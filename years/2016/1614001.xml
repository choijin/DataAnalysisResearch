<AbstractNarration>As climate change continues to add heat energy to the oceans and the atmosphere, the water cycle may undergo significant changes in the amount and timing of precipitation. For regions that depend on seasonal rainfall for water resources such as California and the Caribbean, such changes may drastically alter the freshwater resources available, impacting a wide array of agricultural and municipal activities. In order to predict and plan for these changes, it is necessary to understand the variability of rainfall and groundwater resources in the past to accurately replicate the hydrologic cycle in climate models. This study will use fossil shells from a coastal lagoon in the Yucatan Peninsula as archives of past water chemistry, including the element boron. These fossils record groundwater discharge which is directly related to the amount of precipitation falling over the Yucatan. The researcher will collaborate with Dr. Chen-Feng You, a world expert on boron, at the National Cheng Kung University in Tainan, Taiwan, which has the clean lab facilities necessary to measure boron in fossil shells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two sets of samples will analyzed: one from the Yucatan and one from Taiwan. The Yucatan field site is a brackish lagoon influenced by groundwater springs and ocean water that result in seasonally persistent salinity and pH gradients. Samples consist of several 3 meter long sediment cores covering the past 5,000 years. Foraminifera picked from the core tops and downcore centimeter intervals will be analyzed for the boron isotope 11B, a proxy for pH. Microfossil and water samples will be analyzed on a multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer at Dr. You's lab. Variations in 11B suggest changes in water pH and thus changes in the amount of rain-recharged groundwater entering the lagoon. The Taiwan field site is a similar estuary where modern samples will be collected to establish baseline 11B and compared to the Yucatan as a proof of concept for the 11B groundwater discharge proxy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Climate change is predicted to bring increasingly severe weather, including floods and droughts most recently witnessed by Texas and California. Changing climate impacts when and how much rainfall occurs which directly impacts water resources, including surface resources like reservoirs and groundwater resources replenished by rain. Understanding how rainfall will change is useful to predicting future resource availability, but this also requires understanding natural trends in droughts and floods over thousands of years that occur in tandem with climate change. Previous work has focused on precipitation, but less is known about the immediate response of groundwater to perturbations in the water cycle in the past where it is not directly observable. This project makes novel use of the properties of boron, a naturally occurring element in groundwater. The amount of boron incorporated into shelled marine organisms is determined by the water pH, and coastal groundwater springs with naturally low pH may provide a signal to interpret past amounts of springwater discharge and thus serve as a proxy for groundwater volume. This work advances knowledge of boron isotope behavior in coastal marine shelled organisms as well as provides a new tool useful to modelers of groundwater and past climate. This may help increase the accuracy of water resource forecasts as well as assist in risk management and mitigation to future climate-induced stress on groundwater supplies.</p> <p>&nbsp;This project leveraged a naturally favorable field site to test the hypothesis that biogenic carbonate boron isotopes reflect discharge from low-pH groundwater springs. Celestun Lagoon in the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico, is a narrow lagoon with abundant springs discharging from the carbonate platform of the peninsula and is analogous to the coastal aquifer systems of Florida. The shelled foraminifera Ammonia parkinsoniana lives on the lagoon floor and builds a carbonate shell that incorporates water chemistry, including the isotopes of boron (boron-10 and boron-11). Results from this project demonstrate that Ammonia parkinsoniana exhibit the greatest variability in boron isotope values where near springs (range 8.06 to 18.53 &permil;) with values more stable closer to the ocean with less variable pH. This suggests that in the modern system, foraminifera boron reflects variable spring discharge over seasons or decadal variation. The trend is true going back at least 3,000 years showing sensitivity to proximity near a springs where other traditional measurements show no difference (strontium salinity tracers in carbonate). In coastal systems, boron isotopes appear to show paleodischarge and paleoproximity to springs. Coupled with other trace metal measurements, this proxy may be useful to determining long-term trends in Florida&rsquo;s groundwater resources, as well. Work on this project fostered new collaboration with National Cheng Kung University in Taiwan and trained United States undergraduate researchers in geochemical techniques.&nbsp; This work was presented at the 2017 Goldschmidt Geochemical Conference in Paris, France, and will be presented in Austria in October 2017. Results are in preparation for publication and are expected to be beneficial to both the geochemical and hydrological research communities.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/05/2017<br>      Modified by: Kyle&nbsp;H&nbsp;Broach</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1614001/1614001_10444305_1504648920662_P1010461--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1614001/1614001_10444305_1504648920662_P1010461--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Large coastal spring"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1614001/1614001_10444305_1504648920662_P1010461--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Large coastal spring"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Largest coastal spring in Celestun Lagoon showing large groundwater flow.
