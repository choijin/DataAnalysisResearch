<AbstractNarration>DMREF: Collaborative Research: Design and Testing of Nanoalloy Catalysts in 3D Atomic Resolution&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-Technical Description: The project aims at the discovery of ultra-small, nanometer-sized alloy catalysts to improve the efficiency of fuel cells, mobile power generation, and automotive catalytic converters. State-of-the-art laboratory and computer simulation techniques will be engaged to explore the uncharted design space of bimetallic nanostructures for such applications and implement reductions in cost through partial replacement of precious metals such as platinum by cheaper alternatives. The team of three PIs will synthesize new nanocatalysts using biomimetic approaches, image the positions of all atoms in 3D resolution using the world's most powerful electron microscope, and carry out performance tests in fuel cells in a close feedback loop with predictions by multi-scale modeling and simulation. Fundamental understanding of synthesis controls, atomic-scale order, and associated reactivity of the nanoalloys will lead to rational design rules to optimize catalyst performance and enable targeted improvements of promising materials. The development and validation of predictive multi-scale simulation tools will also benefit the broader computational user community. New fundamental insight into alloy synthesis and reactivity controls has further potential benefits to improve catalysts for commodity chemicals, magnetic information storage, batteries, sensors, and nanoelectronic devices. Undergraduate students, high school students, and teachers will be engaged in summer research activities at UCLA and in annual Engineering Career Days at the University of Akron to encourage careers in science and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description: The project focuses on the computationally driven, rational optimization of nanoalloy atomic composition and shape for catalytic performance in the Oxygen Reduction Reaction (ORR) in fuel cells. Specific aims include the deterministic synthesis of Pt-M Nanocrystals (M = Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Cr, Mn), the three-dimensional characterization of nanoalloy catalysts in atomic resolution and model refinements, as well as the prediction, tests, and optimization of the reactivity in the ORR. Methods comprise biomimetic synthesis protocols coupled with molecular dynamics and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, ORR performance testing by voltammetry and density functional theory calculations, and in-situ monitoring of all reactions. The coordinates of the atoms in the synthesized nanostructures will be monitored by electron tomography to identify atomic ordering, to validate and improve interatomic potentials, and to predict reaction rates in ORR. Detailed understanding of alloy growth mechanism, shape control, and catalytic performance through new polarizable and reactive force fields for alloys and their aqueous interfaces from first principles will close a wide gap between experimental capabilities and missing theoretical understanding. Aided by thorough experimental characterization, predictions with unprecedented accuracy at length scales of 1 to 100 nm appear feasible, far beyond the limits of quantum-mechanical methods and building on previous successful models for interfaces of pure metals (CHARMM-METAL).</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The project has advanced the understanding of catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), a key reaction that influences the performance of fuel cells for automotive and aerospace use. Synthesis, characterization, and simulation methods for Pt-based catalyst interfaces and other nanomaterials have significantly moved beyond prior state of the art. Several breakthroughs in synthesis and catalyst characterization were made, for example, exceeding the targets for specific ORR activity set by the Department of Energy by more than 30 times. Simulations of Pt and alloy nanostructures advanced from being unable to predict relative ORR activity to quantitative guidance and nanostructured catalyst design. Imaging in 3D atomic resolution and temporal resolution at the atomic level has reached unprecedented precision and the Materials Databank was created as a repository for disordered materials structures in atomic resolution. The integration of synthesis, characterization, and modeling at ab-initio and full electrolyte MD scales shifted the paradigm for catalyst design from coarse qualitative predictions to quantitative understanding and informed structural suggestions. The outcomes enable full simulations of nanocatalysts from the atomic-level to the large nanoscale including many times more accurate MD simulations of entire nanostructured particles with full-electrolyte and gas molecules than feasible before and combinations with local quantum mechanical calculations. The relative ORR activity of irregular Pt nanostructures with grain boundaries and other defects can be predicted. The results of this project are documented in 56 peer-reviewed journal articles in interdisciplinary areas, of which 11 have appeared in Nature, Science, and Nature Materials. Broader impacts include new catalyst designs for use in more efficient fuel cell technology, as well as new computational models for a variety of metals, oxides, and alloy nanostructures summarized in the Interface Force Field and other open access cyberinfrastructure. More than 10 symposia at national meetings as well as international workshops were organized and completed in project-relevant research areas. The investigators have been elected as fellows of professional societies during the project and delivered over 150 invited presentations. The project supported the training of more than 5 PhD students, including a minority PhD student, and 3 postdocs, who obtained positions in industry, government laboratories, and academia. In addition, more than 15 undergraduate students and several high school students were engaged in summer research programs. The investigators and graduate students held regular outreach events at local K-12 schools.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 02/07/2021<br>      Modified by: Hendrik&nbsp;Heinz</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1623947/1623947_10338245_1612690674815_f6--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1623947/1623947_10338245_1612690674815_f6--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Pt (111) electrolyte interface during ORR"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1623947/1623947_10338245_1612690674815_f6--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Pt (111) electrolyte interface during ORR"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Perspective view of the adsorption of oxygen (red spheres), water (red/white), hydronium ions (yellow), perchlorate ions (green), and DMF (dark blue/light blue/red/white) on a Pt substrate (gray spheres) preceding ORR catalysis.
