<AbstractNarration>This award will partially support the 2016 IEEE International Workshop on Complex Systems and Networks (IWCSN-2016) in Atlanta, Georgia, October 13-14, 2016. This is an annual workshop for researchers in the emerging area of complex systems and networks, including biomedical and mechanical systems, robotics and control along with other applications in biological and engineering systems. The requested funds will support the participation of invited speakers that are selected from a broad community of researchers, as well as students/postdocs. The workshop covers a broad set of topics with underlying commonalities in terms of analysis techniques and mathematical tools, which are of interest to the engineering and applied mathematics communities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of the workshop are to provide opportunities for participants to learn about state-of-the-art research on various related yet disparate fields. The PIs and workshop organizers are planning tutorial talks and in-depth technical talks describing the latest research results and ongoing projects in related areas. Topics of interest of the workshop include, but are not limited to, complex networks, networked control systems, multi-agent systems, and synchronization phenomena in networks. These topics find applications in communication networks, power grids, electronic circuits, nano-material, biomedical systems, biological networks, neural networks, and disease transmission. The workshop provides a proper framework for interaction and interdisciplinary collaboration, which is key to scientific advancement in the diverse field of complex systems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The IEEE International Workshop on Complex Systems and Networks was held at Georgia State University in Atlanta on November 14-15, 2016. It gathered 89 participants, including  20 invited speakers and 43 undergraduate, graduate students and postdocs from the U.S., Canada, China, Germany, Ireland, Italy, and Japan.  The national and international invited speakers represented various areas of complex systems and networks, ranging from mechanical engineering and biology to epidemiological and social networks.  Intellectual merits:  This workshop provided opportunities for participants to learn about state&ndash;of-the-art research on various related yet disparate fields. It contained both tutorial talks and in-depth technical talks describing the latest research results and ongoing projects. This workshop allowed researchers and students from diverse disciplines to interact, find common ground, share results and insights, and foster collaboration. Some of the scientific questions addressed during this workshop were: What are the universality properties of complex networks? For a particular application, what is the best complex network to deploy? How does the topology of the networks influence various aspects of the underlying system? What can we learn from biological and social networks that may be useful in engineering networked systems and vice versa? What network models can be analyzed mathematically yet capture the salient features of the underlying ensemble systems? Can we build taxonomy of complex network models and what facilitates the identification of phenomena in ensemble systems?  This  workshop contributed to nurturing high quality scientific activity; developing  and strengthening collaboration between mathematics and engineering. It also stimulated the interest of and educated graduate students, postdocs, and junior engineers and mathematicians in dynamical systems and complex networks, with an eye towards network design and control.  Broader Impacts:   This workshop advanced the development and applications of the dynamical system and network theory in engineering, throughout  training  junior mathematicians, graduate students, and those from underrepresented groups for collaborative research with senior researchers.   The solutions to the important engineering and applied mathematics problems require input from a diverse group of researchers, usually from different countries, and rapid progress requires an organized collaborative effort such as this workshop. This workshop served as a venue for developing communication and establishing collaborative research among research groups from the US,  Canada, China, Germany, Ireland, Italy, and Japan.
