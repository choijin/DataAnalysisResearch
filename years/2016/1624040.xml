<AbstractNarration>The PI and organizing team from the University of Colorado, Central Michigan University, Moravian College, and the University of Arizona have received an award through the Research Coordination Network - Undergraduate Biology Education (RCN-UBE) program to hold a workshop entitled Workshop: 3dNaturalists: Using citizen science, bioblitzes and the National Park Service Centennial to promote undergraduate learning in biology. The workshop assembles some of the key personnel from three RCN-UBEs as well as partners from iPlant (CyVerse)and the National Park Service, educators, and student leaders from science clubs in Estes Park, Colorado. BioBlitz events are 24-hour biodiversity surveys involving scientists and the general public collecting species information in an area; perhaps the largest ever BioBlitz event will take place on May 20th as part of the large National Park Service Centennial event. The purpose of this workshop is to prepare students for their roles as experts and field technicians in the 2016 Centennial BioBlitzes and address important topics including data quality, and science associated with crowd-sourced data, broadening participation in citizen science, and incorporation of BioBlitz data into biology education. Key themes of the workshop include data collection tools and devices, data accuracy and application to key science questions, and the challenge of engaging more underrepresented students and undergraduates in general in BioBlitz events. The timing of the workshop is ideal to train students for the opportunity to engage in the large-scale research learning experience about biodiversity in which data collection (via apps on smartphones and tablets) and crowdsourcing datasets are used toward the goal of producing a list of all species observed in the various parks, including those new to the park or new to science.  &lt;br/&gt;The workshop will start with a field session where students and professionals will use various citizen science apps on smartphones followed by two days of facilitated round table discussions, presentations, and activities to exchange information about citizen science data, data accuracy issues and student engagement approaches. On the last day, participants will return to the field to use the various tools discussed and build student confidence in leading the general public through the BioBlitz events. The workshop will include participants from a diverse array of institutions and backgrounds in order to provide the broadest perspective on how to grow and improve the BioBlitz experience as well as research and educational outcomes. The inclusion of student leaders from science clubs such as Minorities in Agriculture, Natural Resources, and Related Sciences (MANRRS) and different chapters of the Ecological Society of America's SEEDS and SACNAS (Society for the Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science) will enhance student engagement, recruitment, and networking.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    The 3dNaturalist workshop integrates across three dimensions in science each of which are changing how scientist-naturalists acquire and apply ecological information: Digital data generated by major infrastructure programs and collections; Discovery where citizens provide data useful for science and management questions; and Diversity where youth traditionally under-represented in science can become engaged in ecology and related sciences through experiential learning. The 3dNaturalist workshop will have two sets of objectives: the first associated with the BioBlitz activity and the second set associated with the BioBlitz data: (1) BioBlitz activity: engaging underrepresented minorities and students from culturally diverse backgrounds in citizen science activities such as BioBlitzes and how BioBlitz data collection can be refined/improved to address specific biodiversity questions to address relevant federal agency needs? (2) Participants: Can information on public participation and motivation inform knowledge of citizen science datasets, how such data could be enlarged as part of the larger park experience i.e. what social media platforms are currently used can become part of the citizen science data platform for the parks.   In 2016, the National Park Service celebrated its centennial with a series of bioblitzes across the country.  Seven major bioblitzes were held at different national parks across the country representing each of the seven regions within the National Park Service.  Bandelier National Park represented the Rocky Mountain Region of the National Park Service and this park hosted a cultural event along with the taxonomic surveys.  Forty students (over 70% from minority and underrepresented groups in the sciences) from over 30 universties across the country participated in the 3dNaturalist workshop held at Bandelier.  Institutions represented included HBCUs (Howard University, Prairie View University), Tribal Colleges (Haskell), Hispanic Serving institutions (Texas A&amp;M Kingsville) and community colleges.   The students were divided into two teams--a cultural team and a taxonomic team.  Each team designed an inventory or survey for the bioblitx activities and conducted the data collection (or interviews) and uploaded data into citizen science datasets.  The cultural team worked closely with a local community center and the National Parks assisting with the cultural fair and educational tours on different taxa while the taxonomic team accompanied researchers and scientists in the field collecting specific taxonomic data and uploaded that data into the iNaturalist Database--a citizen science database used by national Geographic and the National Park Service for the bioblitzes.  3dNaturalist worklshop participants contributed significantly to the taxonomic datasets generated by the bioblitz and were the largest contributing group for the bioblitz.  Students participated in bumble bee surveys, bird banding, bat banding and other inventories working with scientists and the public.  In addition, students conducted their own surveys on pollinators and flower visitors and generated observations that were included in the park datasets.  Lastly students piloted a new idea of "hotshot" teams that searched for Pollinator Hotshot crew as a research experience for undergraduates.  The 3dNaturalist Workshop led to the submission of two research proposals, three conference papers and presentations and one international partnership with the University of Derby, UK.  While the workshop itself engaged 40 students, the larger impact includes student presentations, one student honors project, two international student internships and two undergraduate internships.
