<AbstractNarration>Nontechnical: &lt;br/&gt;This award by the Biomaterials program in the Division of Materials Research to Northwestern University is in support of the participants' travel and/or registration to attend and present recent scientific development by US-based researchers for the 2016 GRS/GRC on "Biomineralization" to be held at PGA Catalunya Business and Convention Centre, Girona, Spain from August 14 to 19, 2016. This award is cofounded by the Global Venture Funds in the Office of International Science and Engineering. This conference is committed in bringing young and senior scientists together, and to discuss their current research and builds informal networks with their peers fostering collaborations and interactions between scientists from different countries and fields that may lead to a lifetime of collaboration and scientific achievement. To fulfill these scientific goals and broader impacts, the organizers have invited a significant number of early career faculty and postdoctoral scientists as well as senior scientists to speak at the meeting. The proposed travel and registration stipends will be used to bring early career scientists from the US, and to encourage the participation of young faculty members at the meeting. Exposing a diverse mix of scientists to this kind of intensive interactive meeting will be an excellent way to stimulate broader participation in cutting edge international projects. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical: &lt;br/&gt;This Gordon Research Conference will bring together a multidisciplinary group of scientists, and would provide a stimulating platform to discuss the latest ideas and recent advances on how (and why) organisms synthesize biomineralized tissues, and on how one may apply these insights in areas as diverse as materials research, biotechnology, regenerative medicine, and address environmental issues. The meeting is expected to assemble a group of best and brightest scientists investigating biomineralization across all domains of life, from nanoparticles made by bacteria to meso-structured assemblies and live tissues in plants and vertebrates. The conference will particularly highlight the use of novel high-resolution techniques and the synergetic use of modeling and experiments. The goal of this workshop is to bring together top class pure and applied scientists with the aim of interfacing multiple disciplines (physics, chemistry, biology, engineering, etc.) to understand the fundamentals of biomineralization, and develop applications based on these novel concepts. These interactions at this conference will be critical in generatng an understanding of how particular materials should be designed to be "symbiotic" with biological entities and how to get similarity in functioning of biomaterials with their living counterparts.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Gordon Research Conference on Biomineralization explored the fundamental processes by which organisms produce minerals, as well as the possibility to exploit these principles in technological applications.  Biomineralization processes play important roles in biology, geology, biotechnology and medicine, and provide inspiration for chemistry, materials science and nanotechnology.  This highly successful conference brought together researchers from many disciplines to address the mineralization by vertebrates, invertebrates, plants, bacteria as well as in biomimetic systems, and covered most biomineral systems, including calcium carbonates, phosphates, oxalates, iron oxides and silica.  The high level of control over the composition, structure, size and morphology of biominerals results in materials of amazing complexity and with fascinating properties that strongly contrast with those of geological minerals and often surpass those of synthetic analogues.  This GRC on Biomineralization discussed the basic principles by which organisms synthesize, control and make use of minerals, and also explored the potential to apply these principles e.g. in regenerative medicine and nanotechnology.  The conference covered all stages from the nucleation of mineral, the molecular biology of matrix production and the molecular details of matrix-mineral interactions to the effects of pathogenic mineralization and the macroscopic properties of biological and bio-inspired materials.  Particular attention was paid to the exciting recent new insights that were gained by the (combined) use of experimental and modeling techniques with high spatial and/or temporal resolution          Last Modified: 09/29/2017       Submitted by: Derk Joester]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
