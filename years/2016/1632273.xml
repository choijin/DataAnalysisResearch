<AbstractNarration>This research project addresses the question of how communities adapt to accommodate new migrants. Migration happens at a range of spatial scales, may involve temporary or permanent relocation, occurs in multiple directions, and is undertaken for a variety of reasons that involve pull factors, such as the promise of abundant resources or religious freedom, and push factors, like escaping an oppressive regime or culture of violence. In such contexts, people may choose to flaunt the distinctive and highly visible markers of their identity or opt to mask their identity by emulating or mimicking the material culture of their neighbors, and each strategy has different implications for the successful integration of community members. Many of the less visible attributes of material culture, especially those that are the product of motor skills learned early in life are not easily changed and therefore are strong indicators of cultural origin. Sissel Schroeder will investigate both the high visibility and low visibility attributes of material culture and their spatial distribution at a Mississippian town that formed through population coalescence and rose to prominence in the midcontinent of North America in the 13th century AD, a time of considerable population movement across North America. Gaining insights into how a multi-cultural community forms, is successful for multiple generations, and dissolves has implications for global issues of ethnic unrest in the world today. Undergraduate and graduate students who participate in the project will gain practical hands-on training in archaeological laboratory methods, material culture identification, and curatorial best practices, as well as organizational and analytical skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through the investigation of low visibility attributes, like the directional twist of the fibers used to make cordage and the kinds of clay and temper materials mixed with the clay to make pottery, it will be possible to identify learning communities of people from diverse backgrounds; by also incorporating some high visibility attributes, it will be possible to more fully explore the role of material culture in the constitution and transformation of cultural identity. The research will be conducted on existing archaeological collections that have been curated since the 1940s, thereby enhancing the value of these irreplaceable materials, promoting the importance of archaeological curation, and significantly augmenting basic understanding of the social complexity of an individual community. Dr. Schroeder will apply a novel investigative approach to the study of fabric. Since fabric rarely preserves in the humid Eastern Woodlands, archaeologists are restricted to studying it through impressions left on the exterior of ceramic vessels. Reverse-engineered 3D models developed from high resolution digital photographs of fabric impressions will reveal details of textile production without having to take impressions of the fabric using modern media that contaminate and damage the ancient materials.</AbstractNarration>

Finally, this project demonstrates the importance of curated collections, the wealth of untapped data that lurk within them, and shows that new analyses of old collections can significantly modify our understanding of the ancient occupation and dynamic sociopolitical landscape of a given site.
