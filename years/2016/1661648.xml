<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is driven by the development of a new plant-based surfactant technology, which has the potential to transform the agrochemicals, oil recovery, and detergents/personal care market toward health friendly and environmentally safe chemicals. A major limitation of existing plant-based surfactant technologies is that they have limited performance compared petrochemical-based surfactants. This entirely bio-renewable surfactant technology provides a competitive advantage in that can be customized toward a specific market, potentially outperform all existing surfactants, and that it can potentially replace the function of numerous existing chemicals in a particular formulation, providing substantially more value and simplifying complex products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project aims to engage in targeted customer discovery research to evaluate the commercial impact of the proposed surfactant technology and to align the technical performance of the tunable technology with a distinct competitive advantage in the target market. This I-Corps project is based on the development of a patented process technology for combining plant-based natural oils and sugars into highly functional surfactants that outperform all other surfactants. Technical results from preliminary research have demonstrated the customizable nature of the technology toward specific markets, providing strong multi-functional performance to replace the need for complex blends of chemicals.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The I-Corps surfactants platform project aimed to understand the applications, customers and market for the use of biorenewable surfactants in the agricultural  market.  These complex molecules exhibit a range of characteristics, for which their application can include the dispersal of herbicides and pesticides.    A key outcome of the I-Corps project was an understanding of the customer relationship with the manufacturer for surfactant chemicals.  The customers that select surfactant types, compositions and concentrations that reflect on the business are the local and regional organizations that select for the extent, location and timing of pesticide and herbicide application.  The farmers are limited in application of chemicals by these organizations, and decisions regarding the consumption of pesticides/herbicides and therefore surfactants are out of the control of the farmers who benefit from the use of the chemicals.  A producer/customer relationship must be made with the local herbicide/pesticide application organizations to introduce new surfactants into the market.  Another major outcome of the project was an understanding of the concerns that customers have in the application of pesticides/herbicides with surfactants.  While the active chemicals are required to change to retain efficacy about every seven years, the surfactants can remain the same provided they meet specific criteria related to toxicity, biodegradability, and stable interaction with the active ingredients.  Another outcome of the project was a realization of the depth of knowledge of the customers of surfactants.  While they seem to constantly be learning and stay up to date on the latest active ingredients in the agricultural applications, their knowledge of different surfactants was limited.  Introduction of new surfactants would require an additional educational component on the benefit of increased biodegradability and reduced usage for agricultural  applications.
