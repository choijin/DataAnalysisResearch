<AbstractNarration>The Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) Program assists universities and colleges in diversifying the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) workforce through the development of highly competitive students from groups historically underrepresented in STEM disciplines: African-Americans, Alaska Natives, American Indians, Hispanic Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Native Pacific Islanders. The goal of the LSAMP Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) Activity is to increase the quantity and quality of STEM graduate students from underrepresented populations, with emphasis on Ph.D. matriculation and completion.  BD programs implemented in the nation's institutions of higher education contribute to addressing one of the objectives in NSF's 2014-2018 Strategic Plan, namely to "integrate education and research to support development of a diverse STEM workforce with cutting-edge capabilities."  For the U.S. to remain globally competitive, it is vital that it taps into the talent of all its citizens and provides exceptional educational preparedness in STEM areas that underpin the knowledge-based economy. With a longstanding commitment to enhancing diversity through inclusion of all individuals, Colorado State University (CSU), lead institution of the Colorado LSAMP (CO-AMP), proposes to extend educational opportunities for 12 underrepresented graduate students as Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) Fellows for two years.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CO-AMP BD at Colorado State will focus on 1) increasing the number of underrepresented students who successfully complete STEM doctoral programs and 2) continuing to implement institutional change for all underrepresented graduate students at CSU. Through a well-developed series of professional development opportunities, coupled with ongoing individual mentoring and networking, BD Fellows will be well prepared to compete as cutting-edge scientists, contributing to social, economic, and academic change and outcomes, where they will serve as role models for the matriculated students underrepresented in STEM areas. In addition, the developmental components of CSU's BD will be extended to all graduate programs within the university, positively impacting the culture at CSU. Ultimately, it will result in not only an increase in STEM doctoral recipients from underrepresented racial/ethnic groups, but also the honing of evidence-based practices for the recruitment, selection, and mentoring of underrepresented graduate students in STEM disciplines.</AbstractNarration>

Our program had a 93% success rate in graduating underrepresented minority students with a MS degree. In addition, of the 13 students enrolled in the program, 8 are continuing on for a PhD. As part of the BD fellows&rsquo; intellectual development, the Graduate School provided 12 formal and informal activities specifically targeted to BD students. These activities were designed to provide them with professional development, advising/mentoring support, and community-building opportunities to successfully move them forward in their degree programs and their membership in the CSU community. All of the students participated in the workshops and training programs provided and the students&rsquo; response to our activities was uniformly excellent; they said that the activities greatly enhanced their graduate school experience thus far. In addition, BD fellows met with the BD Director on a 1:1 basis at least once per semester to discuss progress and the students&rsquo; experiences within their programs and CSU. Based on need, students met multiple times with the Director. The BD fellows also met with their advisors on a weekly basis and met with their faculty mentors at least twice per semester. BD advisors submitted progress reports on the progress of BD fellows each semester to the BD Director.

In all, BD fellows contributed 22 conference presentations and 6 peer-reviewed publications so far. One student received a very prestigious National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship to support her research for the next 3 years. The mentors for the BP program were equally excited about how their students were performing in graduate school. Although, some students may not continue on for a PhD, the mentors felt that the overall quality of the BD graduate student that they had in their lab was good. Three of our BD fellows are moving with their advisors to new institutions as PhD students. This clearly suggests that the BD students are performing at the level that their advisors require for a PhD, and the advisors are committed to advising and mentoring their students to degree completion. The BD students were all very committed to performing public outreach as a part of their broadening URM participation in the STEM fields.
