<AbstractNarration>Everyday activities are increasingly enabled by embedded systems. In such systems, a deadline violation can lead to dangerous and/or disastrous consequences.  The timing parameters of such systems are driven by the physical state of these systems (e.g., ignition timing in automotive systems is determined by engine speed).  Current approaches to deal with the dependencies between the physical environment state and timing parameters make very simplistic assumptions, resulting in wasted hardware and energy resources. This research facilitates more effective integration of embedded systems --thus enabling smaller technology via incorporation of techniques from mechanical engineering, control systems, and real-time scheduling. The resultant techniques will minimize the carbon footprint of systems that are ubiquitous and run our everyday lives. The educational objective of this project incorporates resulting artifacts into undergraduate- and graduate-level courses, as well as in K-12 outreach at local schools via summer camps and challenge sessions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research aims to minimize the computational utilization of real-time embedded systems by analyzing, modeling, and predicting dependencies between the physical state and timing parameters to reduce the size, weight, and power requirements of next-generation embedded systems.  A central objective is development of run-time scheduling algorithms and associated schedulability analysis for new real-time task models that characterize multiple physical dimensions of the system and their interdependencies. Run-time adaptation protocols effectively allocate resources when the estimates of the physical parameters are inaccurate.  Implementations of the scheduling and allocation algorithms upon embedded platforms provide evaluation of performance of multi-dimensional techniques compared to the traditional single-dimensional models.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Everyday activities are increasingly enabled by an often hidden array of embedded systems.  These embedded systems facilitate transportation, environmental control, power grid management, and countless other aspects of everyday life.  An important and safety-critical subset of these systems have real-time requirements.  Often in such systems, a violation of temporal constraints can lead to dangerous and/or disastrous consequences.  Furthermore, the timing parameters of real-time embedded systems are often driven by the physical state of the system (e.g., ignition timing in automotive systems is determined by engine speed).  Unfortunately, previous approaches to deal with the dependencies between the physical environment state and timing parameters make very simplistic assumptions, resulting in over-provisioning and potentially wasting hardware resources.   This project reduced the computational utilization of these systems by explicitly analyzing, modeling, and predicting such dependencies and system complexities/constraints.  Our project's resulting techniques enable decreases in the size, weight, and power requirements of next-generation embedded systems.  Intellectual Merit:  This project developed new approaches for analyzing and designing real-time embedded systems whose timing characteristics are driven by physical systems.  A primary case study in this project was understanding the computational timing problems resulting from engine-control tasks where the frequency and execution time are driven by the rotational speed of a vehicle's crankshaft.  A fundamental question/challenge not addressed prior to this project was: how can a computer-controlled system whose timing parameters are dictated by multiple physical dimensions and system constraints be effectively and safely scheduled in a real-time processing platform.  In the engine-control example, the control task's computational demands may be simultaneously driven by both the rotational-speed and engine temperature; furthermore, the engine-control task is being executed upon an embedded platform (e.g., an electronic control unit - ECU) that is severely-constrained in terms of memory, power, and processing speed.  Our project aimed to effectively ensure such physically-derived tasks can always meet all timing constraints via following major innovations:  1) A novel analysis approach that can dramatically reduce the cost (in terms of design time) of analyzing an engine-control task.  This reduction in cost allows other system and environmental constraints to be more efficiently analyzed by the system designer.  2)  A set of new scheduling algorithms for multicore embedded systems that increase both the security and efficiency of the real-time embedded system.  In particular, we develop scheduling approaches for systems with multiple dependencies that must execute inside a "trusted execution environment".  Furthermore, our approaches are able to reduce the power cost and cache contention of these multiprocessor, parallel systems.  3) A new monitoring and predictive approach for determining whether the external environment conditions necessitate changing the operating mode of the system to protect the timing requirements of the most critical tasks in the system.  Our approach can detect whether a system is likely to go into an "overload" state and then proactively schedule to ensure that every high-criticality task continues to meet all timing constraints.  Broader Impacts:  The principal investigator and his students for this project have presented their research at numerous universities and research institutions, conferences, workshops, and provided demonstrations to visitors of the principal investigators laboratory.  Four Ph.D. students have participated in this project over four years of the project. Three completed Ph.D. dissertations and one ongoing Ph.D. dissertation have resulted from this project.  The former Ph.D. students in this project have gone on to obtain positions at academic institutions (Towson University) and industry (e.g., GM and DCS Corp).  Furthermore, the resulting software artifacts, analysis, and results obtained this project have been made publicly-available for other researchers to use.   The project has contributed to educational curriculum development at Wayne State University.  Concepts from this project have been integrated into the principal investigators undergraduate/graduate-level course on Cyber-Physical Systems and his graduate-level courses on Real-Time and Embedded Systems.  Furthermore, the project has been used as an example in the recruiting presentations and mentoring for economically-disadvantaged students in the Detroit-area into computer science; the principal investigator participates as a mentor.
