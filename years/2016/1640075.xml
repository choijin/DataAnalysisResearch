<AbstractNarration>Amidst today's data explosion, demand for computing power is accelerating, and the energy requirements for solving critical problems in science, engineering, business, and intelligent processing are increasing dramatically.  In order to address this critical issue, the scientific and engineering community is beginning to explore new approaches to computing, such as mimicking the brain's structure or the dynamical behavior of coupled particles.  However, implementing these approaches with conventional computer architectures is highly inefficient from both energy and computing standpoints. As a result, there is a pressing need to develop revolutionary computer architectures that overcome these severe roadblocks. An ambitious program is to be pursued within the framework of this project in which light, rather than electrons, is used to realize new computing paradigms with superior energy scalability. Specifically, computing architectures will be explored that exploit the wave nature of light (i.e., its amplitude and phase) harnessing the remarkable advancements over the past decade in nanofabrication of complex photonic chips with thousands of high-performance devices. These photonic platforms would have the potential to be computationally powerful, operate with unparalleled energy efficiency, and are scalable and highly reconfigurable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To fulfill this vision of energy efficient photonic computing, the proposed research efforts will focus on the following two types of photonic processors: (1) Ising Machine and (2) Neuromorphic Computing Machine.  The unifying aspect of these photonic processors is that they consist of dynamic networks of coupled photonic units and rely on the wave nature of light to solve problems which has no analogy in electron-based computing systems. Beyond developing new types of optical processors, photonics technology will be developed as the cornerstone of future computer systems.  A novel architecture will be explored that integrates photonic processors and interconnects with electronic memory and processors to maximize the benefits of each technology. Research will also be undertaken to map complete, challenging problems to combinations of photonic accelerators and electronic processors, and to determine how to best scale them to maximize full-system performance.  By innovating at all levels of the system - from devices to architectures including systems, compilers, and algorithms -  the project would aim to achieve advances that cannot be realized within any single field.</AbstractNarration>

However, the process of training neural networks underlying AI systems corresponds to a fundamentally difficult optimization problem, and such processing units are a suboptimal computing architecture for solving this problem. In essence, this hardware cannot easily be matched to algorithms underlying neural optimization. Therefore, an impediment to expanding the AI revolution to even more pressing technological and scientific needs lies in the creation of novel neuromorphic computing hardware whose intrinsic dynamics is natively matched to AI algorithms.  We will take a radically new approach to removing the gap between hardware and software in AI by marrying the principles of neural computing with the remarkable properties of quantum mechanics to create quantum-advantaged natively neuromorphic devices. Such quantum neuromorphic computers may enable efficient heuristic computation of difficult optimization problems using natively matched intrinsic quantum dynamics.   To accomplish this goal, we have completed all the experimental steps needed to create quantum neural networks using atoms in a multimode cavity.  We experimentally demonstrated that local couplings among atoms can be created using multimode cavity QED. Photon-mediated interaction ranges were established through measurements of the threshold of a superradiant, self-organization phase transition versus atomic position. Specifically, we experimentally showed that the interference of near-degenerate cavity modes leads to both a strong and tunable-range interaction between BECs trapped within the cavity. We show that atom-atom coupling may be tuned from short range to long range.  In other work, we established the existence of a nonlocal, sign-changing interaction, and used it to create ferro- and anti-ferromagnetic interactions between spins.  Also demonstrated was a spinor-polariton condensate and dynamic spin-orbit coupling of a BEC.          Last Modified: 09/03/2019       Submitted by: Benjamin Lev]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
