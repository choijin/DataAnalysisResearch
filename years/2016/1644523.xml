<AbstractNarration>A growing fraction of textile products, particularly clothing, are made on sophisticated automated knitting machines that can produce complete products in a single step, with full control over variation in shape, appearance, and mechanical properties across the surface of the fabric. These machines promise to democratize the design of garments and other knitted products: any design that can be written down as a knitting machine program can be made in any quantity as easily as a mass-produced product, and every instance can be different, with variations in size, fit, and function. Ironically, very few people can actually design custom knitted garments for automated manufacture on these machines, because developing new patterns is a trial-and-error process requiring esoteric knowledge and access to the production equipment.  This project aims to change this situation by developing simulation technology that enables web-based interactive design tools that accurately predict the end result, eliminating trial-and-error and letting users directly manufacture their designs with confidence of good results the first time. An emphasis on interactive web-based design tools will enable a practical pathway for expanding access and real-world usage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project's technical aims include: (1) Achieve predictive simulation of yarn mechanics by extending prior work on yarn-level cloth modeling to provide a calibrated match to experimental data. (2) Develop multi-scale simulation models that provide real-time feedback for interactive design tasks involving design-related edits to knit structures. (3) Build simulation-based design tools that anyone can use to easily design and simulate their own custom knitted products in the same way one can now 3D print mechanical parts. (4) Investigate high-level optimization-based design tools that enable "smart" edits without resorting to low-level stitch specifications. We will evaluate our simulation tools using a sequence of user studies that measure the effectiveness of the tools to improve users' ability to match design targets.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project supported research on rod simulation, CAD tools for textile design, and fully automatic design of 3D woven objects.  Two different rod simulators were built.  One runs on the CPU and was used both to simulate the sounds of vibrating structures like bars and strings, and even the sound of a Slinky walking down stairs, as well as to simulate yarns to predict the internal structure of knit and woven textiles (described in the SIGGRAPH 2017 paper, "Animating elastic rods with sound").  This simulator also served as a reference for implementing a second simulator (work primarily done at Stanford) that runs on the GPU with dramatically higher performance (described in the SIGGRAPH 2019 paper, "Interactive design of periodic yarn-level cloth patterns"), which enabled work in the second part of the project period on interactive tools.  During this project the opportunity arose to work directly with a manufacturer and their 3D weaving facility, so this project pursued its goal of building simulation-based design systems in the context of 3D weaving,  The result was a system known as Weavecraft (demonstrated in the SIGGRAPH 2019 art paper, "Weaving Objects: Spatial Design and Functionality of 3D-Woven Textiles"), which resulted from an extended collaboration with 3D weaving designers.  Weavecraft is built around a new way of representing woven textiles as blocks of interlaced yarns that can be assembled in 3D to create complex objects; the system was even used to design a shoe that was created in a single 3D weaving operation complete with sole, footbed, upper, tongue, and lace guides. Using the aforementioned GPU simulator, Weavecraft also provides an interactive simulation of the relaxed structure of the woven object, allowing the design to be refined considerably before any weaving is done.  At the end of the project period, work began on a system called Weaveprint, which would eventually allow a wide range of shapes to be produced fully automatically through 3D weaving.  Together these developments have significantly advanced the state of the art in simulation and design tools for textile manufacturing.  In particular, the fundamental improvements in scalability of yarn simulation enable a much broader range of textiles and textile objects to be prototyped in simulation.  And the technology pioneered by Weavecraft can enable dramatic improvements in high-strength composite parts with complex shapes, as well as new categories of 3D woven soft goods, while Weaveprint can enable such parts to be designed easily and automatically.
