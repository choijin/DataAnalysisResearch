<AbstractNarration>This award supports an NSF proposal writing workshop aiming to aid future NSF proposal submitters in communicating clear research objectives and improving proposal quality. Participants will learn guidelines for writing a quality NSF proposal with an emphasis on the research objective. Interactions during the workshop will help build meaningful collaborations. This will positively affect the attendees' academic career and, subsequently, will help develop the nation's human resources. Additionally, when proposals are well written, the reviews tend to be more consistent and NSF panel meetings are more efficient.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This NSF proposal writing workshop will be held on June 27, 2016, at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, Virginia. It will be collocated with the 44th SME (Society of Manufacturing Engineers) North American Manufacturing Research Conference (NAMRC) and the ASME (American Society of Mechanical Engineers) Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference (MSEC 2016). Major activities of the workshop include: presentations by NSF program directors, breakout sessions to discuss example research objectives, a group question/answer period, and a conclusions session. Professors and graduate students from across the US will be invited to attend the workshop.</AbstractNarration>
