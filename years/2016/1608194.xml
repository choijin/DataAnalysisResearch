<AbstractNarration>This award supports travel for US-based participants in the conference "Symplectic Geometry and Topology" at the International Center for Mathematical Sciences (ICMS), Edinburgh, Scotland, UK, held July 25-29, 2016. Symplectic topology is a rapidly developing branch of mathematics, which originated as a geometric tool for understanding qualitative problems of classical mechanics and geometric optics. Since its inception in 1980s, it quickly became one of important branches of mathematics interrelated with topology, dynamics, complex analysis, algebraic geometry, algebra, and mathematical physics. This led to fascinating cross-fertilizations, making symplectic topology a centerpiece of many modern mathematical developments. The conference at ICMS will be concentrated on recent developments in the fields of symplectic geometry and topology. The meeting will allow students and young mathematicians to learn about new research and to interact with a senior outstanding mathematicians taking part in the conference. This award supports participation of US students, postdoctoral associates, and young mathematicians. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference focuses on four core topics: &lt;br/&gt;1. Holomorphic curves (algebraic structures and foundational problems); &lt;br/&gt;2. Groups of symplectic diffeomorphisms; &lt;br/&gt;3. Recent advances in symplectic packings; and&lt;br/&gt;4. Symplectic structures (new constructions and spaces of symplectic structures). &lt;br/&gt;The objective is to bring together specialists in symplectic topology and related areas to discuss recent progress in the field and to catalyze efforts for achieving further breakthroughs in these areas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference website is http://www.icms.org.uk/workshops/symplectic</AbstractNarration>

The objective of the workshop was to bring together specialists in symplectic topology to discuss the recent progress  in the field, and in particular in the theory of  holomorphic curves in symplectic manifolds, groups of symplectic diffeomorphisms, and symplectic packings. The conference also celebrated 70th birthday of Professor Dusa McDuff.  There were 60 participants of the workshop,  including 17 from the USA.  Among participants there were 15   women. The meeting consisted of 28 lectures, given mostly by young mathematicians.  At the same time a large number of leading senior mathematicians took  an active part at the conference, thus creating an extremely stimulating atmosphere for the discussion of new developments in the area of symplectic topology, and especially in the topology and geometry of symplectic and Lagrangian embedding problems. The diiscussion continued well after the regular hours of the conference in small groups in  a very  informal atmosphere.  There was in addition an excellent public lecture by  Professor John Milnor which was attended not only by the conference participants, but also a large local community interested in Mathematics.  Many new results were reported at the conference and several new links between different mathematical subjects were understood. For instance, it is now clear that holomorphic curves have much to say about old questions (by Poincar&eacute; and Birkhoff) on the 3-body problem. And symplectic embedding problems give rise to new connections with lattice point counting, Markov numbers, and several other discrete and algebraic problems.
