<AbstractNarration>The American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) Education and Human Resources Programs will conduct and implement a 12-month project with recipients of the Presidential Awards for Excellence in Science, Mathematics and Engineering Mentoring (PAESMEM) and AAAS Mentoring Awards focused on effective mentoring practices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to convene a working group meeting of recipients of both honorary awards. Participants will reflect on what is known about effective science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) educational and career mentoring and to identify&lt;br/&gt;new directions to scale-up effective STEM mentoring.  The objectives for the proposed working group meeting are to:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(a) review the progress of STEM mentoring over the last 20 years, including revisiting the recommendations in the 2006 AAAS report on Report from Study Group Meetings to Develop a Research and Action Agenda on STEM Career and Workforce Mentoring.&lt;br/&gt;(b) identify and summarize what is known about effective STEM Mentoring at all educational and career stages, including reviewing and discussing the recent 2015 publication, "Successful STEM Mentoring Initiatives for Underrepresented Students: A Research-Based Guide for Faculty and Administrators" by Becky Wai-Ling Packard.&lt;br/&gt;(c) identify barriers and challenges to effective STEM mentoring at all educational and career stages.&lt;br/&gt;(d) identify key strategies and tools to scale-up effective STEM mentoring over the next 10 years, at all educational and career stages.&lt;br/&gt;(e) review and identify new directions for the PAESMEM guidelines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An online report highlighting findings from the meeting will be produced, including tools and resources. The project will be guided by a steering committee that will include PAESMEM and AAAS Mentor awardees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The on-line report and recommended tools will promote inclusive mentoring practices in all educational settings and an inclusive workplace. Creating a sense of belonging in STEM significantly increases the representation of underrepresented minorities, women,and persons with disabilities in all STEM fields. 2016 marks the 20th anniversary of the inaugural PAESMEM honorary awards and the 25th anniversary of the AAAS Lifetime Mentor Award.  PAESMEM inaugural awardees will be acknowledged during the meeting.</AbstractNarration>
