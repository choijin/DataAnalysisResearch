<AbstractNarration>This project supports participation in the thirty-sixth annual meeting of the Southeastern Atlantic Regional Conference on Differential Equations (SEARCDE), on November 5-6, 2016, at the Florida Gulf Coast University. The conference began in 1981 and has met annually since then, with the venue rotating among research institutions in the Southeast. The conference will serve as a forum for discussion and exchange of research ideas and recent developments in both theoretical and applied differential equations. In addition to four invited plenary lectures by leading international scholars in differential equations, there are twenty minute contributed talks given in parallel sessions. All participants will have the opportunity to present their work in these contributed talks, which are organized so that talks by established and senior researchers are interspersed with talks by beginning researchers. The conference tradition fosters an atmosphere conducive to networking and the creation of new research collaborations. SEARCDE especially encourages the participation of beginning researchers who get the opportunity to meet and hear renowned plenary speakers and senior researchers from the region. These opportunities are important for junior researchers, especially those from underrepresented groups. NSF funding ensures that many talented young researchers in applied mathematics will have the opportunity to participate in SEARCDE 2016.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal objective of the SEARCDE conference is to promote research and education in the field of differential equations by bringing together established and beginning researchers to exchange ideas and discuss recent developments. Among others the conference topics will include mathematical biology and epidemiology, dynamical systems approaches to partial differential equations, optimization, and optimal control and numerical analysis and simulation of solutions to PDEs. Proceedings of this conference will be published in Communications in Applied Analysis. Information about the conference can be found at the website, http://math.fgcu.edu/SEARCDE2016</AbstractNarration>
