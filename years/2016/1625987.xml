<AbstractNarration>This Major Research Instrumentation Award supports the acquisition of a three dimensional Digital Image Correlation (DIC) system, including a pair of high speed cameras and associated software and hardware. DIC is state-of-the-art optical measurement technology that uses photographs to monitor the dynamic movement of objects. Kettering researchers will use the DIC instrumentation to advance fundamental research in a number of areas leading to more fuel efficient and crash-resistant vehicles, a more effective renewable energy supply, and improved human health. The DIC system will provide data for the study of advanced materials at Kettering University. It will facilitate the development of computational models to predict the behavior of complex structures; in wind energy, automotive and medical applications. It will highlight opportunities for improving the performance of structures used in a broad range of fields. Conventional measurement tools, such as accelerometers, cannot be used for these applications because several sensors are required to adequately instrument a large surface area, and adding so many sensors to a lightweight structure may alter the dynamic response of the structure, obscuring the true problem or opportunity. The non-contact measurement system will allow Kettering researchers to understand these systems in new and deeply important ways. In addition to supporting research and development at Kettering, the DIC system will also be integrated into the curriculum in several courses (e.g. Experimental Mechanics and Automotive NVH). In these courses, the visual representation of the deformation field will enhance the students understanding of the physical behavior of structures. It will also ensure that undergraduate and graduate students are exposed to state-of-the-art experimental techniques, equipping them for the work of creating the next generation of structural designs. The new instrument will also be used for outreach to K12 and pre-college students through existing Kettering outreach programs such as Academically Interested Minds (AIMs) and Lives Improve Through Engineering (LITE) programs. By providing graphically stimulating photos and videos, it will make the science of design analysis approachable to a broader audience, inspiring an interest in engineering design. &lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;The DIC system will enable several fundamental research activities at Kettering University. For example, Kettering researchers will use the non-contacting capabilities of the DIC system for fundamental research on structural health monitoring (SHM) of rotating structures such as wind turbines and helicopter rotors.  Blade failures are a significant problem for these systems, but challenges with data transmission and mass loading limit the effectiveness of monitoring with conventional contact sensors. This award enables researchers at Kettering University to develop new SHM techniques to prevent catastrophic failures in these structures.   By integrating the finite element method with digital image correlation and a modal expansion technique, the researchers will enhance DIC capabilities for identifying damages inside structures and on locations where cameras do not have line of sight.  In another area of study, researchers at Kettering will use the instrument to advance work underway within the orthopaedic biomechanics research group. This project focuses on improving methods used to treat bone fracture. Current treatments involve plates, screws, and nail designs that are based on devices used in non-biological environments. Clinical use has shown that problems unique to the living environment plague these devices and can lead to poor healing. By using the full-field data from the DIC system, and working between experiments and simulation, researchers aim to identify best practices for modeling the bone/metal interface. This knowledge will facilitate further experimental and simulation work toward optimizing the interface to provide optimal pressure and strain fields for healing.</AbstractNarration>
