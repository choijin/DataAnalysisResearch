<AbstractNarration>Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) melting is increasing.  The associated runoff to the adjacent oceans may have important impacts on marine ecosystems.   Meltwater characteristics, such as iron, sulfate and carbon content, are not well known and depend on the extent and activity of weathering reactions beneath the ice sheet. Microbes in these critical subglacial environments are important contributors of chemical weathering processes, yet, to date, direct molecular evidence of such processes remains to be obtained from GrIS subglacial environments. Here, the principal investigators propose to optimize methods to analyze samples obtained previously from GrIS subglacial meltwaters and to identify evidence of microbial activity in GrIS? subglacial meltwaters.  This is necessary background information required to develop models of the potential impact of increasing meltwater discharge from GrIS on local and downstream commercial fisheries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will contribute to STEM manpower development by offering research experience to an undergraduate student and mentoring to a female postdoctoral researcher.  Its public K-12 focused outreach efforts include workshops and exhibits at three annual Science Weekend experiences for the museum-going public at Seattle?s Pacific Science Center (Polar Science, Life Science Research, and UW PAWS on Science). Each event provides the possibility of one-on-one interactions with over 9000 students from diverse socio-economic backgrounds, allowing time to excite students during explanation of the ?Greenland ice microbes? exhibit and presentation of a hands-on mass spectrometry model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will ultimately provide the first direct molecular evidence for enzymatic microbe-mediated nutrient cycling and remineralization (e.g., iron, sulfate, carbon release) underneath the GrIS. It constitutes the critical first step towards improving conceptual models of microbial GrIS weathering and its resulting impact on nutrient fluxes to future polar oceans. Specifically, the principal investigator anticipates that it will:&lt;br/&gt;1. Optimize protein extraction and environmental proteomics techniques for subglacial meltwater samples;&lt;br/&gt;2. Identify enzymes involved in microbial weathering and nutrient release to the ocean;&lt;br/&gt;3. Decipher molecular protective mechanisms that help microbes in the subglacial environment survive;&lt;br/&gt;4. Identify protein/peptide biomarkers to identify and quantify key metabolic processes in future subglacial studies; and&lt;br/&gt;5. Promote further discovery of novel cold-adaptive enzymes of significant interest to&lt;br/&gt;environmental ecologists and industrial scientists.&lt;br/&gt;Through these efforts, the PIs will demonstrate the ability to detect enzyme-controlled weathering, a prerequisite to quantify and track these processes in detail in the field (e.g., by combining geochemical measurements with targeted quantitative proteomics and 13C-isotopic tracer studies).  The success of this project has the potential to fundamentally change the way in which science views the effects of ice sheet melting. Identification and quantification of the microbial processes controlling weathering and nutrient availability is critical to the next generation of conceptual models ice sheet-ocean interaction.</AbstractNarration>

Genomic data alone do not provide an accurate assessment of&nbsp;<em>in situ</em>&nbsp;microbial activities though. Metaproteomics, on the other hand, can provide direct evidence of proteins synthesized by microbes for the reconstruction of active enzymatic processes controlling the fate of organic carbon, nitrogen and metals in glacial systems and can inform us as to ?who is doing what?. In order for such metaproteomics to provide an accurate view into the function of the resident community, one needs to have a representative sample of this community. This is methodologically extremely challenging given the muddy and silty nature of glacial melt samples and challenges associated with getting sufficient numbers of bacteria separated from such particles and extracted to allow for proteomics (above 1 ?g protein is needed). In this two- year study we successfully developed such a method demonstrating a high bacterial extraction efficiency (3-4 ?g of protein per combined sample and up to 65% of the original bacterial count retrieved, see Figure 1 and 2 in attached file) and furthermore demonstrated the viability of the method for downstream metaproteomics analysis.&nbsp;</p> <p>Thus we obtained the first metaproteomic signatures of microbial GrIS glacial meltwater communities (i.e. survey of all proteins [e.g. enzymes] expressed in glacial microbes) using mass spectrometry proteomics techniques (see Figure 3 in attached file). This dynamic resolution of peptide and proteomic data did allow for more detailed analyses and revealed how seasonality can control expressed functions within the microbial communities underneath the glacier (see Fig.5, 6 and 7 in attached file).&nbsp; Transporters are some of the most abundant proteins identified, including many outer membrane proteins. These are known to import large macromolecules, such as proteins or carbohydrates, for intracellular degradation into nutrients.&nbsp; Additionally, several key proteins involved in methane metabolism were detected (e.g. methane monooxygenase and methanol dehydrogenase, Figure 5 and 6). Close examination of the relative expression of two methanotrophic enzymes revealed a distinct shift in abundance that is controlled by two different classes of bacteria. This led us to the suggestion that different groups of organisms are passing the metabolic ?baton? to improve C and N acquisition and nutrient transfer within dynamic, highly diverse communities.&nbsp;</p> <p>In summary, we developed a high efficiency bacterial extraction method for high sediment content glacial meltwater samples and completed metagenomcis and metaproteomics on these difficult samples. We were able to ID over 1000 proteins from each sample - trumping many soil microbiome metaproteomes three-fold. We detected proteins involved in methane and iron metabolism. We found that splitting samples for meta-genomics &amp; -proteomics yielded high quality data. We discovered that the functional distribution by bacterial class changes through time and strata in glacial meltwaters.</p> <p>The project supported two female senior scientists, a postdoctoral researcher, a technician and undergraduate student. Results were presented at several conferences and a book chapter detailing the results was published. By talking about this project to elementary grade students and their families at the Pacific Science Center during Polar Science weekend, it was evident that young and old minds alike became excited about the fact that microbes play such a crucial role in our everyday life, including how they impact nutrient cycling in the far reaches of the North.&nbsp;</p> <p>In summary these results illustrate the great potential that this newly developed bacterial and protein extraction technique has.
