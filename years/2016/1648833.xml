<AbstractNarration>Young Professional Research Forum at EMBC 2016&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the Young Professional Research Forum at EMBC is to provide doctoral students and early career researchers a supportive scientific forum for students to engage in inter- and multi-disciplinary scholarship focusing on organizational, technical, social, and biomedical issues surrounding health-related technologies. The Young Professional Research Forum provides for expert and peer critique of participants' work with the goal of improving their research. Student participants will also have the opportunity to receive networking support and career advice from internationally-recognized experts. Overall, the doctoral consortium brings together people who might not otherwise engage with one another and engage in inter-disciplinary research in fields involving health, computing and engineering. The Young Professional Research Forum also exposes participant to different scientific disciplinary approaches and develops the next generation of scholars in computing in the domain of health. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the Young Professional Research Forum at EMBC is to support doctoral students and early career researchers through constructive remarks and feedback on their interdisciplinary research from prominent researchers and through interaction with other researchers. Participants from a broad range of disciplines including biomedical informatics, computer science, information science, engineering, clinical sciences and medical informatics will give short presentations of  their work and receive constructive feedback from internationally respected experts. The expert panelists will also provide student participants with career guidance and mentoring through presentations and small group advising throughout the day. In addition, Young Professional Research Forum will be held throughout the conference activities, thus participants will have the opportunity to see the conference and network with conference attendees.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBS) is the oldest and the largest biomedical engineering society worldwide, to advance the application of engineering sciences and technology in medicine and biology, to promote the profession, and to provide global leadership for the benefit of its members and humanity by disseminating knowledge, setting standards, fostering professional development, and recognizing excellence. The 2016 EMBS annual conference in Orlando Florida during August 17-20 attracted more than 2,600 scientists, engineers and students to promote "Empowering Individual Healthcare Decisions through Technology". The fasting growing "biomedical and health informatics" and "wearable sensors", with established areas of "biomedical signal processing and imaging processing" directly support NSF?s mission in advancing "Smart and Connect Health (SCH)". This NSF project is designed to inspire more EMBS young professionals to pursue careers in SCH by helping them to crystalize their research?s "Broad Impact" and "Intellectual Merit"; to attend multiple NSF-sponsored events in EMBC2016 to learn, to network, and to share exciting ideas; and to provide partial funding for them to get matching fund from their institutions to attend EMBC2016. In addition, underrepresented groups of young professionals (e.g. woman, minority, disabled etc.) are strongly encouraged to apply so that the workforce diversity in technology-based and computing-centric fields pivotal for growing "smart and connected health".   The outcomes of this project include: more than 80 young professionals applied for this award, and 30 awardees have presented and shared their work in NSF Young Professional Research forum. Among 30 awardees, 40% are women, which is much higher than average of women working in wearable computing and biomedical and health informatics, and 4 are self-identified as minority.
