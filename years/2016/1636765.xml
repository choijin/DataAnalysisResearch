<AbstractNarration>This Innovation Corps (I-Corps) project is a software application for drones that assists farmers in optimizing crop management.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This team's technology provides an image-based crop management Software-as-a-Service solution that leverages drones for aerial image acquisition. By creating mobile friendly flight planning applications, it puts the farmers in control of their fields. As a result, a drone can fly a specified field (up to 250 acres), collect aerial imagery, and the management system will display an updated map with an aerial representation of the current state of the farmers' fields. With the use of a multispectral camera, the proposed system can detect light frequencies from the canopy of the crops. Those light frequencies can be quantified by a NASA derived index (NDVI) where the current health of each acre can be determined. Over time, this I-Corps team expects to see the platform transform into an insight based application that saves the farmer time, money, and possibly even crops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps team has created a mobile application that can communicate a flight plan to any off-the-shelf drone. The app allows farmers to define their fields and automatically generates the flight plan on their behalf. This means that a farmer can easily procure the drone through their preferred channel, and get it collecting data on their fields without having to worry about learning to pilot the drone. The app allows fields to be bound, defined, and labeled so an operator can simply click a given field and an optimal flight plan is generated. The flight plan allows the operator to determine at which altitude they wish to operate, and the algorithm alters the flight plan accordingly. The proposed system is in the process of evolving beyond an image mosaicking and flight planning application into an analytics engine that can generate prescription recommendations for the farmers' fields. This application leverages historic weather data, as well as scraping real time weather data, to aggregate heat units in order to predict optimal actions for the farmers, such as harvest. With near real-time imaging, historic weather data, and ground based sensor data the team believes they will be able to more effectively predict and optimize yield. The I-Corps program will allow the team to understand which specific crops they can most effectively service, prioritize their feature development, and elucidate more thoroughly on their go-to-market strategy.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Skycision is a technology company conceived at, and spun out of, Carnegie Mellon University.  It uses aerial drones with embedded sensors to collect information about the state of agricultural fields to optimize yields and enhance profitability by:  Reducing crop inspection times Rapidly identifying disease zones and sources of crop stress, and  Integrating additional data (e.g., weather, soil) to automatically make specific recommendations on appropriate actions.   The I-Corps process, and specifically the intensified focus on customer discovery activities, significantly accelerated the identification of Skycision's initial target market (wineries and vineyard management companies, specifically in Northern California).  These direct interactions with prospective customers and other key stakeholders also significantly influenced product development roadmap decisions (e.g., delaying some enhancements, adding a focused set of new capabilities, refining selection of drone manufacturing partners).  By the conclusion of the program, Skycision had secured additional customer trials of its solution which subsequently led to a number of revenue-generating contracts.  In addition, the I-Corps program allowed Skycision to significantly and rapidly refine its overall business model (e.g., pricing scheme and cost drivers, resource requirements, and identification of relevant partners) and "pitch" to prospective investors.  This allowed the company to ultimately be selected for the inaugural cohort of the three-month long AgLaunch accelerator, a joint initiative of Memphis Bioworks Foundation and the Tennessee Department of Agriculture. The program included access to an expanded farmer network, particularly in distressed  rural counties in Tennessee, and $50,000 in seed capital.  Inclusion in this initiative allowed Skycision the resources and expertise to evaluate potential expansion of its solution into a wider variety of row crops, commodities, and orchards which has led to additional customers in new market segments.
