<AbstractNarration>Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) or "drones" have captured our attention as a means to collect aerial sensor data and carry small payloads.  Agriculture, newsgathering, and small package delivery are some of the numerous emerging applications. Numerous research challenges in safety, airspace integration, and complex or large-scale deployments remain. The Center for UAS (C-UAS) is an NSF-supported I/UCRC supporting a wide range of research topics in UAS sensing and control, vehicle and payload management, and multi-vehicle cooperation.  C-UAS (https://c-uas.byu.edu/) has recently grown to include Virginia Tech, and the University of Michigan (UM) was recently invited by the C-UAS team to become a new C-UAS university site pending NSF approval. This planning grant will help the University of Michigan secure industrial partners and plan projects that both complement and extend the C-UAS team and ongoing C-UAS projects. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a new site for an existing I/UCRC, the University of Michigan will adopt policies, guidelines, and an organizational structure consistent with C-UAS and UM practices.  UM site operational procedures and personnel have been defined.  A set of possible projects are summarized with connection to other C-UAS projects and industry members, twelve of which have provided letters of interest for this planning grant proposal.  Education, outreach, and involvement of underrepresented groups are keys to success that complement research project activity.  The planning grant will be used to support travel by the UM team to key companies and a 1.5 day UM site planning workshop hosted at UM. A comprehensive report on the workshop and industry visits will be prepared and shared with C-UAS, potential and committed industry partners, workshop attendees, and NSF.  Throughout the site planning effort, the UM site team will maintain close contact with C-UAS leadership to ensure UM will be an effective new university site.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The University of Michigan PI team achieved all goals specified in our Center for UAS (C-UAS) I/UCRC Planning Grant Proposal.  We first held a Planning Meeting in October 2016.  Key attendees included potential site members from industry, University of Michigan PIs, C-UAS PI Tim McLain and Managing Director Brad Whitby, and NSF representatives.  The University of Michigan team presented potential projects and received positive feedback.  We then attended the C-UAS February 2017 Industrial Advisory Board (IAB) meeting and submitted a full proposal to NSF with four University of Michigan PIs (Ella Atkins, Carlos Cesnik, Dimitra Panagou, Karthik Duraisamy) and seven Letters of Commitment from Industry, two more than the minimum required to meet the $200K minimum membership fees required by NSF for each site proposal.  NSF has now approved the University of Michigan C-UAS site, we attended the August 2017 C-UAS meeting during which our projects received positive feedback, and we have now begun Year 1 of our membership in the C-UAS I/UCRC starting Sept. 2017.  The University of Michigan's four-investigator team is pursuing a total of five projects with one graduate student per project funded by industry membership fees, while NSF funds contribute to the support of the C-UAS managing director, travel, and materials and supplies required for research project experiments.
