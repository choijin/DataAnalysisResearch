<AbstractNarration>Household Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices are intended to collect information in the home and to communicate with each other, to create powerful new applications that support our day-to-day activities. Existing research suggests that users have a difficult time selecting their privacy settings on such devices. The goal of this project is to investigate how, why and when privacy decisions of household IoT users are suboptimal, and to use the insights from this research to create and test a simple single user interface that integrates privacy settings across all devices within a household. This interface will have a flexible set of privacy profiles that fits a wide range of privacy preferences and also helps US companies to comply with EU privacy regulations when they operate in the European market.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike existing privacy research, which assumes that users employ limited but essentially rational decision-making practices, this project aims to understand consumers' actual decision processes.  In this way we can improve theories about privacy decision making using part-worth utility mapping and process tracing (including eye-tracking). The results of these efforts are used to develop a data-driven set of privacy profiles that cover the privacy preferences of most users. These profiles are then integrated into a privacy management interface (an open-source contribution to an existing IoT management platform) that does not overload users with information and control, but instead leverages their existing decision processes and avoids their biases.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit: This project unpacks smarthome users’ privacy decision processes to better under&shy;stand how, why and when their decisions are suboptimal, and to subsequently improve household IoT users’ privacy decisions by providing adequate decision support. Our end goal is to use the insights from this research to create and test a simple, central interface that integrates privacy settings across all devices within a household. This interface is expected to directly improve household IoT users’ privacy decision processes.  Privacy research that focuses directly on decision processes can have a transformatory effect on the difficulty of privacy decisions and the usability of privacy interfaces. Arguably, the current focus on transparency and control merely makes privacy decisions easier for expert users, as interpreting the vast amount of information and harnessing the provided control requires skills that many users do not possess.  Our data-driven approach uses the scenario-based decisions of hundreds of users to determine the optimal privacy-setting interface and a number of "smart privacy profiles" that accurately capture the settings of a large percentage of users. Our recent work is among the first to show that this "smart" approach to default settings performs substantially better than the traditional "everything on" or "everything off" default settings.  Moreover, our recent research advances existing knowledge on the effects of defaults and framing as well as the privacy paradox. Specifically, our part worth utility mapping and process tracing approach allows us to disentangle potential explanations for these effects.  Broader Impacts: The privacy profiles that have been developed in our work summarize the preferences of a wide variety of household IoT users, and can be used to centralize and simplify the privacy setting interfaces of existing IoT devices. Our recent work shows that this improves the privacy management functionality such devices, which is currently addressed separately for each device, and often hidden deep within an unassuming "other settings" category in their settings interface. Our simple, centralized interface allows the users of these devices to get optimal use out of the technology without raising their privacy concerns.  Our findings will also help end-users overcome the privacy paradox and the effects of defaults and framing in their privacy decision-making practices.  One PhD student has been supported on this grant, and its results were reported in workshop and conference publications as well as oral presentations.
