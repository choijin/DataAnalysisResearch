<AbstractNarration>The University of Wisconsin-Madison, in collaboration with the Teachers College at Columbia University, and Georgia Institute of Technology, proposes to study core questions around the design and implementation of the rollout of Computer Science for All (CS4All) in diverse New York City (NYC) communities. NYC is currently beginning the largest rollout of computer science (CS) education in the history of the United States, and one of the largest scaled rollouts of a new academic subject for American public high school students in decades. The CS4All initiative provides an important opportunity to evaluate the affordances and impact of K-12 CS curricula and pedagogies in highly diverse settings at a scale rarely possible. Research around this initiative could not only directly impact CS education for thousands of NYC students, but could also ensure a more equitable blueprint for the rest of the nation as President Obama's newly announced, national CS for All Initiative scales.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though the NYC CS4All project was just announced this year, it is already being deployed across the city in diverse communities and schools that have not previously had any formal computer science or engineering education. As of yet, we know very little about how it is working, or will work, in NYC. Using qualitative grounded theory, mixing interviews, observations, and field notes, we plan to study core questions around the design and implementation of CS curricula in diverse NYC communities: What are the challenges in implementing CS education (with embedded student-centered pedagogies) across NYC? What are the practical roles of the stakeholders in curriculum design, rollout, and uptake for new CS classrooms? What are the goals/values driving administrators and other stakeholders decisions around which CS curricula to adopt, and how are they communicating these goals/values to teachers, students, and their broader community? The research will provide empirical, targeted, and useful research findings for the scaling up of CS classes across NYC and perform basic research that is only possible in this extraordinary, unique, imminent context. To provide such research findings on the accelerated timeline of the rollout requires relatively quick movement on all research endeavors.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     In this project, we examined the history and network structure of New York City's curriculum reform, CS4All (Computer Science for all) initiative. CS4All is an $81 million private-public investment aimed at creating the necessary infrastructure to provide computer science (CS) experiences to all NYC public-school students by 2025. Through interviews with core members of the CS4All initiative, an analysis of public records, and the construction of a social network of various actors, processes, and institutions, we documented how well-connected individuals simultaneously mobilized government resources and grassroots enthusiasm to create the conditions necessary for the initiation of this massive curricular reform effort.   To better understand the potential pitfalls and opportunities of CS4All, we compared its history and structure to Man: A Course of Study (MACOS)--a failed nation-wide curricular reform in the 1960s. The MACOS example suggests that an over-centralization of decision making could become problematic as the goals and details of the initiative become more widely known. If the diverse need and values of communities throughout NYC are not seen to be represented--or at least respected--in the design and implementation of CS Education, a backlash by change-averse stakeholders could be inevitable. Likewise, more consideration should be made for the development of practical formative and summative assessment tools to be used with the diverse curricula being deployed in CS4All. These tools are necessary for teachers to evaluate their practice and student learning, for curriculum developers to critically reflect on and refine their design, school administrators to communicate the value this new course/program of study to parents and government officials, and for funders to see the fruits (or lack thereof) of their investment.  While many of the core CS4All decision have been heavily centralized in the DoE, the DoE has adopted a somewhat distributed system for the enactment of these decisions. In allowing schools to decide what CS curricula or programs they will adopt, and offering a large variety of curricular options, communities may have an opportunity to locally define the nature of the CS4All initiative. This stands in stark contrast to MACOS, where the nature of the curriculum was determined by a handful of academics without consultation from stakeholders and without opportunities for local adaptations.           The CS4All initiative itself also raises important questions about the nature of education reform in the US. CS4All was heavily driven by corporate interests. To what extent is this problematic or prefered to being driven by military fears as was the case with MACOS? Should this vision of education as a means of workforce development be the primary means by which the details of education are determined? Can this workforce focus also contribute to other education goals such as equity and justice?   As the story of CS4All continues to unfold we have an opportunity to determine whether requiring some CS experience in compulsory K-12 education will impact how the general public uses, adopts, and challenges the technological infrastructure that is increasingly ubiquitous in our world. We hope that documenting the early stages of this initiative opens up an avenue to evaluate these important questions further.
