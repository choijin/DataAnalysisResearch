<AbstractNarration>The research enabled by the supported infrastructure has the potential to dramatically impact society in two ways.  First, by undermining entire cyber-crime ecosystems: disrupting underground activities, infrastructure, and social networks through strategic intervention. Inhibiting the flow of money reduces the profitability of these activities, thereby subverting the key incentive underlying modern cybercrime.  Second, improved efficiency of data center networks will significantly reduce operating costs and increase energy efficiency.  The infrastructure will also create educational opportunities for students at a variety of levels, expanding the research skills of postdoc, graduate, and undergraduate students to address both data center network design and security research challenges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is to pursue two separate multi-year research agendas.  One is to collect and analyze extremely large datasets pertaining to various aspects of Internet malware and cybercrime while concurrently exploring new high-performance hybrid optical/electrical network architectures that dramatically decrease the cost and complexity of the infrastructure required to support such analytics.  This award supports compute and storage resources to both conduct the analytics required for the Ecrime research, while simultaneously serving as a testbed for our prototype hybrid network switches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research enabled by this infrastructure has two key components: 1) Through in-depth empirical analyses of a range of online criminal activities, the PIs are developing an understanding of the shape of key economic and social forces---as seen at scale---in terms of relevance for both attackers and defenders.  2)  Characterizing network traffic generated by large-scale data analytics, focusing specifically on identifying the class of network traffic that a circuit switch can support as well as the partitioning of the traffic between the circuit and packet portions of the network.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project funded the acquisition and installation of a rack of state-of-the-art Intel Xeon servers, along with 112 TB of network-attached storage, and a 32-port 100-Gigabyte Ethernet switch to connect them all. This infrastructure serves a dual purpose, enabling two distinct, yet complementary lines of research being conducted by the PIs. First, the compute and storage capacity enabled the large-scale data processing required by the PIs’ evidence-based research in the science of security. The PIs’ research is characterized by its reliance on massive (e.g., 25-TB and larger) datasets, requiring "big-data" analytics tools to effectively process them. Secondly, by connecting the servers to two different networks&mdash;a commodity 100-G switch funded by this grant, and an experimental hybrid optical/electrical top-of-rack switch developed as part of the PIs' research&mdash;the infrastructure served as a testbed for evaluating the effectiveness the PI's novel network designs on real data processing applications and workloads.  The PIs published over 25 manuscripts at top academic conferences disclosing the results of the research conducted on the testbed during the period of the grant.  The data-processing capabilities of the testbed enabled research into the prevalence of Internet site compromise, the behavior of remote-access trojans (RATs), automated account abuse, the evolution of ransomware, the effectiveness of so-called "threat intelligence" feeds, the black-market for email account hacking, and many others.  Meanwhile, the workloads collected on the testbed informed the PIs' network design work, including contributions to passive optical switching, low-complexity circuit scheduling, SmartNIC performance isolation, improved TCP congestion control, and low-latency datacenter network fabrics built out of novel rotor switches.  Additionally, the research enabled by the testbed formed the (partial) basis for seven PhD dissertations granted so far, and at least five more in process.
