<AbstractNarration>Based on the assumption that electric vehicles can decrease fossil fuel dependency and ameliorate urban air quality issues, elected officials at the federal, state, and municipal levels have enacted a variety of policies designed to increase the adoption of this potentially radical technology. This project examines the degree to which these policies, individually or in tandem, affect consumers' willingness to purchase electric vehicles, and the degree to which these policies are driving technological adoption. Alternatively, public policies may be a response to existing demand for electric vehicles and are, therefore, a lagging rather than leading adoption of this technology. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This research increases understanding of the ways public policy can influence, either assist or restrain, the spread of new technologies. The research provides a conceptual and empirical basis for future study of the adoption of radical sustainable technologies. The project surveys the electric vehicle policy landscape in large municipalities across the United States and the ways government officials, representatives of industry, and citizens are communicating about and implementing electric vehicle policies. The project also surveys individual consumers in large U.S. cities in order to assess the effect that government and industry activities have on consumer interest and purchases of electric vehicles.</AbstractNarration>

The Role of Public Policy in Technology Diffusion: The case of Plug-in Electric Vehicles. Environmental Science &amp; Technology 52(19): 10914-10922.   These articles reveal four main findings, as summarized below.  1. State PEV policies play an important role in PEV market developments. State policies influence PEV adoption, but states can consider more than just offering personal tax incentives. Incentives for fleet purchases and charging infrastructure are also essential factors in increasing PEV deployment. Consumer incentives for PEV purchase are twice as effective if the state also provides public charging infrastructure or incentives for others to invest in such infrastructure.   2. Municipal-level stakeholders&mdash;including government officials but also many other types of public, private, and nonprofit stakeholders&mdash;can play an important role in PEV developments. Besides state policies, municipal-level initiatives, such as those focused on expanding PEV charging infrastructure, are also responsible for PEV adoption. Those cities that have experienced success with their PEV initiatives report a great deal of coordination and collaboration across stakeholders. The types of stakeholders engaged in PEV policy activities are also often involved in efforts to encourage the diffusion of other innovative technologies linked to environmental benefits, including wind energy, solar energy, and smart grid technologies.  3. Consumer interest in PEVs has increased significantly between 2011, when modern electric vehicles were first introduced in car markets, and 2017. The main factors behind this trend include:  Improved perceptions about the benefits of owning a PEV relative to the costs;  Favorable consumer experience with the PEV models that are currently offered;  Positive peer influence from friends, neighbors, and family that own PEVs; and  The availability of public charging stations.       4. Despite growing interest, consumers still have significant misunderstandings about PEV technical and cost characteristics.  Consumers tend to overestimate the drawbacks to PEVs (e.g., the purchase price, driving range, and time to recharge the battery) and underestimate the private benefits (e.g., the maintenance costs and gasoline savings). A majority of survey respondents report that incentives would make them more likely to purchase a PEV, but they lack awareness about whether policy incentives are actually available in their local jurisdictions. Increasing awareness about PEV technology and policy will lead to greater consumer interest in PEVs.
