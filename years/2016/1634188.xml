<AbstractNarration>This award supports experimental and computational research to study the high deformation rate behavior of hydrogels.  Hydrogels consist of a polymer network absorbed in water.  Hydrogels are an important class of materials because their properties may be customized to mimic the behavior of many biological tissues.  Accordingly, hydrogels are commonly used as tissue simulants for skin, muscles and human organs (lungs, heart, brain, etc.) in experiments to study traumatic injuries.  Most prior research has focused on the behavior of hydrogels at low deformation rates.  Unfortunately, such experiments do not mimic the conditions associated with tissue injuries caused by high rate deformation (e.g., sudden falls, skiing injuries, automobile accidents) and the effects of shockwave propagation (non-contact blast injuries to lungs, tissue and brain).  The results of this research will provide the knowledge necessary to better understand shockwave propagation and related damage in biological tissues.  Thus, this research will benefit military veterans and other citizens with traumatic soft tissue injuries.  Furthermore, workforce development activities will contribute to the training of graduate and undergraduate students in experimental and simulation techniques. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will provide an understanding of the fundamental physical mechanisms related to the dynamic behavior of hydrogels, such as variation in wave velocity as a function of propagation distance and water volume fraction.  Further, this research will provide a first understanding of high rate viscosity in hydrogels as a function of water content, atomic scale stresses and strains during high rate shearing deformation, and the rate of crack growth in hydrogel samples.  Experiments will be conducted using a unique polymer split Hopkinson pressure bar customized to study shockwave propagation and dynamic fracture in hydrogel materials.  Molecular dynamics simulations will be conducted to study shockwave propagation and viscosity with atomic resolution.  Combined, data from experiments and simulation will be used to improve hyperelastic constitutive models for the dynamic mechanical behavior of hydrogels.  Experimental measurement and simulation of the high strain rate viscosity of hydrogels will be used to develop novel rate dependent cohesive zone models for predictive simulation of crack propagation in hydrogels.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Hydrogels are a class of composite materials composed of mechanically or chemically crosslinked polymer chains swollen by absorbed water. Many hydrogels are biocompatible and have been employed in advanced biomedical applications, such as support scaffolds for cell or tissue growth and as electrically activated or sensing materials in soft robotics. Of primary importance to this work is that hydrogels can be synthesized to mimic the properties of many biological tissues; thus, they are used as surrogates for skin, muscle, tendon and organs, in studies on behind armor blunt trauma and traumatic brain injury. Thus, the objective of this research was to measure, understand and model the loading rate-dependent mechanical deformation of hydrogels in different deformation modes.</p> <p>The <strong><em>Intellectual Merits</em></strong> of this work are significant and integrated between experimental and computational tasks. (1) New experimental techniques and fixtures were developed to study the high strain rate behavior of hydrogels in tension and shear. These experimental methods allowed for the analysis of both transient and steady-state behavior in hydrogels, through measurement of the time synchronized stress and strain responses. (2) Molecular dynamics simulations were performed to study the molecular level mechanisms and rearrangements that occur during shock compression or high rate shear deformation. For example, these simulations provided a measurement of the shear thickening exponent and viscosity during transient state deformation. Using non-dimensional analyses and proof that the shear momentum wave is self-similar as a function of time, a model developed using molecular dynamics results provided a good prediction of experimental measurements of the shear thickening exponent and transient state viscosity, without fitting. (3) New insights into proper bounds for coefficients in hyperelastic constitutive models were established based on thermodynamic inequalities. This work showed that traditionally used inequalities can be overly restrictive for hydrogels. Furthermore, this work proved that using data from only one deformation mode (e.g., compression) to fit parameters in a hyperelastic constitutive model can lead to illogical responses in other deformation modes (e.g., shear). (4) A new form for visco-hyperelastic constitutive modeling was developed that captured rate dependent behavior of hydrogels across a range of strain rates. It was proven that all previously proposed viscous dissipation potentials lack the ability to capture general strain rate dependence of elastic moduli in hydrogels, which directly conflicts with experimental evidence.</p> <p>The <strong><em>Broader Impacts</em></strong> of this work are equally significant. Soft tissue injuries due to blunt trauma or exposure to shockwaves from blasts are common in active duty soldiers and military veterans. In addition, hydrogels are used to train medical professionals to assess and repair soft tissue injuries, and to perform suturing and other surgical procedures. In most cases, laboratory experiments on live tissue are not possible. Therefore, studies on tissue surrogates, such as hydrogels and soft polymers, are necessary to understand the response of live tissue to these extreme loading events. Importantly, most of the technical contributions in this work are relevant to soft materials beyond the specific hydrogels studied in experiments and simulations. An excellent example of this was demonstrated where the new visco-hyperelastic constitutive model was successfully fit to tension, compression and shear data in the literature of brain gray matter deformed at different strain rates. Workforce development activities contributed to the training of both graduate and undergraduate students. Specifically, this award supported (in part) three Ph.D. students at the University of Florida. In addition, multiple undergraduate researchers, including those from underrepresented groups in STEM, were important contributors to the research in each year of the project.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/24/2020<br>      Modified by: Douglas&nbsp;E&nbsp;Spearot</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1634188/1634188_10438671_1603474723292_Figure1_Quasistaticcompressiontensionandshearexperimentsonhydrogels--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1634188/1634188_10438671_1603474723292_Figure1_Quasistaticcompressiontensionandshearexperimentsonhydrogels--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Quasi-static compression, tension and shear setups"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1634188/1634188_10438671_1603474723292_Figure1_Quasistaticcompressiontensionandshearexperimentsonhydrogels--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Quasi-static compression, tension and shear setups"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Experimental setup for (a) uniaxial compression, (b) uniaxial tension, and (c) simple shear experiments on agarose gel.
