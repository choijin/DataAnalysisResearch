<AbstractNarration>The project addresses several central problems in the analysis and prediction of the evolution of complex systems, i.e. the systems with complex dynamics and/or systems with a large number of interacting components (networks).  Real world and engineering networks often have tens of thousands of components. Theory, developed by the principal investigator, allows one to compress networks of any type into much smaller networks while preserving important information about the initial large network.  In the proposed project, this theory will be further developed.  And, in collaboration with Center for Disease Control (CDC) researchers, applied to an analysis of transmission and cross-immunoreactivity networks for Hepatitis C.  Cross-immunoreactivity means that antibodies produced by the immune system to fight some specific type of viruses sometimes fights other types of viruses as well.  Cross-immunoreactivity is found for Hepatitis C, influenza, dengue, and is a basis for a mathematical model developed by the author with CDC colleagues.  Traditional views on evolution of systems with complex dynamics suggest that only long term predictions for such systems are possible, since one should wait until the system stabilizes.  A new approach, proposed by the principal investigator, allows one to make short term predictions on the evolution of chaotic systems.  It will be possible to answer questions such as, "which state of the system is most likely?".  This research will extend this approach to a larger class of systems with complex dynamics and also address problem of recurrence.  Understanding of a fundamental mechanism of chaos, called defocusing, will be essentially extended. Discovery of this mechanism by the principal investigator has already found numerous applications in theoretical and experimental physics. New visual models of systems with various types of chaotic behavior can be included into basic and advanced courses on complex systems and chaos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research addresses some long standing and technically challenging, as well as new natural problems, in the theory of dynamical systems and statistical mechanics. A new area of finite time qualitative properties of dynamical and stochastic systems, pioneered by the principal investigator, will be further developed.  This will make use of combinations of methods and ideas of symbolic dynamics, discrete mathematics and probability.  The theory of isospectral transformation of networks will be further developed with a special emphasis on analysis of attractors of sequences of such transformations in the space of networks.  Understanding the mechanism of defocusing, a fundamental mechanism of hyperbolicity (chaos), will be advanced.  This uses new classes of chaotic billiards where focusing components are not forced to be far from each other.   Classical Ehrenfests' gas will be shown to have unexpected properties thanks to a new observation that billiards with a point and with a finite size particle can have quite different dynamics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this Project:     1.It was built a foundation of a rigorous theory of Finite time dynamics  (evolution) for strongly chaotic dynamical (deterministic) systems and  for stochastic (random) systems (processes). The existing so far theory was  dealing with infinite time behavior of such systems. It means that all  the results and notions in the theory of evolution of complex systems  involved either a limit when time goes to infinity or averaging over infinite  time interval. Therefore predictions of this theory were restricted to what  is going to happen at some very large times which is not much practical.  A new theory allows to make predictions of evolution for finite times. These  predictions allow to answer questions like: "Whether this event (state  of the system) is more likely to show up before another event (state of the  system) in a finite interval of times".  Certainly it is not a silly trivial questions   like whether say "head" will "show" up before in the coin tossing, but the ones  dealing with rather nontrivial events which are relevant to evolution of  complex systems. For instance, which part (subset)  of the collection of all states of the system will more likely show up the first in time evolution.  2. A 45 years old problem independently formulated by many outstanding  mathematicians is solved.  This question was dealing with a border smoothness of the boundary of a billiard table such that dynamics (evolution) is completely chaotic if the boundary is less smooth than this border value, and dynamics becomes not completely chaotic for billiards with more smooth boundaries. Billiards are dynamical systems generated by a motion by inertia of a point particle within a billiard table with elastic reflections off its boundary. They (billiards) serve as relevant models in mechanics, optics, acoustics and various other areas of classical and quantum Physics.  3. There were introduced physical billiard where a moving particle is not a point, as in mathematical billiards, but it is  a hard ball. It was proved that in transition from mathematical to physical billiards (in the same billiard table) both chaos-order and order-chaos transitions in dynamics ( in their evolution) may occur. Moreover, such transitions may occur both softly (already forarbitrarily small radius of a ball) and in a hard manner, when transition occurs if the radius of the moving ball exceeds some positive critical value. These results were immediately taken up by the physicists,  and the papers about application of these phenomena appeared in some best their journals.
