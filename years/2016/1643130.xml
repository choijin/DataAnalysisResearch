<AbstractNarration>This award supports participation in the Fifth Annual Midwest Women in Mathematics Symposium (WIMS) to be held on April 8, 2017 at Indiana University - Purdue University Indianapolis. The aim of WIMS is: (i) to highlight the scholarly contributions of female mathematicians in the Midwest region, and (ii) to stimulate collaborations, networking, and mentoring relations among female mathematicians in the Midwest region. WIMS has been established as an annual event that rotates among colleges and universities in the Midwest. The Symposium brings together female mathematicians from across the Midwest at all stages of their careers. Based on attendance at previous WIMS, 150 participants are anticipated in 2017.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Symposium features two hour-long plenary lectures by distinguished senior female faculty members and ten thirty-minute invited lectures by promising female junior faculty and postdoctoral researchers. The topics of the academic sessions at WIMS 2017 are Geometry and Topology, Dynamical Systems, and Mathematical Biology. Graduate students and recent Ph.D.s have the opportunity to present their work at the Symposium Poster Session. The lectures and poster session are accompanied by open problem sessions, during which WIMS participants work in small groups to discuss field-specific problems. Such work will naturally lead to follow-up visits among the participants at other Midwest institutions and new long-term collaborations. More details about the symposium can be found at http://math.iupui.edu/~buse/WIMS-17/.</AbstractNarration>

The meeting built upon the success of previous symposia, maintaining WIMS as an annual event rotating among colleges and universities in the Midwest. The Symposium attracted female mathematicians in the Midwest at all stages of their careers.     A total of 98 participants registered for the all-day conference at IUPUI.  Ten promising junior faculty members gave 30 minute research talks, 18 trainees (postdocs, graduate students, and undergraduate students) gave poster presentations, and 2 distinguished senior faculty members gave plenary talks.  The oral and poster presentations reflected the broad spectrum of pure and applied mathematics research being conducted at the variety of Midwest institutions represented at the conference.  Open problem sessions were also held during the conference which gave participants the opportunity to discuss new or unsolved problems, particularly in the areas of geometry, topology, dynamical systems, and mathematical biology.  Finally, the working lunch featured round-table discussions during which female students could gain insight from junior and senior female faculty members regarding work-life balance issues for female mathematicians.  A satellite colloquium was held at IUPUI the night before the conference, providing an additional opportunity for participants to meet and network with each other and the IUPUI faculty.
