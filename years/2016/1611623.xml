<AbstractNarration>To get the sharpest images of planets, stars and galaxies, astronomers must use innovative techniques that correct for the blurring of images caused by turbulence in the earth's atmosphere. One of the most exciting uses of this technology is imaging planets around nearby stars. This team aims to build a device that works using infrared light from the host star (the star that the planet orbits). The device will be used on one of the world's largest telescopes, the Keck II telescope on Maunakea, Hawaii. The system works by rapidly changing the shape of mirrors inside the instrument to counteract the effect of "ripples" in the earth's atmosphere. The principal investigator, along with a postdoctoral researcher, summer interns, and graduate and undergraduate students from Hawaii and California, will search for planets around 150 small "dwarf" stars. Their results will be made available to the broader science community through the Keck Data Archive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Driven by the scientific desire to study young planetary systems around low-mass M-dwarfs, and the practical need to develop near-infrared (NIR) wavefront sensing and adaptive optics (AO) capabilities for the upcoming generation of 30 meter class segmented-mirror telescopes, the proposers seek to produce a system that operates in the L-band for the Keck observatory. The IR detector technology needed for such a system now exists (in large part through funding by NSF) and will be used by the proposers to build a near-IR, high-order, pyramid wavefront sensor for the Keck II telescope. This system will then be used to conduct an L-band (3 micron) coronagraphic imaging survey of ~150 M dwarfs with the Keck facility instrument, NIRC2. The team will conduct follow-up low-resolution slit spectroscopy observations of any exoplanet candidates found in the L-band survey. Note that M-dwarfs are too faint to observe with sufficient contrast and spatial resolution to detect (even massive) exoplanets with existing optical AO systems. The development of the proposed NIR wavefront sensing system at Keck may be viewed as an enabling technology that could lead to the fabrication of similar units at other, publicly available observatories. It should also be noted that NIR wavefront sensing can be used to extend the performance of natural guide star AO systems to fainter targets, and to increase the sky coverage to regions where only optically obscured or very red guide stars are available.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Images obtained using ground-based telescopes are blurred by atmospheric turbulence. Adaptive optics (AO) technology is used to correct&nbsp;this effect and&nbsp;is routinely used on the two 10-meter diameter Keck telescopes (figure 1) located in Hawaii. These AO systems are used to produce incredibly detailed images, enabling the direct imaging and detection of planets outsider our solar system (exoplanets). A deeper understanding of planetary formation and evolution depends critically upone the ability to study young dwarf stars which are common sites of planet formation. Unfortunately, the faintness of these stars at visible wavelengths has made them challenging to observe with current AO systems, which typically measure the impact of the atmospheric turbulence using visible detector based wavefront sensors (WFS). However, these stars are relatively bright at infrared wavelengths and therefore can benefit from infrared wavefront sensing, now possible due to recent advances in infrared detectors.</p> <p>We proposed to the National Science Foundation&nbsp;to implement a new WFS on the Keck II telescope: a near-infrared pyramid wavefront sensor. A pyramid WFS uses a four-sided pyramid prism to split the incoming light and produce four images of the telescope aperture on a detector. The distribution of light between the four images (figure 2) provides a measurement of the wavefront aberration caused by the atmospheric turbulence. The decision to use a pyramid WFS over other types of WFS stemmed from the high sensitivity of this sensor, as demonstrated&nbsp;at visible wavelengths on the Large Binocular&nbsp;and Subaru&nbsp;telescopes.&nbsp;</p> <p>Our proposal was built on&nbsp;considerable progress by our collaborators: infrared detector testing and camera development at the University of Hawaii (UH); visible pyramid WFS experience and real-time control software developed at Arcetri and Subaru Observatories; the AO exoplanet expertise of a science team at the California Institute of Technology (CIT); and the scientifically productive AO systems and instruments at the W. M. Keck Observatory.</p> <p>The infrared pyramid WFS was designed to be used with the NIRC2 science instrument,&nbsp;a near-infrared imager, and a new fiber injection unit (FIU) used to feed NIRSPEC, the&nbsp;near-infrared spectrograph on the Keck II telescope. The pyramid WFS and FIU were developed in conjunction as the Keck Planet Imager and Characterizer (KPIC). KPIC was assembled at the UH (see figure 3) and thorough testing of the subsystems was carried to ensure they met the requirements. In particular this involved testing the performance of the pyramid WFS's infrared detector, a SAPHIRA avalanche photodiode array, and development and testing of the camera controller. In September 2018 the KPIC instrument was successfully installed on the Keck II telescope AO bench (see figure 4) and integration with the existing&nbsp;AO system was completed. Full remote control of the system allows the team to remotely&nbsp;test and calibrate the instrument during the day, using an internal source to mimic a star. On November 20, 2018, the Keck pyramid WFS was operated on-sky for the first time, successfully operating the AO system with the pyramid WFS (see figure 5).</p> <p>The feasibility and performance of the infrared pyramid WFS was fully demonstrated via daytime and on-sky commissioning. A shared risk science program was carried out in parallel, focusing on two distinct types of observations. First, searches were carried out around stars thought to be probable hosts of exoplanets, specifically low mass stars and stars previously observed to have proto-planetary disks. These observations involved long exposures (typically &gt; 1 hour) using a coronagraph to block the light from the star to aid in the detection of any planets. Post processing techniques were used to further reduce noise in the data. An example of the final image of such an observation with the pyramid WFS is shown in figure 6, the planetary system PDS70. This result has recently been accepted for publication in the Astronomical Journal (Wang et al., 2020). Other observations have revealed several interesting features which will be followed up in future observations. In conjunction with the deep imaging a snapshot survey of young, nearby M-dwarf stars was carried out. This involved short exposures, searching for stellar and planetary companions, and had helped demonstrate the image quality and observing efficiency of the pyramid WFS for these types of observations. The pyramid WFS will be available for regular science observations beginning in August 2020 after completing the&nbsp;upgrades&nbsp;needed to make the system facility-class&nbsp;and the training of operations personnel.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 04/14/2020<br>      Modified by: Peter&nbsp;L&nbsp;Wizinowich</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1611623/1611623_10462195_1586387599034_telescope_mount--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1611623/1611623_10462195_1586387599034_telescope_mount--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1: The Keck II Telescope."><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1611623/1611623_10462195_1586387599034_telescope_mount--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1: The Keck II Telescope."></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The Keck II telescope showing the 36 hexagonal segments of the primary mirror (each segment is 1.8 m from corner to corner).
