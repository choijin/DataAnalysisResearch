<AbstractNarration>This RAPID award investigates whether larval nematodes, which also infect the blood of people, can increase the rate of transmission of the Zika virus. Nematode blood pathogens are parasitic worms that enter the skin and blood of people as tiny larvae and are common in Latin America and the Caribbean. The relationship between these nematodes and virus transmission has not been well studied, but there is some evidence that nematodes may enhance virus transmission. For a mosquito to become infectious and transmit the virus, the virus must pass from the mosquito's gut (after the mosquito feeds on the blood of a person infected with the virus) through the insect's gut wall, which can serve as a barrier to the virus. However, larval nematodes can penetrate the mosquito's midgut wall, potentially enhancing virus transmission into the mosquito body. This project will test the hypothesis that larval nematodes are increasing a mosquito's ability to transmit Zika. If they have this effect, treating people for these parasitic worms could reduce disease transmission. Results from this project will be relevant to the Zika public health emergency, and the researchers have set in place mechanisms to share quality-assured interim and final data as rapidly and widely as possible, including with public health and research communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will investigate whether people infected with larval nematodes, microfilariae, enhance the transmission of arboviruses, such as the Zika virus. After feeding on an infected host, a mosquito ingests microfilariae, which penetrate the mosquito's midgut providing a pathway for viruses obtained in the blood meal to enter the body cavity and ultimately the salivary glands. These mosquitos become more susceptible to virus transmission, which can accelerate virus development leading to more infectious mosquitos. Microfilariae can penetrate the midgut of Aedes aegypti, which is the mosquito that transmits Zika. This study will quantify midgut microfilariae penetration for Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus after being fed mixtures of microfilariae (Mansonella ozzardi) and Zika to determine the rate of viral infection and dissemination for the Zika virus.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Zika virus is transmitted by mosquitoes.  But mosquitoes also transmit other pathogens, such as malaria and parasitic nematodes.  This project set out to examine whether a relatively benign nematode infection common throughout Latin America &ndash; i.e., mansonelliasis &ndash; could enhance the transmission of Zika virus by mosquitoes.  Mansonelliasis is one of several diseases caused by a group of nematodes known collectively as filarial worms.  Filarial worms are vector-borne and parasitize all classes of vertebrates, except fish.  There are at least 6 different species that exclusively parasitize humans, including Mansonella ozzardi, the species that causes mansonelliasis in Latin America.  Adult females produce tiny larvae called "microfilariae" that enter the blood and skin of their host.  When ingested by mosquitoes, the microfilariae quickly penetrate the mosquito stomach and move to the thorax where they complete their development.  I speculated that if the same blood also contained Zika virus, then the virus could "hitch a ride" with  penetrating microfilariae and be transported directly into the body of the mosquito without having to first undergo replication in the mosquito stomach.  This would speed up virus development in the mosquito and make mosquitoes able to transmit the Zika virus much sooner than they normally would.  In effect, microfilarial infections could enhance Zika virus transmission.  Before beginning the work, all required compliance issues allowing me to produce Zika virus-infectious mosquitoes and obtain microfilaremic human blood from overseas had to be met.   After approvals were in place, successful laboratory infections of mosquitoes with Zika virus were accomplished in short order.  However, a major setback to the project occurred upon the unexpected and tragic death of my Trinidadian collaborator who was to be the source of Mansonella ozzardi infected blood.  This filarial species is not easy to obtain because it only grows in humans.  Thus the only way to get it is to collect blood from naturally-infected people in Latin America.  Attempts to find another source of this parasite species proved fruitless.  To keep the project going, I chose to use another species of filarial worm &ndash; i.e., Brugia pahangi &ndash; that can be obtained from an NIH-supported research repository known as BEI Resources.  When Brugia pahangi microfilariae were mixed with Zika virus and fed to mosquitoes, the virus moved into mosquito body cavities more rapidly and in greater proportion than in mosquitoes fed only virus.  Thus, the ability of B. pahangi microfilariae to "enhance" Zika virus infectivity to mosquitoes was confirmed.  To test if Zika virus interacted somehow with B. pahangi microfilariae, I incubated Zika virus with purified B. pahangi microfilariae for several hours, then subjected the microfilariae to extensive washing to the point where there should have been no virus left in the test tubes.  However, when miniscule amounts of the washed microfilariae were injected into mosquitoes, Zika virus was recovered a week later from 4 of 29 (14%) injected mosquitoes, indicating that Zika virus had indeed associated with B. pahangi microfilariae during co-incubation &ndash; i.e., Zika virus either stuck to the surface of microfilariae or was swallowed by the microfilariae.  In addition those studies, I also tested  the ability of our local mosquito species to transmit Zika virus.  I found that one of the most aggressive and abundant mosquito species in the northern hemisphere, Aedes vexans, was capable of becoming infected and transmitting Zika virus.  Although this study was somewhat ancillary to my investigation of the interaction of Zika virus with microfilariae, I felt it remained true to the larger goal of the NSF RAPID initiative &ndash; i.e., to better understand mosquito transmission of Zika virus.  The project provided excellent training in classic arbovirology techniques for two graduate students and three undergraduate students.  In summary, my students and I were able to show that microfilarial worms, when ingested together with Zika virus by mosquitoes, resulted in an enhanced infection of mosquitoes with Zika virus.  The worms made a difference.       Last Modified: 08/23/2018       Submitted by: Jefferson A Vaughan]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
