<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will extend to a number of applications, including smart buildings, home automation, and security. The development of this new technology for efficient indoor sensing, and development of new algorithms for occupancy sensing and counting techniques, will have immediate implications in the building automation and home construction industries, where improved occupancy sensing is necessary to achieve the promise of Smart Buildings that adjust environmental conditions such as lighting and air conditions automatically to suit the needs of the occupants. Implementing this false-alarm free technology will realize millions of dollars cost saving from reduced energy use. Such energy savings would impact the US energy independence while helping to cut greenhouse gas emissions, making positive contribution to the planet?s climate and environment. In addition to "smart building"/energy efficiency applications there are also significant opportunities to apply these highly-reliable and difficult-to-defeat sensors to facility security, military, law enforcement/correctional facilities and in-home care monitoring. This projects represents Broadening Participation: As a woman-owned minority business in the underrepresented geographical location (Hawaii), the success of Adnoviv will bring opportunity for graduate students through our relationship with the University of Hawaii and encourage young girls to enter Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) related fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase I project will result in a revolutionary advance in occupancy sensing for smart buildings and energy-use reduction by providing a low-cost sensor capable of real human presence detection and occupant count, and eliminating the issues that have limited the utility of occupancy sensors in many applications. The feasibility of using radio frequency Doppler radar to detect human cardiopulmonary activity and estimate number of occupants using a low power system-on-chip (SoC) platform will be demonstrated. In particular reliable occupant detection without false alarms, and occupant count estimation will be investigated to further enhance energy savings potential, especially in conjunction with heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) loads. The significant commercial potential of such True Presence Occupancy Detection Sensors (TruePODS) in energy-saving applications will be demonstrated in partnership with one of the largest building automation companies in the world.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ With NSF STTR Phase I funding, Adnoviv continued its efforts on developing the company?s first core commercial product &ndash; new intelligent True Presence Occupancy Detection Sensors (TruePODS) which saves energy without user compromise. TruePODS are the first that employ Doppler radar cardiopulmonary sensing technology to detect true human presence, and hence to avoid the cost and nuisance associated with erroneous switching of lights or HVAC (heating, ventilation and air conditioning) systems.  The innovation in TruePODS is true occupancy detection achieved through Doppler radar sensing of a motion-modulated signal reflected by the chest of person. Respiration or heart beat are remotely sensed to accurately recognize human presence using a low-power (radiated power level lower than a typical WiFi router or cell-phone) radio source from an off-the-shelf SoC (System-on-Chip). TruePODS integrate the capabilities of sensing, decision-making and communication in a single device, and thus provide the key to realizing wireless sensor units which can enable zero energy "smart buildings" by reducing energy consumption and improving energy efficiency, all in an inexpensive, small form-factor, low-power solution.  With the primary focus on the growing market for improved human detection sensors in energy-saving and energy-efficiency applications, the objective of the Phase I project is to investigate the feasibility of building Doppler radar occupancy sensors with high detection accuracy: TruePODS.  After one year of research and development, Adnoviv team has achieved all the technical objectives listed in Phase I proposals:  Build a field test prototype and run a long-term testing in a real environment, against an existing commercial hybrid occupancy sensor product which includes both passive infrared (PIR) and ultrasonic sensors. Develop and optimize an occupancy detection algorithm which demonstrates at least 90% detection accuracy within 10 seconds in a field test scenario.  Develop a method for counting occupants by designing and testing an algorithm based on Received Signal Strength (RSS).  Improve the counting accuracy by developing a SIMO/MIMO radar architecture and the Blind Source Separation (BSS) algorithm to determine the number of occupants.    Adnoviv has confirmed the superior performance of built Doppler radar occupancy sensors: TruePODS through long term field test, running in parallel with commercial available occupancy sensor. Also, Adnoviv explored and confirmed the feasibility of occupancy counting capability for both coarse and fine counting applications with the method of simple radar architecture based on RSS and more complicated SIMO/MIMO structure.  Encouraged by the findings on TurePODS field test prototype, Adnoviv is confident that a successful pre-commercial TruePODS prototype can be built by completing the research and development for TruePODS MVP (minimum viable product) and optimizing both hardware and software that we have.
