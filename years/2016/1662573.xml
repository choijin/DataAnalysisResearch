<AbstractNarration>Title: 2017 Proteins: Exploring the Role of Proteins as Cellular Organizers by Combining Experiment and Theory &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This meeting will cover a very broad range of topics relevant to protein science, including protein structure, function and dynamics, from the molecular to the cellular level, using biophysical, biochemical, structural, optical and computational tools. The meeting has evolved with the field, and represents the cutting edge of protein science. This year a Gordon Research Seminar exclusively for young scientists, will be held two days prior to the Gordon Research Conference at the same site. This year's list of speakers has many eminent scientists including one Nobel Laureate. Half of the invited speakers are females and also include members of the underrepresented minorities, young scientists and international scientists. Attendees include graduate students and postdoctoral fellows and junior faculty from primarily undergraduate institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two major themes will be highlighted in this meeting.  The first theme depicts proteins as cellular organizers from molecular to cellular level using state-of-the-art biophysical approaches. The second theme is integration of theoretical and computational approaches with experiment.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The 2017 Proteins Gordon Research Conference was conceived with two underlying leitmotifs. The first is to highlight proteins as cellular organizers, while the second and equally central theme of the meeting was the interplay between experiment and theory and modeling in modern protein research. Recent major advances in electron and optical microscopy have revealed amazing structural and spatial organization at the level of protein complexes and protein interactions. These advances were featured by Andre Hoelz of CalTech who described the structure of the nuclear pore complex in the opening Keynote address. Our closing Keynote speaker, Carol Post of Purdue University, addressed a combined computational and experimental approach to understanding the regulation of a tyrosine kinase. Several sessions followed up on the theme of proteins as cellular organizers. Session 3 addressed new super-resolution imaging of nuclear organization, while Session 4 spoke to the dynamic aspects of proteins as organizers in vesicle sorting and membrane remodeling. Two other sessions, one on the role of intrinsically disordered proteins and the other on protein biogenesis and interactions <em>in vivo</em> weaved in this leitmotif, as well. Given the ever-increasing level of integration of experimental and theoretical approaches in protein science, both theory and experiment were included in each session. In several cases, individual invited speakers addressed both experimental and computational aspects of protein research. In other sessions, a combination of talks, some theoretical and others experimental, addressed similar topics. Of the 24 invited speakers, we worked to achieve a near complete balance between theoretical and experimental protein science.

Specific sub-topics included: protein modeling and design; dynamics and allostery; membrane and vesicle management; nuclear organization; intrinsically disordered proteins; biogenesis and interactions.     What were the major goals of the project?  Organizing a Gordon Research Conference involves extensive communication with the research community to identify important issues at the frontiers of the field, and solicit suggestions for speakers and discussion leaders to participate in the conference.  The Chair then contacts prospective participants to invite them to talk and discuss the nature of their contributions.  The Chair then communicates the topics and aims of the conference through web pages, contact with relevant international professional bodies and email to members of the research community around the world to encourage applications for participation in the conference.  The Chair is then responsible for assessing and accepting the applications and fielding a host of questions both concerning the technical content and practical aspects of conference participation.     Major Activities   The Gordon Research Conference (GRC) and Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) on Proteins were held at Holderness School in Holderness, New Hampshire from June 17-23, 2017.   The meeting covered a variety of scientific topics and the content presented was highly rated by participants.    The Conference had 110 participants. Scientists from academia represented 89% of the participants while attendees from government accounted for 4% and those from industry totaled 7%. The meeting also attracted a strong mix of young investigators and senior scientists.  Students and post-docs accounted for 52% of all attendees.
