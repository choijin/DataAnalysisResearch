<AbstractNarration>This project supports a conference on "Humans, Machines, and the Future of Work" to be held at Rice University, in Houston, TX. The conference will focus on issues created by the impact of information technology on labor markets over the next 25 years, addressing questions such as: What advances in artificial intelligence, robotics and automation are expected over the next 25 years? What will be the impact of these advances on job creation, job destruction, and wages in the labor market? What skills are required for the job market of the future? How can education prepare workers for that job market? What educational changes are needed? What economic and social policies are required to integrate people whose skills do not match the needs of future labor markets? How can social mobility in such an environment be preserved and increased? The conference will feature 16 renowned speakers and panelists from academia, industry and leading think tanks with expertise in technology, economics, social sciences, and the humanities. The goal of the conference is to start a conversation between many academic disciplines on the future of work in order to make this topic a subject of ongoing academic inquiry, as well as a subject of public policy discussion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The current understanding of the Information Technology Revolution is somewhat similar to the 1970s' understanding of global warming. Facts are known with some level of certainty.  Computers are eliminating some jobs involving structured tasks in manufacturing, clerical work, and some other mid-skill occupations.  At the same time,  computers are creating new jobs in many other occupations, particularly for technically skilled people. Beyond these facts lies a broad landscape of speculation.  Not much is known about the Information Technology Revolution's net effect on employment and wages. Equally important, not much is known about the speed at which the revolution is proceeding.  To the extent this uncertainty can be reduced, it will require a joint effort by computer scientists, economists, sociologists, psychologists, and others. Addressing these issues is an important national challenge.</AbstractNarration>

The conference lasted two days and was attended by over 200 attendees.  The conference focused on issues created by the impact of information technology on labor markets over the next 25 years, addressing questions such as:  What advances in artificial intelligence, robotics and automation are expected over the next 25 years? What will be the impact of these advances on job creation,job destruction and wages in the labor market? What skills are required for the job market of the future?

How can we preserve and increase social mobility in such an environment?   The conference featured renowned speakers from academia, industry and leading think tanks with expertise in technology, economics, social sciences and the humanities.   In addition, an interactive poster session included about 20 posters on topics related to the future of work and facilitated a multitude of conversations among participants.  The conference was concluded with a public-policy panel in which experts debated public-policy options to respond to the automation challenge.
