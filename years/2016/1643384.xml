<AbstractNarration>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities - Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) provides support to undertake an institutional self-analysis in preparation for a Broadening Participation Research Center.  Broadening Participation Research Centers are expected to serve as a national hub for the rigorous study and broad dissemination of the critical pedagogies and culturally sensitive interventions that contribute to the success of HBCUs in educating African American STEM undergraduates. The project at Southern University seeks to investigate identified contributory factors envisioned to support advancing diversity and inclusion through global research engagement as a promising interventional approach with the potential to change the culture of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education for underrepresented minority students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project seeks to frame a new model for transformative STEM teaching and learning that advances science and societal well-being through the 21st century; enhance the research knowledge base to better understand the multidimensionality of underlying issues affecting STEM workforce disparities; and incorporate research, education, outreach, and knowledge transfer into an integrated learning ecosystem that will inform STEM education practices and interventions. To address this grand challenge, the project's activities and strategies are designed to investigate the viability of global translation in: creating shareable knowledge; educating a new generation of scholars, practitioners, innovators, entrepreneurs, and leaders; positively impacting the inclusion of disproportionately represented diverse minorities in the STEM workforce; and developing practical solutions to the most pressing environmental, economic, and social challenges of sustainability. The project will be guided by formative and summative evaluation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[PROJECT OUTCOMES REPORT  In August 2016, the National Science Foundation funded Southern University and A&amp;M College in Baton Rouge, Louisiana to investigate the effect of translating guiding tenets of Southern?s land grant mission to the international stage as a contributing factor to advancing diversity and inclusion of underrepresented minority populations within the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce.  The project, entitled ?Planning Grant:  Advancing Diversity and Inclusion (ADI) Through a Collaborative Model for Globalization of Higher Education at an HBCU Land-Grant Institution?, sought to develop a new model for transformative STEM teaching and learning that maximized knowledge exchange and research connectivity across scientific disciplines, knowledge institutions and geographic boundaries in realizing innovative solutions to address global sustainability challenges.  It would also enhance the research knowledge base to better understand underlying issues affecting STEM workforce disparities.   Southern University envisioned that this planning grant would allow for exploring factors that support advancing diversity and inclusion through global research engagement as a promising interventional approach with the potential to change the culture of STEM education for underrepresented minority students.  Efforts focused on how best to identify and advance interventional approaches with the potential to strengthen the capacity of Southern and other HBCU institutions to mitigate and where possible resolve educational disparities experienced by students from diverse underrepresented minority populations.  Collaboration among existing national higher education associations in the United States, China, Japan, South Africa, Ghana, and Kenya resulted in a catalytic proposal submission in response to NSF Solicitation 19-501: Accelerating Research through International Network-to-Network Collaborations (AccelNet) for development of the Water, Energy, and Environment (WE2) Researcher?s Network.  The goal was to promote international research collaboration, accelerate scientific discoveries, and engage students and early career researchers in international research exchange in the scientific fields related to water, energy, and the environment. Although not awarded, efforts will continue through future submissions to NSF as well as to other government and non-government agencies as WE2 partners are committed to continuing collaborative activities that explore successful linking of STEM research and academics to entrepreneurial, community, and economic growth. Participation in the WE2 proposal process allowed Southern University to elevate its contribution to global engagement ? especially in improving the disparity of underrepresented students who participate in water, energy, and environmental research which has grown in popularity and become an integral part of many STEM as well as non-STEM programs (i.e. health, social sciences, policy development, business management, etc.). WE2 is an excellent vehicle for the joint promotion of STEM education globally and to enhance the research skills of students from underrepresented groups so that they can conduct high-quality research, be better prepared, and more competitive for the global workforce.  Thus, efforts undertaken through this planning grant have resulted in a shift from relationships between individual disciplines and institutions to that of network to network collaboration toward the common goal of global sustainability. This planning grant enabled Southern University to continue its commitment to providing educational and research empowerment to our STEM faculty and students as well as those at other HBCU institutions so they can experience open access to participate in resolving global sustainability challenges that directly affect the social, economic, and entrepreneurial viability of communities in the U.S. and around the globe.
