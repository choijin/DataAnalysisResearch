<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) and Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Programs, Professor Paul Bracher from Saint Louis University and colleagues Daniel Warren and Elizabeth Hasenmueller have acquired an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES). This instrument is a necessary analytical tool used to identify and quantify metals in solutions. Consequently, it has broad use in applications such as analysis of biological solutions, water supplies and watersheds, food production and chemical reactions. The instrument is also used to train undergraduate and graduate students in this basic tool. It enables hands-on citizen-science activities such as analysis of local water supplies and is made available to other researchers beyond the St. Louis University community.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially by researchers at St. Louis university in areas such as: (a) prospective roles of inorganic cations in the origin of life, (b) the geochemistry of surface waters, shallow groundwaters, and soils, (c) ion-exchange in mineralized tissue with physiological pH regulation, (d) earth science to understand water transformations in the critical zone at the interface between water, air, soil and rock, (e) transport of sodium contamination from road salt, (f) wastewater contamination from sewer overflows using tracers, and (g) how mineralized tissues buffer perturbations to acid-base homeostasis in reptiles, amphibians and mammals.</AbstractNarration>

This instrument is the first and only ICP-OES spectrometer operational on the campus, and it supports the (i) analysis of medical/biological specimens for levels of physiological ions, (ii) detection of heavy metals and major cations in environmental samples, and (iii) rapid, simultaneous measurement of cations in complex aqueous mixtures that cannot be analyzed efficiently by atomic absorption due to signal interference. While ICP spectrometers are a fundamental piece of instrumentation at research-active universities, Saint Louis University did not previously possess or operate a single ICP instrument. &nbsp;</p> <p>The instrument has enabled groundbreaking research and led to the training of over thirty experienced users. The spectrometer enabled collaborations with the NSF-NASA Center for Chemical Evolution (headquartered at Georgia Tech in Atlanta, GA), the University of South Florida (Tampa, FL), the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, and Anoka County Parks (Minnesota). Environmental research conducted with the instrument included the measurement of salts and trace metals in stream and soil samples, which enabled several studies of the persistence of salts used for de-icing roadways.</p> <p>In a high-profile manuscript published in the journal <em>Nature Communications</em>, our team used the spectrometer to address the question of how peptides and proteins might have formed from amino acids on the early Earth. The study---a collaboration between scientists at SLU and the College of Charleston---reported in 2019 how water-absorbing deliquescent salts can assist making peptides from the simplest amino acid, glycine, during self-regulated, environmental cycling designed to mimic day and night cycles. During the day, the reaction mixtures form peptides when they evaporate to dryness at high temperatures. At night, the reactions acquire water from the atmosphere to form aqueous solutions at low temperatures, thereby rewetting without the addition of water by a rainstorm and avoiding the possibility of destructive overdilution. Seemingly minor differences, like changing the ambient humidity from 50% to 70%, can lead to profound differences in the tendency of samples to absorb water, and hence, large differences in the yields of reactions they host. And while potassium and sodium are neighbors on the periodic table with almost identical reactivities, many potassium salts are deliquescent where their sodium counterparts are not. Potassium phosphate fostered yields of peptides from glycine ten times greater than in sodium phosphate. We believe this system may provide clues relevant to solving the mystery of why all life on Earth spends so much energy enriching potassium inside cells and throwing sodium out. Deliquescent cycles may also be relevant to finding life in the polar regions of Mars, where perchlorate salts enable the existence of liquid water, even under dry, frigid conditions.</p> <p>The instrument and the research it supported were the focal point of outreach efforts led by the SLU team. High school students were provided with experience analyzing water samples from field sites in Minnesota and tap water from their houses. Public presentations at a local ecology center were made on the prevalence of road salt contamination and flood response in urban streams. The team also helped organize local outreach events discussing the origins of life.</p> <p>The instrument remains in operation, supported by the Department of Chemistry at SLU, where it continues to enable groundbreaking research and enriched laboratory instruction. In the final year of the award, 22 student and postdoctoral users were trained in the operation of the instrument and design of experiments. Training included how to operate the instrument, develop methods, and collect data to measure concentrations of various elements present in water-based samples. Additional undergraduate students (not involved in research) were exposed to the instrument in their analytical chemistry courses. The team published 4 related papers, with 5 additional manuscripts in review or preparation for imminent submission. The team delivered 33 scientific presentations related to the research conducted on the ICP instrument (including student presentations).</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 03/19/2020<br>      Modified by: Paul&nbsp;J&nbsp;Bracher</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1626501/1626501_10448982_1584619651261_OutcomesReport-Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1626501/1626501_10448982_1584619651261_OutcomesReport-Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="ICP-OES Spectrometer at Saint Louis University"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1626501/1626501_10448982_1584619651261_OutcomesReport-Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="ICP-OES Spectrometer at Saint Louis University"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Photograph of PerkinElmer Optima 8300 ICP spectrometer installed at Saint Louis University from the funding provided by this NSF MRI award.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Bracher Group, Saint Louis University</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Paul&nbsp;J&nbsp;Bracher</div> <div class="imageTitle">ICP-OES Spectrometer at Saint Louis University</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1626501/1626501_10448982_1584619729365_OutcomesReport-Figure2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1626501/1626501_10448982_1584619729365_OutcomesReport-Figure2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Synthesis of Peptides from Wet-Dry Cycling Regulated by Deliquescence"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1626501/1626501_10448982_1584619729365_OutcomesReport-Figure2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Synthesis of Peptides from Wet-Dry Cycling Regulated by Deliquescence"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Simple environmental cycling enabled by water-absorbing minerals can support the synthesis of peptides from smaller amino acid building blocks using conditions meant to mimic day-night cycles on Earth.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Bracher Group, Saint Louis University</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Paul&nbsp;J&nbsp;Bracher</div> <div class="imageTitle">Synthesis of Peptides from Wet-Dry Cycling Regulated by Deliquescence</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
