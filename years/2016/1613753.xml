<AbstractNarration>This research project concerns the modeling, analysis, and numerical exploration of deformations of mechanical and biomechanical systems, in particular highly deformable thin-surface structures and solids. These occur naturally in bio-molecular systems and also in man-made thin films and elastomers. Lipid-bilayer membranes are ubiquitous in bio-molecular systems, and the accurate modeling and prediction of their mechanical response under external stimuli is crucial for understanding the behavior of cell function and also that of liposomes, the latter of which can be used as vehicles for nutrient and drug delivery. Likewise, a fundamental understanding of the nonlinear response of highly deformable structures and materials is important, for example, in the design of sensors as well as for many other engineering applications. The research aims to provide new classes of continuum-mechanical models and novel approaches to their mathematical analysis, leading to a quantitative understanding of the behavior of such systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project centers on the modeling, computation, and analysis of highly deformable, thin elastic structures and solids. In particular, classes of problems for incompressible solids, thin elastic surfaces, two-phase lipid-bilayer vesicles, and generalized rod models will be addressed. The main goals of the work are: (i) to provide new classes of continuum-mechanics-based models, (ii) to systematically find global equilibria as loading and other parameters vary and assess their stability (local energy minima), and (iii) to identify new phenomena. Goal (ii) entails rigorous existence results as well as systematic numerical computation. In particular, the former will entail addressing new questions in both partial differential equations and the calculus of variations. Goals (i) and (ii) inform and enrich the other; goal (iii) is enabled by goals (i) and (ii). The proposed work is highly interdisciplinary, requiring tools and perspectives from several fields, including nonlinear continuum mechanics, biophysics, materials science, nonlinear elliptic partial differential equations, bifurcation theory, calculus of variations, numerical methods, and symmetry ideas.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The principal investigator and his coworkers studied several problems of nonlinear elasticity for thin structures and bulk solids, with applications to pattern formation in lipid-bilayer vesicles, wrinkling of thin structures and fracture of solids.  The main goals of the work: (1) develop accurate, mechanics-based models; (2) provide rigorous mathematical existence results for solutions; (3) uncover new phenomena.  Major accomplishments include:  A new model accounting for inelasticity in highly stretched elastomer sheets was developed and numerically implemented. The existence of classical solutions "in the large" in incompressible nonlinear elasticity was established. A complete classification for pattern selection via symmetry modes in problems with spherical symmetry, with particular application to lipid-bilayer vesicles, was constructed. The existence of weak solutions in 2nd-gradient nonlinear elasticity accounting for self-contact was established. A new and promising approach to fracture in solids based on the inverse formulation of nonlinear elasticity was uncovered.    Each class of problems studied has direct and important connections to basic science and technology.  For example, thin-membrane structures are ubiquitous in both biological and manufactured systems. The former category includes lipid-bilayer membranes, which play a crucial role in cell function.  In addition, an understanding of fracture in solids is vital for safety in engineering structures.  With the support from this grant, one student completed his PhD, six papers were published in highly respected, peer-reviewed journals, and two other manuscripts were submitted for publication.
