<AbstractNarration>This project aims to develop technology from Johns Hopkins University (JHU) to address a common and serious problem for amputees: heat and sweat build-up under their prosthetic limb. Amputees typically wear a flexible liner made of silicone or similar material over the residual limb and under their prosthesis to provide padding and improve comfort and fit. The main drawback of the liner is that it insulates the limb, creating a very warm environment leading to excess sweating. Overheating and excessive sweat often results in rashes, blistering, and the prosthesis sliding off the limb. Active amputees must regularly remove their prosthesis and liner to remove the sweat that has accumulated.  These factors can limit the motivation of amputees to exercise, thus negatively impacting rehabilitation.  The JHU technology comprises a cooling liner which replaces the current liner worn under the prosthesis.  The cooling liner has embedded tubing through which ice water is pumped to cool the limb and reduce sweat.  If successfully developed this product has the potential to significantly improve the lives of amputees, making it easier for them to use their prosthesis and to exercise, while reducing the potential for skin damage and other problems that result from excess heat and sweat under the prosthesis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Walter Reed National Military Medical Center approached JHU to develop a solution for amputees' heat and sweat problems.  This led students in JHU's Mechanical Engineering Department to create a manufacturing method to embed coolant tubes into a silicone liner, so that coolant fluid can be circulated around the limb, reducing skin temperature and sweat production.  The coolant is ice water, which is stored in a reservoir (e.g. a waist pack) which also contains the circulating pump.  This liner was found to be effective in preliminary tests on US Army Veteran amputees at Walter Reed. The initial product targets transtibial amputation, the most frequent form. There are approximately 350,000 transtibial amputees in the US who have prosthetic limbs and it is estimated that sales of the cooled prosthetic liner in this market have the potential to reach $25M/year or more at maximum penetration. Cool Stride was recently awarded $100,000 in funding from the Maryland Innovation Initiative to continue prototype development.  This team believes that the I-Corps program will allow the team to generate feedback from amputees, prosthetists, reimbursement and regulatory consultants on these, as well as yet unknown issues, regarding the proposed product.  The answers should help the team understand a) commercial potential; b) the need for minor or radical design changes; c) pricing structure; d) development and commercialization plan, and e) possible need to pivot towards a distinctly different product to solve amputee heat/sweat issues.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ CoolStride LLC is developing technology to address a common and serious problem for amputees: heat and sweat build-up under the prosthetic limb. Overheating and excessive sweat often result in rashes, blistering, and the prosthesis sliding off the limb. Active amputees must regularly take off their prosthesis and liner to remove the sweat that has accumulated.  CoolStride?s technology comprises a cooling liner which would replace the current liner worn under the prosthesis.  The cooling liner has embedded tubing through which ice water is pumped from a reservoir to cool the limb and reduce sweat.   This was an I-Corps project that focused on extensive interviews with amputees, prosthetists and others in the prosthetics business, to help understand the likely demand for CoolStride?s product in different amputee groups and to help with commercial product design. The I-Corps program also included a series of NSF-taught classes to help develop understanding of customer segments, sales channels, value propositions and other aspects of a robust business model.  We interviewed 102 amputees, prosthetists, competitors, distributors and others in the prosthetic business, then presented reports on these interviews to I-Corps. Our interview questions were designed to generate (i) market data on the prevalence and severity of heat and sweat problems in the amputee population and (ii) determine product preferences regarding the design of the ice water reservoir.   Initially we assessed the prevalence of heat and sweat issues in this population.  More than 70% of amputees reported heat and sweat problems, similar to previously published studies.  We then asked about the preferred location of the ice water reservoir and it was clear that, while many amputees would wear a waistpack or backpack, the market would be substantially larger if the reservoir were attached to the prosthesis.  We also asked the amputees with heat and sweat issues about their preferences regarding minimum cooling time and acceptable reservoir weight.  Based on these surveys, we determined a Minimum Viable Product Profile for the reservoir.  In summary, the project provided customer feedback on the design on CoolStride?s cooling prosthetic liner.  If successfully implemented and commercialized, the modified product has the potential to help amputees overcome their heat and sweat problems.
