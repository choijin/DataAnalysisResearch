<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for the conference "Frontiers in Mathematical Physics", to be held at the Centre de Recherches Mathematique at the University of Montreal  from August 28 to September 1, 2016.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference focuses on recent developments in Analysis, especially in the fields of spectral theory, quantum mechanics, and statistical mechanics.  A number of distinguished mathematicians have agreed to attend and speak at this conference. The award gives early career researchers, researchers who are members of underrepresented groups, researchers not funded by NSF a chance to attend and participate in this conference.  The organizing committee will strive to make this funding opportunity known to target groups through a number of different activities.  More information will be made available at:&lt;br/&gt;http://www.crm.umontreal.ca/2016/Simon16/index_e.php</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award was to reimburse various people for attending the conference "Frontiers in Mathematical Physics" held in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, 28 August - 1 September 2016. Everyone who was to be reimbursed by Virginia Tech has been reimbursed as of 9 February 2017.  The conference was a success, and a large number of people attended.  Concerning broader impacts:  Many young people attended.  Many women attended. There was a large international component since participants from many foreign countries attended.  Speakers included:  Tom Spencer, Abel Klein, Juerg Froelich, Fritz Gesztesy, Artur Avila, Michael Aizenman, Yosi Avron,  Percy Deift, Laslo Erdos, Rupert Frank, Martin Hairer, Svetlana Jitomirskaya, Doron Lubinsky, Robert Seiringer, H-T Yao, Israel Sigal, and Herbert Spohn.  The conference covered a very wide collection of topics in Mathematical Physics.  Other sponsors of the conference included the International Association of Mathematical Physics, the Fields Institute, Caltech, the American Institute of Physics, the American Mathematical Society, the Centre de la Recheches Mathematiques, Springer Verlag, the Cambridge University Press, and the Annals de l'Instute Henri Poincare D (of the European Mathematical Society Publishing House).  The conference was held at the University of Montreal.  The Scientific Committee for the conference included George Hagedorn, Percy Deift, Jonothan Breuer, Walter Craig, Svetlana Jitomirskaya, and  Andre Martinez-Finkelshtein.
