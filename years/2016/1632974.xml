<AbstractNarration>1632974&lt;br/&gt;Love&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the major issues facing the water and wastewater industry is aging infrastructure, some estimate that this is a one trillion dollar issue to be solved in the coming years. Flint, MI, is currently suffering from a "perfect storm" attributable to out-of-control corrosion of its potable water distribution system. In addition to concerns about lead, there are excessive disinfection by-products in the water, and, the poor bacterial quality associated with drinking water is also of concern. As one measure of protection to consumers, faucet-mounted point-of-use filters are being deployed for long-term use in the city at a scale not previously seen in the US. This project will investigate point-of-use filters for Flint water, with particular attention to the potential for changes as the water and infrastructure warm in the summer months.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Well maintained point-of-use devices will certainly remove some of the chemical water contaminants; however, the opposite is typically true for microbiological contaminants. Previously, the PIs have shown in multiple and repeated tests that point-of-use filters increase the abundance and alter the composition of microbial communities in drinking water, even when filters are used in accordance with manufacturer guidelines. The PIs work has also shown that trace levels of a surrogate unregulated disinfection by-product altered the composition of the microbial community in the effluent of a point-of-use filter, suggesting that contaminants in the drinking water coupled with use of a point-of-use device alters the microbial risk a consumer is exposed to. In the case of Flint, it is not known how recovery of the distribution system and premise plumbing from the corrosion period will impact the microbial water quality applied to the point-of-use filters, and how influent changes will, in turn, influence the microbial quality of the water produced by the filter. Furthermore, it is unreasonable to think that a single point-of-use device on a faucet is sufficient, given that it does not achieve the conventional drinking water treatment paradigm that is to use multiple treatment barriers to protect public health from multiple contaminants. The PIs have extensive experience interrogating point-of-use filters like those used in Flint for changes in water quality, microbial abundance and composition using a range of current methods and can mobilize quickly. The PIs propose to complete a sampling campaign of faucet mounted point-of-use filters in Flint, Michigan over the spring, summer and fall 2016 to evaluate changes in the microbiological quality of point-of-use-treated water. The analyses will include culture-based and culture-independent methods to determine microbial community composition, specific species and/or genes that can impact public health. It is hypothesized that there will be higher levels of microbial growth across the system during the summertime. Previous studies showed significantly elevated levels of Mycobacterium, a family of bacteria known to include opportunistic pathogens, in the filter housing and moderate yet significant increases in the filter effluent. The importance of point-of-use filters in mitigating the chemical contaminants of concern is acknowledged, but a balance is needed to achieve acceptable microbiological water quality. Given the unknown consequences of the corrosion damage of Flints drinking water pipes on the microbial quality and disinfectant residuals in the distributed water, it is important to evaluate the microbiological quality of point-of-use filters in order to establish good monitoring and filter maintenance practices to assist in setting a point-of-use filter maintenance strategy for Flint, which is a major outcome of our proposed effort. This is particularly important to engage in immediately and through the rest of this year since the use of filters is expected to continue for several months.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this RAPID grant was to evaluate the microbiological quality of water applied to and produced by point-of-use (PoU) filters deployed in Flint, Michigan and to recommend best practices for reducing microbial counts leaving filters for users who choose to do so.  From July 6, 2016 through October 28, 2016, we performed 32 sampling events representing 17 homes where most homes were resampled 2 to 4 weeks after their initial sampling.  Each sampling event involved collecting 3 L of water going into the kitchen PoU filter (after 1L was collected for chemical analysis by a collaborating RAPID grant), 3 L first flush leaving the filter, 3 L water leaving filter after 5 minutes flushing, and the PoU filter.  Once back in the lab, water samples were processed for heterotrophic plate counts (HPC) and DNA extraction for biomolecular analyses.  Furthermore, PoU filters were disassembled and three samples were collected from them: the outer fabric, biomass attached to the outer activated carbon block via sonication, and biofilms on the inner channel.  The DNA was used to perform whole community analysis via 16S rDNA Illumina sequencing for the first 12 sampling events conducted in July 2016.  Additional biomolecular analysis via quantitative PCR and screening for various pathogens were performed in response to a Shigella outbreak that occurred summer 2016, and to corroborate preliminary evidence of a build-up of enteric bacteria across some filters.  Furthermore, 3 additional sampling events were performed on March 24, 2017 in response to resident concerns about microbial contamination in drinking water; those analyses are underway and will be included in the final report.       The HPC data corroborated prior studies by our team and others, showing a significant increase in HPC counts across the filters in 79% of homes.  Across all sample events, the median HPC count increased approximately 10 times across the PoU filters.  Furthermore, analysis of microbial communities across all points monitored along the PoU filters shows that the bacterial taxa present change across the filter.  Therefore, use of a PoU filter in one?s home changes the microbiological quality of the water.  Furthermore, our results show that changes are unique from home to home among those houses we sampled.  Of interest to residents is how PoU filters impact their exposure to potentially harmful bacteria, and we will report fully on our findings associated with targeted bacteria in the final report.      Manufacturers recommend that PoU users flush filters for approximately 5 seconds prior to first use after filters have sat unused for at least a few hours.  We conducted a flush study to evaluate how flushing affects microbial water quality over almost 3 months and recommend a slightly longer flushing time (15 seconds).  Our results also show that the bacterial count consistently increases over time. Therefore, it is important to replace PoU cartridges according to manufacturer recommendations.        Results from sample events conducted in 2016 were mailed or hand delivered to all residents in writing by Thanksgiving 2016, and preliminary results from sample events in March 2017 were verbally reported to residents in April 2017 and final results will be provided in writing to those residents as soon as they are available. Depersonalized results across all monitored homes were shared with residents at a town hall meeting in December 2016, and final results will be compiled in a report that will be sent to all residents as soon as they are compiled and available.  Furthermore, depersonalized results available to date have been shared with public health officials associated with the City of Flint, Genesee County, the State of Michigan, a Physicians group in Genesee County, and the Environmental Protection Agency.
