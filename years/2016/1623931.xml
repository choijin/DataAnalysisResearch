<AbstractNarration>This "End to End Trust and Security Workshop for the Internet of Things" is a workshop jointly sponsored by the IEEE, Internet2 and the National Science Foundation. The workshop brings together researchers, academics, government agencies, and standards bodies for a series of panels, presentations and breakout discussions around the unsolved research and operational challenges in developing a security framework for the Internet of Things (IoT). Participants in the workshop, being held at George Washington University in Washington, DC, will range from postdoctoral fellows, graduate students, IT architects, researchers, security professionals, industry leaders and government employees. This grant provides travel support for researchers and graduate students who otherwise would not have the ability to attend the workshop.</AbstractNarration>

Participants included researchers, students, IT architects, security professionals, industry leaders and government employees. The workshop focused on challenges and solutions involved with End-to-End trust and security for an open IoT architectural framework, addressing key TIPPSS elements: Trust, Identity, Privacy, Protection, Safety and Security.&nbsp; It was part of Internet2&rsquo;s larger program to foster collaborative innovation in several key areas, including IoT and End-to-end Trust and Security. The event enabled discussion of potential technology solutions, policy implications, best practices and gaps related to the challenges in End-to-End trust and security for IoT.</p> <p>Prior to this workshop, activities had been held at campus, industry-specific, domain-specific, and technology or device levels addressing ways to enhance trust and security on intra- and inter-campus and organizational levels, as well as isolated discipline-specific inquiries into the Internet of Things. There had been few opportunities to link together these isolated activities, or convene people active in these investigations, thereby limiting any impact or possibility of translating a model from one discipline or setting to another or across the broader IoT solutions ecosystem.&nbsp; The workshop provided this opportunity, while building upon existing momentum and enabling translation of findings into community practice for a variety of settings and disciplines. The workshop agenda included discussion on: Needs and Challenges in End-to-End Trust, Security, and Privacy for the IoT; E2E Trust and Security Using ISO/IEC/IEEE P21451-1-4 (Sensei-IOT) 1st Semantic Web 3.0 Standard for the Internet of Things (IOT); Industrial Internet Reference Architecture; Network End-to-End Data Link Evaluation System (Needles); Outcomes of the 2015 Internet of Things Security and Privacy Keynote Workshop; The Internet of Things: An Overview: Understanding the Issue and Challenges of a More Connected World; IOT and the Ability to Defend Against the Silent Intruder; and Wi-Fi Privacy Experiments at IEEE 802 &amp; IETF meetings. It also included breakout groups addressing Access Control and Identity Management, Architectural Framework, Policy and Standards, and Scenarios and Use Cases.</p> <p>The meeting included 181 attendees representing 153 institutions from 7 countries (United States, Canada, China, India, Mexico, Sri Lanka, and Singapore) including 54 universities, 16 government agencies, 74 corporations, plus 9 professional organizations and national research and education networks. The workshop resulted in the following insights: 1) Policy moves slowly and in response to interest groups and positions while products are being created more and more quickly; 2) Developers need to know they have responsibility for privacy, security, and trust; 3) Different industries need to work toward common goals within different regulatory frameworks and with different governmental bodies; 4) Makers have to be educated as to privacy/security needs without impeding innovation; 5) We need to explore how security, privacy, and IoT ethics can be built into systems and developer tools and education; and 6) Technologists need to lead creation of definitions while reflecting local cultures and legal systems. By leveraging Internet2&rsquo;s successful, long-term track record of coordinating meetings for and by the community, the results of the workshop can inform ongoing government-funded research initiatives by NSF and other agencies in multiple disciplines. By convening members of the community for this interactive opportunity and benefiting from incremental interaction with IEEE members that this workshop allowed, this gathering continued the momentum of Internet2&rsquo;s Internet of Things and End to End Trust and Security innovation initiatives, thereby increasing its likelihood of enhancing the work of current and future NSF-funded researchers in multiple disciplines in multiple campuses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 03/07/2017<br>      Modified by: Florence&nbsp;Hudson</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
