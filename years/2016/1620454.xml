<AbstractNarration>Symmetry reduces large complex systems to manageable quantities of information. Identifying those symmetries and understanding their structure helps to solve a wide range of problems, from improving engineering tasks to disrupting the mechanisms of disease. The century-old problem of deciding whether two sets of symmetries have the same structure is known today as the Group Isomorphism Problem. This problem is fundamental to both computational algebra and computational complexity, and has implications for fields as diverse as material science, particle physics, and chemistry. The primary goal of this project is to develop significantly better approaches to testing isomorphism of finite groups of symmetries. It supports a new multidisciplinary collaboration between researchers at four universities, including students and early-career mathematicians and computer scientists. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The Group Isomorphism Problem asks for an algorithm to decide whether two finite groups are equivalent. Both the problem itself, and the techniques designed to improve upon it, have implications for other computational problems, including the better-known problems of Graph Isomorphism and P versus NP.  Our team's approach goes beyond existing static recursions such as working sequentially down a derived or lower central series. Using a new dynamic strategy we prioritize the optimal stages of the problem, thereby improving the performance of later stages. To achieve this we are investigating the use of nonassociative rings, spectral sequences, modular representation theory, and p-local cohomology. We are also inspecting recently developed data structures in computational algebra that seem well-suited to our approach, as well as investigating applications to geometric complexity theory.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Properties of an environment are studied through measurement resulting in data that blends scientific information with unwanted aspects of our measuring equipment and procedures.  For example, a color photograph broken into pixels in Red-Blue-Green could just as accurately use Cyan-Yellow-Magenta but the data for these pixels is clearly influenced by whatever choice is made.  Isomorphism concerns comparing data in a manner that looks past the effects of a selected frame for reference in measurements.  Isomorphism collapses the data to the information we really need to make informed decisions.  Comparisons in this way are the starting points of classifying information, removing duplicates, and identifying influential features in data.    This research concerns detecting isomorphisms that are unknown between data.  For data that can be modeled as tables of numbers, the data may be treated as multiplication tables creating new algebras which may then be inspected for equivalence using many centuries worth of research into the mathematics of algebra.  We shall call this simply "algebraic data" despite its origin in more general contexts.   Our study uncovered new ways to condense the information in algebraic tables to ones often exponentially smaller. Thus, the work of comparison is considerably reduced.  This further evolved into to the emergence of a cellular structure where algebraic data can be modeled as a skeletal framework with "bubbles" in data that can be condensed locally even if the whole cannot be condensed.  These results are still developing and will comprise future study as well.   Alongside the exponential breakthroughs just reported we also developed a number of heuristic and practical approaches to discern qualitative differences in data, I.e. differences that signal the data are unequal even after potential changes in reference frames.  We further developed initial analysis as to the theoretical limits of heuristic methods.  In one study we proved that for dense set of input sizes of algebraic data, isomorphism can be decided exponentially faster by a combination of techniques.  This demonstrates for the first time that these concepts can be used at scale in the near future.   All of our algorithms and prototypes have been shared publicly as open source software and robust elements have been integrated into leading computer algebra systems to give researchers direct access to testing and improving the methods.
