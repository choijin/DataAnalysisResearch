<AbstractNarration>This award supports a new Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site at the Rochester Institute of Technology.  The first observations of gravitational waves by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) have opened up the dawn of the gravitational wave astronomy age. Soon, we will see the birth of multimessenger astronomy, as gravitational wave and electromagnetic observations are combined with theoretical models to give us new insights into astrophysical phenomena that were previously unavailable to science. A key step in moving this project forward will be the training of students that will form the next generation of scientific leaders. This REU site, dedicated to the study of multimessenger astrophysics, will help groom the next generation of scientists in the many and diverse skills that will allow them to pursue careers in this growing field as well as many others.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students in the REU program will learn about and perform research on topics spanning gravitational wave detection and data analysis, observational astronomy and astrophysics, visualization of scientific data, and theoretical and numerical modeling. Working in pairs, each supervised by a committed research mentor, students will spend ten weeks performing research and participating in a wide array of professional and scientific enrichment activities that include developing presentation skills, acquiring familiarity with academic literature, and learning to access and use workstations and supercomputers to perform numerical simulations. In addition, the site will have a particular focus on deaf and hard of hearing students, and will offer all of the REU students the chance to learn American Sign Language through a specialized "bootcamp", building community between hearing and deaf students in the program.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Our Research Experiences for Undergraduates program in Multimessenger Astrophysics admitted three cohorts of 8 students each in the summers from 2017 through 2019. Our participants were introduced to the newly developing field of multimessenger astrophysics, which combines traditional electromagnetic astronomy, computational modeling and theoretical studies, and the newest developments in gravitational wave astrophysics.   We provided our participants with computer skills training in modern day computer languages and introduced them to cutting-edge supercomputing facilities, including winning time on XSede facilities via collaboratively written startup allocations. Our students all participated in annual RIT REU-wide workshops on opportunities in graduate school, organized and co- hosted by all theREUs on campus, which also included participation by other summer undergraduate research projects including the Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation.  All students presented their work each year at RIT's annual Summer Undergraduate Research Symposium, and several presented talks and posters at various local and national meetings as well.  Four published papers have appeared with REU participants as authors to date, with additional works still in preparation. Our program served to broaden participation within the astrophysics community, particularly for deaf/hard-of-hearing students as well as those attending community colleges.  To encourage closer connections between hearing students and deaf and hard-of-hearing students, we provided training for all students in American Sign Language (ASL). Through a variety of shared experiences, our students were able to interact in a much broader way than would have been possible if a language barrier was in place. Via a workshop led by faculty members in RIT's ADVANCE project entitled "Creating vibrant STEM learning environments", which included a big-picture overview on the state of inclusion within STEM fields, in particular the representation of women and minorities, our 2019 cohort reported that they felt empowered to go back to their local communities and start taking more active steps to encourage diversity and inclusion at their home institutions.
