<AbstractNarration>Nearly every research field and industry sector is struggling with managing and extracting useful information from massive data sets, that are commonly referred to as Big Data. Modeling, data management, and analytics are key elements in understanding and using these data sets, and their importance in academia and industry is predicted to grow exponentially. One central challenge can be expressed as follows: Given specific analysis tasks and specific constraints on the available Big Data, how do we enable productive, efficient, and secure end-to-end value extraction from the data? To address this challenge, we propose to join industry members with participating academic centers in a new site of the existing Center for Hybrid Multicore Productivity Research (CHMPR) I/UCRC, at NC State University (NCSU) in Raleigh, NC, with the goal of conducting trans-disciplinary translational science and research of enabling better decision making in presence of Big Data. The fundamental research done at CHMPR/NCSU will be translated into technology developments, delivering practical solutions to hard problems. This translation will apply to federal agencies, government organizations, and industry sectors struggling with hard Big-Data problems, thus contributing to the progress of science and advancing the future Big-Data needs of the industry and society. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Success in solving the problem of extracting value from massive data hinges on balancing fundamental research, technological know-how, and commercial market intelligence. We propose both to address recognized aspects of this problem and to develop the science and training that will address future aspects of this problem. The CHMPR/NCSU effort toward end-to-end enablement of data will focus on developing technologies and tools for bridging the time gap between the acquisition of data and real-time and long-term decision making. CHMPR/NCSU research projects will be addressing the issue of what are appropriate technologies for: storing and cleaning the data; modeling the data; making the data secure; asking the right analysis questions; pre- and post-processing the data with regard to the analysis; and, finally, making the analysis results useful. The resulting techniques will be applicable across multiple industry sectors, including national security, health care, manufacturing, energy, and business intelligence. The research being done at NCSU will contribute to the computationally intensive analytics-research program of CHMPR, while complementing its portfolio by the NCSU big-data transformation and analysis expertise. The technologies and tools resulting from the proposed work will change the results that can be obtained from the data, as opposed to just obtaining the results faster. The ultimate success of this paradigm shift by the Big-Data-analysis industry will rest on the ability of universities such as NCSU to prepare experts in taking advantage of the data-enablement science and technologies to solve a variety of real-life applications.</AbstractNarration>

Twice a year, CHMPR conducted an IAB meeting for board members, partners, supporters and members of CHMPR for project updates, status updates, new proposals and presentations of current and future research plans.  Some major applications during CHMPR Phase 2 are listed below.  Developed a genomic based phenotype classification of type II diabetes for a prototype clinical decision support system using 1 TB of NIH hospital data records authorized for use by UMBC in this project. Presented first use of social media data integrated into the NOAA operational oil spill model as a Human Sensor Observing Network for improving predictions of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill reaching the Gulf States. Animated results were presented using virtual world rendering technology for general public. Scalable Binary Image Segmentation using Quantum Markov Random Field. We developed a quantum annealing algorithm which performs medical image segmentation that can be used for classification and edge detection in the broader area of Markovian Random Field (MRF). Developed a Hybrid Task Graph Scheduling API in collaboration with NIST that has been loaded on GitHub along with tutorials to train users. Implemented a Semantic web interface for machine negotiation and validation of cloud acquired resources. Developed an in-memory very large sparse matrix eigen value eigen vector routine for the Hadoop ecosystem. Permissioned Blockchains for Food Safety. This project is a novel academic complement for food safety. Our objective was to develop a novel blockchain based approach that uniquely solves the core challenges in food safety recall and auditing procedures. The blockchain project was to develop a secure, fault tolerant, and scalable blockchain system to largely increase the efficiency and effectiveness of food recall and food auditing procedures. We implemented a parallel sorting benchmark for EMU Chick PIM system and evaluated system performance We implemented a Deep Neural Net model for the segmentation of NIST generated stem cell images on the IBM Minsky computer system at UMBC. We successfully tested the application of a probabilistic pixel classifier on high resolution large stem cell dataset. We built narratives on large-scale social media data based on an ''anchor topic'' of interest, estimate sentiment on the text within the narrative, then present the social media posts and related narratives using an interactive, web-based text visualization system that represents posts, sentiment, narratives, and other text properties using a suite of text visualization techniques.   We developed a representation over blockchain of a data owner’s consent regarding access to their data along with reasoning algorithms to compute sharing decisions compatible with that consent.   Our researchers have presented research results at rated IEEE and AGU conferences, Supercomputing conferences, journal publications, and workshops conducted in collaboration with IUCRC members.
