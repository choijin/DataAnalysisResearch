<AbstractNarration>This is a collaborative project involving Carroll Community College (Award DUE-1600748) and Howard Community College (Award DUE-1600754) in Maryland, and it builds on a previous Advanced Technological Education (ATE) project (Award DUE-0802311) at Lone Star College-Montgomery in Texas. Audio Visual Systems (AVS) specialists are needed to support the specialized communication and presentation needs of businesses and other organizations. AVS specialists are employed in universities, K-12 schools, scientific research centers, conference centers, hotels, theaters, and other venues that have integrated, high-tech communication systems. These technicians require advanced training in industry-specific technologies that support a multitude of presentation venues, which in turn support educational, conference, corporate, entertainment, and other events. The two collaborating colleges will jointly create an innovative AVS program to prepare students for this growing, interdisciplinary field, in which the technology continues to advance and to require deeper knowledge of concepts in science, mathematics, and engineering. The new program will provide a pathway for students, offering certificates, an associate degree, and the option of transferring to a four-year program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The AAS degree program in Audio Visual Technology Systems (AVTS) will partner with local businesses and other organizations to offer on-the-job training, as well as potential post-graduation employment. Students will receive hands-on instruction in the application of electrical, lighting, and acoustical theories and designs. The program will be led by faculty who have substantial industry experience. Specific objectives of the project are to develop courses and curricula; recruit students into certificate and degree programs; develop and strengthen industry relationships; ensure smooth transitions for students from high schools to the two-year program, and from the two-year program to four-year programs; and disseminate the curriculum and other resources to other community colleges.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project was to design and implement a new technology degree and certificate program in order to train future event technicians.  The original creators of this program (while working with industry professionals) noticed a need for innovative education of audiovisual specialists and thus created the new Entertainment Technology program.   The main outcome of this project then was making sure we had a degree and certificate program that aligned with industry standards as well as the standards of MHEC (Maryland Higher Education Commission.)  MHEC did officially approve of our program and those we have worked with in the industry have acknowledged and approved of our training.  The following is our most updated, Academic Council approved, Program Description and Program Goals:  The purpose of the AAS degree in Entertainment Technology is to prepare students to work as audiovisual specialists and event technicians in a variety of presenting venues such as conference centers, hotels, theaters, houses of worship, sports arenas, resorts, and more!  Student?s multimedia communication skills will strengthen through specialized courses, practicums, and co-ops using industry-specific technology both on campus and in the field.  The small student-to-faculty ratio (usually under 15-1) provides students more opportunities for hands-on learning with quality instruction from industry professionals.  Program Goals:   Identify types and purposes of audio, lighting, video, and set construction equipment used for live events. Use industry standard audio, lighting, video, and stet construction equipment for live events. Apply electrical, lighting, and acoustical theories and designs pertaining to live events. Engage in technician best practices that support live events through hands-on experience.   We felt it was important to cover the basics in house (or on campus) but also provide opportunities in the field so students were better prepared to enter the workforce.  Below is a list of our required courses for the degree and certificate programs. (Degree seeking students also take several general education credits)  ENTEC-101:  Introduction to Entertainment Technology ENTEC-105:  Entertainment Technology Lighting ENTEC-106:  Entertainment Technology Audio ENTEC-107:  Entertainment Technology Video      ENTEC-220:  Entertainment Technology Cooperative Education 1 ENTEC-221:  Entertainment Technology Cooperative Education 2 ENTEC-222:  Entertainment Technology Cooperative Education 3 ENTEC-230:  Entertainment Technology Capstone Project   Each of our ENTEC Cooperative Education courses place the student in a new work environment.
