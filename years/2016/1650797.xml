<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to understand product application opportunities in the evolving textile electronics industry. Textile electronics is a field which requires that new technologies adoption meets the stringent cost and comfort requirements of the textiles industry, while maintaining the rigid device performance metrics of the electronics industry.  The opportunity exists through this I-Corps project to understand the tradeoffs between a transformative process technology with the ability to form cost effective, customized textile electronics products in fitness/wellness, health/medical, industrial/military, and fashion/infotainment markets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project will explore the market potential for a transformative electronic interconnect technology applicable to the fabrication of low-cost garment-based wearable devices.  The technology focused upon in this work allows for the ability to retro-fit garments with electronics by simple heat iron-on strategy, similar to placement of a heat laminated tag or manufacturer logo.  This technology is an alternative to conductive yarn and bulky wires used currently in textile electronics, materials which limit scale-up of wearables to small quantities and results in a bulky garment that is uncomfortable to the wearer.  This iron-on technology allows for the ability to connect multiple devices on a garment in a low cost, customizable way and enables a strategic expansion of the textile electronics product landscape. This I-Corps project seeks to understand the opportunities for the technology through a voice-of-customer analysis of the key stakeholders in the textile electronics industry.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This I-Corps project examined the commerical business case for a biometric monitoring garment through 100+ interviews with potential users and the supply chain related to the garment production. The project explored value propositions related to athletic training, employee safety and training, incentive programs for health insurance, and patient care.  Through the program, we determined a suitable business case for the use of biometric garments in law enforcement training for determination and reactions to stressful situations.  A key challenge that was identified was the costing of the garment, which is dictated by the manufacturing strategies.  A key result was a re-focus on the academic research by the PhD student involved in this project to define new automoated practices in the electronics integration in garments. As a result, the student  launched a startup company (in early 2018) and has recieved SBIR funding.   An additional key outcome of this project was the use of the customer discovery strategies in coursework of the PI at NC State University.   Specifically, principles of the buisness model canvas were applied into a graduate product development course in the 2017 and 2018 academic years, as well as a undergraduate engineering capstone course during the 2018 academic year.   Both of these courses interface students with the textile industry for the formation of new products.  The business model canvas and the cusomter discovery assisted in the engineering design process to identify product criteria and applicability in textile market spaces.
