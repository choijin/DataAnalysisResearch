<AbstractNarration>Academic and practitioner communities have few opportunities to engage directly. The purpose of this workshop is to increase practitioner awareness of relevant scholarship to better inform policy, influence program design and refine evaluation practices, and engage researchers and practitioners in a dialogue to help influence the design of new research questions and methodologies.  Held in concert with the State Science and Technology Institute(SSTI)'s 2016 Annual Conference, a gathering of more than 300 federal, state, local and private-sector technology based economic development practitioners this workshop provides a unique opportunity to cross-fertilize the interests and needs of practitioners who make policies and develop programs supporting capital access, entrepreneurial assistance, industry/university partnerships and cluster development with SciSIP researchers. The objective of this workshop is to learn each other's perspectives in order to develop new directions and datasets for future research and to better inform policy and practice.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award facilitated a series of events at SSTI?s 2016 Annual Conference focused on connecting academic researchers with innovation policymakers and practitioners. Specifically, NSF?s funding enabled SSTI to provide stipends to six faculty and 10 graduate students with specific interests in the science of science and innovation policy (SciSIP) who participated with a broader audience of more than 300 professionals at federal, state and local government offices, independent nonprofit organizations, institutions of higher education, and other entities. Over the course of the conference, SSTI held an opening colloquium for academics to exchange their research agendas, four breakout sessions on innovation policy issues with academics and practitioners as co-panelists, and a closing workshop for all interested audiences to discuss how research can better inform policy and how real world needs can better inform research.  While the conference achieved the short-term objective of bringing these audiences together at the conference, the long-term purpose of forging these connections is to have a lasting influence on the quality and impact of SciSIP research and the efficacy of innovation policy. Because of connections made in the development of the conference, SSTI has been able to connect policymakers in three states with specific policy questions to academic research regarding the effects of innovation programs.  More broadly, a large portion of the conference?s researcher participants stated that the exchanges would have an impact on their future research. One student said that because of the conference, "I will not only restrict my research to the federal scope, since I can analyze how evaluations can occur locally." Another student, inspired by a speaker?s call for practitioner?s to consider innovation more broadly, said, "I am now planning to look more closely at which industries states identify in their S&amp;T policies." A third stated, "Knowing more about regional development programs, aka sources of funding, will be very useful [for my] going forward in academia with a focus on entrepreneurship."  This clear influence of practitioner?s needs and interests on burgeoning SciSIP researchers was one of SSTI?s objectives for the conference. We look forward to continuing these interactions to further develop research agendas that can speak directly to innovation policy in the future.
