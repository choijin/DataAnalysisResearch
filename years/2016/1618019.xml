<AbstractNarration>This project for Wearable Authentication Solutions for Ubiquitous and Personal Touch-Enabled Devices (WASUP) studies and designs models and techniques to identify, authenticate, and audit touches on touch-sensing devices using a small wearable token. The token, such as a bracelet or ring, embeds a security code in the capacitive touch signature of a user, which is detected with the existing capacitive sensors used in many touch screens. This offers a number of distinct and desirable properties. First, the code is clearly associated with a touch, even if multiple potential users are nearby. Second, one can expect attacks on the communication channel to be more difficult to execute, since virtually no over-the-air signal propagation is involved. Owing to these unique security properties, this project supports a broad range of applications with significant societal impact. For example, a security token based on this proposed technology could lead to authentication solutions that progressively or continuously authorize users and are more robust than current techniques such as PIN codes, Bluetooth, and Near Field Communications (NFC). The underlying primitives of WASUP could also allow unobservable and direct contact communication, for example in tactical scenarios, when the detection of communication can compromise mission security. Given the significantly growing use of capacitive-touch interaction, there exists great potential for widespread applications of these techniques. The WASUP project will also include a variety of exciting and appealing educational activities involving K-12 and undergraduate students, such as developing applications that make use of WASUP through research internship programs. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The team will first model the generation, propagation, and detection of capacitive touch communication signals and explore relevant design trade-offs. The expected outcomes include the environment model, through-body signal propagation model, and touch propagation time model, which will provide the foundational understandings of the capabilities and limitations of capacitive touch communication channel. Informed by these models, the team will investigate design alternatives of the hardware transmitter and the corresponding receiver software in order to achieve the data rates necessary for many real-world authentication and identification scenarios. In the third thrust, the researchers propose to design, analyze, implement, and evaluate WASUP-based security devices and protocols for compelling and practical use cases. The team plans to bootstrap the WASUP ecosystem by demonstrating practical wearable hardware tokens with sample applications on current off-the-shelf devices.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The objective of this project was to study and design techniques to identify, authenticate, or audit every user touch on a touch-sensing device. As groups of users rapidly switch among such touch enabled IoT devices, existing methods for authentication with devices become increasingly cumbersome and imprecise. This project therefore pursued the vision of a small wearable device such as a ring/glove/token that can embed identification, authorization, or authentication codes in the capacitive touch signature sensed by devices that the user touches.  One outcome of this project is a model and better understanding of how to limit the eavesdropping range through capacitive signals around the human hand. Specifically, the project developed a circuit model to characterize the capacitive communication channel based on our measurements and used this to identify an electrode configuration that reduces signal paths through other conductors in the environment and therefore better confines the signal to the human body.  A second outcome is that the project demonstrated the feasibility of designing authentication tokens using this channel that significantly better confines transmission of the code to the human hand than existing non-capacitive communication techniques. The project demonstrated wearable token prototypes with different form factors (ring and wristband) and several receiver prototypes that can be embedded in the touch devices (say, phones or smart buttons). It also verified the ability to reliably deliver an identification code during a touch duration at low power consumption.  An additional outcome is the development of micro-finger gesture sensing techniques based on this understanding of capacitive signals around the human hand. Such gestures can find application in interacting with a head-mounted device (HMD). Head-mounted devices for Augmented Reality (AR) can support a growing number of applications in the areas of image guided therapy, computer aided design, cargo packing, manufacturing and digital field service. Micro-finger gestures also have applicability in gesture-based authentication solutions.  Overall, the project experiments and data analysis were conducted by students and provided them with important research mentoring and experience.
