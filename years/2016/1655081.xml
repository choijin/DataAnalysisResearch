<AbstractNarration>Although high-value innovations offer the potential to increase economic growth and sustainability in the United States and beyond, recent years have shown disappointing numbers in the transformation of research and development (R&amp;D) into legitimate commercially viable products and value to society. Even in established companies, 80% of new products and innovations fail within one year. Numerous company studies show that less than 20% of their most important R&amp;D initiatives could bring value for the enterprise.  More realistically, only 2-5% could provide significant value. This high failure rate can be attributed to a deficit in the following: (1) customer and market focus; (2) innovation and value-creation skills; and (3) use of effective value-creation processes. This project hypothesizes that an emphasis on the skills and processes employed during the initial stages of the innovation process is necessary to create successful and sustainable R&amp;D innovations. By improving the initial stages of the innovation process, contributions to the science, engineering, and education ecosystems can be expected to increase, and thereby, positively impact the quality and sustainability of both R&amp;D and societal value of the products so created. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Addressing the aforementioned challenges facing today's R&amp;D innovators, and acknowledging the value of intensive collaboration, the project team will host two Value-Creation Playbook workshops for the NSF Division of Engineering Education and Centers (EEC), specifically its Engineering Research Center (ERC) Program. The Value-Creation Playbook is an immersive, hands-on program that satisfies the fundamental requirements for success in innovation. The design of the workshop is based on the principle that in order to innovate effectively, professionals must (1) have shared value-creation concepts and language; (2) develop fundamental frameworks for collecting essential knowledge; and (3) be able to rapidly create new value using best learning practices, such as continuous, unrelenting team iteration. Workshop delivery focuses not only on increase in participants' knowledge and awareness, but also on long-term sustainable impact on participants' attitudes and behaviors. It is expected that, as a result of these workshops, ERC teams will (1) clarify their projects' goals, objectives, and milestones; (2) strengthen their R&amp;D and commercialization efforts; (3) better understand the core language, skills, and intellectual frameworks required for efficient value creation, with an emphasis on aggressive iteration and collaboration; and (4) be able to better align their team's direction and purpose, both individually and with the overall NSF ERC program. It is intended that these processes and skills will be employed continuously by NSF ERC teams as they move forward with their program initiatives, and their individual careers in the engineering ecosystem.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Innovation-for-Impact: A Value-creation Program to Improve   the Impact of NSF?s R&amp;D and Commercialization Initiatives  The National Science Foundation (NSF) is one of the most important innovation-funding agencies in the US.  High-value innovations represent a path for growth, prosperity, meaningful jobs, social responsibility, environmental sustainability, and national security. NSF has taken a leadership role in developing new initiatives for improving research and development (R&amp;D) and innovative outcomes, like with Innovation Corps Program (I-Corps?), educating the next generation of researchers, engineers, and innovators. For R&amp;D, engineering, and innovation programs, the best results can only be achieved by leveraging the genius of teams.  Today, though most university researchers communicate with each other in some sense, they do not aggressively collaborate and brainstorm with each other.  In the global innovation economy, radical collaboration is essential.  It is not possible to efficiently maximize R&amp;D and commercialization results alone; intense and rapid iteration with partners is essential.   To address this challenge, NSF funded a project to create a Value-Creation Playbook and associated workshops for the NSF Division of Engineering Education and Centers (EEC), specifically its Engineering Research Center (ERC) Program. The Value-Creation Playbook is an immersive, hands-on program that satisfies the fundamental requirements for success in innovation. The design of the Value-Creation Playbook workshop is based on the principle that in order to innovate effectively, professionals must (a) have shared value-creation concepts and language, (b) develop fundamental frameworks for collecting essential knowledge, and (c) be able to rapidly create new value using best learning practices, such as continuous, unrelenting team iteration.  As a result of participating in the Value-Creation Playbook workshops, it is expected that the ERC teams will be better prepared to clarify their projects? goals, objectives, and milestones.  Their R&amp;D and commercialization efforts will both be strengthened and teams will be better aligned. An electronic version of the Value-Creation Playbook is attached as an image.    With funding from NSF, American Society for Engineering Education, utilizing a mini-Delphi panel process, conducted an evaluation of the Value-Creation Playbook based workshop to learn:  How well does the Value-Creation Playbook and Workshop fit with the ERC ecosystem?  Is Value-Creation Workshop needed to infuse the goals of collaboration and innovation?  What is the value created by such Workshop?  Can the value of the Workshop be achieved through how it is currently designed?   Highlights of the panelists? discussion resulted in findings such as:  Panelists thought a workshop was a good idea and the workshop had potential, but the workshop needed changes to better align with ERC culture. Panel members thought that cultivating a culture of aligning research with ?customer needs? at ERCs would be beneficial. But, a caution from one of the panelists ? not all research conducted by ERCs fits the customer discovery model. A culture of customer discovery is relevant and beneficial to use ? inspired based research- ?Pasteur?s Quadrant?, but could be detrimental to pure basic research ? ?Bohr?s Quadrant?. It is important to note the difference. The workshop in its current form is not a good fit for ERC culture.  The workshop was written for corporations to align the development of products with customer needs.  ERCs do not have customers the way companies do, and the language in the workshop as well as examples provided during the workshop would need to change to fit the ERC context.  Some panel members questioned if a two-day workshop could change the way ERC researchers go about their research, or, in other words, change the culture at ERCs.  The National Science Foundation could use ?additional levers? that would complement a workshop with additional activities to change the culture at ERCs.  For example, the NSF could require a description of efforts to conduct customer discovery for research in new RFPs and also request evidence of customer discovery for research during evaluations of ERCs; NSF could sponsor a series of workshops.   Overall, the panelists agreed that a workshop on this topic will be good for ERCs, but it needed to reflect and focus on the academic culture and environment.
