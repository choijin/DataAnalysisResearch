<AbstractNarration>R/V Neil Armstrong is one of two new ships built by the Office of Naval Research for the Academic Research Fleet (ARF).  In CY 2016 the ship will transition from construction to sea-going operations.   The proposed operations will provide access for over 4&lt;br/&gt;NSF Principal Investigators (PIs), including OOI, to conduct multiple research sea voyages throughout the year. 57% of the 207 days scheduled will support NSF programs. ONR will also support PIs this year to make up the 43% of the 207 days. After the Science Mission Equipment is installed during Phase III shipyard, Armstrong will conduct a series of shakedown and Science Verification Cruises (SVCs) to check out the ship and equipment. In April 2016 Armstrong is scheduled for both INSURV and NSF Inspection to assess readiness for options as a UNOLS vessel.&lt;br/&gt;If successful, Armstrong will conduct funded science voyages for OOI at the Pioneer site. Armstrong will transition to OOI work in the Irminger Sea in July 2016 followed by an NSF sponsored OSNAP Voyage in August. Armstrong will finish the year with additional OOI voyages at the Pioneer site and a dry-dock availability before January 2017. That yard availability will mark the end of the warranty period.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit :&lt;br/&gt;These peer-reviewed projects supported by operations on R/V Armstrong in 2016 have been rigorously evaluated for scientific and intellectual merit as an integral part of the NSF grant review and award process. The competitive nature of the award granting process ensures a very high level of intellectual merit. Knowledge gained and the discoveries made by the research programs&lt;br/&gt;supported by R/V Armstrong will enhance understanding of the oceans and address a broad range of important scientific questions. The goal of this proposal is to provide funding support to safely and productively operate and maintain R/V Armstrong in 2016 and to ensure it is maintained to support its planned life-cycle. This support is an essential prerequisite for safe and successful scientific missions.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;WHOI research vessels provide at-sea laboratories necessary to effectively and safely take science to sea. This community includes senior oceanographic scientists, post-doctoral and doctoral students, graduate and undergrad students as well as engineers, technicians, and teachers. These intellectual endeavors have broadened our understanding and have spurred on new questions and scientific theory. Research supported by R/V Armstrong next year will be important in understanding the Earths climate and how it&lt;br/&gt;changes over time. In 2016 R/V Armstrong will exercise all of its scientific mission equipment to evaluate its capability and what may need further development on the nation's newest research vessel. Educational and outreach programs will be featured on these voyages. All of these intellectual endeavors will continue to broaden our understanding of the oceans, stimulate new questions, and confirm&lt;br/&gt;scientific theory for years to come, benefiting society at large. Oceanographic expeditions are an extension of university classrooms and are an extraordinary educational experience. Voyages expose participants to new ideas, teach fundamental scientific&lt;br/&gt;principles through observation and practice, and inevitably raise questions that stimulate new thinking about how the oceans work. An increased awareness of our responsibility to bring this science into the classroom and to the public has resulted in the development of new avenues to share these scientific findings. The cruise web site concept has effectively reached classrooms with real-time images,&lt;br/&gt;data and two-way communication between scientists and students in schools across the country. These efforts have extended the sea-going experience from a handful of participants to thousands of students in classrooms across the country, as well as to the general public. Scientists on WHOI vessels will use this tool to present their data through web based approaches either at their home institution or through web sites maintained by community organizations. The WHOI web site, http://www.whoi.edu, has pioneered efforts to present the results of research expeditions to the public. Outreach programs continuing in 2016 from WHOI vessels with the Perkins School for the Blind and Disabled represent cutting edge efforts to broaden the experience of conducting research at sea to every American.</AbstractNarration>
