<AbstractNarration>The rapid development and wide deployment of wireless networks incur a fast escalation of energy demand, which eagerly calls for energy-efficient networking techniques. At the same time, wireless networks are evolving into complex forms with multi-dimensional resources including communication link, radio, channel, antenna, and transmit power; algorithms with low complexity for energy efficiency optimization are highly demanded. This project targets at a fundamental study on energy-efficient wireless networking through establishment of a uniformed analytical framework, development of efficient and low-complexity algorithms, and application of the generic studies into important scenarios in the fifth generation (5G) cellular systems. This interdisciplinary research will not only provide various training projects to undergraduate and graduate studies, but also inspire students to pursue high-quality research with a creative, open-minded, and cross-disciplinary perspective.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project is going to demonstrate that a uniformed multidimensional optimization framework for energy efficiency optimization can be constructed by the principle of scheduling proper transmission patterns, which are defined by the interference model of the network. With such a uniformed optimization model, low-complexity decomposition techniques are fundamentally related to a maximum weighted transmission pattern (MWTP) problem, under a physical interference model according to the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio. Approximation algorithms and associated performance analysis for the MWTP problem (which is NP-hard in general) are critical research issues to be studied. Distributed algorithms for solving the energy efficiency optimization problem further involves decomposition with multi-objective optimization, and innovative Lyapunov function design and associated stability analysis under the physical interference model, which will also be addressed in this project. Energy efficient solutions in a couple of important 5G cellular scenarios will be enabled through innovative modeling and algorithms in the uniformed multidimensional framework, including joint optimization that incorporates massive MIMO interference mitigation with flow constraint at network layer and base station sleeping at system level, formulation and algorithm development for a MWTP problem under the massive MIMO interference model, and modeling of the interplay between massive MIMO and device-to-device communications. In this project, the proposed research seamlessly integrates studies in the areas of optimization, graph theory, dual decomposition, approximation algorithms, and wireless communication and networking.  The research outcomes are expected to provide important guidance for the development of the 5G cellular systems.</AbstractNarration>
