<AbstractNarration>This project provides travel support for 10-15 students attending the 2016 Annual Computer Security Applications Conference (ACSAC). ACSAC, which is celebrating its 32nd year, is a top-tier academic security conference that attracts averages about 250-300 highly skilled security professionals and student attendees per year. ACSAC has carved a unique role as a security conference equally attended by academia, industry, and government. In addition to the technical papers, the conference program will include keynotes by distinguished speakers, tutorials, case studies, panels, a poster session, and works-in-progress talks. This project will help to groom the next generation of cybersecurity professionals by facilitating interaction of students with experts in the field.</AbstractNarration>
