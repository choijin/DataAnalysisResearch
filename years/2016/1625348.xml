<AbstractNarration>This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) project supports the acquisition of an Electron Beam Lithography system at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and regional universities. This tool will provide state-of-the-art nanofabrication capabilities to a large population of students, faculty, researchers, and scholars at several universities. This capability will enhance study and research within fields ranging from physics, to electrical and computer engineering, to materials science and biology. A key attribute of the instrument to be acquired is the ability to pattern very small features across large areas - a capability that is especially important, for example, for modern photonics technology. Students (graduate and undergraduate) and other scholars around Wisconsin will directly use the instrument to facilitate cutting-edge study and research, honing their expertise in a key modern fabrication technology in the process. Undergraduate education will be enhanced by new components relating to electron beam lithography in courses in the Department of Physics and the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at UW-Madison.  The new facility will also be used in the recruitment of a diverse group of students to UW-Madison, as well as for outreach and education activities for high school students and the general public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The instrument to be acquired will meet critical needs for students studying and performing research in a wide range of areas varying from quantum devices to water quality monitoring and from nanostructured optical metasurfaces to aggressively scaled carbon nanotube field-effect transistors.  The project seeks an instrument that can provide sub-10 nm lithographic resolution, high-speed beam deflection, high resolution over a 500 micrometer field without stitching, and a stitching accuracy of 15 nm. In addition to these high-end features that will enable a broad spectrum of research, the modern electron beam lithography tool that will be acquired in this project will provide far greater throughput while also facilitating use by less experienced users and lowering the barrier to entry for new users. These advantages will increase the range of users who will benefit from the instrument's capabilities.  The tool will be integrated within the University of Wisconsin-Madison cleanroom in order to maximize the instrument's impact. This cleanroom user facility contains a broad array of auxiliary tools that will enhance the use of the electron-beam instrument. This facility will also manage and enable broad access to the instrument.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project supported the acquisition of an electron beam lithography tool which was installed in the clean room -- a user facility -- at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.  This lithography tool has capabilities that enable the nanofabrication of structures with extremely small feature sizes.  Examples include the fabrication of narrow metal wires used to apply voltages in semiconductor devices and small dielectric features used to guide the propagation of light.  Key features of this instrument include the ability to pattern with sub-10 nanometer precision -- that is, less than 10 billionths of a meter -- and the ability to align features from one session to the next to within 20 nanometers.  The tool operates by directing a high energy electron beam into a thin film which then undergoes chemical changes, enabling the writing of a pattern that can be revealed by a subsequent chemical development process.  Because of the relatively high energy of the beam in this tool, patterns with a dense set of features can be written relatively easily, increasing the utility and throughput of the tool.  This system is capable of writing patterns onto wafers of material ranging from 2 inches to 6 inches in diameter as well as onto small and oddly shaped pieces of material.  Since installation, the tool has transformed the rate at which electron beam lithography-based nanofabrication can be performed by student users of this tool.  Its capabilities have been featured in an outreach event during the course of this award, and the tool has been used in academic courses at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
