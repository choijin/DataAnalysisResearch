<AbstractNarration>This award will support a residential doctoral and postdoctoral mentoring program at the American Bar Foundation (ABF). Over the three-year grant period, the ABF will award four two-year doctoral fellowships and one three-year postdoctoral fellowship to young social scientists studying interdisciplinary topics at the intersection of law and inequality. This program offers the mentoring, networking, and professional development activities necessary to help young researchers excel in their respective career paths. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This fellowship program has two broad objectives: (1) to foster cutting edge research on law and inequality and (2) to support emerging scholars in interdisciplinary and disciplinary departments studying law and inequality. It is designed to address both the financial burdens of graduate education and the need for mentoring and networking that is crucial for junior scholar success, and that can be so elusive in interdisciplinary fields. The fellowship program will enhance the diversity of research and researchers in the field of law and social science, and enrich scientific study and knowledge of law and inequality.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The Law and Social Science Fellowship and Mentoring Program on Law and Inequality provides training for outstanding young scholars in the field of law and social science (LSS). The program has two broad objectives: (1) to foster cutting edge research on law and inequality and (2) to support creative scholars in interdisciplinary and disciplinary departments studying law and inequality. The program is designed to address both the financial burdens of graduate education and the need for mentoring and networking that is crucial for emerging scholar success, and that can be so elusive in interdisciplinary fields. Though this renewed award, NSF continued an important fellowship program that has been held in residence at the American Bar Foundation (ABF) since 2008. To date, the program has helped launch the careers of 22 doctoral students and 1 postdoctoral fellow. This renewed award funded 4 doctoral students for two years each and 1 postdoctoral fellow for three years from 2017-2020.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Intellectual Merit:&nbsp;<br />The program aims to enhance the diversity of research and researchers in the field of law and social science and enrich scientific study and knowledge of law and inequality. In particular, the program has increased both quality and quantity of research on the ways in which inequality is mediated through legal institutions; the impact of social and economic inequality on legal outcomes; how various forms of inequality (especially racial and ethnic inequality) interact with the creation of legal rules, decision making, and the operation of organizations; and how law may create differential expectations and experiences for members of different social groups. Fellows supported under this award completed dissertations on topics such as how Black graduate students in prestigious universities experience diversity norms; growth and inequality in immigration enforcement; the historical relationship between corporate law and economic and racial inequality; and use of the criminal legal system to manage mental illness and substance use.&nbsp;</p> <p>Broader Impacts:&nbsp;<br />The program achieves the broader impact of building a new talent pool of researchers and teachers in the field of law and social science. By funding and mentoring talented emerging scholars, with a focus on offering opportunities for underrepresented scholars, this program has increased the diversity and quality of the field. The program contributes to the identification, recruitment, and retention of emerging scholars from underrepresented groups by providing funding, mentoring, and networking during a crucial stage of graduate studies and career development. Nearly all of the Fellows supported by this award finished their PhDs and secured employment as professors, research scientists, or another closely related role. During and after their fellowships, these fellows published award-winning papers and books, secured grant funding, and presented their work. The Fellows trained by this award and their continuing scholarly work will have an impact on the LSS field and society for many years to come.&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/04/2020<br>      Modified by: Ajay&nbsp;Mehrotra</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
