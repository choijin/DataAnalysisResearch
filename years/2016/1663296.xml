<AbstractNarration>Support is sought for travel and registration fees for invited speakers, undergraduate students, graduate students, post-docs, and under-represented, female and junior faculty to attend and present at the Symposium BI1: Today Teaching and Learning in Materials Science: Challenges and Advances at the Fall Materials Research Society (MRS) National Meeting in Boston, MA, November 28-30, 2016. Throughout the two-days oral and poster sessions and discussions held in this symposium, the focus will be on improving the efficacy of undergraduate and graduate student education in materials science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tutorial will encourage the participation of graduate students, postdoc researchers, and junior faculty, especially from the under-represented groups. The topics addressed in this Symposium, namely: Curriculum and Course Development; Active Learning and Student Engagement; Research Based Teaching Initiatives and Active Learning Oral; Use of Computers; Data, Analysis and Simulations; Ethics, Diversity and Global Issues; Outreach; Challenging Approaches to Instruction; Laboratory: hands-on Formats are very relevant and require major efforts to insure progress in this critical field. MRS meetings provide an ideal setting for such interchange because of its healthy melding of all aspects of STEM research and education.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The main objective of this symposium was to address the current state and challenges in materials science education and the ongoing innovation and experiments in learning tools, environment, and format to meet these challenges.  Efforts were made to identify "what works" and "what does not work".  The symposium examined new innovative and effective instruction concepts and ideas in the area of materials science. The talks were relevant to many ongoing efforts in related STEM areas. Our goal was to strategically address the many dimensions of teaching and learning in materials science and related fields originating from our desire to produce the highest quality graduates possible.  The focal points of these efforts included addressing our national needs for highly skilled, productive, motivated and creative scientists and technologists in materials science.  Materials science is a multi-disciplinary field of study that continues to grow in breadth (e.g., bio, nano, soft, electronic, photonic, and green materials). The interdisciplinary nature of our field offers many challenges in the design and implementation of curricula to prepare students for their future work.  The symposium had four major activities: a tutorial, a discussion session at the end of the symposium, the main set of presentations, and a poster session.   Attendance was typically 60-80 people/session.  Time for questions was provided at the end of each talk and was well utilized.  The overall quality of the contributed talks was excellent and were well received.  NSF  funds provided were used entirely for the registration fees for all invited speakers (excluding our speaker from NSF) and travel awards given to six women graduate students who presented talks or posters.  Anecdotal comments by several participants at the end of the symposium where very positive.  We were encouraged to organize similar symposia in the future.
