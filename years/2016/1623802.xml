<AbstractNarration>Recent warming has resulted in Arctic permafrost thaw, earlier spring sea ice melt, and later fall sea ice formation.  As a result, important coastal archaeological sites that were once protected by ice are exposed to increased damage and even complete loss due to a combination of melting permafrost and wave erosion during the extended open water season. With this project the research team will investigate significant prehistoric and historic archaeological deposits at one such threatened site, Iita (Etah) in northwestern Greenland. Research since 2006 has documented rapid erosion of the site and revealed stratified deposits extending back 1000 years. These deposits represent two different cultural groups, the Dorset, who lived there between AD 1050 and 1200, and the Thule (ancestors of the contemporary Inuit) who moved into the area from their homeland in Alaska around 1200. The area around Iita is rich in marine and terrestrial resources, including millions of dovekies, which nest in nearby cliffs. The investigators expect to recover both artifacts and animal bones that will increase our understanding of the different ways in which these two groups used these resources.  The research team may also be able to determine whether they occupied the area at the same time, and if so, how they interacted. The nature of contact between Dorset and Thule people, if it happened, is one of the enduring questions in Arctic prehistory.  The stratified deposits at Iita provide a rare opportunity to investigate this question. The team will focus their work on areas of the site most prone to erosion, recovering data before it is lost forever. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A team of six researchers from Bowdoin, UC Davis, and the National Museum of Greenland will excavate at the site of Iita, Qaasuitsup Kommunia, Greenland. Due to increased ice-free periods in the stormy fall season the site is experiencing rapid erosion, documented over the course of work at this site between 2006 and 2012. Excavations in historic contexts in 2006 revealed a buried early Thule component at the site and hinted at earlier occupations. In 2012 testing by J. Darwent and H. Lange confirmed the presence of a minimum of three discrete stratigraphic levels dating to the Late Dorset period, each separated by sterile sand. These distinct occupation levels offer an unprecedented opportunity to study and compare well-defined relatively brief occupations, in contrast to the often-mixed surface and near-surface sites more commonly found. They offer the opportunity to learn about many aspects of Late Dorset Culture, from the importance of exploiting the massive dovekie colony, to their demise as the ancestors of the contemporary Inughuit moved into the area. The early Thule levels also present at the site offer the possibility of identifying the nature and extent of interaction (if any) between these two groups.  In this remote location, evaluation, monitoring, and mitigation of changes due to erosion are difficult. This fieldwork will allow the research team to both continue monitoring and to partially mitigate impending loss of these significant cultural resources.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>RAPID: Endangered Archaeology at Iita was funded to conduct archaeological excavations at the historically important site of Iita (Etah) on Foulke Fjord in northwestern Greenland. A team of six archaeologists spent six weeks at the site in the summer of 2016, and since then have been working to analyze and disseminate their findings. Iita is important because the 1000-year history of occupation is recorded in discrete stratigraphic levels, something that is common in other parts of the world, but very rare this far north. Our work at Iita since 2006, however, has shown that the site is actively eroding and at risk of being lost, and one of our main objectives was to evaluate this situation.</p> <p>In the summer of 2016, we excavated 13 1x1 m squares, of which 10 reached sterile soil up to 120 cm below the surface. We halted work in the remaining units due to permafrost and associated meltwater. We identified at least three discrete Late Dorset occupations, as well as parts of two later Thule houses. Radiocarbon dates show that the Late Dorset people occupied the site between about AD 1000 and 1250.</p> <p>Preliminary analysis of zooarchaeological remains indicates that Late Dorset people hunted most of the species available in the area, including little auks, which nest in the hundreds of thousands at the head of the fjord. Other finds of note include a number of pieces of worked meteoric iron, from the Cape York meteorite 170 miles to the south, and finely carved ivory figurines. Both of these are evidence of the far-flung networks in which Dorset people interacted: meteoric iron has been found in Late Dorset sites in the central Canadian Arctic, and the figurines recovered are nearly identical to a group found in that region as well. On-going analysis will focus on examining the discrete Late Dorset levels to evaluate any temporal changes.</p> <p>In addition to Late Dorset finds we also identified portions of two buried houses constructed by Thule people, the ancestors of the modern Inuit. One of these houses has been dated to between AD 1470 and 1640. In both cases, there were no surface indications that the houses existed (unlike more recent houses on the site), and only the rear portions of the houses were preserved, the entrance tunnels and fronts having been lost to erosion.</p> <p>We also evaluated the on-going erosion at the site. Losses of up to two meters in some areas are evident and can be documented in an extensive photographic series of the eroding face from previous visits in 2006 and 2012. In the face of continuing diminishment of annual sea ice, which forms later in the fall and melts earlier in the summer, we anticipate that this situation will continue, and probably become worse, in coming years.</p> <p>A multimedia article prepared by the Bowdoin College department of communications describes some of the work of this project.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 03/01/2019<br>      Modified by: Genevieve&nbsp;M&nbsp;Lemoine</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1623802/1623802_10413629_1532354727689_GL07_18_2016_07--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1623802/1623802_10413629_1532354727689_GL07_18_2016_07--rgov-800width.jpg" title="View of Iita from Provision Point"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1623802/1623802_10413629_1532354727689_GL07_18_2016_07--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="View of Iita from Provision Point"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Seen from across the water, the erosion that threatens the site is clearly visible.
