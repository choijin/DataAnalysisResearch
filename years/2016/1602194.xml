<AbstractNarration>Our knowledge of the inner workings of volcanoes, magma ascent rates, and the sequence of events leading up to a volcanic eruption is still rudimentary for undersea volcanoes.  In the Spring of 2015, just after installation of Ocean Observatory Initiative (OOI), a new; NSF-funded; cabled undersea observatory, a major eruptive event happened at Axial Volcano, an edifice just off the coast of the Northwestern US on the Juan de Fuca mid-ocean ridge spreading center. Samples of the associated lavas, collected just shortly after the eruption hold the potential to dramatically improve our understanding of undersea volcanic processes.  This research takes advantage of this unique opportunity to carry out analyses of Po210, a very short lived radioactive isotope, which allows high resolution dating that can tell over what period of time the lavas were erupted.  Additional Uranium series isotope analyses allow estimates to also be made about magma ascent rates, better helping us understand the eruption process and mechanisms of the Axial eruption. These data, along with  independently collected major and trace element geochemical data and geophysical data that will be combined to answer questions about the Axial magmatic system and magma migration pathways leading to eruption. Broader impacts of the work include public release of data, support of an early career researcher, public outreach via social media, and support of an institution in an EPSCoR state.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Axial Seamount is a submarine volcano of the Oregon coast that has erupted 3 times since 1998, and is home to a cabled geophysical observtory funded by NSF (it came on line in 2015).  It erupted soon after the observatory went on line, followed by several expeditions to observe and sample lavas conducted by partner organiations, which the PI of this project participated in.  Lava samples were collected (see image) for radiometric dating (the subject of this study) as well as compositional and physical analysis by others.  What we wanted to learn was when in 2015 exactly were lavas erupted at Axial Seamount, to see if there were changes in time or location of the volcanic vents, and to compare ages to geophysical eruption signals measured by the cabled observatory at this site, which suggest that the eruption migrated from north to south over a couple of weeks. .     18 Lavas were dated with the Po210 method. This requires repeat analyses of 210Po in the sample, which changes after eruption. Results suggest that all 18 lavas erupted within error of each other on the same days, in Spring 2015. This is consistent with a short duration eruption, unlike the eruption in 2011, which lasted several months. However, our analytical results from this project are not as robust as in prior applications of this method in our lab, primarily due to technical difficulies experienced by the lab technician who did the actual analyses, yielding higher uncertainty in the results, and making correlation with geophysical signals difficult.
