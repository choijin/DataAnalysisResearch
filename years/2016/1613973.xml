<AbstractNarration>The goal of this program is to study the epoch of reionization (EoR) through the redshifted hydrogen emission line at rest wavelength 21 cm. The EoR is one of the last unexplored phases in the history of the universe. Broader impacts of the work include training of women and underrepresented minority students through a program called Research Experiences for Non-Traditional Undergraduates (RENTU). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award will provide support for the US-based imaging power spectrum analysis team, which has been at the forefront of analyzing data from the Mileura Widefield Array telescope in Australia, and will provide one of the cornerstone analysis pipelines for the new Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA), an NSF-supported radio telescope in South Africa.</AbstractNarration>
