<AbstractNarration>This award supports participation in a series of summer schools in computational number theory. The subjects for the upcoming summer schools, to be held at the University of North Carolina - Greensboro, are: May 16 to 20, 2016: Computational Algebraic Number Theory; May 2017: Computational Aspects of Hilbert's 12th Problem; May 2018: Geometry and Modular Forms. The aim of the one-week summer school is to complement the traditional training that graduate students receive by exposing them to a constructive and computational approach to many objects in number  theory. This furthers their knowledge and gives the students additional tools for their research.  Furthermore, the school provides the students the opportunity to work closely with experts in the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The summer school is valuable to students for their careers as researchers and in their post-doctoral lives, since the event helps to create research communities. By meeting and working with other graduate students in their field, the students lay the foundation for future collaboration. In the years after the summer school, they will have opportunities to meet again at one of the regional conferences, including the Palmetto Number Theory Series and the South Eastern Meeting on Numbers. Additionally, by introducing the students to a computational approach to number theory, this project will enhance the next generation of mathematicians by increasing their ability to use computing technology in their research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For more information, see  http://www.uncg.edu/math/numbertheory/summerschool/</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ UNCG Summer School in Computational Number Theory   The goal of this proposal was to run a one week summer school in computational number theory for approximately twenty graduate students (ten local and ten external students) in the years 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019. The grant will supported the travel costs, accommodations, and meals of the students and up to three invited speakers.   The PIs ran the first summer school in computational number theory at UNCG titled A Computational Approach to L-Functions in May 2012.  This the a summer schol has taken place every year.  The subjects for the summer supported by this grant period were:   &bull; Summer 2016: Function Fields &bull; Summer 2017: Modular Forms &bull; Summer 2018: Algorithms for Extensions of Large Degree &bull; Summer 2019: Computational Aspects of Buildings   Each UNCG Summer School in Computational Number Theory will ran for a week, from Monday to Friday. On a typical day, external and local experts gave talks in the morning, and in the afternoon students solved problems related to this material. These included theoretical as well as programming problems and computer experiments. The whole group, speakers and students, had lunch together everyday and wen on an excursion for one afternoon, to foster exchange in a casual atmosphere between the students and the speakers.   Intellectual Merit   The aim of the summer school in computational number theory is to complement the traditional training that graduate students receive by exposing them to a constructive and computational approach to many objects in number theory. This will further their knowledge and give the students additional tools for their research. Furthermore, the school will allow the students to have the opportunity to work closely with experts in the field.   Broader Impacts   The summer school will help create research communities. By meeting and working with other graduate students in their field the students will lay the foundation for future collaboration. In the years after the summer school they will meet again at one of the regional conferences PANTS (Palmetto Number Theory Series) or SERMON (South Eastern Meeting on Numbers) and also national and international conferences such as SageDays and LMFDB workshops.
