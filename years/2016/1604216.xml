<AbstractNarration>Liu 1604216&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will develop a unique optical instrument for super resolution imaging at ultra-fast speed. The instrument will be the first optical imaging tool that has unprecedented resolution in both space (~50nm scale) and time (~20ms scale) simultaneously. It will have a profound impact to the fields of physical science, biomedical imaging and to fields where both high resolution and high speed optical imaging are required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An innovative combination of plasmonics, structured illumination microscopy, and optical tweezers, will allow a host of fundamental studies on the nanoscale interactions and real-time dynamics of living cells that are impossible to conduct by any other presently available instrument. Localized plasmonic structured illumination (LPSIM) is a structured illumination microscopy (SIM) technique and the plasmonic antenna array provides deep sub-wavelength illumination patterns, leading to much higher resolution in a final reconstructed image.&lt;br/&gt;.</AbstractNarration>
