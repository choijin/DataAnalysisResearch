<AbstractNarration>This award supports research in the field of algebraic geometry. The research sets the stage for understanding the basic structure of fundamental problems in a way suitable for pragmatic use in a broad spectrum of applications. The results of the work are intended to be immediately relevant to questions in the theory of integrable systems, string theory, gauge theory, and the study of topological insulators.  In addition, the research project aims to have concrete applications to field theory and quantization.  The project also aims to build a new arsenal of geometric techniques applicable to the theory of algebraic cycles, symplectic topology, and high energy physics. This will be achieved by providing research opportunities on the interface of geometry and string theory for graduate students and postdoctoral associates in mathematics and physics, and by development of courses on formal localization and shifted quantization and on Calabi-Yau integrable systems and higher Donaldson-Thomas theory. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project integrates ideas from derived geometry and quantum field theory to unravel the hidden complexity of moduli problems, to extract new enumerative invariants of varieties, and to study completely integrable systems. The resolution of these questions will consolidate and demystify several existing quantization schemes in geometry, symplectic topology, and field theory. Three directions will be studied. The first aims to characterize those moduli spaces that admit a realization as the critical locus of a potential. The characterization requires the development of the formalism of shifted symplectic and Poisson structures in derived geometry and the theory of isotropic foliations. In the second project a new method will be investigated for constructing motivic orientation data on non-abelian cohomology by building explicit Lagrangian foliations and computing the associated potential functions. The project aims to construct higher Chern-Simons functionals, and sets the stage for extracting enumerative invariants from higher dimensional quantum field theory. The final project searches for Calabi-Yau integrable systems that realize the tame or wild meromorphic Hitchin fibrations for ADE structure groups.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The PI developed a novel toolbox for perturbative analysis of moduli spaces in geometry, topology, high energy and condensed matter physics. The toolbox is different from any of the existing local schemes in that it allows for understanding and modeling the effects of quantum corrections on the global geometry.  The versatility of the toolbox comes from a built in utilization of the higher geometric structure inherently present in the parameter spaces for such theories. The PI applied this new methodology to study and solve fundamental problems in geometry, quantum symmetry, integrable systems, and geometric representation theory.    Three projects were completed.  In the first project the PI studied and classified isotropic and Lagrangian foliations on derived spaces and stacks and explained how such foliations guarantee the existence of global potentials that give a perturbative realization of the underlying geometry. The classification and existence results were utilized to construct stationary phase approximations of moduli of quantum branes, and to analyze in detail the global Poisson geometry and quantization of spaces of local systems on higher dimensional smooth varieties. In the second project the PI introduced a new method for constructing potentials and orientation data on moduli spaces of flat bundles and Higgs bundles. The method was applied by the PI to constructions of higher Chern-Simons functionals.Several graduate students trained and supported within the project used the novel methodology to solve fundamental open problems in the field, including a complete characterization of quantized cycles whose perturbative structures are independent from the choice of an action, a proof of a non-abeliazation theorem for general local systems on surfaces, and a proof of the spectral correspondence for square summable cohomology. In the third project the PI extended the Hodge theory associated with meromorphic Hitchin and Calabi-Yau integrable and used the extension to compute the Okamoto symmetries of residues, to construct Hecke eigensheaves, and to prove several outstanding conjectures on the topology of wildly ramified character varieties and to compute generating functions for invariants of framed torus knots and links.  The completion of these projects is essential for understanding complicated enhancements of structures in algebraic geometry, symplectic topology, and theoretical and mathematical physics. The solutions obtained by the PI set the stage for understanding the local and global complexity of common zeroes of polynomial equations in a way suitable for pragmatic use in a broad spectrum of applications. Aside from the natural applications to algebraic geometry and topology, the carried out work tackled deep open problems  in category theory, geometric representation  theory, the theory of integrable systems, string theory, quantum gravity and cosmology.      While completing this research program the PI organized a concentrated effort on enhancing and building a new geometric arsenal of techniques applicable to the theory of algebraic cycles, symplectic topology, and high energy physics. This was achieved by training three postdoctoral researchers, six Ph.D. and two M.Sc students in mathematics and physics, and by a curriculum development of courses on non-perturbative quantization, singular non-abelian Hodge theory, geometric engineering, and Donaldson-Thomas theory.  The work was disseminated through talks at multidisciplinary conferences, courses at graduate schools, research seminars, publications in peer reviewed scientific journals, and a peer reviewed research monograph.
