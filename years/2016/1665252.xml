<AbstractNarration>The award studies the structure of Boolean functions - functions of many inputs whose output is binary. The main goal of the award is to study the influence of individual inputs on the output, as well as the stability of the output to random perturbations applied to the vector of inputs. The study of influences and stability will be used to obtain new algorithms for learning from data and for analyzing markov-chain sampling procedures using generalizations of the Fourier expansion. It will be further used in conjunction with tools from the theory of hardness of approximation to show that for some combinatorial optimization problems it is computationally hard to find (even) an approximately optimal solution. A main theme of the award is to obtain new results on the geometry of the Gaussian measure as a key step for analyzing stability of Boolean functions. This follows the general philosophy of invariance principles which argue that in certain situations functions of bits and functions of Gaussian variables, which are easier to analyze, behave similarly. The award will support the educational efforts and mentoring of new graduate students by introducing to them new connections between pure mathematics, theoretical computer science and their applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A key feature of modern computation is its binary nature. The award will investigate binary and other computational models motivated by the following questions: How robust are these computational models? How well can they classify data? How well can they be used to solve large optimization problems? The approach is based in parts on deep tools from mathematical analysis including the study of geometric problems in high dimensions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Using tools from Gaussian analysis, the project provided new rigorous limits on the performance of efficient combinatorial algorithms and of communication protocols. The algorithmic bounds show that certain combinatorial problem cannot be solved efficiently even approximately.  For computation, it is established that it is computationally decidable to determine which distributions can be jointly simulated by agents who communicate via noisy channels. In other results relating to data science, the project provided new algorithms to efficiently test for simple, low-dimensional explanations for high dimensional phenomena.  The study of Boolean functions on new domains led to results establishing threshold phenomena in voting between multiple alternatives. On the other hand, the study of the interplay between Gaussian analysis and Boolean functions established that plurality vote is fundamentally different than majority vote as it is not as robust. This presents a new and fascinating research direction for future research: what is the most robust partition of Gaussian space into three parts? What is the most stable voting method between three or more alternatives?  The project further provided efficient algorithms for binary network partition problems both with and without ``side information" thus proving non-rigorous conjectures from statistical physics.   All of our work was carried out with collaborators, post-doctoral fellows and graduate students who were partially supported by the grant in their professional development.  Further development of graduate education results from classes taught during the term and in summer schools.          Last Modified: 11/26/2018       Submitted by: Elchanan Mossel]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
