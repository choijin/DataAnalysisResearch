<AbstractNarration>This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on developing a pilot-scale mobile Flash Hydrolyzer (FH) unit to rapidly and economically harvest products made from microalgae. Microalgae have been on the forefront as an alternative feedstock to produce liquid transportation fuels, bioproducts, and for wastewater treatment for nutrients recovery. The FH technology provides a more economical way to harvest these products, which are sustainable substitutes for petroleum-based fuels and chemicals.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will result in a novel mobile algae slurry processing Flash Hydrolysis unit which will be used for following demonstration purposes: (i) On-site algae processing at commercial algae cultivation facilities; (ii) Recovery of bioproducts and nutrients at algae bloom sites; (iii) Processing algae from the tertiary treatment of wastewater effluents; and (iv) Integration into a municipal solid waste processing facility. The mobile unit will be unique with respect to its ability for rapid heating of algae slurry and the design of a high-pressure plug flow reactor with short (and tunable) residence times resulting in substantial cost savings due to compact reactor size and equipment footprint among hydrothermal reactors. The project addresses the knowledge gap in the area of rapid heating of biomass components in subcritical water/hydrothermal media and the engineering challenges of algae slurry feeding at high pressure and process scale-up. The successful demonstration of such a system will encourage the stakeholders (including industry) to adopt this novel technology in a rapidly growing Bio-economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project team consists of graduate students and interdisciplinary undergraduate students who will gain experience in project-based learning and process design, as well as an opportunity to interact with numerous stakeholders. This project platform will help engage student participants in talking to potential customers, partners and competitors, and entrepreneurial opportunities that follow successful academic research. A summer biofuel research apprenticeship program and visits of local high school students to the project site will be used as a tool to engage K-12 students.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The project aimed at the design, fabrication, and demonstration of a 2.5 gal/h mobile Flash Hydrolyzer which is used for fractionating microalgae components (proteins and lipids). Flash hydrolysis (FH) is a subcritical water based hydrolysis process developed by the principal investigator (PI) which is used to extract proteins in aqueous fraction while keeping the lipids in solid fraction. FH process is conducted in a continuous flow process typically conducted at 280<sup>?</sup>C under subcritical water condition with a residence time of few seconds (e.g. 10 s).

A longer preheating or residence time will degrade the hydrolyzed protein. The team conducted simulation studies using COMSOL for modelling FH reactions and to understand the heat transfer issues at the mixing junction and inside the plug-flow reactor. Based on simulation studies for different scenario and commercial availability of a rapid heating system, the team designed, procured, and installed an induction heating system that could heat algae slurry to 300?C in 5 seconds. Second challenge was to develop a high-pressure pumping system for flowing slurry with high microalgae content (up to 10 wt%). The team selected, procured, and installed ?Lewa Ecoflow Diaphragm Metering Pump?. Third engineering challenge was to develop a customized back pressure regulator (BPR) which would be compatible for high solid/microalgae slurry. A domestic precision pressure control company is agreed to conduct a case study and develop a customized BPR.
