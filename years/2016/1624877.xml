<AbstractNarration>Dr. Jennifer Drummond has been granted an NSF EAR Postdoctoral Fellowship to carry out research and education activities at the Center for Advance Studies in Blanes, Spain, and the Desert Research Institute in Reno, NV. The overall aim of the project is to examine how particulate organic carbon and microbes from wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents influence the metabolism of recipient streams. This work will improve the understanding of the impacts of environmental alterations derived from urban activity on stream ecosystem functioning. The information can be used to guide management and policy decisions related to balancing human and environmental needs for sustainable water resources. The project addresses a worldwide issue of concern and the research results will be shared with multiple audiences in Spain, Europe, and the United States. The education plan will consist of contributions to a massive open on-line course and participation in MOVILAB. The MOVILAB travels to different villages and gives local kids and adults the opportunity to have hands-on experience while learning about current environmental topics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research plan will include experimental, field and laboratory work together with computational development and analysis. The project will result in a unique data set on the mechanisms underlying (i) transport and retention behavior of particulate organic carbon (POC) and microbes in urban channels and (ii) how this affects the metabolism of WWTP-influenced stream ecosystems. Furthermore, a computational model will be developed that combines transport and retention of solutes, POC, and microbes with the metabolic activity of the stream. This model can be used to link scales of solute and particle retention and examine the controlling mechanism of in-stream metabolism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award was supported with funding from the Office of International Science &amp; Engineering.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project examined how particulate organic carbon and microbes sourced from waste water treatment (WWTP) effluent influences the metabolism of recipient streams.  Through field sampling campaigns, lab and field experiments and computational development and analyses, this project demonstrated that particulate organic carbon significantly contributes to increases in stream metabolic activity, especially immediately downstream of a WWTP.  By applying a novel method using a hydrometabolic tracer to measure the metabolic activity of the particulate organic carbon deposited on the streambed, we demonstrate that WWTPs are sources of organic-rich fine particles that accumulate in streams, especially during dry periods.   The results show that the quantity and quality of particulate organic carbon and its associated metabolic activity vary by both distance from the WWTP point source and by sampling date, which is influenced by the time history of the hydrological conditions and the capacity of the stream to dilute the WWTP effluent point source.   Fine particles rapidly deposit and then slowly rework over time downstream, propagating WWTP sourced organic-rich fine particles downstream.  Specifically, the WWTP longitudinal footprint on fine particle in-stream dynamics increases as dilution capacity decreases.  We found that the quality, not the quantity, of the fine particle standing stocks directly influenced the microbial metabolic activity. Furthermore, extremely low flow conditions, as those found in intermittent streams, highlight that WWTP effluents can be important sources of not only particulate organic matter, but also pathogens (both fecal indicator bacteria and human enteric viruses) to receiving streams. The project addressed a worldwide issue of concern &ndash; how urban activity impacts stream ecosystems and alters the quality of freshwater resources.  This project improved public knowledge of both increased risk of freshwater resources from urban point sources and methods for restoration to improve water quality by interacting with students, the community, and a local restoration company and water management consortium.
