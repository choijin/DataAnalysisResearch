<AbstractNarration>This project explores an integrative approach to embedded hardware security, where efficient design solutions complement appropriate test/validation steps and security analysis. It creates technology to protect embedded systems at different stages of life-cycle against hardware intellectual property (IP) piracy and reverse engineering, hardware Trojan attacks in untrusted design and fabrication facilities, and malicious modifications of hardware IP. It investigates a design approach based on scalable key-based hardware obfuscation to protect hardware IP from illegal usage and malicious modifications. The design technique is combined with a "self-referencing" based validation approach, which compares side-channel signature of a chip with itself - in both spatial and temporal manner, to reliably detect hardware Trojans. Security analysis is performed to measure effectiveness of the proposed framework using appropriate trust metrics and to identify emerging security threats. The approaches are validated using software automation tools and a custom hardware emulation platform. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research improves understanding of technological issues related to embedded hardware security and will enable technologies for secure and trustworthy hardware at low cost. The project integrates education through training students various aspects of hardware security using hands-on experiments, involving undergraduate and high-school students in research, and disseminating research results, course modules, software tools and the hardware test bed to local schools and peer research community. It will create awareness about the security issues and countermeasures through the "Hardware Security" group in Facebook created by the PI and through organizing special sessions in major IEEE/ACM conferences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Primary goals of this five-year project were to analyze the major hardware security issues and then investigate an integrative approach to hardware protection for embedded systems. The major intellectual contributions of the project are described next in detail.  (1) Extensive threat analysis through the hardware life cycle:  Significant accomplishment was made in analyzing diverse threats in electronic hardware life cycle. From these analysis, appropriate threat models, instances, as well as benchmarks developed to enable researchers focus on protection approaches. The threat analysis involved both hardware intellectual property (IP) blocks as well as fabricated integrated circuits (ICs) of different types. It considered various attack surfaces and business models to greatly enhance our understanding of various trust issues associated with design, test, fabrication and in-field usage of electronics. In the cases of Trojan attacks on hardware, the PI has developed several taxonomies of threats and countermeasures for different levels of hardware abstraction.  (2) Integrative protection:  The project explored a holistic countermeasure of electronic hardware that combines the technology for secure hardware design with test/validation, to provide comprehensive security to all parties involved in the hardware life-cycle, while satisfying the tight resource constraints of embedded systems. It has been successful in developing an integrative approach to embedded hardware security, where efficient design solutions complement appropriate test/validation steps and security analysis. Obfuscation-based design approach to protect against Trojan attacks is complemented with comprehensive trust validation. The research explored a novel side-channel approach, called self-referencing, which reliably detects Trojan circuits under large process and measurement noise. Self-referencing is combined with a statistical logic testing approach to achieve high Trojan coverage. The proposed research significantly improves our understanding of technological issues related to embedded hardware security and creates pathways to enabling technologies for secure and trustworthy hardware at low cost.  In particular, major research progress has been made in the following key areas: (a) analysis of Trojan attacks in application specific integrated circuits (ASIC) as well as field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) platform which exposed several new threats and helped to create corresponding threat models; (b) development of both novel Trojan detection approach as well as Trojan-resilient hardware architecture or design approach that can tolerate existence of Trojans and maintain correct functional behavior on Trojan activation; (c) comprehensive solution for hardware IP protection during design, fabrication and deployment through a novel low-overhead state space obfuscation approach, and (d) analysis of security design and validation requirements in the system-on-chips (SoCs) used in emerging internet of things, wearables and implantable devices.  Broader Impacts:  Project has resulted in the following products: (1) three edited books; (2) 12 journal publications; (3) 18 conference publications; (4) several book chapters; and (5) one patent. It has funded five graduate (PhD) students and three undergraduate students.  Research results have been disseminated in a timely manner through publications, special issues in journals, special sessions in conferences and invited lectures as well as tutorials. The graduate, undergraduate, and high school students working in this project have participated in conference oral/poster presentations and have given hardware demonstration of the experimentation platform developed in this project in HOST 2017 conference.  In addition to the extensive research accomplishments, PI Bhunia has been actively involved in developing a unique hands-on training course on hardware security in University of Florida (UF). The course has been offered for the second time at UF where students learn different aspects of hardware security through 11 well-designed experiments. The course has been very popular with the students at UF. PI Bhunia has updated the course materials and experiment platform for offering it as an EDGE course &ndash; i.e. an online course, so that students can take this course online remotely from any location.  Future Directions:  The research findings and educational efforts are expected to create pathways for many future explorations and development.   (1)   Future work on hardware IP protection will involve extension of the state space obfuscation method to large intellectual property blocks and SoCs and development of new metrics and evaluation on industrial designs.  (2)   Future work on hardware Trojan detection will involve application of advanced statistical analysis as well as machine learning techniques to improve the detection accuracy and the confidence level.  (3)   New Trojan-resilient system architecture and evaluation of the architecture with diverse SoC designs and automatic synthesis of the security policies can be explored.  Finally, the hardware security training and education platform developed by PI Bhunia can be extended with additional features for implementing diverse hardware security experiments. We hope educators across the nation will benefit from the platform and augment its capabilities.         Last Modified: 09/29/2017       Submitted by: Swarup K Bhunia]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
