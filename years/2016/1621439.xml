<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) project will be to provide the biotechnology and pharmaceutical research community with improved models that will accelerate the discovery of the next generation of drugs targeting fat metabolism.  Currently, over one in every three American adults are obese and the incidence of childhood obesity continues to climb.  Obesity is now recognized as a world-wide epidemic which will impact many if not all nations.  In the coming decades, it will be critical to develop more effective therapies for obesity and its associated problems, diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure and stroke.  Obesity is caused by an overgrowth of the body's fat cells.  Unlike current models that rely heavily on mouse fat cells, the proposed "humanized fat-on-a-chip" technology will provide scientists with a research model that closely approximates the clinical conditions that face doctors and their patients every day.  By working with human fat cells in a three dimensional structure resembling the actual human tissue, the proposed platform has the potential to impact the pace of new drug discovery and the cost of health care delivery for disease prevention and treatment.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SBIR project proposes to develop a "humanized fat-on-a-chip" drug discovery platform targeting drugs for fat metabolism. The pharmaceutical industry currently lacks a robust human fat tissue model, and continues to use less reliable mouse models.  As a result, the obesity and diabetes drug discovery pipeline remains blocked.  To address this need, the proposed project will combine human cells with protein scaffolds to pioneer a tissue engineered fat pad.  The objectives are to 1) evaluate the human cells and scaffolds separately to confirm the identity and function; 2) combine the human cells with the scaffold and perform assays in vitro to demonstrate that they can mimic the function of actual human fat; and 3) transplant the human cell/scaffold constructs into mice for 8 weeks to show that the tissue engineered fat pad will work under "real life" conditions.  It is anticipated that the human cell/scaffold constructs will display the metabolic features associated with human fat.  With this proof-of-concept data, the next step will be to create tissue engineered fat pads that display not only healthy but unhealthy (diabetes, obesity) metabolic patterns for use in drug screening and discovery.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Fat or adipose tissue, as it is described by biologists, is a complex organ containing a wide range of cell types.  In addition to the fat cells themselves, adipose tissue contains stromal/stem cells that can turn into fat cells, immune cells, and cells that form blood vessels.  An individual?s health is regulated, in part, by how these cells interact with each other in a three-dimensional space.  This is particularly important in disorders such as diabetes, obesity, and metabolic diseases.  Currently, most studies of fat are conducted in mice or related animal models; however, these findings are of limited value because of the unique features of human fat.  Under this Phase I NSF SBIR grant, LaCell LLC has developed proof of principle data that will help address this issue.  Using a special cocktail of "enzymes" and chemicals, LaCell is able to digest human fat and release all of the different constituent cell types into solution.  The cell content can be quantified by using a sophisticated laser activated counting device.  The mixture of human cells from fat can then be re-constituted into a three-dimensional matrix prepared with a human platelet or blood cell derived product manufactured by LaCell.  The resulting "fat on a chip" can then be maintained for days to weeks in a temperature controlled and humidified incubator and used for studies outside the body.  With this technology, LaCell can measure how the "fat on a chip" responds to potential drugs and chemicals.  By adding these agents to the "fat on a chip", LaCell scientists can measure how quickly the human tissue takes up sugar, digests fat, and expresses unique gene markers found only in human fat depots.  Using these tools, LaCell is now positioned to commercialize its technology and serve as a contract research service for pharmaceutical companies interested in developing new drugs to treat or prevent diabetes, obesity, and their associated metabolic complications.
