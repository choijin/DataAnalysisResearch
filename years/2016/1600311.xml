<AbstractNarration>Today, 3D scanners are limited in their ability to see reliably in everyday situations such as fog, rain, and snow.  On the road, the proposed technology (MDAR) enables self-driving cars to see faster and more accurately in snow, fog, and on dusty country roads-a key step for achieving mass-scale adoption of fully-autonomous vehicles.  In the factory, MDAR gives equipment the gift of 3D vision uninhibited by shiny surfaces, unlocking new industrial automation applications. MDAR addresses a unique gap in current 3D scanning where other systems are too slow, too cumbersome, too expensive, or too sensitive to environmental degradations.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader objective of this project will be the commercialization of the motion contrast 3D scanning technology developed at Northwestern University. The specific objectives of this project are to: (1) engage in customer discovery by interviewing over 100 customers; (2) complete an alpha version of our initial product offering; (3) refine the technical specifications for the beta version of our initial product offering based on our findings during customer discovery. The scope of this project will be both technical and commercial. On the technical side, this project will further the development of an alpha model. On the commercial side, this project will help further distill the best paths forward for commercialization. The potential contribution of our project will be to advance the development of a technology that, due to its high-speed outdoor capabilities, can improve road safety by advancing spatial awareness in autonomous cars or broaden our knowledge of planetary science by allowing remote probes to quickly and reliably scan terrain. This has significant implications in private industry, including: self-driving cars, precision agriculture, industrial automation, and consumer electronics</AbstractNarration>
