<AbstractNarration>The team will use the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) to inventory the cold gas in the universe.  Recent technical upgrades to this NSF facility paved the way for this important inventory.  The team will study how galaxies form stars in the cold gas.  They will also test models for how galaxies change as they age.  Senior team members will train junior team members.  Undergraduates from underrepresented groups will be involved in the research.  The team will engage with underserved youth in counties near Ithaca, New York.  Podcasts will be developed to disseminate the research to the public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team will use the VLA's superb sensitivity and wavelength coverage to investigate the volume density of molecular gas in the universe.  Their goals are to (1) conduct the first census of the cold gas history of the universe; (2) determine what drives the evolution of the volume density of cosmic star formation; and (3) compare the data to models for galaxy evolution.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The VLA COLDz project has delivered a three-dimensional view of the cold gas content of galaxies in the early universe across two well-studied cosmological deep fields on the sky. The cold gas in galaxies is the prerequisite material for star formation, i.e., the process through which galaxies have build up their stars until present day. The COLDz data show that the density of cold gas in galaxies per unit cosmic volume was about three times larger eleven billion years ago than today, initially rising to the present day value another 1.5 billion years earlier when the density of stars in galaxies was &gt;30 times lower than today. At the cosmic times studied by COLDz, galaxies were "gas-dominated", i.e., they typically contained more gas than stars - contrary to the present epoch. Beyond a measurement of this "cold gas history" of the universe at early epochs, COLDz has also revealed a significantly higher space density of so-called "optically-dark", i.e., heavily dust-obscured massive starburst galaxies in the first billion years after the Big Bang than previously thought. The results from this program directly feed into the development of the ngVLA (given the immediate relevance to its survey capabilities), the next large US-led radio facility to come online in the late 2020s/early 2030s. It builds the foundation for its Key Science Goal #3. This research has directly contributed to five PhD theses, two of which received support by this grant, and ~150 peer-reviewed publications, six of which describe the main results of the survey.
