<AbstractNarration>According to a NPR report, 14 percent of the world?s electricity is supplied by nuclear power. The current fleet of 438 reactors spread across 30 nations in addition to the 67 new plants under construction in 15 countries contain a large breadth of specifications, design features, and structural materials. These structural materials must withstand ever increasing amounts of neutron radiation damage in addition to operating in a high temperature and pressure and corrosive degradation environment. Their safety and reliability remain of first importance as reactor lifetimes aspire to be extended. However, they become difficult and expensive to safely handle and test because they become highly radioactive. This radiation has been known to cause unwanted embrittlement and abrupt premature failure. This project focuses on simulating the high dose radiation effect of helium production by focusing a medium energy helium ion beam on a sample at reactor operation temperature. Unlike neutron irradiation in reactors, this technique does not cause the sample to become radioactive, but because the shallow penetration depth of the helium is limited to microns in depth, test samples must be manufactured on this length scale. Micro tensile tests will be performed to investigate the effect of the helium on the grain boundary strength of a structural material commonly used in many nuclear reactors. This research will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Dhriti Bhattacharyya at the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO) in Lucas Heights, Australia who is a radiation damage specialist who has developed a novel in-situ micro-scale tensile testing technique to investigate nuclear structural materials. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Micro-scale tensile testing specimens will be manufactured out of helium implanted engineering alloys using focused ion beam (FIB) milling techniques. These specimens will be tested inside of a scanning electron microscope (SEM) in a fashion that will effectively pull apart the material?s grain boundaries in order to test how the helium has effected its grain boundary strength, a strength determining feature crucial to the material remaining intact and reliability during extended service. In addition to providing quantitative mechanical stresses, this technique allows for real time observation of local deformation in real time, providing valuable information concerning the ultimate failure mechanism of reactor components. Selecting of specific types of grain boundaries to investigate and different microstructural features can be made using electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) and post-test investigations can be performed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and EBSD to further understand the deformation mechanisms and the distribution of the helium, concerning whether it segregates along the material?s grain boundaries. The methods development of micro-tensile testing will have a wide variety of applications in materials research as a whole, and it will also allow a greater number of labs worldwide to safely conduct research and obtain better statistics with minimal radioactive sample material.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Australian Academy of Science.</AbstractNarration>

By performing tests on specimens containing grain boundaries, a better understanding of the effects of helium on grain boundary strength, failure mechanisms, and ductility was gained. Quantitative data in terms of these mechanical properties proved useful for developing models to predict acceptable component lifetimes.</p> <p>Four U-shaped cross-sections of a nickel superalloy spring (0.7-0.8 mm outer diameter, ~ 730 &micro;m thickness) were cut from a coil and mechanically polished. Ion irradiation of two slices was performed using the 2MV Tandetron STAR accelerator (6 MeV He<sup>2+</sup>, &phi; = 5.6 x 10<sup>17</sup> ions/cm<sup>2</sup>, T<sub>irr = </sub>20 &plusmn; 5 <sup>o</sup>C) at the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO). Two slices were preserved as non-irradiated specimens. The irradiation temperature was monitored with a thermocouple mounted close to the sample on the aluminium sample clamp.&nbsp; An energy degrader wheel with 14 aluminium foil thicknesses 0.8-22 &micro;m was used in an attempt to create a flat irradiation profile with helium uniformly implanted.</p> <p>One helium implanted coil was sliced in half, mounted in cross-section, and mechanically polished. Depth-controlled 250 nm Berkovich nanoindentation with an indent spacing of 5 &micro;m 0-20 &micro;m from the irradiated surface was performed in order to obtain irradiation hardness changes. Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) images of all indents were taken in order to precisely measure exact distances between indents and the irradiated surface. Indents occurring on top of carbide inclusions were removed as they are not representative of the behaviour of the bulk material.</p> <p>One control spring coil and one irradiated spring coil were mounted on an aluminum dovetail insert designed for characterization and fabrication of micro-tensile samples in the the Zeiss Ultra Plus SEM and Zeiss Auriga 60 focused ion beam (FIB). Seven dog-bone-shaped tensile specimens with rounded edges to avoid unwanted stress-concentrations at the corners were fabricated using the FIB to produce final smoothly polished geometries in the control spring component with 17-18 &micro;m gauge lengths, 4.0-4.6 &micro;m gauge widths, and 3.5-5.3 &micro;m gauge thicknesses confirmed by SEM images.</p> <p>Pre-test electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) analysis was performed on all gauge sections of the specimens at 4kx magnification with 20 keV electrons using 100 nm step sizes. This analysis includes band contrast, Euler angle color, inverse pole figure (IPF) x, y (tensile pulling direction), and z direction maps, <em>hkl</em> orientations of each grain, quantification of pre-existing lattice rotation within each grain in the specimen, misorientation angles between neighboring grains, and Schmid factor maps which indicate how likely slip events are along the most likely slip plane and slip direction from the 12 available fcc slip systems.</p> <p>In-situ tensile tests have been performed on non-irradiated samples in high vacuum inside of a Zeiss Ultra Plus SEM using a micro-test rig (MTR-3) developed by MicroTesting Solutions (Hilliard, OH, USA) at the Institute of Materials Engineering at ANSTO. Samples were subjected to elongation using an in-house fabricated tungsten gripper. The specimen was pulled at a displacement controlled (piezoelectric feedback control loop) rate of 20 nm/s, equating to an approximate strain rate of                                                   &nbsp;= 1.2 x 10<sup>-3</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>. High definition SEM images (2048 x 1535 pixels) were acquired at small strain intervals during the tests. For each image, the load recorded at the start of acquisition can be used to calculate the engineering stress. The mechanical properties elastic modulus, yield strength, uniform elongation, ductility, and failure stress will be determined from engineering stress versus engineering strain curves in order to quantify orientation effects and misorientation angles.</p> <p>Two non-irradiated specimens were tested to failure. They failed rather abruptly along grain boundary interfaces with minimal plasticity beyond yielding. The average failure strength of the specimens was 1542 &plusmn; 143 MPa. Pre- and post-test SEM images and IPF plots in the tensile loading direction along with a nominal displacement versus engineering stress loading curve can be seen for one tested specimen. Testing of the rest of the control specimens and irradiated specimens is ongoing via the help of Dhriti Bhattacharyya and Alan Xu. The results will be analysed in terms of the change in strength and ductility of the specimens due to irradiation and the contribution of bubbles and displacement damage. The effect of orientation and the role of grain boundaries in the deformation and fracture mechanisms will also be studied.
