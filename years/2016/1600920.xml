<AbstractNarration>This project will investigate the genetic factors that cause elaborated bone pattern in fish fins. Bone pattern elaboration results from increases in bone numbers and connections, and such research is important for understanding processes of both evolution and development. In evolution, increase in the number of bones arranged end-to-end helped transform fins into limbs and aided the colonization of land by extinct vertebrates. In development, normal function and movement depends upon formation of the proper bone numbers and connections, and defective development can lead to severe impairment. Currently, the mechanisms that led to elaboration of the fin skeleton to form limbs are unknown. To identify the genetic factors involved, the researchers will study strains of the model species, zebrafish, that have genetic changes that result in the formation of new fin bones. They will also investigate naturally occurring variation in two species, gar and bowfin, that have different numbers of bones extending from the shoulder. These complementary approaches will reveal the mechanisms regulating growth and formation of the skeleton of fins and limbs, and show how simple genetic changes can lead to the formation of limbs from fins. Understanding the mechanisms of bone pattern elaboration and development has implications for human health and developmental abnormalities, and may provide clues for the evolution of life on land. Additionally, the project will provide research opportunities for Native American undergraduates. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While tetrapod vertebrates have increased the number of bones along the proximo-distal (P-D) axis of the limb, teleost fishes such as the zebrafish have reduced the pectoral fin skeleton; only a single long bone is found along the P-D axis. The researchers performed a forward mutagenesis screen in zebrafish and isolated a novel mutant that forms supernumerary bones along the P-D axis of the fin through a process similar to that seen in the development of tetrapod limbs. The proposed research will extend results from mutant analysis to natural populations to determine if the mutation is producing supernumerary bones by activating ancestral genetic mechanisms. Transcriptome profiling by RNA sequencing will be used to compare gene-expression levels in the developing pectoral fins of wild-type and mutant zebrafish, as well as two species that exhibit natural variation in P-D axis elaboration. This analysis will reveal patterns of differential gene expression that correlate with P-D axis elaboration. Differentially expressed genes will be tested in the zebrafish to determine if their modified expression has an effect on fin morphology. This study will elucidate how additive phenotypic changes arise in development and identify candidate pathways by which additional fin/limb bones are formed in both evolution and disease.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Brent Hawkins is pursuing research for his doctoral dissertation, "Latent potential for limb-like development in the zebrafish revealed through single mutations," which has been supported by an NSF Dissertation Improvement Grant.  Brent is a graduate student in the Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology (OEB) at Harvard University, where he is jointly supervised by James Hanken (OEB) and Matthew Harris of the Department of Genetics at Harvard Medical School.  Brent expects to complete his dissertation in spring 2019.  The addition of new bones along the length of appendages underscores many key transformations in vertebrate evolution, such as the transition of fins into limbs.  Despite this importance, genetic mechanisms that can cause such changes are unknown.  Brent?s project seeks to identify exactly these mechanisms by comparing laboratory as well as natural populations of fish species that exhibit variation in the number of bones along the length of their pectoral fins.  He is using next-generation sequencing to determine what genes are expressed in developing fins and how these genes change in animals with additional bones.  He is focusing his study on two zebrafish (Danio rerio) mutants that form new fin bones in a limb-like manner, and on natural populations of bowfin (Amia calva) and gar (Lepisosteus osseus), two species that exhibit natural differences in the number of fin long bones.  Due to unexpected difficulties in collecting wild specimens of one species in the field, Brent has so far succeeded in generating data sets from zebrafish and bowfin but not gar.  However, he has initiated a new collaboration with an experienced investigator who should be able to assist Brent in acquiring needed material from gar.  Analysis of these data sets is ongoing.  This project is providing Brent with graduate-level training and experience in the handling and analysis of next-generation transcriptome data sets and contributing to our understanding of the mechanisms underlying vertebrate evolution.  In addition, it has the potential to impact human health.  Limb defects are amongst the most common congenital abnormalities in humans.  Brent?s project has the potential to increase our understanding of conditions in which the number of limb bones is modified, such as hyperphalangy.  Data generated as part of Brent?s dissertation will be made publicly available on open-source repositories.       Last Modified: 10/15/2018       Submitted by: James Hanken]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
