<AbstractNarration>This award supports a two-day workshop for NSF-Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Physics Site directors both to discuss effective practices in the current REU programs as well as to learn more about effective practices in programs outside of the NSF-REU Physics Sites. In particular, the participants will learn about current results in assessment of undergraduate research experiences and programs that have increased the diversity in undergraduate research programs from other disciplines and discuss how to adapt/adopt these ideas for Physics REU sites. Participants will discuss the current challenges and opportunities they face in their individual programs as well as challenges faced by the Physics REU-Site program as a whole and devise a plan for addressing these issues. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program serves the national interests by not only promoting the advancement of science carried out at the REU Sites by research mentors and their undergraduate proteges, but by training the next generation of science researchers.  In addition, the report developed as a part of this project will be a resource that all Physics undergraduate research programs (not just NSF REU sites) can utilize to improve their undergraduate research programs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   This grant helped to establish and maintain a national community of programs that provide summer Physics research opportunities for undergraduates. The NSF Physics REU Leadership Group (NPRLG) helps coordinate efforts across the ~60 Physics REU (Research Experiences for Undergraduates) sites and works to increase the efficacy of each site through shared resources and common best practices.  Approximately 50 Physics REU sites are members of the NPRLG.  A group of three physics REU site directors serve on the NPRLG Executive Committee (EC) and, along with representatives from the (APS) American Physical Society, help coordinate NPRLG?s efforts.   This grant primarily funded an in-person meeting of the Physics NSF REU directors community, held in 2016.  A large fraction of current REU sites were represented at this meeting.  During the meeting, sites voted to establish the NPRLG and the initial Executive Committee, learned of best practices, discussed issues relevant to their REU programs, and identified a list of action items for the NPRLG to pursue in the following years. The NPRLG accomplished the following actions identified at this meeting:   Established a common notification date for all domestic Physics REU applicants (solving a long-standing problem for students who are accepted at multiple sites with widely differing deadlines)   Piloted a common program assessment tool to help standardize our assessment practices and ensure the use of validated assessment questions   Instituted an online discussion forum for all Physics REU sites in order to increase the speed and efficiency of communication and allow sites to quickly get answers to REU-related questions    Created a shared online storage space containing resources and documents that are useful for REU sites? operations      Instituted annual videoconference meetings to discuss common issues and keep the community connected between in-person meetings   Additionally, the NPRLG continues to identify and implement new areas where they can help improve the efficiency of the REU community.  Examples include collaborative recruitment of students and video conferences specifically meant to assist new sites in setting up their programs.  The NPRLG and the in-person meeting(s) are primarily aimed for REU site directors, but are open to anyone who is involved in a research program with undergraduate students.  More information, including the outcomes from our 2016 meeting, are available to anyone on our webpage.  Through the work of the NPRLG, we positively impact a large and diverse group of undergraduate students (roughly 10 students per REU site, or roughly 600 students, each year) from all across the country, by working to improve their interactions with the Physics REU programs and improving their summer research experiences.
