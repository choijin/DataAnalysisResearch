<AbstractNarration>Electric motors consume nearly fifty percent of the electricity that is generated worldwide. Integration of adjustable speed motor drives plays a pivotal role in increasing efficiency, reliability and performance in these energy converters and is considered a necessary step in the future energy systems across the globe.  Electrified transportation, home appliances and industrial drives are among the primary candidates for this transformation. Switched reluctance motor (SRM) drives can provide a low cost, robust and fault tolerant solution for these applications. However, high levels of acoustic noise and vibration in this family of drives has limited their use in many applications. This project addresses this shortcoming by introducing a new computational tool that will allow for optimal tuning of the design and control to minimize this undesirable feature of SRM drives. It is hoped that effective use of the proposed method will open new horizons for integration of this technology in various sectors of the industry, thereby providing a low cost and highly efficient alternative for use in affordable and energy saving products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed method is based on the use of the electromechanical impulse response for machine modeling and analysis. This innovative tool provides an experimentally measurable link between the terminals of the power electronic converter and acceleration of the stator frame. This, in turn, will allow for online tuning of the vibration and acoustic noise that is generated by virtue of the radial and tangential vibrations in the stator frame of SRM drives. Furthermore, the proposed method substantially reduces the computational efforts in optimal design of the electromechanical features of SRM drives. In addition, cross coupling between the rotor and stator and nonlinear dynamics of the SRM drive will be taken into account in the work. Furthermore, the impact of wide-bandgap devices on structural response of SRM drives will be investigated. The proposed method will be investigated through detailed multi-physics finite element analysis and experiments. Successful completion of this project will (a) create new opportunities in applying the proposed method to other electric motors, inductors, transformers and generators; (b) educate a new generation of motor experts with insightful understanding of electromechanical energy conversion, vibration and power electronics; and (c) provide a better understanding of magneto-structural phenomena in electric machines and adjustable speed drives.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Acoustic noise and radial vibration of switched reluctance motor (SRM) drives are the main hurdles for massive integration of this robust technology in a wide range of applications. The acoustic noise in SRM drives is mainly due to radial vibration of the stator housing during turn-off process (high pitch component of the noise) and torque pulsation which induces acoustic noise and vibration from bearing and end caps. In this project a new numerical tool named mechanical impulse response (MIR) has been developed and deployed to accurately predict the radial vibration of the stator. Using MIR an optimal switching pattern has been designed and developed to actively mitigate the radial vibration of the statorframe and its corresponding acoustic noise. Furthermore, using a novel geometry for the rotor, a series of optimally designed flux barriers have smooth the torque angle characteristic into a symmetric form, thereby substantially removing the torque pulsation (by as much as 65%). The above mentioned techniaues do not introduce any additional cost, hardware, penalty to torque density, or reduction of efficiency. The control and design methods accomplished in this project, introduces a new family of the SRM drives which do not suffer from conventional acoustic noise issues and maintain advantages of the SR-technology such as low cost, wide speed range in constant power region, and robust/rugged structure.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/18/2019<br>      Modified by: Babak&nbsp;Fahimi</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1610287/1610287_10436878_1568830488227_image1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1610287/1610287_10436878_1568830488227_image1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="reduction of radial acceleration by optimal switching"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1610287/1610287_10436878_1568830488227_image1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="reduction of radial acceleration by optimal switching"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">reduction of radial acceleration in SRM drive by optimal switching, top (estimated accelartion using IMR), middle (acceleration before optimal control, bottom (radial acceleration after optimal switching)</div> <div class="imageCredit">babak fahimi</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Babak&nbsp;Fahimi</div> <div class="imageTitle">reduction of radial acceleration by optimal switching</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1610287/1610287_10436878_1568830569397_image2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1610287/1610287_10436878_1568830569397_image2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="measured frequency domain acceleration"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1610287/1610287_10436878_1568830569397_image2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="measured frequency domain acceleration"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">reduction of radial acceleration in frequency domain</div> <div class="imageCredit">babak fahimi</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Babak&nbsp;Fahimi</div> <div class="imageTitle">measured frequency domain acceleration</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1610287/1610287_10436878_1568830668341_image3--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1610287/1610287_10436878_1568830668341_image3--rgov-800width.jpg" title="acoustic image-before"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1610287/1610287_10436878_1568830668341_image3--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="acoustic image-before"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">acoustic image of SRM before tuning</div> <div class="imageCredit">babak fahimi</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Babak&nbsp;Fahimi</div> <div class="imageTitle">acoustic image-before</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1610287/1610287_10436878_1568830717012_image4--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1610287/1610287_10436878_1568830717012_image4--rgov-800width.jpg" title="acoustic image after tuning"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1610287/1610287_10436878_1568830717012_image4--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="acoustic image after tuning"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">acoustic image after optimal tuning</div> <div class="imageCredit">babak fahimi</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Babak&nbsp;Fahimi</div> <div class="imageTitle">acoustic image after tuning</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1610287/1610287_10436878_1568830776253_image5--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1610287/1610287_10436878_1568830776253_image5--rgov-800width.jpg" title="reduction of torque pulsation by optimal design of the rotor"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1610287/1610287_10436878_1568830776253_image5--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="reduction of torque pulsation by optimal design of the rotor"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">torque pulsation of the SRM before and after optimization of the rotor</div> <div class="imageCredit">babak fahimi</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Babak&nbsp;Fahimi</div> <div class="imageTitle">reduction of torque pulsation by optimal design of the rotor</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
