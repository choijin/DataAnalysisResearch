<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this project spans various segments i.e. consumer, environment&lt;br/&gt;monitoring, healthcare, infrastructure monitoring, automotive, smart cities, agriculture, power generation,&lt;br/&gt;oil and gas, industrial automation/manufacturing, retail, and robotics to name a few. Over the past several&lt;br/&gt;decades, wireless connectivity has played a significant role in reshaping our social lives and generating&lt;br/&gt;huge economic value for businesses all around the globe. The wireless connectivity has been focused&lt;br/&gt;around human-to-human communication but in the next decade machine-to-machine communication will&lt;br/&gt;play a significant role in the fourth industrial revolution. The proposed R&amp;D will enable the vision of&lt;br/&gt;ubiquitous connectivity at scale, which the Internet of Things promises. The Internet of Things (IoT)&lt;br/&gt;economic impact is projected to be anywhere between $7-15 trillion globally in the next decade and the&lt;br/&gt;impact of it will be felt by virtually every industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will address the two key problems with the&lt;br/&gt;current state-of-the-art wireless sensor nodes. First is the limited battery-life and second is the cost of the&lt;br/&gt;sensor nodes. Low power standard compliant wireless communication plays a key role in extending the&lt;br/&gt;battery-life of a wireless sensor node. Experience with semiconductors dictates that complete system&lt;br/&gt;integration on a single piece of silicon (zero external components) not only reduces the cost of the system&lt;br/&gt;(in high volume) but also improves the systems? overall energy efficiency. This enables operation on&lt;br/&gt;harvested energy requiring no external battery. No external components imply that the microsystem needs&lt;br/&gt;to operate from energy sources with limited capacity. No external components also imply no quartz crystal&lt;br/&gt;frequency reference, which almost every microsystem uses as of today for frequency and timing reference.&lt;br/&gt;Off-chip crystal is a bulky component that poses a severe size limitation for low-profile millimeter scale&lt;br/&gt;microsystems. Eliminating off-chip crystal is a significant step forward towards energy autonomous&lt;br/&gt;millimetre-scale microsystems that have widespread commercial applications.</AbstractNarration>
