<AbstractNarration>Pepperwood is a leader in advancing science-based conservation throughout the Northern California region and beyond (see www.pepperwoodpreserve.org). The purpose of this project is to build on Pepperwood's experience using its 3120-acre research reserve to advance long-term climate research and environmental education for all ages.  Pepperwood will use NSF funds provided by this award to develop a five-year strategic plan to increase its impact in terms of publishing scientific results, engaging diverse students, and forging conservation applications with land and water management partners.  The Pepperwood team will seek input from the scientific community, business leaders, and technology experts. The results will be integrated into a comprehensive planning document that addresses how to achieve targeted science and education outcomes in partnership with the California Academy of Sciences, the Santa Rosa Junior College, University of California, federal and state agencies, and others.  This project will strengthen Pepperwood's role in improving the health and prosperity of the region and the nation as a whole through science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pepperwood will develop a five-year strategic plan for its center of operations, the Dwight Center for Conservation Science, and its 3120-acre research reserve located in California's Coast Ranges. The goal is to advance the station's role as an emerging leader in real-time climate change research and applications for the region. Proposed planning activities include 1) consulting with scientific advisors to define a century-scale vision for making a scientific impact, 2) locating models and selecting best practices for excellence in field station management and operations, 3) seeking expert advice on data management to incorporate resilient hardware, software and communications networks to store and disseminate research results and long-term monitoring data, 4) consulting business experts on how to leverage revenue generation strategies specific to our non-profit context, and 5) synthesizing these planning elements into a five-year comprehensive strategic plan in concert with research, education, community, and government stakeholders.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Pepperwood has developed a five-year (2020-2025) Strategic Plan for its center of operations, the Dwight Center for Conservation Science, and its 3120-acre research reserve located in Sonoma County of the Californian Coast Ranges. Originally founded via a legacy gift to the California Academy of Sciences, Pepperwood fills a critical field station niche situated in the heart of Northern California's biodiversity hot spot. The Pepperwood Foundation was created in 2005 to establish Pepperwood as a regional ecology institute, featuring a dynamic <em>Sentinel Site</em> system to measuring the impact of climate change on natural resources. Pepperwood also provides meaningful research and education experiences in partnership with residents, citizen scientists, students, teachers, universities, and resource agencies.&nbsp; Pepperwood's public engagement programs are dedicated to diversifying the community of future science, technology, engineering, math and conservation professionals.</p> <p>Pepperwood's Strategic Plan builds on our role as an emerging leader in real-time climate change and fire research critical to understanding how our local watersheds and ecosystems are responding to increasing climate variability and hazards. Key activities included 1) engaging scientists to set research priorities, 2) identifying best practices for field station management, 3) gaining expert advice on environmental monitoring and communication technologies, 4) consulting non-profit business experts, and 5) and synthesizing this input into a five-year comprehensive strategic plan (featuring business, field station, and program elements) in concert with our research, education, community, and government stakeholders.</p> <p>This NSF-funded project was punctuated by the unprecedented Northern California fire season of 2017, which engulfed our reserve and necessitated a complete rebuild of the field sensor and communications comprising the Pepperwood Climate-Ecosystem Sentinel Site and over half of our other operational facilities.&nbsp; Our community is now relying on us more than ever as a source of high quality data to inform long-term climate and fire resilience strategies.
