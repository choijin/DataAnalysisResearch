<AbstractNarration>This proposal requests funding for a conference to be held in conjunction with the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) annual meeting to take place in San Francisco, CA, November 16, 2016.  The Conference is entitled "Bay Area Biotechnology Topical Conference" with the goal to create a unique environment for companies and small businesses operating at the forefront of synthetic biology to come together share ideas, network with AIChE affiliates, and interface with students to educate and recruit the next generation  of scientists and engineers in this area.  In addition, this will include a SBIR/STTR program workshop and networking event to include current SBIR grantees and prospective small businesses interested in learning more about the SBIR/STTR programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed conference offers a unique opportunity for companies to showcase their capabilities to a diverse audience of chemical engineers from academia and industry while also identifying potential partnerships. The Workshop on SBIR/STTR grant opportunities will allow start-up companies dominating the synthetic-biology space to learn about obtaining seed funding from the NSF. Finally, through the speaker presentations, students and post-docs in attendance will connect academic exploration of synthetic biology into commercial ventures and the challenges of creating business models and identifying appropriate markets.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Bay Area Biotechnology Topical Conference at the 2016 AIChE Annual Meeting  Wednesday, November 3, 2016  San Francisco, CA  Outcomes Report  The Bay Area Biotechnology Topical Conference at the 2016 AIChE Annual Meeting was held on Wednesday, November 16, 2016 at the Hilton San Francisco Union Square, in San Francisco, CA. It was organized jointly by the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) and AIChE?s Food, Pharmaceutical &amp; Bioengineering Division (FP&amp;BE). The topical conference was chaired by Chase Beisel, Assistant Professor, Department of Chemical &amp; Biomolecular Engineering, North Carolina State University.  The topical conference was organized by an interdisciplinary committee of academic and industrial researchers representing a wide range of interests with an underlying theme of synthetic biology. This composition was chosen in order to ensure that invited participants were of a diverse scientific background and highly regarded by the scientific community for the quality and novelty of their current research. The Technical Advisory Committee ensured the success of the conference.       Name     Affiliation     Department/Division       Dr. Chase Beisel     North Carolina State   University    Chemical &amp; Biomolecular   Eng      Dr. Yvonne Chen    University of California, Los   Angeles    Chemical &amp; Biomolecular   Eng      Dr. Amy Karlsson    University of Maryland,   College Park    Chemical &amp; Biomolecular   Eng      Dr. Sherry Yang    Amgen    Process Development      Dr. Kristy Hawkins    Antheia    n/a      Dr. Smruti Phadnis    Agilent Research Laboratories    n/a        The Bay Area Biotechnology Topical Conference follows the success of previous topical conferences held at the AIChE Annual Meeting over several years on the topic of Emerging Frontiers in Systems and Synthetic Biology.  The objective of the topical conference was to create a unique environment in which companies and small businesses operating at the forefront of synthetic biology can come together to share ideas and challenges, network with the diverse people affiliated with AIChE, and interface with students to educate and recruit the next generation of scientists and engineers. Despite the connection between chemical engineers and the synthetic biology companies, there has been a lack of participation of these companies at the AIChE Annual Meeting. Because of this focus, chemical engineering students and researchers are less aware of the commercialization of synthetic biology, while start-ups, small businesses, and large companies are missing the diverse expertise represented at the AIChE Annual Meeting. The topical conference addressed this disconnect while also providing a forum for synthetic biology start-ups and small businesses to interface with each other.  A unique mix of small-businesses devoted to synthetic biology had the opportunity to interact in a short-term program that led to intensive, one-on-one and small-group discussions. We also created a balance of speakers of different genders, backgrounds, career stages, and expertise, which can lend to greater sharing of unique perspectives and experiences. Finally, because of the large representation of academics at the AIChE Annual Meeting, these companies could access the diverse expertise in upstream and downstream processing as well as the newest research tools and methodologies that could be incorporated into each business.  The AIChE Annual Meeting brings together thousands of chemical engineers, from professors, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows to industrial professionals, representing disciplines ranging from large-scale chemical processes and oil extraction to atmospheric chemistry and biotechnology, making it the perfect venue for an associated topical conference on this topic.  The topical conference brought together over 60 attendees, with a focus on attendees and speakers from companies in the San Francisco Bay Area. The attendees were leading practitioners and researchers in the field of synthetic biology, as well as young investigators including graduate students. The one-day event will covered a diverse range of topics within a unifying theme of commercializing synthetic biology.  The Bay Area Biotechnology Topical Conference program was composed of three sessions, a workshop on NSF SBIR/STTR grant opportunities, and a networking session and reception that allowed for extended discussion and networking between participants. Twenty invited speakers represented diverse industries and markets, including microbial engineering, cell-free systems, drug discovery, antimicrobials, apparel, specialty chemicals, therapeutics, crop production, and probiotics and came from a wide range of small businesses and large companies such as:     Agilent Technologies Amyris AsilomarBio Autodesk Life Sciences Antheia Bolt Threads Boston Mountain Biotech De Novo DNA Genentech General Probiotics Genomatica Ginkgo Bioworks Manus Bio Muse Bio SecondGenome Synthego Twist Bioscience Zymergen      Topics discussed included:     Biotechnology for Energy, Chemicals, and Materials Biomedical Diagnostics and Therapeutics Biotechnology Platforms, Reagents, and Research Products  NSF SBIR/STTR grant opportunities      Complete information about the topical conference can be found on the website of the 2016 AIChE Annual Meeting:  www.aiche.org/conferences/aiche-annual-meeting/2016/new-topical-conferences-2016 aiche.confex.com/aiche/2016/webprogram/TA.html      Access to the conference proceedings can be found at the following link:  www.aiche.org/conferences/aiche-annual-meeting/2016/proceeding/group/bay-area-biotechnology       Last Modified: 05/30/2017       Submitted by: Stephanie Orvoine-Couvrette]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
