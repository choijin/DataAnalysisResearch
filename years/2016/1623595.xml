<AbstractNarration>A team of scientists from the University of Massachusetts, Columbia University and William and Mary College will use new molecular techniques to reconstruct the past history of environmental changes in the Faroe Islands, a key location in the migration of people across the North Atlantic.  Recent archeological research has found intriguing evidence that the first settlers on the islands arrived before the 9th century Norse settlers, but little is known about their impact on the environment, and what animals they might have brought with them.  The research will focus on lake sediments that provide a record of natural and human-induced environmental changes over time.  The research will contribute to studies of how humans adapt to environmental changes in marginal island environments, by examining the timing and history of environmental impacts, and the development of strategies that have allowed limited natural resources to be used sustainably for more than a thousand years.  The project will involve collaboration with archeologists in the Faroe Islands, to prepare related educational materials for display in their National Museum, and will provide unique opportunities for undergraduate students to participate in the research and public outreach activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Faroe Islands represented an important "stepping stone" in the westward migration of people into Iceland, Greenland, and North America, so the timing of settlement in the Faroes has particular significance for an understanding of North Atlantic colonization.  The research will provide new information about when settlers first arrived in the Faroe Islands, the type of animals that accompanied them, their use of fire to modify the local vegetation cover, and how these events relate to past climate variations in this remote region.  The researchers will extract organic molecules preserved in lake sediments to obtain records that indicate the presence of human settlers. This will include compounds that are produced in the intestines of people, pigs and grazing animals (sheep, goats and cattle), and molecules related to the burning of peat and shrubs.  Other compounds will indicate changes in the composition of vegetation.  The research will also focus on DNA in the sediments, to identify the presence and types of animals that may have been brought to the islands by the first settlers.  The sediments will be dated using radiocarbon, and volcanic ash from Icelandic eruptions of known age.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The Faroe Islands are a remote archipelago in the North Atlantic, between Norway and Iceland.

By examining the materials that have accumulated as lake sediments over the past few thousand years near a Viking-age farm site, we determined that people arrived to the Faroe islands approximately 300 years before the Viking voyages into the North Atlantic. Our evidence comes from molecular remains that indicate the presence of livestock and from the identification of sheep DNA in the lake sediments beginning at 500 A.D., before the Vikings had the sea-faring technology to make the voyage. It is therefore likely that travelers from the British Isles were the first occupants of the Faroe Islands whose presence is detected in the lake sediments.

In addition to providing strong new evidence to document and refine the human history of the North Atlantic region, this project also resulted in a new records showing how climate changed in the region over the past 10,000 years and how this compares to climate in the region during the last period of global warmth (the last interglacial period), approximately 125,000 years ago.
