<AbstractNarration>1604471 PI: Tenhaeff&lt;br/&gt;Title: Solid Polymer Thin Film Electrolytes to Enable 3D Lithium Ion Batteries&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The miniaturization of microelectronic devices and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) has enabled the development of multi-billion dollar industries that commercialized remarkable technologies, including distributed sensors, implantable biomedical devices, wearable electronics, and "the internet of things". Three-dimensional lithium ion batteries (3D batteries) are envisioned as incredibly flexible energy storage devices to power the next generation of ubiquitous microelectronic devices and MEMS. The fabrication of 3D batteries requires breakthroughs in the preparation of ultrathin, solid-state electrolytes. This project focuses on the understanding and controlling polymer thin film synthesis via initiated chemical vapor deposition (iCVD) to enable precise fabrication of electrolyte materials for 3D batteries. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A key scientific objective of the proposed project is to understand how the chemical, physical, and electrochemical properties of ultrathin polymer electrolytes must be synthetically controlled via iCVD to achieve stable, reversible electrochemical cycling in solid-state 3D lithium ion batteries. These ultrathin polymer electrolytes will be subsequently integrated into two-dimensional thin film batteries in order to further understand materials requirements imposed by the energy storage electrodes and thin film processing. The ultimate objective is to fabricate complete, full 3D battery cells and study the influence of 3D architectures on electrochemical performance and correlated effects. Optimization of materials and cell designs will be performed to maximize 3D battery performance.  New insights into fundamental structure-property-function relations emerging from the proposed study may have significant potential to advance the fabrication of 3D batteries as well as a wide range of other devices. The PI plans to train graduate students, engage undergraduate students in research, and develop a new iCVD module for the undergraduate Reaction Engineering and Reactor Design course.  A proposed outreach effort will focus on engaging underrepresented minority students from the Rochester City School District.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The project, "Solid Polymer Thin Film Electrolytes to Enable 3D Lithium Ion Batteries," sought to develop novel thin film polymer electrolytes for next generation 3D microbatteries and larger format lithium ion cells. The overall objective of the proposal was to understand synthesis-structure-property relationships of polymeric thin film electrolytes prepared using a vacuum deposition technology called initiated chemical vapor deposition (iCVD). In the latter phases of the project, lithium phosphorous oxynitride (Lipon), a glassy, inorganic thin film electrolyte material, was also studied.&nbsp;</p> <p>For 3D microbatteries, ultrathin lithium ion conducting polyelectrolytes based on poly(methacrylic acid-co-ethylene glycol diacrylate) were prepared. A key outcome of this work was the development of a solution-based approach to ion exchange the protons of methacrylic acid for Li<sup>+</sup>. Crosslinking (ethylene glycol diacrylate component) was required for physical stability, and the influence of crosslinker composition on the overall lithium ion conductivity was studied. The ability to conformally coat the electrolytes on complex, three-dimensional electrode architectures was also demonstrated (Figure 1). However, the maximum room temperature conductivity achieved was 1x10<sup>-8</sup> S/cm, which is too low for implementation into practical electrochemical cells and realization of reasonable storage capacities. Because crosslinking is required for physical stability during the Li<sup>+</sup> incorporation, a path to 3D microbatteries with practical power performance was not identified.</p> <p>The project transitioned to the development of ultrathin polymeric artificial solid electrolyte interphases (ASEIs) for Si anodes. Si is the next-generation anode for lithium ion batteries, but a critical issue is Si's non-passivating surface chemistry that results in significant electrolyte degradation and formation of resistive interfaces. A polymeric ASEI based on poly(1,3,5,7-tetravinyl-1,3,5,7-tetramethylcyclotetrasiloxane) (pV4D4) with a tunable thickness from approximately 10 to 50 nm was developed. It was shown that 25 nm-thick pV4D4 films reduce the irreversible capacity due to electrolyte degradation, resulting in better charge capacity retention over 100 cycles (Figure 2). This was attributed to the dense morphology of the pV4D4 films, which accomodated transport of the Li<sup>+</sup> but largely occluded the electrolyte solvent. Post-mortem compositional analysis confirmed the mitigation of solvent degradation.</p> <p>In the last phase of the project, inorganic films of Lipon were studied. Like pV4D4, Lipon has a dense morphology; it is a lithium ion conductor but is impermeable to organic solvents. There is significant interest in coupling Lipon to liquid electrolytes to create hybrid electrolytes for advanced lithium metal batteries. Lipon is chemically stable with Li metal and can be used to protect Li in liquid electrolytes. The chemical and physical stability of Lipon was studied in several common liquid electrolyte compositions, and it was shown that in the absence of HF-generating salts, Lipon is stable and negligible resistance develops at the Lipon/liquid interface. However, in electrolytes with LiPF<sub>6</sub> salts, HF can form through reactions with trace moisture contamination, leading to Lipon degradation and the formation of resistive interfaces. The ability of Lipon to promote the electrodeposition of Li metal into smooth morphologies at its interface with a current collector was demonstrated. Studies of the lithium deposition behavior at this Lipon/current collector interface showed that Li's nucleation phenomena on the current collector is an important factor in achieving smooth, planar, mirror-like Li deposit morphologies.</p> <p>Considering broader impacts, this project developed novel polymeric thin film materials for advanced electrochemical energy storage applications. Further engineering and development is required to utilize these new materials in practical battery cells, but the knowledge that was developed is expected to have an enduring impact in the energy storage field. The results of this project were reported in four peer-reviewed journal publications, three Ph.D. theses at the University of Rochester, and numerous seminars and presentations, including poster and oral presentations at national science conferences. The project supported the training of three Ph.D. students, two of whom are from underrepresented populations in the STEM fields. Beyond the training of Ph.D. students, the project provided independent research opportunities for two M.S. students and three undergraduate students. Four additional undergraduate students had the opportunity to participate in the project by leveraging the project with their Senior capstone design project. The team developed an experimental apparatus to characterize the glass transition temperature of polymer thin films using variable temperature multi-wavelength interferometry. They designed the hardware and control software to measure film thickness as a function of temperature.</p> <p>In addition to these research activities, the project also supported outreach activities for high school students in the Rochester City School District. Paired with the University of Rochester's Kearns Center <em>Upward Bound </em>program, these students learned about polymeric materials through a mixture of lecture and hands-on lab activities.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/19/2020<br>      Modified by: Wyatt&nbsp;Tenhaeff</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1604471/1604471_10435302_1602870191959_Figure1-alt--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1604471/1604471_10435302_1602870191959_Figure1-alt--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1604471/1604471_10435302_1602870191959_Figure1-alt--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">SEM micrograph of carbon nanofiber electrode conformally coated with poly(methacrylic acid-co-ethylene glycol diacrylate) by initiated chemical vapor deposition.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Yifan Gao</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Wyatt&nbsp;Tenhaeff</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure1</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1604471/1604471_10435302_1602871017049_InkedFigure2-edit_LI--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1604471/1604471_10435302_1602871017049_InkedFigure2-edit_LI--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 2"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1604471/1604471_10435302_1602871017049_InkedFigure2-edit_LI--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 2"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">(A) Specific capacity and (B) coulombic efficiency of Si anodes as a function of thickness of ultrathin pV4D4 coatings, prepared by iCVD.
