<AbstractNarration>Despite widespread dissemination of best-practice standards for conducting forensic interviews, many jurisdictions lack the expertise to skillfully investigate crimes involving child witnesses.  An efficient way to ensure that all jurisdictions have access to highly trained child interviewers is to conduct remote (live-streaming video) forensic interviews.  Remote interviewing could reduce investigative response time, spare investigative resources, and accelerate case disposition.  However, the ability of remote interviewing to elicit eyewitness evidence from children has not been sufficiently tested and, therefore, will certainly prompt challenges regarding children?s testimonial reliability.  The current project is a comprehensive and theoretically grounded evaluation of the effectiveness of remote interviewing of child witnesses.  Results will be disseminated to scientists and forensic professionals through publications and presentations, thereby informing policies and guidelines for the use of remote forensic interviews with children.  Because remote interviewing increases access to specialized expertise, project results will also impact how children are questioned by electronic means in non-forensic contexts.  The project will provide research training to dozens of students at two research sites and promote greater awareness of evidence-based practice through outreach to practitioners who work with child witnesses. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using an established paradigm that produces salient touching experiences, individual children at two sites (ages 4 to 8 years) will be told that a male assistant can no longer touch their skin when he delivers a germ education program.  The assistant will touch each child once and realize an impending mistake before he completes a second touch.  Afterward, children will hear a story from their parents that contains misinformation about the experience, including narrative about a nonexperienced touch.  During interviews conducted in traditional face-to-face or remote formats, children will answer questions about the germ education event and answer a series of questions that tests their ability to distinguish experienced from suggested events.  By comparing the completeness and accuracy of children?s testimonies across formats, this study will determine whether remote interviewing elicits testimony that is comparable in quality to the testimony elicited by face-to-face interviewing.  Measures of behavioral inhibition and executive function will determine whether remote interviewing is beneficial for children who are behaviorally inhibited or contraindicated for typically-developing children who have poor cognitive control.</AbstractNarration>

These conversations typically occur face-to-face, but in-person interviewing may not be optimal when children or their caregivers have a communicable disease, during disease outbreaks, when children are out of local jurisdiction, or when jurisdictions lack the expertise needed to talk with a young witness about the matters under investigation. Reassured by the use of tele-conferencing in health and mental health settings, some jurisdictions adopted tele-forensic interviewing during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, few studies have compared the quality of testimony elicited from children who participated in face-to-face and tele-forensic interviews.&nbsp;</p> <p class="Body">This study of eyewitness testimony across interview modes enrolled 261 children from two research sites. During a first laboratory session, 4- to 8-year-olds individually experienced a hands-on educational program about germs and good hygiene. Before each child participated, a research assistant explained that Mr. Science (the man delivering the program) should not touch the child while helping with the activities. Mr. Science then broke this rule when he touched the child's cheek, and later he reached for a handshake but caught his mistake before touching. About 2 weeks after these events, a parent twice read a story to the child about the laboratory visit. This story described some accurate and some inaccurate information about the germ education program, including false narrative that Mr. Science shook the child's hand. During a second laboratory visit, each child described events from the first visit during a face-to-face or tele-forensic interview.</p> <p class="Body">Interviewers began each conversation with rapport-building questions, open-ended prompts about a typical school day, and the interview rules (e.g., to not guess). After introducing the topic of the germ education program, each interviewer progressed from open-ended prompts to questions about what the child liked and disliked about Mr. Science, whether someone did something wrong, and whether someone touched the child. Two challenging question sets completed the interview: questions about whether each of 10 events (including experienced and nonexperienced events) had happened (source-monitoring questions) and questions about event details. In the waiting room, a parent provided demographic information about the family, filled out a questionnaire about the child's temperament, and reported the child's exposure to digital devices (using a questionnaire modified with permission from Common Sense Media; Rideout, 2015). Each child also completed tasks that measured developmental maturity (cognitive control).</p> <p>The children's performance was similar across interview modes for many outcome measures. Interview type did not significantly influence the accuracy of their responses to open-ended questions or how often they reported experienced or nonexperienced touching. Also, the children were equally accurate across interview modes on challenging source-monitoring and detail questions. They were more talkative about a typical school day when conversing face-to-face, however, and younger children (4-, -5, and 6-year-olds) said more in response to open-ended prompts about the germ education program when conversing face-to-face. Interview mode also affected how early in interviews the children reported touching. Those younger than 7 years disclosed the face touch and noncompleted handshake more readily when interviewed face-to-face. By contrast, children 8 years and older disclosed the face touch more readily on screen, and older 7-year-olds and 8-year-olds disclosed the noncompleted handshake more readily on screen. Thus, younger and older children reacted differently to screens: Younger children reported transgressions sooner when speaking face-to-face, whereas older children reported transgressions sooner when speaking on screen.</p> <p>Other analyses explored possible reasons why the younger children disclosed earlier in the face-to-face condition.
