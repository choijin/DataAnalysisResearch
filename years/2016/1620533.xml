<AbstractNarration>This project will support attendance by graduate students and postdoctoral researchers at the Gordon Research Conference on Mitochondria and Chloroplasts; Evolution, Biogenesis and Quality Control GRC to be held on June  19-24, 2016 in Mount Snow, Vermont, USA.   The meeting will consist of short talks, poster sessions, communal dining, and conversations that will provide ample opportunity for sharing latest research results and for exploring collaborative possibilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mitochondria and chloroplasts are two organelles that are responsible for energy conversions in the biosphere.  Chloroplasts play essential roles in in converting carbon dioxide into food and mitochondria are involved in converting food into energy stores.  The Broader Impacts of this work involves both the importance of these organelles to the biosphere as well as the training of new scientist to pursue research in these important fields. Cutting-edge or late-breaking research will be highlighted in several short talks chosen from the abstracts. The primary purposes of this conference are to promote discussion between scientists with common professional interests, including those from non-research-intensive colleges and universities, to foster the exchange of ideas from advanced aspects of their field, and to enable scientific collaborations to evolve in new directions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The 2016 Gordon Research Conference on Mitochondria &amp; Chloroplasts assembled an international group of scientists investigating the evolution, biogenesis and quality control of these essential organelles.     This GRC brought together investigators working on mitochondria, chloroplasts and non-photosynthetic plastids in animal, plant, algal and fungal systems with interest in: i) evolution and diversity of organelles of endosymbiotic origin (including apicoplasts and other secondary or even tertiary plastids, ii) transcriptional and translational regulation of organelle biogenesis, protein sorting and assembly into holocompleses and iii) protein maturation and vesicular mechanisms.  Large scale techniques were discussed because they allow comprehensive analysis of transcriptional regulation of organelle biogenesis (e.g. recognition of 'regulons' and associated transcription factors), retrograde organellar signaling, and protein homeostasis (proteostasis) through analysis of protein degradation (e.g. by metabolic labeling and mass spectrometry).  This GRC provided an excellent platform to accelerate discovery of common and unique organellar features and accelerate knowledge transfer between different research communities.  Speakers with international recognition in the field joined young investigators and scientists who have not previously attend this conference.  Fifteen short talks were selected from abstracts to showcase emerging late breaking topics, especially from early career investigators.  Expert Discussion Leaders guided the discussions and the daily poster sessions enriched and stimulated interactions between participants and research communities.   This GRC was preceded by a Gordon Research Seminar which included seminars on organelle biogenesis, homeostasis, dynamics and signaling.
