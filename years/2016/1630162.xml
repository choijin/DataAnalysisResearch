<AbstractNarration>All organisms face uncertainty in their environment, yet their strategies for managing that uncertainty are diverse: some avoid it by only using a narrow range of habitats or resources, while others tolerate it by being flexible and adjusting as conditions change. Understanding how these different strategies arise, and the circumstances that favor one strategy over another, is critical to explain why species live where they do, and how they will respond to future environmental change. In this project, the researchers are studying how plants respond to uncertainty in the amount of water they experience by conducting controlled experiments with plants that occupy seasonally-flooded wetlands in western North America. These plants occupy different habitats within the wetlands - ranging from the deepest to the shallowest positions - and thus are expected to show a range of responses to different water conditions. By evaluating how these plants adjust to uncertainty in soil moisture and flooding, the scientists will gain a general understanding of the different ways that organisms handle changes in their environments. This knowledge is broadly significant for predicting how organisms will respond to future environmental uncertainty, including climate change, habitat loss, and biological invasions. In addition, these results will directly affect the management of plants and animals that occupy wetlands, and the results of this work will be directly communicated to practitioners involved in the conservation and restoration of wetland ecosystems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In these experiments, the investigators manipulate the overall levels of water availability (ranging from drought to flooding), as well as the extent of variability in soil moisture and flooding, in a series of controlled experiments in a growth chamber environment. The study organisms are three annual species of Lasthenia (Asteraceae) that are adapted to different hydrological environments within vernal pool wetlands in California. The researchers will measure the survival and reproductive output of these three species under the different water treatments, while also measuring changes in leaves and root architecture to quantify plant phenotypic responses to fluctuating hydrological conditions. These data will be used to test the hypothesis that phenotypic flexibility (i.e., plasticity in leaf and root traits) will be important for predicting plant performance when water levels fluctuate, but that this plasticity may reduce performance when water levels are constant. We also predict that the three species will exhibit unique responses to the water treatments that reflect adaptations to their respective microhabitats.</AbstractNarration>

Understanding how these different strategies arise, and the circumstances that favor one strategy over another, is critical to explain why species live where they do and how they will respond to future environmental change. In this project, we evaluated how plants respond to uncertainty in the amount of flooding they experience by conducting controlled experiments that manipulated the amount that water levels fluctuated in their environment. We studied plants that occupy seasonally-flooded wetlands in western North America called vernal pools. These wetlands depend on winter rainfall to fill with water each winter, and the depth of water fluctuates between rain events. In California, vernal pools provide habitat to hundreds of unique plants and animals that have adapted to these environments where the amount and duration of flooding is highly unpredictable.</p> <p>We focused on three closely-related plant species that occupy different habitats in vernal pool landscapes: one is found deep in vernal pools, another occurs along the sloped edges of pools, and another lives outside of pools in the surrounding grasslands. We grew all three species in the greenhouse and manipulated the total amount of time they were flooded (simulating different depths within vernal pools) as well as the extent of fluctuations, or variability, they experienced in flooding and soil moisture. Our results indicated that all three species had similar responses to the depth at which they were grown, with longer flooding events having a negative effect on all species? survival and reproductive output. However, the species differed substantially in their responses to variability in flooding: the plants that occupy the most predictable moisture conditions in nature were negatively affected by fluctuations in moisture, while the species that occupies a habitat that consistently experiences fluctuating water levels was unaffected by variability. These responses were largely determined by each species? unique root and leaf characteristics, with these characteristics changing across both experimental treatments and the developmental stages of the plant. Collectively, these results indicate that differences among species in their ability to tolerate environmental uncertainty can be an important, albeit relatively understudied, driver of where they occur in natural environments.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>This knowledge gained in this project is broadly significant for predicting how organisms will respond to future environmental uncertainty, including climate change, habitat loss, and biological invasions. Our efforts to understand water dynamics within complex wetland landscapes has also provided unique insights into how water depth is regulated within wetland systems to ultimately influence plant distribution patterns. More specifically, the insights we have gained about wetland plant species will inform the decisions of land managers who aim to preserve, restore, or create wetland habitat with the goal of supporting native biodiversity. This project has provided numerous interdisciplinary training opportunities for undergraduate, graduate, and post-graduate researchers, including several from underrepresented groups, by providing research experiences that integrate ecology, plant physiology, and hydrology.
