<AbstractNarration>The planned research is to investigate various novel photonic devices based on the radiation pressure created by localized electric fields for development of high sensitivity optical sensors.The approach involves an integrated investigation of thermal-optical-mechanical forces for the development of reconfigurable devices. The analytic and experimental details are adequately addressed and may lead to useful devices as well as new optical science. The proposed effort has strong educational components including collaborative research interactions for underrepresented minorities, high school students and undergrad students. The PI intends to integrate the planned research with student education of nanotechnology and photonics to students at all levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research is based on integration of metallic nanoparticles that act as optical nano-antennae with micro-electro-mechanical systems for unique device functionality for sensing applications. The approach is to employ the plasmonic resonances in these nano-antennae arising from the oscillations of the conduction electrons in metals for making micromechanical resonators optically responsive at the desired wavelength range independent of the optical transparency of constituent mechanical resonator materials. This platform will enable the study of interaction between light and mechanical resonators through optically induced forces as well as the investigation of mechanically tunable optoelectronic devices. If successful, the proposed research could have a transformative impact on unique opto-electro-mechanical sensors with sensitivities far exceeding present-day technologies.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual merits:  Over the course of the project period, we have developed the theoretical and experimental framework needed for the design and fabrication of optomechanical devices that combine the optical resonances of a nanoscale object and mechanical resonances of a host platform. Our succesful effort had led to several publication in prestigious scientific journals in the fields of photonics and nanotechnology.   Our main contributions were 1) the first demontration of the analog of a mechanical laser based on a metamaterial, i.e. an artificial electromagnetic material, 2) 3000x enhancement of optical nonlinearities in monolayer excitonic materials in an optomechanical device, 3) Unidirectional and enhanced emission from monolayer excitonic materials via coupling to unique resonances known as Fano resonances that arise from the hybridization of a broad and a narrow resonance yielding asymmetric lineshapes, 4) Demonstration of the first multimodal sensor based on graphene, an atomically thin lattice of carbon atoms, to achieve electrical, optical, and mechanical detection of low concentrations of proteins.      Broader Impacts:  As a result of this work several students at the postdoctoral, doctoral, and masters level have been trained and joined the academic and high-technology work forces, which are important aspect of maintaining our technological edge as a nation.  In conjunction with these efforts, several courses both at the graduate and undergraduate level were developed based on the topics needed to perform the proposed work.   Our work was presented at various conference to disseminate our findings.          Last Modified: 09/13/2018       Submitted by: Ertugrul Cubukcu]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
