<AbstractNarration>Non-technical:  This award by the Biomaterials program in the Division of Materials Research to the University of Colorado Boulder is to develop a chemical process, which is referred to in the proposal as "liquid crystal autocatalysis." This project explores as the mechanism for the appearance of nucleic acids in the prebiotic era. This proposal is expected to develop the understanding on how a "Liquid Crystal (LC) World" preceded the nucleic acid world by providing its basic molecular design and feedstock. Within the liquid crystal phase, duplex-forming nano-nucleic acids are held in end-to-end contact to a structure that catalytically promotes their chemical ligation, and this forms the basis for an autocatalytic feedback loop. The outcomes from these studies could have potential in offering new tools for in situ synthesis of nucleic acid-based nanotechnology, and potentially leading to a whole new platform for nano-controlled nucleic acid, and assembly/disassembly of nucleic acids for different applications such as drug/gene delivery, bioderived motors, etc. The proposed educational broader impact activities will help to inspire high school students in STEM, and would provide valuable undergraduate research opportunities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Technical: The proposed research program will be focusing on exploring the features of this ancient Liquid Crystal (LC) World and especially its capacity for providing the molecular feedstock for the nucleic acids (NAs) world.  The research will diversify the input chemical stock for starting the LC World by exploring liquid crystal autocatalysis under successively more primitive and diverse initial conditions, beginning with ultra-short duplexing NAs down to single bases, and evolving to mixtures of homologs made with proposed prebiotic synthetic or chemical degradation schemes, with the goal of understanding the robustness of liquid crystal autocatalysis in the presence of chemical noise.  This award will develop the ability of liquid crystal autocatalysis to narrow molecular diversity to generate homogeneous polymer populations such as the nucleic acids. This project will also explore the potential of the LC World for producing nucleic acids with chemically and catalytically active secondary structures, by feeding liquid crystal autocatalytic systems with mixtures of nanonucleic acids that incorporate randomness in sequence and lengths. This approach will enable development of strategies for making chains capable of adopting a secondary structure. This project will investigate the evolution of nucleic acid populations starting under varying conditions of randomness in thermal cycling and ligation, searching for specific subpopulations of sequences or folding motifs.  Finally, new strategies will be explored for catalytic ligation and chemical stabilization of self-assembled DNA. This path has definite potential for technological novelty, offering new tools for in situ synthesis in the hugely expanding field of NA-based nanotechnology, and potentially leading to a whole new platform for nano-controlled NA chemistry.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit   One of the most universal characteristics of things living on Earth is their use of DNA to encode the instructions for their making, and for passing such genetic information on to future generations.  DNA  is a polymer, a flexible chain-like molecule where each link has a molecular side group, A, C, G, or T for short, capable of mutually locking together, A only with T and C only with G.  Since the time of Watson, Crick, Franklin, and Wilkins its been known that this behavior enables the single DNA strands to pair up to form a rigid double helical duplex structure of stacked bases if their sequences of bases along the chains match to enable locking.   The base sequence then is read to make living things and the sequence-selective duplexing enables the information to be copied and passed on.  A key question in understanding the origin of life is how such an information storage and transmission mechanism first appeared in the universe.   To address this question we sought the simplest (pre-life) physical situations in which the basic process of selective molecular pairing could promote the chemical synthesis or stability in the kind of duplex stacking structure found in DNA.  Such a process must clearly start with single bases, which led us on the track of probing and understanding the pairing behavior of shorter and shorter (nanometer length) DNA and RNA, down to single bases  The major goals of this project were to pursue the understanding of the collective interaction and self-assembly of ultra-short nucleic acid oligomers (nanoNAs) in high concentration solution. We created this field to push the frontiers of DNA nanoscience, and to shed new light on the role of collective physical behavior in the origin of life.  We are carrying out a research plan organized around two principal themes: ?Soft materials science of hierarchical self assembly of nanoNAs. and ?NanoNA liquid crystal (LC)-based molecular selection, templating, and autocatalysis.  A basic discovery motivating this project was that just by increasing the concentration of base-like molecules in aqueous solution we could drive ultrashort (nanometer length) DNA to form double helix duplexes of the kind formed by polymeric DNA.  The most important scientific result during the course this project was our discovery of base-stacked duplexes in high concentration solutions of single bases (no polymerization), reported in this publication.

This  project has also provided a wellspring of opportunities for graduate and undergraduate research, creating a context for the Physics Ph.D. thesis of Greg Smith and for undergraduate research theses leading to Latin Honors for four UCB undergraduates: Emily Hayden, Joe Theis, Akihiro Yamaguchi, and David Stearns.
