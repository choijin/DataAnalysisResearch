<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project involves the areas of risk management, data collection, and participation/growth in the agricultural sector. With the proposed platform, individuals with investment capital will be paired with individuals who have access to infrastructure and management expertise. This will allow small-scale farmers to invest in other farmers to diversify their operations, creating a more reliable income stream and consequently increasing the stability and resilience of small farms, which will greatly benefit the rural economy. Incentivizing these farmers to upload data to improve projection accuracy will result in more robust datasets that can be used to compare and optimize farming practices. The micro-consortia that will be formed will reduce barriers to entry in the agricultural sector by facilitating remote transactions, contracts, and management. This platform could eventually help farmers in developing countries produce agricultural goods with the financial help and expertise of more established farms in the developed world. By increasing participation in agriculture and improving upon current farming practices around the world, this platform can help feed the world's growing population for years to come.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to generate better agricultural decision making and implementation tools by improving upon existing data sets. Massive amounts of data are being collected by farming operations, but that data is often difficult to manage. This project can help farmers utilize this information by providing visual tools to make advanced data analysis and decision-making more intuitive and user-friendly. The feasibility depends on developing an accurate decision support system as well as providing actionable recommendations to incentivize the use of the tools. The goal of the project is to develop the main simulation tool for a decision support platform, along with easy-to-understand visualizations of different investment projections and their impact on income. Finally, users will be given the ability to act upon the recommendations from the analysis immediately and directly from the analysis platform.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[In this project we have worked to consolidate multiple distinct agricultural networks through the creation of an online marketplace of agricultural production contracts (hosted at https://www.farmafield.com/). By supporting micro-finance within agriculture, our platform improves access to agricultural investment opportunities and provides new sources of capital for agricultural producers, thus allowing them to better manage their income volatility and risk exposure.  Our marketplace provides cattle producers (our first offering) with software for improved accounting, visualizations, and analyses. They are then able to use these tools to attract new investment partners by sharing information about their operation and production practices, offering simple payment processing and accounting systems for ease of access and transparency, and providing novel access to an asset class that is typically marked by high barriers to entry for outside investors. This marketplace drives the exchange of the agricultural ?data that matters? (i.e., data that impacts operational income) which can then be used to provide the farmer with operational analyses, benchmarking, and decision support tools. These tools can in turn reduce producers? inefficiencies and income volatility in a virtuous cycle. This platform also addresses difficulties that many producers face when seeking external financing. The software and financing tools can improve the sustainability of small farms both domestically and in developing nations &ndash; helping to feed the world?s increasing population more efficiently.
