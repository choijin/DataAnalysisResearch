<AbstractNarration>This project conducts a large-scale comparative analysis of the impact of social cleavages - especially those based on class, religion, race/ethnicity, and gender - on voting behavior in 23 capitalist democracies since 1945.  It examines four questions that have been the subject of much controversy in recent years.  One, are social cleavages declining in importance as factors predicting individual voting behavior?  Two, do party strategies, issue and attitudinal differences, and social, economic, and political contexts explain the patterns of change over time across each cleavage?  Three, what individual and macro-level factors explain cross-national differences in the importance of cleavages? And four, what has been the impact of these changes on the electoral coalitions of major political parties?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To answer these questions, the project creates an original data set containing pooled information from over 200 surveys done in 23 countries since 1945.  The investigators recode the data to provide cross-nationally comparable information on each respondent's class location, religion, gender, political attitudes, and voting behavior.  They next combine the survey data with national figures on ethnic-linguistic and religious heterogeneity, percentage of women in the labor force, percentage of regular church attendees, levels of social mobility, and welfare state expenditures.  They lastly add information to the data set on party platforms for most of the nations.  The investigators not only use the data to address the substantive questions about changes and national differences in social cleavage-based voting, but also make the data available to other researchers interested in comparative voting behavior.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
