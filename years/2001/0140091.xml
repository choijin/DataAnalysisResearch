<AbstractNarration>Previous investigation into the dynamics of a gaseous Bose-Einstein condensate has revealed a number of interesting phenomena such as solitons and vortices.  The current research is designed to examine the validity of the mean-field approximation previously employed by including correlation effects using a multi-configurational approach well known in quantum chemistry.  The new method will be applied to condensates in optical lattices where transitions from delocalized to localized states are known to occur.</AbstractNarration>
