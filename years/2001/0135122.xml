<AbstractNarration>This integrated research and educational CAREER project will apply the "bottom-up" approach of atomic and molecular manipulation to produce new nanoscale structures.  Three areas of emphasis are involved: (1) probing and manipulating the intrinsic degrees of freedom of the atom, such as energy levels, charge, and spin; (2) probing and manipulating the interface between the atom and the external environment, involving imaging chemical bonds, electronic and vibrational structure, and electron correlation effects; and ultimately (3) the nuclear properties of single atoms, for example isotopic mass and nuclear spin.  Synergistically with the laboratory component, the PI and Stanford University will implement a substantial educational and outreach program.  This cross-cutting effort includes:  (1) the introduction of a new co-terminal physics teaching program, (2) the development of two sets of new courses into which current research in nanoscale science and technology will be interwoven, (3) an outreach program to build nanoscience research and education within the Americas, and (4) the construction of a remote-control station for atom manipulation in order to promote nanoscience education via visual tools to visiting students and to the public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This integrated research and educational CAREER project seeks to apply the "bottom-up" approach of atomic and molecular manipulation to several focused areas in science and technology.  Controlled atom and molecule manipulation and atom-by-atom assembly of complex structures on the nanometer length scale are capabilities existing now only at the frontiers of science and technology.  The students involved in this proposed research and education plan will receive a unique and cross-discipline training in emerging fields now universally identified as critical to society and our understanding of nature.  Synergistically with the laboratory component of this plan, the PI and Stanford University will implement a substantial educational and outreach program.  This cross-cutting effort includes the introduction of a new co-terminal physics teaching program, the development of two sets of new courses into which current research in nanoscale science and technology will be interwoven, an outreach program to build nanoscience research and education within the Americas, and finally the construction of a remote-control station for atom manipulation in order to promote nanoscience education via visual tools to visiting students and to the public.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
