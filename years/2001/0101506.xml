<AbstractNarration>DMS-0101506&lt;br/&gt;Jonathan McCammond&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In recent years ideas from geometry have driven some of the &lt;br/&gt;most exciting developments in combinatorics such as Gromov &lt;br/&gt;hyperbolic groups and CAT(0) spaces, combinatorial Morse theory, combinatorial Ricci curvature, combinatorial differential &lt;br/&gt;manifolds and matroid bundles. The central unifying notion &lt;br/&gt;in geometry is that of curvature. Now, through these diverse&lt;br/&gt;geometric and combinatorial theories, curvature is emerging &lt;br/&gt;as a powerful tool and fundamental unifying concept in &lt;br/&gt;combinatorics as well.  This Focused Research Group will &lt;br/&gt;explore some of the specific notions of combinatorial&lt;br/&gt;curvature driving current combinatorial work, and also the &lt;br/&gt;role of curvature as the basis for a coherent geometric &lt;br/&gt;vision of combinatorics itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The notion of curvature has been one of the grand unifying &lt;br/&gt;concepts in geometry and physics for well over a century.  &lt;br/&gt;For example, Gauss, the originator of our modern understanding &lt;br/&gt;of curvature, showed that Euclidean geometry was distinguished &lt;br/&gt;from other geometries as being the geometry of a space with &lt;br/&gt;zero curvature. As an application he showed that it is&lt;br/&gt;precisely the curvature of the surface of the Earth which makes &lt;br/&gt;it impossible to draw a map of the Earth's surface (on a flat &lt;br/&gt;piece of paper) that accurately portrays all lengths and angles.&lt;br/&gt;Riemann generalized Gauss's work to smooth spaces of higher &lt;br/&gt;dimensions, and Einstein observed that Riemannian geometry&lt;br/&gt;was precisely the right setting in which to describe his &lt;br/&gt;theory of general relativity (in which the curvature of the &lt;br/&gt;universe is the result of gravitational forces). Partly as a &lt;br/&gt;result of Einstein's work, the last century saw an intensive investigation into the curvature of smooth spaces.&lt;br/&gt;Combinatorics, roughly defined, is the study of objects which &lt;br/&gt;can be described by a finite amount of information.  This is &lt;br/&gt;precisely the mathematics that computers can do.  This type of mathematics seems far removed from the geometric investigations &lt;br/&gt;of Gauss, Riemann and countless others.  However, there is a &lt;br/&gt;growing collection of  combinatorial phenomena which can best &lt;br/&gt;be viewed as being finite analogues of facts about the curvature &lt;br/&gt;of smooth spaces.  The goal of this proposal is to come to a&lt;br/&gt;coherent understanding of curvature as a combinatorial notion. &lt;br/&gt;In addition, bringing together researchers from a variety of mathematical disciplines, we wish to bridge the chasms between geometry, combinatorics, algebra and topology, using curvature &lt;br/&gt;as the unifying theme.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
