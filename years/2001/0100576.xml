<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;NONLINEAR OPERATOR THEORY. The goal is to find canonical "nonlinear generalizations" &lt;br/&gt;of analytic function theory and the related parts of linear operator theory.  Many &lt;br/&gt;classical and many new analytic function theorems have a statement purely in terms of &lt;br/&gt;linear operators.  The surprising thing is that these theorems about linear operators &lt;br/&gt;do not actually require linearity, and it has become clear that there will be  extensive &lt;br/&gt;nonlinear generalizations of them.  This wide open area is close to control theory.&lt;br/&gt;COMPUTER OPERATOR ALGEBRA.  Linear engineering systems theory and operator theory are rife with calculations in a noncommutative algebra. Helton's group with M. Stankus &lt;br/&gt;are major providers of software (called NCAlgebra) for performing general noncommutative &lt;br/&gt;calculations in Mathematica.  One phase of the software is at the level of a very &lt;br/&gt;powerful `yellow pad', and contains numerous algorithms they developed. For example, &lt;br/&gt;the  "noncommutative convexity" algorithm discussed  below will go in.  In another phase &lt;br/&gt;there is  extensive software implementing noncommutative Groebner basis algorithms &lt;br/&gt;due to Mora and algorithms for sorting and "shrinking" the output in various ways ( this &lt;br/&gt;is crucial in the noncommutative case). Since the techniques are new, experimentation on &lt;br/&gt;traditional problems is important. &lt;br/&gt;NONCOMMUTATIVE INEQUALITIES.  Recently, Helton and collaborators made progress on a &lt;br/&gt;theory and resulting algorithm which takes a rational function F of noncommutative &lt;br/&gt;variables Z and outputs a family of inequalities which determine a domain G of Z on &lt;br/&gt;which F is "matrix convex".  Decidedly non-trivial is showing that the domain G &lt;br/&gt;determined by the algorithm is  "the  largest possible" domain of matrix convexity &lt;br/&gt;for F. This is a first attempt at an automatic method for what engineers now do with &lt;br/&gt;Schur complement tricks  to convert a design problem to Linear Matrix Inequalities.  &lt;br/&gt;OPTIMIZATION  OVER SPACES OF ANALYTIC FUNCTIONS. Qualitative theory, computer algorithms based on this theory, analysis of such algorithms.  These are the key optimization &lt;br/&gt;problems which arise in designs of linear systems where there are competing constraints, &lt;br/&gt;or uncertainty in the math model of the physical system one is trying to control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research is directed at several projects in parts of operator theory and functional &lt;br/&gt;analysis related to engineering system theory. Linear operator theory has had a strong &lt;br/&gt;interplay with analytic function theory and engineering for many decades.  Indeed most &lt;br/&gt;commercial software (at least in the control engineering community) for solving analytic &lt;br/&gt;function problems is based on this type of interplay between functions and matrices.  &lt;br/&gt;One branch of analysis closely related to applications is classical Nevanlinna-Pick-&lt;br/&gt;Nehari theory, or equivalently commutant lifting theory, a part of the area called &lt;br/&gt;operator model theory.  The early development of this  was done for the purest of &lt;br/&gt;mathematical reasons, but in the mid 1970's  and early 1980's this was shown to be &lt;br/&gt;critical to the design of engineering systems where stability of the system is the key &lt;br/&gt;constraint. This motivated much more mathematical development and now it is one of the &lt;br/&gt;areas of functional analysis most closely associated with control engineering. For many &lt;br/&gt;years (since Norbert Wiener) design tools optimized mean square performance. The theory &lt;br/&gt;above ultimately lead to (commercially commonplace) tools for optimizing worst case &lt;br/&gt;frequency domain performance. The goal of much of the proposed research is to extend &lt;br/&gt;this theory in several radically new directions and we list the main ones.&lt;br/&gt;HIGHLY NONLINEAR GENERALIZATIONS; the goal is to find canonical "nonlinear &lt;br/&gt;generalizations" of analytic function theory and the related parts of linear &lt;br/&gt;operator theory.  This wide open area is closely related to control theory.  Many &lt;br/&gt;systems which people wish to control are nonlinear (e.g., jet engines).&lt;br/&gt;NONCOMMUTATIVE COMPUTER ALGEBRA; if a signal goes into a system A, comes out and then goes into B what we get is BA, while if a signal goes into B and then A what we &lt;br/&gt;get is AB.  Seldom does AB  equal BA, thus the design of engineering systems&lt;br/&gt;requires (heavy) noncommutative calculations.  Helton's group has a broad based &lt;br/&gt;effort to develop methods and theory for computer assistance of such calculations.  &lt;br/&gt;Inequalities with noncommuting elements is now a major topic in engineering and &lt;br/&gt;Helton's group is working out systematic methods for treating them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
