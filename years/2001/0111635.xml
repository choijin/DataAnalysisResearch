<AbstractNarration>Dr. Jingsong Zhang of the University of California Riverside is funded for his research on state-resolved photodissociation dynamics of small free radicals, structure, energetics, and photochemical reactivity by the Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division.  Fundamentally new insigts and quantitative understanding of photochemical reactivity of small prototypical free radicals will be generated experimentally uisng laser excitation, laser probing, and time of flight mass spectroscopy.  Laser spectroscopy and state-resolved photodissociation dynamics will be used to fully characterize prototypical reactive intermediates and small alkyl, unsaturated aliphatic, alkoxy, and aromatic radicals, as well as the HOCO radical.  These systems will also be examined at a high level of theory (electronic and dynamic) with little or no approximation.  Detailed mechanisms involving dissociation and nuclear rearrangement will be generated.  Open-shell electronic states, structures and multiple potential energy surfaces of free radicals and their influences on photodissociation and unimolecular reactions will be deduced.  Competitive dissociation pathways and decomposition mechanims of free radicals and product energy disposal will be mapped.  Free-radical electronic states, thermodynamics, and energetics will be tabulated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The energetics and dynamics of small free radicals are important areas of physical chemistry and have practical importance in combustion and atmospheric chemistries.  The experimental and theoretical analyses by Dr. Zhang will provide detailed advances in our understanding of important carbon-based radicals and the hydrogen extraction chemistry of these radicals.  In addition, important teaching and training will be provided students at one of our nation's most culturally diverse universities.  Multi-disciplinary approaches, for example, connections between fundamental molecular-level knowledge and practical atmospheric and combustion chemistry, as well as those between modern techniques and scientific advances, will be stressed.</AbstractNarration>
