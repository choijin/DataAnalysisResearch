<AbstractNarration>Economists have developed a theory of "sunspot" equilibrium to describe situations&lt;br/&gt;where economic fluctuations are not driven by changes in market fundamentals, but are&lt;br/&gt;instead due to extrinsic, non-fundamental factors. This project involves the design of an&lt;br/&gt;experiment that will explore whether and how such extrinsic factors can result in market&lt;br/&gt;fluctuations, and whether the particular market institution also plays a role.&lt;br/&gt;The experiment consists of two main treatments. In the first, human subjects participate&lt;br/&gt;as buyers or sellers in a computerized "double auction", where goods can be bought and&lt;br/&gt;sold continuously over a fixed trading period at mutually agreed upon prices that are&lt;br/&gt;observable as they occur to all participants. In the second "call market" treatment,&lt;br/&gt;subjects submit private bids and offers, and a centralized mechanism determines the&lt;br/&gt;single, market clearing price, as well as the quantities that each participant can buy or&lt;br/&gt;sell. Thus, the only information subjects receive in this environment is the resulting&lt;br/&gt;market price and the quantity they were able to buy or sell at this price.&lt;br/&gt;In both treatments, subjects face uncertainty in that they are given two sets of values or&lt;br/&gt;costs for the goods they can buy or sell; these two sets correspond to the"state" of the&lt;br/&gt;economy, and are referred to as "high" or "low" in reference to the equilibrium price in&lt;br/&gt;the two states. (the equilibrium quantity is the same in both states). Initially, subjects are&lt;br/&gt;told the state of the economy in advance, so that they become familiar with the two states&lt;br/&gt;for prices. After several rounds, subjects are informed that the true state of the economy,&lt;br/&gt;will henceforth be determined expost, after all trading is completed. Furthermore, the rule&lt;br/&gt;for the determination of the state will depend on the median trade price in the double&lt;br/&gt;auction environment or on the analogous market clearing price in the call market&lt;br/&gt;environment. If this price lies within a proscribed domain of the equilibrium low price,&lt;br/&gt;then the state is declared to be low and if it lies outside this domain, in that of the&lt;br/&gt;equilibrium high price, then the state is declared to be high. Subjects are provided with a&lt;br/&gt;potential coordination device (or sunspot realization) which takes the form of a random&lt;br/&gt;announcement by the experimenter of the forecast for the state of prices in the current&lt;br/&gt;period. Subjects are instructed that this announcement has no binding consequences.&lt;br/&gt;Preliminary findings suggest that subjects coordinate perfectly on the announcement in&lt;br/&gt;the highly centralized call market environment but fail to do the same in the more&lt;br/&gt;decentralized double auction environment. These experimental findings if replicated,&lt;br/&gt;have significant implications for the architecture of real financial markets.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
