<AbstractNarration>Geography (88)&lt;br/&gt;Field experience is vital for the development of qualified and effective practitioners in all aspects of geography. Unfortunately, the availability and easy access to secondary data over the past two decades has resulted in the de-emphasis of fieldwork, which now threatens to produce a generation of geographers inadequately prepared to apply and teach field methods. This project is working to correct this deficiency through the development of a field laboratory dedicated to student-led, inquiry-driven instruction. Our premise is that students learn best by doing. Our goal is to provide students the opportunity to acquire hands-on experience in an intellectually exciting environment wherein problems are investigated that they themselves have formulated. This approach is a modification of the guided-inquiry, learning-by -doing approaches created and described by Barbara Tewksbury (see B. Tewksbury, editor, "Innovative and Effective Teaching in the Geosciences," National Association of Geoscience Teachers, 1997), developed and implemented with success at Hamilton College (Geology) and Dickinson College (Geology, Geophysics), and elsewhere in Europe (see M. Kent et al, "Fieldwork in Geography Teaching: A Critical Review of the Literature and Approaches," Journal of Geography in Higher Education, Vol. 21, No. 3, 1997, pages 313-332). To facilitate experiential learning, we are working in a 14,200 acre field site belonging to the University of Oklahoma. Field activities throughout the geography curriculum are being planned for this field station. Students first become acquainted with the field lab in lower division courses, when they are introduced to fundamental field techniques and instruments. Upper division courses are building on these experiences, and we are implementing a course of guided autonomous investigation. Small teams of students are working with faculty and representatives from state and federal agencies. The role of faculty is to stimulate, encourage, and guide students through the research process and advise them on the merits and the suitability of chosen field methods. Scientists from state and federal agencies are being used to provide unique insights from practical local perspectives. The students are collecting original data, performing appropriate analyses, and reporting their results in departmental colloquia. Outstanding students are provided with support to present their results at national meetings and they are encouraged to publish in appropriate journals. By experiencing the complete spectrum of problem formulation, experimental design, data analysis, report writing and dissemination of results, students are developing skills in problem-solving, critical thinking, and research collaboration. All project activities are being placed on a web site created for the purpose and are freely accessible to everyone.</AbstractNarration>
