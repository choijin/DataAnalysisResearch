<AbstractNarration>This is a US-Polish collaborative research project that will support the participation of Polish researchers in the PP2PP experiment at RHIC.  The principal investigator is Dr. Michael Rijssenbeek from SUNY at Stony Brook.  His Polish collaborators are Professor Andrzej Sandacz from the Institute for Nuclear Studies in Warsaw and Drs. Janusz Chwastowski and Bogdan Pawlik from the Institute of Nuclear Physics in Krakow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SUNY Stony Brook group has been responsible for PP2PP simulations.  This activity will now be taken over by the Polish group.  In order for this to happen this project will provide support for the necessary consulting and transfer of software responsibilities.  This project will also facilitate and integrate collaborative research in preparation of the data run, during data-taking, and in the data analysis phase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project in nuclear physics research fulfills the program objectives of bringing together leading experts in the U.S. and Central/Eastern Europe to combine complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest and competence on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.</AbstractNarration>
