<AbstractNarration>Ancient Andean empires were communications dinosaurs; information and &lt;br/&gt;decision-making traveled only as fast as a human could, and the Andean &lt;br/&gt;peoples did not know writing.  Lacking the administrative technology of &lt;br/&gt;contemporaneous European or Asian states, the native empires of the Andes &lt;br/&gt;were forced to develop alternative modes of statecraft, and other &lt;br/&gt;principles to integrate their subject populations. Archaeologists have long &lt;br/&gt;suspected, based on Spanish eyewitness accounts of the Inka empire, that &lt;br/&gt;one of the crucial integrative mechanisms of prehispanic statecraft was the &lt;br/&gt;elaborate mortuary practices of the politically important.  In the Inka &lt;br/&gt;empire, the carefully kept bodies of deceased rulers served as material &lt;br/&gt;symbols of dynastic succession and political continuity.  Through periodic rituals and&lt;br/&gt;fine mausoleums mummies were the setting for public communication of &lt;br/&gt;messages of political legitimization and imperial authority.  While the &lt;br/&gt;role of the dead in Inka statecraft has been well studied, much less is &lt;br/&gt;known about this topic in early Andean empires, such as the Wari; in some &lt;br/&gt;ways a fore-runner of the Inka that dominated the highlands between AD 400 &lt;br/&gt;and 800.  Ms. Charlene Milliken's doctoral dissertation project, conducted &lt;br/&gt;under the direction of Dr. Marc Bermann, will investigate the site of Conchopata, &lt;br/&gt;Peru.  At its height, Conchopata was a secondary center of the Wari empire &lt;br/&gt;(A.D. 600-1000) and consisted of residential zones, public plazas, pottery workshops, &lt;br/&gt;temples, and specialized mortuary complexes. Excavation will center on &lt;br/&gt;residential contexts associated with two mortuary &lt;br/&gt;complexes, and research will test the hypothesis that these mortuary complexes were &lt;br/&gt;used by Conchopata elites in the veneration of important ancestors. &lt;br/&gt;Conchopata is a particularly good location for this research because &lt;br/&gt;several intact mortuary structures have been uncovered; normally these &lt;br/&gt;kinds of facilities were looted or destroyed long ago. This project will &lt;br/&gt;provide the first investigation of the potential role of mortuary activity &lt;br/&gt;in Wari political statecraft as one native means by which authority is &lt;br/&gt;constructed and expressed in non-literate, non-Western populations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
