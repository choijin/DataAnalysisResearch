<AbstractNarration>A grant has been awarded to Dr.'s Riegel, Kilpatrick, and Robart at the University of Pittsburgh, Johnstown Campus to fund the acquisition and operation of a genetic analzer. The genetic analyzer will be used to train undergraduate students carrying out molecular biological research in the areas of virology, population genetics, and plant systematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The genetic analyzer will be used to support the undergraduate research initiatives conducted by students directed by these three faculty members. Undergraduates working with Dr. Riegel (Department of Chemistry) study the virus which affects gypsy moths. One study involves the temporal expression of a gene and the other study involves a mutant with an aberrant morphology. The analyzer will be used to verify the DNA sequence of the mutants constructed in the course of the temporal expression study, and to sequence the aberrant morphology mutation once it is localized. This virus is important to study as it and related viruses are used as biological control agents, and one of the related viruses is used in a protein expression system. Proper understanding of the control of genetic expression and the mutations that arise are important to the optimal use of these viruses as control agents and expression systems. Students of Dr. Kilpatrick (Department of Biology) carry out research in the area of population genetics. They study fitness components in hybrid fruit flies derived from crosses among geographically diverse populations, and the role of mitochondrial DNA variation in determining organismal fitness. His students will use the analyzer to sequence multilocus genotypes of individual flies and then to analyze the patterns found. Because these data are often used to measure genetic differences and gene flow among natural populations, this work will aid in the interpretation of variations in the genetic patterns in many species. Dr. Robart's students (Department of Biology) carry out research in the area of plant molecular systematics. They are using molecular sequencing to reconstruct the phylogenetic relationship of the lousewort. Dr. Robart's students will use the analyzer to sequence particular genetic regions of the plants to construct a phylogenetic tree. In addition the analyzer's ability to carry out microsatellite and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis will allow students to measure gene flow and trace patterns of evolutionary diversification among the different varieties of the plant. This work will contribute to the understanding of the rise of new flowering plant species and the diversification of their floral characteristics.&lt;br/&gt;The genetic analyzer will be part of a major effort on the part of UPJ to enhance undergraduate research and training in molecular biology and biochemistry. Within the past 5 years, UPJ has added a biochemist to the chemistry department, hired a second molecular biologist and constructed and equipped new laboratory facilities for molecular/biochemical research. The genetic analyzer will greatly enhance this effort. Undergraduate researchers trained on this equipment will be able to better carry out research in the field of molecular biology and its applications to virology, plant systematics, and population genetics.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
