<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;The 40th IEEE Decision and Control Conference (CD01) is the premiere, annual international conference on systems and automatic control research. It is sponsored by the IEEE Control Systems Society and conducted in cooperation with the Society of Industrial and Applied Mathematics, and the Institute For Operations Research and the Management Sciences. This year it will be held at the Hyatt Regency Grand Cypress in Orlando Florida, December 4-7, 2001. Pre-conference workshops will be held on Monday December 3, 2001. The Conference provides an excellent opportunity for researchers to present the latest developments in the field, promote new ideas, and discuss and evaluate past accomplishments. The technical content of the Conference has traditionally been of the highest quality drawing leading scientific researches from all over the world. The Conference typically draws some one thousand participants each year. Such a venue is of special importance for the training of new researchers and graduate students in systems and control. The National Science Foundation has consistently supported these activities over the years by providing partial travel support for graduate students participating in the Conference. In this proposal we are asking that NFS continue this long-standing tradition and provide travel support for graduate students who will be participating in the 2001 IEEE CDC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
