<AbstractNarration>This proposal was received in response to NSE, NSF-0019.   This NIRT project focuses on the study of charge transport in molecular systems.   An interdisciplinary team from physics and chemistry, working in the areas of nanoscale synthesis, high-precision structural characterization, electrochemistry, DNA chemistry, microfluidic techniques, and the use of novel nanoscale materials will be engaged in the effort.  There are two principal experimental thrusts to the work: 1) the systematic exploration of electronic tunneling through solvents and other small, well-characterized molecules and 2) a rigorous study of charge transport through DNA.   The award is jointly funded by the Divisions of Physics and Chemistry.</AbstractNarration>
