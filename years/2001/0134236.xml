<AbstractNarration>The focus of this integrated research, education, and outreach program is the development of simulation tools capable of modeling the complex electromagnetic environment of high-speed circuits. Key innovations include the use of multi-scale abstraction and introduction of meta-elements to minimize the computational burden. The finite element method is used as a back-bone approach to allow for complex geometrical and material features. This simulation tool will be used, along with other educational materials developed by the Principal Investigator, to develop a Mixed Signal Circuits course at Michigan State University that focuses on electromagnetic interference (EMI) mitigation and design for electromagnetic compatibility (EMC).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The educational materials developed for consumption on the MSU campus will be adapted for distance learning via the Asynchronous Learning Network. Flexible short courses will be offered over the Internet to industrial and life-long learning students. The target audience for this outreach effort are degreed-professionals desiring EMI/EMC education for mixed signal circuit design. Student learning tracks will be customized based on the needs of the student and their company. Several major companies have indicated interest in collaborating in this effort and their input will assist the Principal Investigator in the production of a high-quality, high-impact outreach program.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
