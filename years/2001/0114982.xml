<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to improve the capability of controlling the gas tungsten arc welding process for precise joining by emulating skilled operators using intelligent automatic welding machines in order to produce quality welds consistently.  To this end, a novel sensing and control system will be developed to measure and control the three-dimensional surface of the weld pool.  A new technique will be used to modify the traditional gas tungsten arc welding process for better arc concentration and directionality.  A numerical model will be developed to analyze the behaviors of the modified process under the varying welding parameters in order to simulate the performance of the developed control technology.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scope of work addresses basic physics, dynamic modeling, and robust control issues. The research team will closely collaborate with industrial partners and governmental scientists on both the basic research and applied issues.  The investigator includes a plan to educate graduate students in both the fundamental science integration and potential for industrial applications.  The investigator also plans to accept undergraduate and talented high school students, including those from under-represented groups, to work on carefully defined topics during the research.  In addition to the social impact, the impact on industry should also be significant and several industrial partners are committed to case study support and equipment/engineering support for the future development of this novel technology at production level. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
