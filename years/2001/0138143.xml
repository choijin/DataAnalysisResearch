<AbstractNarration>The Advanced Materials Program in the Division of Chemistry makes this renewal award to University of California Riverside to design and synthesize novel chiral macromolecular materials based on thienylenes and Dewar benzene. Primary focus of the proposal will be to fine tune solid-state electronic and optical properties of this system by permanent (non-covalent) guest inclusion.  These materials would have potential for applications in photomechanical actuators, photolithographic substrates and thermally induced chemiluminescent materials. Ultimate goal of the project will be to develop molecular actuators that function like "molecular muscles".  Planned research and education activities with graduate and undergraduate students including mentoring of minority students would prepare them for future careers and studies in science and engineering fields.  The proposed web based outreach programs would benefit a large number of students in the community and would prepare them for future science education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Novel chiral macromolecular crystalline materials will be designed and synthesized from thienylenes and Dewar benzene, both of which possess dynamic topologies.  Solid-state electronic and optical properties of this system will be studied, and these materials would have potential applications as photomechanical actuators, photolithographic substrates and thermally induced chemiluminescent materials.  Participation of graduate and undergraduate students in the material chemistry related research would prepare them for new careers and higher education.  Planned web based programs would benefit the whole community, and would create awareness and appreciation of science related topics in the community.</AbstractNarration>
