<AbstractNarration>Computational Intelligence (CI) is an emerging field of fundamental and applied research that utilizes a number of powerful computational paradigms, either separately or synergistically, to solve problems that defy solutions using traditional techniques.  The main paradigms of CI encompass Fuzzy Set Theory and Fuzzy Logic (FL), Neural Networks (NN), Reinforcement Learning (RL), and Genetic Algorithms (GAs).  In this research, the PI will probe how CI paradigms can be utilized to address a number of critical research problems that are at the very heart of the infrastructure engineering profession at the present time.  This will include the use of CI for: (1) the on-line management and control of transportation networks in the context of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS); (2) determining "optimal" budget allocation in the context of integrated infrastructure management systems; and (3) deriving land use limits from infrastructure capacity.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The different research activities of the study will complement a corresponding education plan that has the following objectives: (1) strengthen the Information Technology (IT) content of Civil Engineering (CE) curricula; (2) experiment with learning strategies that promote active learning; and (3) undertake high school outreach.  To achieve these goals, the study will develop a new course on CI applications in CE, as well as develop educational modules on ITS to be incorporated in undergraduate transportation classes.  The study will also experiment with the "Just-in-Time Teaching" (JiTT) strategy, a pedagogical strategy that works through a fusion of high-tech and low-tech teaching elements.  In addition, the study will establish an outreach program to local high schools that will provide the opportunity to select junior and senior students to work with faculty mentors on independent research projects.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
