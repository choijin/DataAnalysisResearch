<AbstractNarration>University of Arizona (UA) in partnership with Pima Community College (PCC; a multi-campus institution) proposes a comprehensive program to increase the enrollment, retention, and graduation of women especially minority women of Hispanic and American Indian origins, in tracks leading to BS and graduate degrees in astronomy, biosciences, chemistry, physics, engineering and related fields. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project strengthens previous activities by 1) building on collaboration between PCC and UA science departments in research internship programs, extending these efforts to highlight the needs of women especially minority women students; 2) integrating community college level programs into UA's Women in Science and Engineering K-12 and university programs; 3) paying new attention to differences within groups and fields; and 4) identifying and initiating strategies for long-term institutional changes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PCC's multifaceted program will include 1) increasing recruitment; 2) individual student mentoring and academic advising; 3) enrichment efforts to strengthen students' preparedness and widen their knowledge of career choices; 4) improvement of institutional instructional and support programs focusing on interactive learning, classroom climate, enhanced outreach to high school science teachers, and coordination of minority and support programs; and 5) financial support for students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Activities at the UA will include new efforts to enhance students' motivation, performance and financial support and will foster their use of existing units serving minority and women undergraduates. Collaboration with the Graduate College and Women of Color Consortium will address advancement to graduate education. We will compare students' GPAs and progress towards BS and Graduate education for the target group to those of all PCC science and engineering students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The prime target group is women who have been consistently highlighted as most underrepresented and most difficult to retain and advance in science-related areas. We will address different needs and issues across fields and among groups, reflecting the multiple intersections of gender and ethnicity. The most underrepresented of all -- minority women, will be a special focus. Strategies that work with these populations can be applied to all students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project offers a potential model for improving on articulation of community college students into four-year undergraduate and graduate institutions. Since nationally, community colleges are an entry into higher education particularly for women and minorities, increased articulation with a focus on science and engineering could increase participation of these groups at higher levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
