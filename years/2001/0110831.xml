<AbstractNarration>The photon counting histogram (PCH) is a recently introduced technique that exploits&lt;br/&gt;fluorescence fluctuations to distinguish molecules by their intrinsic fluorescence brightness. For&lt;br/&gt;example, a homodimer A2 will appear twice as bright as its monomer A, if each protein A carries&lt;br/&gt;one fluorescent label. The main focus of this proposal is the development of dual-color PCH.&lt;br/&gt;Adding a second detection channel and splitting the photons between both channels according to&lt;br/&gt;color will increase the sensitivity and capability of the PCH technique tremendously. Dual-color&lt;br/&gt;PCH combines the benefit of separating photons of different molecules by color with the intrinsic&lt;br/&gt;ability of PCH to distinguish the brightness of molecules. To illustrate this point, consider two&lt;br/&gt;proteins A and B with differently colored labels. A mixture of their homodimers, heterodimers&lt;br/&gt;and monomers (A2, B2, AB, A and B) is resolvable by dual-color PCH. A single measurement&lt;br/&gt;will determine the brightness of each component together with their concentrations. Currently,&lt;br/&gt;no other technique promises to deliver comparable performance. The second goal of this&lt;br/&gt;proposal is the application of dual-color PCH to study subunit interactions of an oligomeric&lt;br/&gt;enzyme. The association and dissociation of individual subunits is directly observed by dual-&lt;br/&gt;color PCH analysis and allows the determination of protein assembly paths under varying&lt;br/&gt;external conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The existing theory of PCH for a single channel will be modified to describe dual-channel&lt;br/&gt;detection. The algorithms and software programs to analyze the data will be developed and the&lt;br/&gt;performance of the dual-channel detection system will be characterized on a two-photon&lt;br/&gt;microscope. The practical resolvability of a mixture by dual-color PCH is from an experimental&lt;br/&gt;point of view of crucial importance. This project will address and answer this question by&lt;br/&gt;analyzing the influence of the photon count statistics on dual-color PCH. Another important&lt;br/&gt;consideration is the emission spectrum of a fluorophore. Most pairs of fluorophores have&lt;br/&gt;overlapping emission spectra and a perfect separation of the two fluorophores by color is not&lt;br/&gt;possible. Optical filter combinations that maximize the signal-to-noise ratio of dual-color PCH&lt;br/&gt;for dyes with overlapping emission spectra will be determined and tested. The experimental&lt;br/&gt;characterization of dual-color PCH will start with binary mixtures and will continue with&lt;br/&gt;mixtures of increasing complexity to determine the capability of dual-color PCH. In addition,&lt;br/&gt;dual-color PCH with excitation at multiple wavelengths will be implemented to further increase&lt;br/&gt;the performance of PCH.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The subunit interactions of phosphofructokinase (PFK) will be studied by dual-color PCH.&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the subunit exchange between hybrid tetramers and the dissociation and association&lt;br/&gt;of the oligomeric protein will be examined. Individual subunits of PFK will carry specific&lt;br/&gt;fluorophores, which allow PCH to distinguish the subunit composition and population of each&lt;br/&gt;fraction by color and absolute brightness. It is important to stress that dual-color PCH will have&lt;br/&gt;applications well beyond the study of oligomeric enzymes. The impact of this new technique will&lt;br/&gt;be felt in many other biological research fields. The association of proteins to form complexes is&lt;br/&gt;a general concept encountered in most regulation processes of cells. Dual-color PCH can detect&lt;br/&gt;and identify protein association on the single molecule level. An important and pressing task of&lt;br/&gt;the post-genomic era is the identification of the function of a large number of unknown proteins.&lt;br/&gt;Dual-color PCH can assist in this task by mapping out their protein-protein interactions.</AbstractNarration>
