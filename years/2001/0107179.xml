<AbstractNarration>The screening of data sets is essential to modern technology.  &lt;br/&gt;Whenever the objective is to find "positive elements" in a &lt;br/&gt;data set, a test indicating whether at least one positive is &lt;br/&gt;an element of a specific part of the data set can greatly &lt;br/&gt;facilitate their isolation.  Such tests are called binary &lt;br/&gt;group tests and the general mathematical method behind the &lt;br/&gt;identification of the positives using such tests is known as &lt;br/&gt;classical group testing.  In many applied settings, the use &lt;br/&gt;of classical group testing to isolate objects that are &lt;br/&gt;individually positive has become standard experimental &lt;br/&gt;procedure.  However, very little work has been done in &lt;br/&gt;applying group testing techniques to the identification of &lt;br/&gt;objects that are collectively positive.  Let C be an unknown &lt;br/&gt;collection of subsets or complexes in a population and let P &lt;br/&gt;be a pool taken from the population.  A pool P is said to be &lt;br/&gt;positive if and only if a member of C is also a subset of P.  &lt;br/&gt;The identification of C by the application of these binary &lt;br/&gt;tests is called group testing for complexes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary aim of this proposal is the development of efficient &lt;br/&gt;group testing methods that lead to the identification of &lt;br/&gt;positive combinations of objects, namely the positive complexes.  &lt;br/&gt;There are many scientific and technical areas where the &lt;br/&gt;identification of positive combinations of objects is important. &lt;br/&gt;Computationally feasible methods of finding combinations of &lt;br/&gt;entities that produce some measurable outcome or are measurably &lt;br/&gt;linked to some function or disfunction would have important &lt;br/&gt;applications to medical genetics, computer security, software &lt;br/&gt;testing, data mining, communications, and marketing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
