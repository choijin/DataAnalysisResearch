<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;0140047&lt;br/&gt;Hariharan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Electromagnetic interference (EMI) and high frequency noise are major sources of signal loss and data corruption in electronics, communication and mass storage devices. In addition, there have been major advances in areas like high-speed, high-density memories and computer processor speeds. For example, nowadays, CPUs operate at frequencies over 1GHz. Rapid progress in microelectronics fabrication processes have led to miniaturization of electronic device modules. Space is at a premium and this causes power sources and IC components to be packed very close to each other. Moreover, there are major efforts to design and develop solid-state quantum computers that would be inherently highly susceptible to EMI. These advances place stringent requirements and underscore the critical need for improved materials that combine optimal device characteristics and excellent EMI--suppression properties particularly at RF and microwave frequencies. To obtain these new materials exhibiting desirable properties, a combinatorial approach involving materials synthesis and electromagnetic characterization is necessary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conducting materials, capacitors, ferrites have all been popular choices for near-field and far-field EMI suppression at frequencies in the low RF (few MHz) to the microwave (up to 100 GHz) range. While these materials individually are somewhat effective over different frequency bands, they are often tagged on to circuits as additional components.  The PIs propose a novel scheme using layered composite materials where wideband EMI--suppression functionality is integrated into the base materials that are used in devices for RF and microwave circuits. Their primary target will be to achieve integrated functionality and improved shielding effectiveness over the frequency range of 1 MHz to 10 GHz.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs proposed research includes development of the following three strategies:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[1] Synthesize a series of nanocomposite materials comprised of magnetic nanoparticles    embedded in doped intrinsically conducting polymers. Study the fundamental magnetic properties, complex impedance and shielding effectiveness up to 10 6Hz.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[2] Investigate the RF response in variable thickness layered nanocomposite materials processed using thick film spin coating methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[3] Monitor the device performance and EMI-suppression of a PC mother board and a microwave circulator coated with the downselected nanocomposite materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The synthesis of nanoscale materials will be carried out in collaboration with Materials Modification Inc. (MMI) using a patented microwave plasma technique. Systematic magnetic and electromagnetic characterization will be done using resonant and non-resonant methods developed in their laboratory at University of South Florida. This GOALI project will contribute to extensive training and education of graduate students at USF in two major topical areas: Nanomaterials technology and Electromagnetic measurement methods. It also affords a direct opportunity for Applied Physics PhD students at USF to travel and work on-site at MMI and gain industry experience.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
