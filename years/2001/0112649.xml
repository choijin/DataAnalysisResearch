<AbstractNarration>     Recent work has pointed out the existence of power-laws in the degree distribution of real-world&lt;br/&gt;networks. In retrospect, these findings while widely publicized are perhaps not surprising; power-laws&lt;br/&gt;for various notions of size in real-world phenomena have been known for several decades.&lt;br/&gt;Nevertheless, these findings have sparked extensive interest in the structure and macroscopic properties&lt;br/&gt;of the Internet. Such interest is timely; recent work has also revealed that network topology properties&lt;br/&gt;may impact protocol performance&lt;br/&gt;     Generating realistic topologies is a prerequisite for understanding the impact of topology on pro-tocol&lt;br/&gt;performance. Our recent work on topology generation motivates the proposed research and is&lt;br/&gt;driven by the perceived dichotomy between structural generators those that explicity embody some&lt;br/&gt;notion of hierarchy in constructing topologies and connectivity-based generators those that at-tempt&lt;br/&gt;to generate topologies with power-law degree distributions.&lt;br/&gt;     Our preliminary research on this larger question reveals several interesting results: that real net-works&lt;br/&gt;are well-modeled by connectivity-based generators, and that these generators result in graphs&lt;br/&gt;with a continuum of levels of hierarchy. Continuing on from this work, our proposed research will at-tempt&lt;br/&gt;to increase our fundamental understanding of the structure of real networks, and their impact on&lt;br/&gt;protocol performance. Conceptually, our proposed research has three interrelated parts: understand-ing&lt;br/&gt;hierarchy in real networks, devising structural models for topology construction based on Highly&lt;br/&gt;Optimized Tolerance, and examining more closely the impact of topology on protocol performance.&lt;br/&gt;     The structure of networks, and their impact on protocols, has received little attention until recently.&lt;br/&gt;In terms of broader impact, this work has the potential for making fundamental progress in the areas&lt;br/&gt;of topology modeling. In a larger sense, it may develop methods that can be used to understand the&lt;br/&gt;physical processes that lead to the development of other real-world networks, such as the Web topology&lt;br/&gt;and social networks.</AbstractNarration>
