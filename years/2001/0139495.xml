<AbstractNarration>The Harvard Forest is a center for NSF-Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) and related studies involving more than 75 researchers from Harvard University and other institutions.  Since 1993 Harvard Forest has provided a diverse and talented group of undergraduate students with training in independent research and guidance to graduate study and professional development through a Summer Research Program in Ecology.  This program, which is dedicated to promoting career development in ecological sciences, includes between 13-18 students each summer.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research theme of the Harvard Forest REU program addresses the relative importance of environmental change, natural disturbance, and human activity in controlling current and prospective ecological patterns and process in the northeastern U.S.  Studies are diverse and mentors are lead scientists and educators in areas ranging from atmospheric chemistry and ecosystem studies to wildlife biology, population ecology, ecophysiology, paleoecology, and conservation biology.  Mentors in the program include researchers with Marine Biological Labs-Ecosystem Center, Woods Hole Research Center, University of New Hampshire, University of Massachusetts, Holy Cross College, and three academic departments at Harvard University (Organismic and Evolutionary Biology, Earth and Planetary Sciences, and Harvard Forest).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To provide the most productive student experience the program utilizes an effective protocol comprising: selection of diverse and productive students; advanced preparation; individual mentorship within research groups of faculty, graduate students, post-doctoral associates and undergraduates; weekly seminars and discussion groups on science, careers, graduate studies, and ethics in science; field trips to other research sites and institutions; recreational opportunities; an annual student symposium and published proceedings; program evaluation and discussion; and follow-up of publications and presentation, theses and careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The REU program at the Harvard Forest uses exceptionally well-equipped field, laboratory, analytical, and housing facilities.  Each student is closely supervised in independent studies by a mentor and the program is overseen by a coordinator working closely with the Harvard Forest Director, Administrator, Museum Coordinator, and Data Manager.  Participants are recruited nationally with a strong emphasis on geographic coverage, small colleges and participation of women, minorities, and students with disabilities.  The program runs 12 weeks during the summer although many students continue with research projects beyond this period.  Detailed information on past and proposed REU research projects and the Summer Research Symposium, which includes past REU student research results, is available at www.lternet.edu/hfr.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
