<AbstractNarration>This proposal seeks support for carrying out two conferences to scope out and define the scientific and out reach programs that will be done in the anticipated National underground Science Laboratory at Lead, South Dakota.  Educators, geologists, biologists, and physicists will attend both of these conferences.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will produce a white paper defining the nature and the timing of the science and outreach activities for the underground laboratory.  The white paper will also serve as a guide to aid the baseline design of the laboratory.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
