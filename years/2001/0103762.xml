<AbstractNarration>0103762&lt;br/&gt;Li&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A program of research related to the application of pseudoframes for &lt;br/&gt;subspaces (PFFS) and relevant interpolation techniques is proposed. &lt;br/&gt;Theme 1 of the program studies the contribution of PFFSs to artifact &lt;br/&gt;reduction in data/image compression.  Key observations lie in the fact that &lt;br/&gt;there are symmetric and compactly supported biorthogonal wavelets, but &lt;br/&gt;not within an MRA (of compactly supported wavelets). It shows the "lack &lt;br/&gt;of room" within the MRA subspace structure. PFFS is a tool to explore the &lt;br/&gt;insight story of such a phenomenon.  Theme 2 focuses on a new &lt;br/&gt;construction approach of interpolatory multiresolution analysis (I-MRA).  &lt;br/&gt;The key observation is that an interpolatory sequence can be defined by &lt;br/&gt;sampled reproducing kernel function of a subspace V of an MRA.   It is &lt;br/&gt;expected that such an interpolatory sequence can easily form a basis or &lt;br/&gt;frame of V, giving rise to an interpolatory "interface" to the MRA, and a &lt;br/&gt;construction methodology of I-MRA.  Theme 3 studies applications of &lt;br/&gt;PFFSs in the Sinc-type methods for interpolations and quadratures.  The &lt;br/&gt;motivation is to explore the advantage of fast decaying properties of &lt;br/&gt;PFFSs in the Sinc-type applications.  In theme 4, the P.I. expects to apply &lt;br/&gt;similar interpolation techniques as described in theme 2 to study multi-&lt;br/&gt;band samplings using frames and/or PFFSs as fundamental tools. The &lt;br/&gt;technique of PFFSs with their flexibility is expected to play a role.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each research topic is highly motivated by its applications in data/image &lt;br/&gt;compression, sampling and interpolation for efficient numerical &lt;br/&gt;implementations.  PFFS is a tool to study a subspace V while "standing" &lt;br/&gt;outside of it.  In doing so, one is given the freedom and additional "room" &lt;br/&gt;to perform tasks in V by using advanced tools not available in V.  In &lt;br/&gt;signal/image processing, such advanced properties of PFFS are extremely &lt;br/&gt;useful because it is known that biorthogonal wavelets of finite length with &lt;br/&gt;symmetry are desirable for reducing ``blocking'' and ``ringing'' effects, and &lt;br/&gt;yet such biorthogonal wavelets do not reside in its dual wavelet subspace. &lt;br/&gt;We believe that PFFS shall not only provide a class of biorthogonal &lt;br/&gt;wavelet examples, the additional information (known from the &lt;br/&gt;construction) contributed by PFFS will provide practical insight about &lt;br/&gt;"blocking" and "ringing" artifacts, and thereby delivers new solutions and &lt;br/&gt;enhanced signal/image compression rate and communication speed.   &lt;br/&gt;Other applications of PFFSs in irregular sampling (for multi-band &lt;br/&gt;functions) as well as in the Sinc-type methods (for interpolation and &lt;br/&gt;quadratures) are all based on applying flexible properties of PFFSs.  The &lt;br/&gt;expectations include enhanced practical efficiency and improved rate of &lt;br/&gt;convergence.   The project on interpolatory multiresolution analysis has &lt;br/&gt;practical applications in data acquisition/sampling while simultaneously &lt;br/&gt;performing the wavelet transform.  One of the key ingredients of the study &lt;br/&gt;is to build an interpolatory "interface" to a given MRA and still keep the &lt;br/&gt;underlying desirable wavelet properties.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
