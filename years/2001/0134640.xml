<AbstractNarration>The University of Hawaii system is an educational institution unlike any other, due to its remote location, culturally rich history, and locally populated student body. It is unique among our nation's universities and requires an equally unique approach to research and education. Cultural and geographic issues that do not exist at other institutions filter into nearly every facet of our function as a university. These can create a sense of unity among the administration, faculty, and students, or a sense of division; therefore, it is essential to consider the local cultural dynamics in any research and educational plan. This 5-year career development plan addresses the uniqueness of the University of Hawai'i and seeks to increase undergraduate and graduate enrollment, student research participation, and diversity within the College of Engineering. A key aspect of this plan is working with the local cultural dynamics to foster a positive image for the College of Engineering within the state of Hawai'i, as well as the Mainland. The proposed plan is an integrated research/education/outreach program. intended to encourage students to pursue graduate degrees, while providing them the experience of open-ended collaborative research projects in the areas of lasers and optics.&lt;br/&gt;The research proposed here involves fundamental investigation and development of optical sensors; particularly low-cost, high-efficiency, laser diode and LED-based sensors. Various innovative optical sensors will be developed with applications ranging from biomedical monitoring to target tracking. I will build upon previous work in gas sensing to optimize sensitivity, while miniaturizing the sensor. Innovative modulation techniques will be explored for increased accuracy to measured parameters. Central to this is the wavelength modulation technique employing higher harmonic detection. The focus of this research will not only be on the development of novel sensors, but also on the integration of such sensors in a sensor network. The motivation for concentrating on integration of optical sensors is to address the escalating need for situational awareness over multidimensional environments with a cost-effective robust system in environmental, military, and commercial analysis.&lt;br/&gt;Theoretical, experimental, and practical issues of all levels will arise in this research project, making it ideally suited for teams of students, composed of individuals at various academic levels ranging from sophomore to Ph.D., to participate. The rationale for including undergraduate students in what is traditionally graduate work, is threefold: (1) hands-on research projects give them the opportunity to apply the knowledge learned in their course work; (2) exposing them to open-ended research problems gives them a feel for what is involved in graduate school and can encourage them to pursue graduate degrees; and (3) undergraduate students are typically an untapped resource in academia: given the right opportunity, students are often highly motivated and extremely creative. I intend to use this team-oriented approach to propose and implement an accelerated Masters of Science Option to the College of Engineering at the University of Hawai'i Manoa campus. This program would allow top performing students to get a Masters of Science with a thesis within one year of their Bachelors degree. This plan would be the first of its kind in the College of Engineering and would contribute significantly to the College's current initiative to boost enrollment. Furthermore, this interactive program would have a positive impact on the local community for two reasons. First, high-tech research draws attention from the mainland, as well as Japan, which can play an essential part in helping to balance the tourism-based economy. Second, engineers with graduate degrees and having a solid education and good practical experience are in high demand in the current job market, an asset highly revered in this tight-knit community. Creating a positive image within the local community is the most effective form of outreach here in Hawaii.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
