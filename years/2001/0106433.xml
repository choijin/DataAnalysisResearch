<AbstractNarration>With support from the National Science Foundation, Dr. Steven Kuhn and a&lt;br/&gt;group of international researchers will continue archaeological excavations&lt;br/&gt;at UUagizli ("three mouths") cave in south-central Turkey.  The team includes&lt;br/&gt;professional archaeologists, physical anthropologists, geologists, and specialists&lt;br/&gt;in the analysis of ancient plant remains, as well as graduate students from&lt;br/&gt;the U.S., Turkey, and western Europe.  The central goal of the project is&lt;br/&gt;to examine evidence for marked changes in human behavior within the earliest&lt;br/&gt;Upper Paleolithic period, and to place these developments in their environmental&lt;br/&gt;context. Archaeological deposits at the site span the period between about&lt;br/&gt;30,000 and 43,000 years before present. Although humans with essentially&lt;br/&gt;modern skeletal anatomy had appeared much earlier, many researchers believe&lt;br/&gt;that it was only after 45,000 years ago that there is evidence in Eurasia&lt;br/&gt;for complex technologies, symbolic communication and art, and other features&lt;br/&gt;of material, social and intellectual life that distinguish fully modern&lt;br/&gt;humans from their ancestors.  Results from excavations at UUagizli cave&lt;br/&gt;to date have helped expand our understanding of changes in economies and&lt;br/&gt;technology for this crucial interval in human history.  The site has also&lt;br/&gt;yielded remains of what are among the earliest ornament-making traditions&lt;br/&gt;in Eurasia. These findings are especially important because they document&lt;br/&gt;the use of material culture as a medium of symbolic communication, long&lt;br/&gt;considered an important rubicon in human cognitive evolution.  One issue&lt;br/&gt;guiding the research is whether developments in human behavior after 45,000&lt;br/&gt;years ago represent local responses to changing ecological and demographic&lt;br/&gt;conditions, or whether they reflect the appearance of new human populations&lt;br/&gt;with enhanced cognitive abilities. Continuing excavations will allow us&lt;br/&gt;to examine in detail the timing of major shifts in behavior, and whether&lt;br/&gt;they occurred independently or in concert. Studies of animal bones, remains&lt;br/&gt;of shellfish, as well as ancient pollen and phytoliths (durable crystalline&lt;br/&gt;components of plant tissues) will allow us to place these developments in&lt;br/&gt;their environmental context, helping to distinguish broad evolutionary trends&lt;br/&gt;within the human species as a whole from local adaptations to changing conditions.&lt;br/&gt; At the same time, the project is helping to establish new links between&lt;br/&gt;academic institutions in Turkey and the United States.  Through their participation&lt;br/&gt;in the research, students from Ankara University obtain training in field&lt;br/&gt;and lab methods. In exchange, American graduate students get valuable&lt;br/&gt;overseas research experience as well as material for theses and dissertations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
