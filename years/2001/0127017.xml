<AbstractNarration>Interdisciplinary (99)&lt;br/&gt;This project supports the acquisition of an Inductively Coupled Plasma Emission Spectrophotometer (ICP), the centerpiece for establishing a five-course sequence that integrates problem-based learning, and faculty development for implementation of the integrated courses. The course sequence tracks majors through Environmental Communication and Problem-solving, Research and Analytical Methods, Environmental&lt;br/&gt;Statistics, Environmental Impact Assessment, and Senior Seminar. The interdisciplinary environmental themes and a hierarchical course model are adapted from successful programs at Montclair State University (NSF-DUE 9952667), Middlebury College (NSF-DUE 9980911) Evergreen State College (NSF-DUE 9972501), and Governor's State College (NSF-DUE 0088831). The Environmental Science and Policy Program at the University of Southern Maine is strengthening its curriculum by adding a new B.S. degree to the existing B.A. degree. The B.S. degree was approved in 2001 and is being implemented during the 2002 academic year. The addition of a B.S. degree option modifies the current interdisciplinary curriculum model and requires revising and transforming two courses (Environmental Communication and Environmental Impact Assessment) and creating three new courses (Research and Analytical Methods, Environmental Statistics, and Senior Seminar) to form an integrated, cohesive course sequence. Students are first introduced to dominant environmental themes, their causes, and potential solutions while also developing a research proposal to guide their future activities. Next they gain hands-on training in data collection and generation in both the field and laboratory and are introduced to data quality objectives focusing on their selected theme. Students then use the data they generated in an environmental statistics course. Student teams next synthesize their prior studies through comprehensive impact assessment approaches. Lastly, students culminate their research through a professional presentation at either a college-wide research symposium, regional, or, if appropriate, national meeting. The collective outcomes from each course will result in a comprehensive and evaluative student research portfolio. Introducing students and faculty to a range of environmental themes across a sequenced course structure strengthens the interdisciplinary learning goals for the curriculum as a whole. In addition, the weave of a focus environmental theme across a five-course sequence engages and interests students while allowing them to build problem-solving skills, communication abilities, and analytical competence. In particular, this approach attracts and improves the science skills of a large non-traditional USM student body (predominately female, older, and part-time). Student outcomes are expected to improve understanding of environmental scientific knowledge, increase practical skills relating to communication, laboratory analysis, data collection, and research writing. This project is being implemented over a 24-month period and the curriculum modifications are being evaluated at two levels: course-specific successes and overall sequence outcomes. The results are being disseminated to science peer groups within our institution, our region, and at national meetings and WWW provides access to our results through our Program homepage.</AbstractNarration>
