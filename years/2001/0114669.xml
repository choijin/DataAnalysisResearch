<AbstractNarration>The Miami Museum of Science proposes to design and implement an innovative model &lt;br/&gt;program to increase the confidence, interest and preparedness of girls to pursue &lt;br/&gt;academic and employment opportunities related to high end careers in the field of &lt;br/&gt;information technology (IT). Titled GREAT! (Girls Redesigning and Excelling in &lt;br/&gt;Advanced Technology), the project will build on the body of research related to girls&lt;br/&gt;and IT to develop and model effective methodologies for engaging girls as designers -&lt;br/&gt;- as opposed to simply users -- of IT applications. The overall goal of GREAT! is to &lt;br/&gt;raise interest and skills in advanced technology applications among middle school &lt;br/&gt;girls, particularly girls of color, resulting in increased representation of females in&lt;br/&gt;academic programs and employment opportunities leading to high end IT careers. &lt;br/&gt;Specific objectives of GREAT! are to build girls' confidence and expertise with &lt;br/&gt;advanced technology applications; to engage them in the use of advanced technology to &lt;br/&gt;solve real world problems; to strengthen girls' communication and presentation skills; &lt;br/&gt;to contribute to and inform the field through a comprehensive evaluation of project&lt;br/&gt;outcomes, and to disseminate project methodologies and findings among informal &lt;br/&gt;science education institutions and other interested parties. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Museum will collaborate with Miami Dade County Public School's Urban Systemic&lt;br/&gt;Program to recruit 40 middle school girls each year, for a total of 120 girls over the&lt;br/&gt;duration of the project. Over the course of a two year period, participants will assume &lt;br/&gt;the roles of IT designers, acquiring progressively complex technology skills &lt;br/&gt;culminating in the creation of a fully interactive 3 D virtual Museum exhibit experience.&lt;br/&gt;Girls will begin by participating in a 12 week Saturday Technology Workshop which will &lt;br/&gt;take place over the course of the academic year. Following completion of the Technology &lt;br/&gt;Workshop series, girls will take part in a 4 week intensive summer Design Studio in &lt;br/&gt;which they will use state of the art virtual reality (VR) technology to create a VR&lt;br/&gt;production showcasing an invention of their own design. Girls will work in teams of four, &lt;br/&gt;with each team assigned a mentor (a female college student majoring in computer&lt;br/&gt;technology or a related field) who will provide technical guidance and serve as a role&lt;br/&gt;model. Upon completing their productions, girls will strengthen their presentation skills&lt;br/&gt;and increase self esteem and self confidence through Family Night presentations and by &lt;br/&gt;exhibiting and interpreting their work to visitors in the Museum galleries for a one month &lt;br/&gt;period during the subsequent academic year. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Museum will contract with VR Visions and the Center for Children and Technology&lt;br/&gt;to provide design support. Kathleen Tyner of Media Analysis &amp; Practice will serve &lt;br/&gt;as the project's external evaluator, responsible for formative and summative evaluation &lt;br/&gt;of project activities.</AbstractNarration>
