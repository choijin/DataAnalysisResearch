<AbstractNarration>The process of designing or upgrading a large-scale broadband&lt;br/&gt;communication infrastructure involves solving several optimization problems, including&lt;br/&gt;the problems of optimum topology design, server placement, distribution&lt;br/&gt;and replication of data between the servers, and fair division of&lt;br/&gt;limited network resources (e.g. bandwidth, CPU cycles, etc.) among the users. As&lt;br/&gt;networks become larger and more complicated, it becomes imperative to&lt;br/&gt;use mathematically sound, scalable methods for solving the above problems.&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to develop and implement such methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the main thrusts of the project is development of new approaches&lt;br/&gt;for network design and sizing. In particular, the project focuses on&lt;br/&gt;development of optimization techniques where the goal is to construct a low cost&lt;br/&gt;topology, choose optimum locations (and sizes) for servers (e.g. web&lt;br/&gt;caches, application servers, wireless hubs, etc.), and decide how to&lt;br/&gt;replicated the data.  A related problem is network&lt;br/&gt;expansion/augmentation, where the goal is to decide (online) where to&lt;br/&gt;place new equipment and to choose which new links to lease in order to&lt;br/&gt;satisfy the increased demand. Due to economies of scale, topology design&lt;br/&gt;and augmentation problems have concave costs structure and hence can not&lt;br/&gt;be solved by classical flow-based approaches. The investigators work on&lt;br/&gt;developing principled approaches for solving the above problems and on&lt;br/&gt;designing and implementing a set of tools that can be used in the&lt;br/&gt;planning and network management process.</AbstractNarration>
