<AbstractNarration>This is a U.S.-East European workshop on algebraic geometry and geometric modeling that will be held in Lithuania.  The principal investigators are Dr. Ronald Goldman from William March Rice University and Professor Rimvydas Krasauskas from Vilnius University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Algebraic geometry has in the past affected and in the present continues to affect the progress of geometric modeling and computer aided design.  The purpose of this workshop is to provide an opportunity to disseminate new trends and techniques in algebraic geometry to the geometric modeling community.  The Lithuanian mathematicians and computer scientists have taken the lead in investigating applications of toric varieties to geometric modeling.  These applications are largely unknown in the U.S. and Western Europe and this workshop will serve as an effective mechanism for promoting and disseminating this work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop in mathematics and computer sciences fulfills the program objectives of bringing together leading experts in the U.S. and Central/Eastern Europe to combine complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest and competence on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.</AbstractNarration>
