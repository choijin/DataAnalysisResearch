<AbstractNarration>Ms. Pamela Dase is a gifted teacher of high-school mathematics who has made an extraordinary effort to mentor high-school students. In support her classes at Centennial High School in the Columbus Public School system, she advocated for the Algebra for All pilot program for all students in her building. Centennial High School is described as an urban school with a significantly diverse student population, including students for who English is a second language. Dase is a champion for increased math requirements; she has high expectations of her students and they respond. She provides after-school support to ensure that students are successful. One indicator of the outcome may be that Centennial's students tend to score higher that the district average on statewide proficiency tests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Her principal describes Dase as a veteran teacher (thirty-two years) who is a trendsetter and role model, working with more junior staff to incorporate technology throughout the curriculum and in all classes. Dase's students have gone on to achieve doctorates in molecular biology, physics, and mathematics, as well as baccalaureate degrees in diverse areas. Several of her students have become teachers of mathematics; one such student is now a teacher at the same school.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
