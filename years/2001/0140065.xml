<AbstractNarration>McBay &lt;br/&gt;OIA-0140065&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quality Education for Minorities (QEM) Network, a non-profit organization, has been instrumental in improving the education of under-represented groups that have been historically undeserved by the nation's educational system.  A successor to the Quality Education for Minorities Project based at MIT, QEM continues to develop effective strategies for STEM education for minorities, and focuses on issues and barriers that prevent minorities from receiving a high quality education. This project continues to provide internship opportunities for students at the National Science Foundation as a mechanism to increase students understanding of science policy; encourage potential for becoming leaders and proponents for increased STEM participation by students from low-income communities; and encourage interns to continue STEM interests and studies through the doctoral level. Complimentary to the internship experience at NSF, students are required to engage in a science-oriented community outreach activity during the following academic year at their respective institutions.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
