<AbstractNarration>This is a U.S.-Bulgarian cooperative research project that will focus on synthesizing large quantities of conductive nanoparticles for possible applications to battery technology.  The principal investigators are Dr. Kenneth Klabunde from Kansas State University and Dr. Iovka Dragieva from the Central Laboratory of Electrochemical Power Sources in Sofia. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers will devise strategies for the synthesis of large quantities of conductive and semiconductive nanoparticies.  The strategies will be based on two approaches:  1)  modified sol-gel/aerogel procedures employing metal alkoxide molecular precursors leading to metal oxide nanoparticles, and conversation of metal oxide nanoparticles to metal sulfide (or selenide or telluride) nanoparticles by catalyzed solid-gas reactions and 2) borohydride reduction of mixed metal salts to yield bimetallic metal particles and metal hydrides, and metal vapor-solvent cocondensation to form nanocrystalline metals and bimetallics. Through this research the researchers expect to discover and develop better porous conducting materials for applications as electrodes in Li ion batteries, metal-hydride batteries, and zinc-air batteries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project in materials research fulfills the program objectives of bringing together leading experts in the U.S. and Central/Eastern Europe to combine complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest and competence on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.</AbstractNarration>
