<AbstractNarration>With National Science Foundation support, Drs. Patricia Urban, Edward&lt;br/&gt;Schortman, and Ms. Marne Ausec have worked to describe and explain changes in&lt;br/&gt;prehistoric power relations within the adjoining Naco and lower Cacaulapa&lt;br/&gt;valleys, Northwestern Honduras.  The basic question has been, and remains,&lt;br/&gt;"How did a few come to rule the many?"  Answering this deceptively&lt;br/&gt;straightforward query requires examining the ways in which local rulers&lt;br/&gt;marshaled political and economic forces within their societies and forged&lt;br/&gt;alliances with peers in neighboring realms.  The hypothesis guiding this&lt;br/&gt;research proposes that: 1. Rulers exercised dominion by monopolizing local&lt;br/&gt;access to imported commodities valued and needed by the general populace, as&lt;br/&gt;well as locally produced items, such as ceramic vessels and stone tools; 2.&lt;br/&gt;Commoners surrendered their labor and loyalty to local notables in return for&lt;br/&gt;access to these goods; 3. Unwilling to go gently into dependence, commoners&lt;br/&gt;also used their skills and immediately available resources to make as many&lt;br/&gt;items for their own use and trade as possible, thereby minimizing reliance on&lt;br/&gt;local lords; 4. This competition resulted in a population divided by the&lt;br/&gt;power ndividuals, families, or factions could wield and the wealth they &lt;br/&gt;enjoyed.&lt;br/&gt;Work funded by the National Science Foundation in Naco, from 1990-1996, was&lt;br/&gt;instrumental in establishing this model; investigations pursued in the lower&lt;br/&gt;Cacaulapa valley from 1999-2000, also funded by the NSF, are crucial to&lt;br/&gt;testing these ideas.  Survey of 7km2 in the lower Cacaulapa drainage&lt;br/&gt;identified a major political capital, El Coyote, with over 340 prehistoric&lt;br/&gt;structures covering 0.7km2.  Excavation of 2,850m2 on and around 40 buildings&lt;br/&gt;at El Coyote and in five rural sites revealed a history of occupation that&lt;br/&gt;diverged markedly from the expected.  Specifically, emerging data patterns&lt;br/&gt;suggest that first, El Coyote came to prominence during the Late Classic&lt;br/&gt;period (AD 600-950; the site was founded as early as AD200), possibly as an&lt;br/&gt;outpost of its larger Naco Valley contemporary, La Sierra.  Second, rather&lt;br/&gt;than staying within La Sierra's shadow, El Coyote's rulers established their&lt;br/&gt;independence by AD 1000.  Third, building on their new-found autonomy, lower&lt;br/&gt;Cacaulapa notables went on to fashion a realm that was growing in size and&lt;br/&gt;complexity, and acquiring goods from as far away as central Mexico and&lt;br/&gt;Guatemala's Pacific coast, between AD 1000-1300, when neighboring societies,&lt;br/&gt;including those in Naco, suffered profound declines.  Assessing these &lt;br/&gt;preliminary interpretations requires further analyses of ceramics, stone &lt;br/&gt;tools, faunal and floral remains, as well as human skeletons, to be conducted &lt;br/&gt;with National Science Foundation support during May through December, 2001.  &lt;br/&gt;These studies will focus on: 1.  stylistic studies of artifacts, particularly &lt;br/&gt;ceramics, designed to help date deposits, and infer the external connections &lt;br/&gt;enjoyed by lower Cacaulapa residents through time; 2. technological analyses &lt;br/&gt;aimed at identifying the range and scale of specialized production activities &lt;br/&gt;in which residents of El Coyote and its hinterland engaged; 3. functional &lt;br/&gt;studies aimed at reconstructing changes in patterns of consumption and &lt;br/&gt;production across time and space; 4. distributional assessments, to test for &lt;br/&gt;artifact patterns suggestive of wealth and power differences; 5. examination &lt;br/&gt;of skeletal remains to describe demographic processes as well as stresses (for &lt;br/&gt;example, dietary deficiencies, injuries, physical changes from movements &lt;br/&gt;unique to certain occupations) to which lower Cacaulapa populations were heir.&lt;br/&gt; The planned work is crucial to writing lower Cacaulapa valley prehistory and &lt;br/&gt;comparing the ways in which political and economic processes were manipulated &lt;br/&gt;there and within other ancient states.  The research applies not just to &lt;br/&gt;Honduras, or even the ancient New World, but to any society in which those &lt;br/&gt;seeking power tried to alter their societies, while others resisted &lt;br/&gt;domination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
