<AbstractNarration>OIA-0101762&lt;br/&gt;Yochelson&lt;br/&gt;Council of  Competitiveness&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will provide partial support for the second National Innovation Summit to be held at the University of California, San Diego, on April 5-6, 2001. The Summit will serve as a forum for over 150 public and private sector leaders to discuss issues pertinent to the nation's economic competitiveness and technological innovation.  The core components of the agenda, which highlight NSF's research and education goals, include winning the skills race, sustaining American leadership at the frontiers of discovery and research, and strengthening regional innovation capabilities. In each of these areas, leaders will define strategic challenges, illuminate them with policy research, and develop broadly supported policy recommendations advancing the national interest. Consequently the Summit will raise awareness of the close connection between innovation and competitiveness in the global economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
