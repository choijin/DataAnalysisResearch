<AbstractNarration>Geography (88)&lt;br/&gt;The core purpose of this project is to adapt key elements of the core curriculum developed by the National Council for Geographic Information and Analysis (NCGIA,1997), combining these with materials already used on some campuses in the University of Maine system. This is a collaborative project designed to benefit five universities that are part of this system: &lt;br/&gt;The University of Southern Maine,&lt;br/&gt;The University of Maine, Fort Kent,&lt;br/&gt;The University of Maine, Machias,&lt;br/&gt;The University of Maine, Augusta, and&lt;br/&gt;The University of Maine, Farmington. &lt;br/&gt;The broader purpose of this collaborative project is to enhance GIScience education throughout the state of Maine on the 5 collaborating campuses. On each campus a dedicated laboratory is being equipped to support the development of a modern geographical information science (GIScience) curriculum, comprised of GIS and GPS technology and related educational materials. We are developing and implementing a sequence of two GIScience courses for undergraduate students in each of the five universities. These are being designed to educate students to a common standard of achievement, although there are local variations designed to meet the varied needs of the 5 participating campuses. The new curriculum meets a growing need for high-quality GIScience education in a variety of fields. We are designing the two-course sequences to foster active learning by customizing exercises and data sets to the diverse geographic locations and programmatic strengths of each campus. Our project is also enhancing and developing the skills of the faculty, and integrating advanced technology into a variety of disciplines. Our plan is to disseminate our work through our teaching, on-site workshops for our faculty colleagues, internet publication, and presentation at professional meetings. Project evaluation is being assisted by on-site peer input during faculty workshops, and periodic review by a three member advisory panel of GIScience scholars and professionals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
