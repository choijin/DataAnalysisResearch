<AbstractNarration>Under the direction of Dr. Terry Hunt, Ms. Julie Field will collect data for&lt;br/&gt;her doctoral dissertation. She will initiate new archaeological research in&lt;br/&gt;the Sigatoka Valley, located in the southwestern corner of the island of&lt;br/&gt;Viti Levu, Fiji. This research will investigate the evolution of competitive&lt;br/&gt;settlement strategies between related and non-related social groups in&lt;br/&gt;Fijian prehistory.  Ms. Field's previous analyses of aerial photographs from&lt;br/&gt;the Sigatoka Valley have documented the location and character of over 700&lt;br/&gt;archaeological features, including fortifications, agricultural features,&lt;br/&gt;and unfortified settlements. Despite the quantity and richness of the&lt;br/&gt;archaeological record, no chronology exists for the establishment of the&lt;br/&gt;fortifications, or the arrival of the various patrilineal descent groups&lt;br/&gt;documented at the contact period.  Ms. Field's doctoral dissertation&lt;br/&gt;research will examine the development of fortifications in the valley, and&lt;br/&gt;also trace the relationship between the environment and the frequency of&lt;br/&gt;conflict, as evinced by the occurrence of fortifications on lands&lt;br/&gt;traditionally held by patrilineal descent groups, known as mataqali and&lt;br/&gt;yavusa.  Her research will incorporate an archaeological excavation and&lt;br/&gt;collection strategy, focusing on a sample of 15 sites from a variety of&lt;br/&gt;environmental zones.  The acquisition of datable materials from such&lt;br/&gt;features as walls, ditches, and remote mountain outposts will allow for the&lt;br/&gt;first chronology of fortifications in this part of Fiji.  Ms. Field will&lt;br/&gt;also couple the information gleaned from archaeological research to an&lt;br/&gt;environmental model generated within the framework of a geographic&lt;br/&gt;information system (GIS).  Comparison of these data, as well as the&lt;br/&gt;distribution of land-holdings and hierarchical social relations that are&lt;br/&gt;known to exist between the patrilineal descent groups of the valley, will&lt;br/&gt;have the potential to indicate group fission, movement, and the various&lt;br/&gt;competitive stances that existed in prehistory.  Archaeologists are&lt;br/&gt;interested in the development of conflict and warfare, and the examination&lt;br/&gt;of fortifications is a very direct method for the study of this phenomenon&lt;br/&gt;during the prehistoric period.  NSF support will allow Ms. Field to conduct&lt;br/&gt;excavations in Fiji, and also provide for the dating of archaeological&lt;br/&gt;materials.  This research is important because it will yield data of&lt;br/&gt;interest to both regional and international scholars, and it explores a&lt;br/&gt;topic that is of great interest to the discipline of anthropology.  It will&lt;br/&gt;also support and assist in training a promising young scientist.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
