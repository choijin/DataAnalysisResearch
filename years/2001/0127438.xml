<AbstractNarration>Physics (13) This project is developing and field testing a set of companion materials intended to provide visualization and numerical solutions illustrating problems and concepts in upper-level undergraduate courses in electricity and magnetism. The goal is determine how the use of a highly portable and cost-free implementation of computational and visual learning tool may be brought into wide acceptance. The subject of electrodynamics has been chosen for this proof-of-concept project because of the rich opportunity for visualization. This prototype project involves developing a selection of sample learning aides for undergraduate electrodynamics with a component of field testing in a classroom environment. The project materials consist of Java programs with numerical methods and a visualization interface and are accompanied by descriptive text. A key component of the prototype concept is the text and discussion materials that work with the Java visualization and computational tools. This accompanying material includes subject explanation and description of the use of the computational/visual tools. Though a significant quantity of learning materials and software are being produced in this prototype project, one of the major research question addressed is the design of materials to that they are actually used in the classroom. The design concept being tested seeks to remove many of the typical barriers to adapting new material for an existing class. Among the barriers being addressed are cost, relevance, software compatibility, and the important issue of time invested by teacher and student in getting started with the learning tools. Relevance and other design features are the subject of field tests included in the project design.</AbstractNarration>
