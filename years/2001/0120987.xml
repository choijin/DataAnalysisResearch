<AbstractNarration>AST-0120987&lt;br/&gt;PI: Gyuk, Geza&lt;br/&gt;Inst: Adler Planetarium&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award under the MPS Internships in Public Science Education Program, the Adler Planetarium will sponsor a unique graduate fellowship program. The Adler Public Education Fellowship is aimed at drawing young researchers into closer ties with public education and outreach.  Each year, a graduate student actively involved in research will be selected as a Fellow and will be responsible for planning, developing, managing and teaching a 4-5 week summer program for local high school students and carrying out a program of public observing/demonstrations on the Apache Point 3.5meter telescope.  The Astro-Science Workshop will be a themed, research-based experience combining lectures by prominent astronomers/astrophysicists and hands-on student research and exploration.  Because the Fellowship is intended to promote the development of researchers/educators, the Fellow is also expected to continue a vigorous program of research at their home institution.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded by the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities.&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>
