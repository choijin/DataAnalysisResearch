<AbstractNarration>Project Summary for award DMS-0400461 of Pries&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theory of Galois covers of the complex projective line (Riemann &lt;br/&gt;sphere) with given branch locus is well-understood; namely, one can &lt;br/&gt;describe the inertia groups of such a cover with Riemann's Existence &lt;br/&gt;Theorem and study families of such covers via their moduli spaces, which &lt;br/&gt;are called Hurwitz spaces. These techniques extend to covers of the &lt;br/&gt;projective line over an algebraically closed field k as long as the &lt;br/&gt;ramification is tame. However, if the ramification is wild, i.e. if the &lt;br/&gt;characteristic of the field k divides the order of some inertia group, &lt;br/&gt;new phenomena occur which are much less understood. There are major open &lt;br/&gt;problems involving the inertia groups and deformation theory of wildly &lt;br/&gt;ramified covers. The PI proposes to study wildly ramified covers of curves, with the goal &lt;br/&gt;of answering some of these problems; in particular, the PI expects to &lt;br/&gt;compute the dimension of the deformation space of a cover in terms of its &lt;br/&gt;ramification invariants. The PI also proposes to construct moduli spaces &lt;br/&gt;for wildly ramified Galois covers of curves in characteristic p and to &lt;br/&gt;investigate some of their properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Galois theory has high appeal to a broad audience. Several open problems &lt;br/&gt;in this area can be explained to non-mathematicians and the topic connects &lt;br/&gt;diverse areas of math. Galois theory arose classically as a means of &lt;br/&gt;understanding symmetries of equations and of classifying extensions of the &lt;br/&gt;rational numbers. Some of the early applications were that it is &lt;br/&gt;impossible to trisect an angle, double the volume of a cube, or solve a &lt;br/&gt;quintic equation. The PI proposes to develop a new course on Galois theory, to introduce &lt;br/&gt;graduate students to the fundamental background and active research &lt;br/&gt;problems of this topic.  The PI would like to continue to lead research &lt;br/&gt;programs for students; the program which the PI led in 2002 motivated &lt;br/&gt;several students (including students from underrepresented groups) to &lt;br/&gt;pursue graduate study in mathematics. An application of Galois theory in characteristic $p$ to data-transfer codes was recently discovered.  These codes can be constructed using &lt;br/&gt;curves of low degree which have many points defined over finite fields. &lt;br/&gt;The PI would like to develop the connection between Galois theory and &lt;br/&gt;coding theory further. Finally, the PI will continue collaborating with &lt;br/&gt;mathematicians in Germany and New York and will disseminate the results &lt;br/&gt;from this research through conferences and papers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
