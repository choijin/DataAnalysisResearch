<AbstractNarration>Principal Investigator:  Barrie Walden&lt;br/&gt;Institution:  WHOI&lt;br/&gt;Proposal #:  0433409&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WHOI proposes to design and build a new, state-of-the-art 6500 meter deep submergence research human occupied vehicle (HOV) for the U.S. oceanographic community to replace the DSV Alvin.    By providing the capability to routinely access the deep seafloor and conduct observational, sampling and mapping studies, DSV Alvin  has,  over  the  past  four  decades,  helped  to  revolutionize  our understanding of seafloor geologic processes and benthic ecosystems, making important discoveries about the biological, chemical and geological processes that shape our planet. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed HOV replacement will be a more robust and technologically advanced deep submergence vehicle, and will still be capable of operating off of the R/V Atlantis with only minor ship modifications.  Proposed scientific elements of the design include many cutting edge technologies, such as a variable ballast system to allow for midwater column research, use of new battery systems to increase bottom time and depth capability to reach 95 per cent of the ocean bottom.  Implementation of these unique technologies will allow science users enhanced capabilities and expand the suite of oceanographic disciplines that will be able to use a deep submersible for research.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
