<AbstractNarration>The Institute for Mathematics and its Applications (IMA) funds&lt;br/&gt;every year a summer graduate program in an area of interest&lt;br/&gt;to graduate students in mathematics.  The 2004 edition&lt;br/&gt;will be held at the University of Notre Dame from June 8&lt;br/&gt;until June 27, 2004. The topic of the summer school will be on&lt;br/&gt;coding theory and cryptography. About 60 graduate students,&lt;br/&gt;20 recent Ph.D's and 10 more senior researchers will participate&lt;br/&gt;in this three week event.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The summer school will combine both teaching and research. Half&lt;br/&gt;the time will be devoted to teaching coding theory  and cryptography&lt;br/&gt;by some leading researchers in the field. During the other half of&lt;br/&gt;the day groups of 3-4 graduate students will do research under&lt;br/&gt;the supervision of a senior mentor who typically is a  recent PhD.&lt;br/&gt;A broad variety of research projects will be studied by the graduate&lt;br/&gt;students. The school will provide a learning and research experience&lt;br/&gt;both for the graduate students and their senior mentors.&lt;br/&gt;Details about the summer program and the studied research&lt;br/&gt;projects can be found on the web:&lt;br/&gt;http://www.nd.edu/~cam/ima/&lt;br/&gt;NSF support helps to cover the travel expenses of participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
