<AbstractNarration>Abstract &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0354373 FRG: Collaborative Research in Semiclassical Asymptotic Questions in Integrable Nonlinear Wave Theory  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Peter Miller, Kenneth McLaughlin and Jared Bronski&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of applied mathematics is the study of equations of scientific,&lt;br/&gt;engineering or industrial interest in a mathematically rigorous way.&lt;br/&gt;Understanding such equations often requires considering&lt;br/&gt;a limit in which certain parameters approach zero. While&lt;br/&gt;some of these problems behave in a predictable manner in the&lt;br/&gt;limit, other interesting and important problems involve unstable&lt;br/&gt;behavior that becomes less and less predictable the smaller the&lt;br/&gt;parameter of interest becomes.  One of the best illustrations of this&lt;br/&gt;concept is the behavior of fluid flows when the viscous drag is small,&lt;br/&gt;and the fluid behaves in a turbulent and chaotic way.&lt;br/&gt;The primary model under study in this project is the nonlinear&lt;br/&gt;Schrodinger equation, which is a fundamental model for the study of&lt;br/&gt;pulses in optical fibers. The small parameter limit for this&lt;br/&gt;model corresponds to the limit of ultra-short pulse propagation, which&lt;br/&gt;is expected to find many applications to high-speed telecommunications.&lt;br/&gt;This limit is known as the semiclassical limit.&lt;br/&gt;This project constitutes an in-depth study of initial-value problems&lt;br/&gt;for several partial differential equations (PDEs) in the semiclassical&lt;br/&gt;limit. Existing formal theories fail because they lead to model problems that are&lt;br/&gt;ill-posed and thus make no prediction at all for reasonable initial&lt;br/&gt;conditions.  The goal of this project is to develop asymptotic&lt;br/&gt;theories that are not based on any particular ansatz and do not&lt;br/&gt;require unphysical conditions on the initial data.  Among the problems&lt;br/&gt;under attack is the rigorous semiclassical analysis of the focusing&lt;br/&gt;nonlinear Schroedinger equation for general data, a problem that is&lt;br/&gt;generally considered to be one of the most important open problems in&lt;br/&gt;the field of integrable systems.  The specific aims of the project&lt;br/&gt;include the development of new ansatz-free methods of asymptotic&lt;br/&gt;analysis --- for spectral theory and for Riemann-Hilbert problems of&lt;br/&gt;inverse-scattering theory --- that are insensitive to analyticity&lt;br/&gt;properties of the initial data, and have a "nonlinear&lt;br/&gt;Riemann-Lebesgue" character, directly exploiting cancellation due to&lt;br/&gt;oscillations where analytic deformations are impossible.  These&lt;br/&gt;techniques, once developed, will also have important repercussions in&lt;br/&gt;fields that are only tangentially related, for example, the theory of&lt;br/&gt;orthogonal polynomials of large degree and the statistical analysis of&lt;br/&gt;large random matrices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main goal of the proposed work is to develop predictive tools that&lt;br/&gt;apply to extremely unstable systems when the initial conditions&lt;br/&gt;are rough or noisy. An example of such a system is the one governing the&lt;br/&gt;propagation of ultrashort data pulses in certain optical fibers, and&lt;br/&gt;therefor any new insights into such systems will have repercussions&lt;br/&gt;in the field of telecommunications. Some of the problems we propose to&lt;br/&gt;study admit a detailed analysis because they are idealized and can in some&lt;br/&gt;sense be solved exactly; however our work is also expected to lead to general&lt;br/&gt;methods that are applicable to less idealized systems.&lt;br/&gt;These techniques will also have important implications in mathematical&lt;br/&gt;fields that are only tangentially related, for example, the theory of&lt;br/&gt;orthogonal polynomials of large degree and the statistical analysis of&lt;br/&gt;large random matrices.This project also has an important educational&lt;br/&gt;aspect. We plan to involve both graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in&lt;br/&gt;this work, and the advanced training of the next generation of researchers&lt;br/&gt;is an important component of this proposal. We also plan an&lt;br/&gt;interdisciplinary workshop to further disseminate the results of this work beyond the&lt;br/&gt;boundaries of the mathematical community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
