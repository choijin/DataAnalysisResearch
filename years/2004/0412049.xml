<AbstractNarration>Optimization problems involving eigenvalues arise in many&lt;br/&gt;applications. In recent years, attention has focused on&lt;br/&gt;semidefinite programs, which are linear optimization problems in&lt;br/&gt;the space of real symmetric matrices, with positive semidefinite&lt;br/&gt;constraints.  This project focuses on optimization problems in the&lt;br/&gt;larger space of square matrices, not generally symmetric. In this&lt;br/&gt;context, it is well known that eigenvalues, which provide&lt;br/&gt;information about asymptotic behavior of dynamical systems, are&lt;br/&gt;not as useful as pseudospectra, which provide a more robust&lt;br/&gt;measure of system behavior. This project focuses on the&lt;br/&gt;computation, analysis and, especially, numerical optimization of&lt;br/&gt;pseudospectral functions. A secondary goal is to advance the&lt;br/&gt;development of algorithms for general nonsmooth, nonconvex&lt;br/&gt;optimization problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Applications of this work arise in many contexts.  A good example&lt;br/&gt;that we have used is a model of a Boeing 767 at a flutter condition.&lt;br/&gt;Flutter occurs when the plane flies so fast that the interaction&lt;br/&gt;of the aerodynamic (wind) forces with the structural forces in&lt;br/&gt;the airplane combine to generate an instability which could be&lt;br/&gt;catastrophic.  Normally, a plane like this does not fly so fast but&lt;br/&gt;it is important to know what would happen if it did, and whether a&lt;br/&gt;simple controller could bring the plane under control.  Eigenvalues &lt;br/&gt;tell us about stability in the long term, but pseudospectra are far &lt;br/&gt;more informative, telling us about stability in the short term.  &lt;br/&gt;Optimizing the pseudospectra over the parameters of the &lt;br/&gt;controller may result in the design of a controller that is simple &lt;br/&gt;yet effective in avoiding the instability and preventing catastrophe.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
