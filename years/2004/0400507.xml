<AbstractNarration>The PI plans to pursue research in three different areas. First the PI &lt;br/&gt;plans to extend the work of Brenti, Remmel, Beck, Langley, Wagner and &lt;br/&gt;others who have used certain homomorphisms from the ring of symmetric &lt;br/&gt;functions to a polynomial ring F[x], for an appropriately chosen field F, &lt;br/&gt;to find new generating functions for permutations statistics. Recently &lt;br/&gt;discovered methods by the PI and his students have produced many new &lt;br/&gt;applications of these methods which allow one to find generating functions &lt;br/&gt;for 321-avoiding permutations, alternating permutations, and permutation &lt;br/&gt;enumeration statistics for various subgroups of the wreath product of a &lt;br/&gt;finite group with the symmetric group. The PI plans to systemize and extend &lt;br/&gt;such methods. Second, the PI plans to study the combinatorics of various &lt;br/&gt;submodules of the ring of diagonal harmonics which is intimately connected &lt;br/&gt;with the theory of Macdonald polynomials. The work of Garsia, Haiman, &lt;br/&gt;Haglund, Loehr and the PI have lead to combinatorial interpretations of the &lt;br/&gt;Hilbert series and the generating function for the occurrences of the &lt;br/&gt;alternating representation in the character of such submodules under the &lt;br/&gt;diagonal action in terms of counting various classes of labeled Dyck paths &lt;br/&gt;according to certain statistics. More recently, Haiman, Haglund, Loehr, &lt;br/&gt;Remmel and Ulyanov have given a conjectured combinatorial interpretation of &lt;br/&gt;the coefficient of a monomial symmetric function in the Frobenius series of &lt;br/&gt;the ring of diagonal harmonics. The goal of the PI's research in this area &lt;br/&gt;is to prove some of these conjectures and to give a full combinatorial &lt;br/&gt;interpretation of the Frobenius series of the ring of diagonal harmonics. &lt;br/&gt;Finally the PI also plans to work on (p,q)-analogues of rook theory and &lt;br/&gt;various extension of rook theory and the theory of enumeration of spanning &lt;br/&gt;forests of various directed graphs studied by Egecioglu, Williamson and the PI.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is concerned with various problems which arise in the study of &lt;br/&gt;algebraic combinatorics. In particular, the goal of this project is to &lt;br/&gt;increase our understanding of how various classical combinatorial &lt;br/&gt;structures such as permutations, lattice paths, spanning trees and &lt;br/&gt;placements of non-attaching rooks on generalized chess boards play a &lt;br/&gt;fundamental role in helping us understand certain algebraic structures. &lt;br/&gt;Conversely, in algebraic combinatorics, one wants to understand how various &lt;br/&gt;algebraic structures can give new insights into the theory of these &lt;br/&gt;classical combinatorial structures. The three main areas of research &lt;br/&gt;proposed in this project, namely the theory of permutation enumeration, the &lt;br/&gt;theory of the ring of diagaonal harmonics and rook theory are all active &lt;br/&gt;areas of research were there is a beautiful interplay between algebraic and &lt;br/&gt;combinatorial methods.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
