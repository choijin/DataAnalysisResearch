<AbstractNarration>CAREER:  A Novel CMB Polarization Experiment based on Large Arrays of Coherent Polarimeters&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AST 0449809  Amber Miller&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Amber Miller, at Columbia University, will undertake a research program related to the anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background (CMB).  The PI will develop a 40 GHz "pathfinder array", to be used for observations of the CMB, and ultimately pave the way for production of a larger-format camera.  With this instrument, it should be possible to increase observational sensitivity to polarization anisotropy, and better constrain foreground polarization contaminants.  The PI will involve undergraduates in her research.  A pilot program, involving a local high school teacher and two students in the PI's research, will also be undertaken - the longer-term goal is to include a student teacher from Columbia's Teacher's College, during each academic year, in the effort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
