<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit Since the approval of the ultra-wide-band (UWB) frequency spectrum (1.99-10.6 GHz) by the FCC in 2002, many UWB products are currently under development for both sensing and communications. With a very large bandwidth at a relatively low frequency, UWB radar is capable of achieving both high resolution and good penetration. Therefore, UWB radar is well-suited for detecting and imaging occluded targets, e.g., humans behind walls, caves underground, or biological tissues.  Consequently, it is recognized as a promising technology for applications ranging from physical security to biomedical imaging.  UWB wireless communications also have unique advantages, especially for short range urban/indoor environments, because of high capacity, resistance to multipath and interference, and simple scalability in multi-user situations.  The current debate over IEEE standards for UWB indicates that industry intends to aggressively pursue this promising market.  However, the physical layer understanding for UWB including scattering, mobile/urban propagation, and antenna characterization, is still an emerging area. One of the key challenges in UWB radar and communications technology is how to overcome the signal distortion  caused  by  propagation through  dispersive  occluding  materials,  dispersion  due  to  frequency-dependent  antenna  radiation, nonlinear  effects  due  to  embedded  semiconductor  devices,  and  the  use  of  oversimplified  narrowband scattering  and  propagation  models.  Due to  this  lack  of  understanding,  current  UWB  radar  and communication systems are limited from reaching their full potential.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research team, a collaboration of four faculty at the University of Texas-Pan American and one  at  the  University  of  Texas  at  Austin,  have  identified  three  projects  related  to  UWB  radar  and communications  that  depend  critically  on  a  common  core  of  instrumentation;  in  particular,  high-speed time-domain measurement of UWB electromagnetic fields and signals.  In addition, two related projects in radar  imaging  and  semiconductor  modeling  need  the  ability  to  make  high-speed  time-domain measurements.  At UTPA  the  proposed  instrumentation  includes  1)  a  time domain measurement  system consisting of a very high-speed digital oscilloscope and pulse generator; 2) commercial electromagnetic simulation  software;  3)  DC  and  high-power  parametric  semiconductor  testing  equipment;  4)  antenna positioning  system  and  absorbers.  At  UT-Austin,  a  single  high  performance  vector  network  analyzer  is requested.  The  instrumentation  builds  upon  existing  facilities  and  will  greatly  extend  our  research capabilities for both the current and future projects.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The immediate application of the instrumentation will focus on three aspects of UWB technology:  1) UWB detection  and imaging  of  occluded targets; 2)  time-domain  characterization  of  UWB antennas with  embedded  circuits;  3)  UWB  electromagnetics  for  communications  and  sensing.  In  addition,  the instrumentation will support two related research projects: 4) maximum resolution range-Doppler imagery and 5) nonlinear semiconductor device characterization. While each PI will lead one of the five projects;  there is strong overlap, and three of the PIs already have a history of research collaboration.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts  UTPA is a public institution located in the Lower Rio Grande Valley of South Texas. The  student  population  is 85%  Hispanic,  the majority  are  first  generation  college  students,  and most qualify for some form of financial aid. The PIs have employed at least twenty-eight undergraduate students on research projects, and at least fourteen undergraduate students have been publication authors or  co-authors.  For  this  project,  we  have  a  special  opportunity  to  involve  eight  to  twelve  freshmen  and sophomore students per year through an already funded state/industry program that supports on-campus technical employment for new electrical engineering students at UTPA.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three  of  the  PIs  are  junior  faculty  at  UTPA,  and  UTPA.s  master.s  program  in  electrical  engineering  is  still  young.    By  strengthening  our  existing  collaborations  with  faculty  at  major  research institutions,  like  UT-Austin,  we  hope  to  improve  the  institution.s  research  track  record  and  broaden opportunities for Rio Grande Valley master.s students to transition to doctoral studies.  We expect that ten to twenty graduate students will use the proposed instrumentation for thesis research over the next eight to ten years. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
