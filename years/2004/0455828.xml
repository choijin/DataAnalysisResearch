<AbstractNarration>This five-year project is submitted under category B (full development projects) of the TPC program solicitation.  It is designed to build resources for helping teachers learn mathematical content in ways usable for the work of teaching.  Two practice-centered packags will be developed for use in the professional education of K-8 teachers of mathematics.  The packages will be usable by the existing range of teacher developers.  Each package will comprise selections of records of practice and resources for their use with teachers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Teacher educators are a diverse audience, but with enough in common that the materials will address the needs of each segment of this audience.  The work will be an extension of work done by the project team over the last decade.  An eight-step work plan includes in-house piloting and two rounds of field testing, each followed by revision.  Evaluation will include examinations of the material from both pedagogical and mathematical points of view, in both formative and summative environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dissemination will be closely linked to technology.  Material will be posted on the web, with liberal access for legitimate use.  Other higher-quality formats will be utilized and materials disseminated using the resources of the Universities of Michigan and of Georgia.  In addition, dissemination will be announced through connections with NSF-sponsored CLTand LSC programs, professional organizations and national digital databases.</AbstractNarration>
