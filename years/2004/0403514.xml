<AbstractNarration>0403514&lt;br/&gt;Christoserdov&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Continent-ocean margins are regions of intense biogeochemical cycling and play a major &lt;br/&gt;role in global carbon cycle. Tropical mobile mud belts and delta topset beds represent one class &lt;br/&gt;of continental margin environments where these various potential properties simultaneously &lt;br/&gt;combine to an extreme, producing massive, diagenetic reactors of global significance. Oxidation &lt;br/&gt;of organic matter in this type of sediments involves coupling of the carbon and the Fe(Mn) &lt;br/&gt;cycles by reactions of sulfur cycle and involves chemolithoautotrophic sulfide oxidizing bacteria. &lt;br/&gt;As a consequence, two principal processes are responsible for the net CO2 production by the &lt;br/&gt;topic mobile sediments: oxidation of carbon matter, which produces CO2, and chemolithotrophic &lt;br/&gt;CO2 fixation, which consumes CO2. The primary goal of the present proposed project is to &lt;br/&gt;establish the relative importance of these two processes of the carbon cycle in tropical suboxic &lt;br/&gt;deltaic and mobile mud environments, and to determine the role eubacteria play in them.  &lt;br/&gt;  This proposal is designed around the specific hypothesis that heterotrophic organic &lt;br/&gt;oxidation and chemolithotrophic carbon dioxide fixation co-occur in mobile muds and contribute &lt;br/&gt;to overall CO2 production by these sediments. We propose to examine deposits from a migrating &lt;br/&gt;mud wave in coastal French Guiana, downdrift of the Amazon River delta. To test the primary &lt;br/&gt;project hypothesis we propose to use a combination of radiotracer, microbiological and &lt;br/&gt;molecular biological techniques to: &lt;br/&gt;(I)  Identify reactions of the carbon cycle and their rates in the field and laboratory &lt;br/&gt;experiments. Using radioactive carbon tracers, we will determine the relative importance &lt;br/&gt;of heterotrophic oxidation of organic substrates (acetate, algal biomass) and CO2 fixation &lt;br/&gt;and/or production. To determine whether CO2 fixation is connected with autotrophic &lt;br/&gt;activity the genes for RubisCO I and RubisCO II will be amplified and cataloged.  &lt;br/&gt;(II)  To model possible role of chemolithotrophic and heterotrophic reactions in the &lt;br/&gt;carbon cycle and ascertain responses of the system to outside disturbances, we will &lt;br/&gt;use a combined approach of metabolic inhibitors in radiotracer experiments and &lt;br/&gt;measurements of RubisCOI and RubisCOII gene expression. The number of bacteria &lt;br/&gt;potentially able to carry out specific reactions of the cycle will be estimated and &lt;br/&gt;compared with estimates of total sedimentary bacterial production (using oligonucleotide &lt;br/&gt;probes and measurement of rRNA).  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The novelty of the project include determination of the rate of CO2 fixation and organic carbon &lt;br/&gt;oxidation in tropical mobile sediments, which allow us to answer the question: Are they &lt;br/&gt;significant on a global scale?. The role of chemolithotrophic carbon fixation in suboxic deltaic &lt;br/&gt;environments will also be elucidated. The fact that CO2 might be fixed in massive deltaic &lt;br/&gt;environments would have tremendous impact on the carbon cycle. Depending on the enzymes &lt;br/&gt;participating in CO2 fixation in mobile mud belts (RubisCO I, RubisCO II or CO &lt;br/&gt;dehydrogenase), 13C of biomass may be affected. We will address the mechanism by which &lt;br/&gt;CO2 is fixed and determine whether RubisCO I or RubisCO II or neither (ATP-dependent citrate &lt;br/&gt;lyase or CO dehydrogenase) mediate this fixation. Microorganisms involved in the above &lt;br/&gt;described biogeochemical processes will be identified and how the inhibition of biological &lt;br/&gt;activity of these microorganisms affects the overall carbon cycle will be ascertained. As a part of &lt;br/&gt;broader impacts of the project, one graduate student will be trained. One K12 teacher or an &lt;br/&gt;undergraduate student will be involved in our research every summer that the project is funded. &lt;br/&gt;Results and progress on project will be publicly disseminated through research meeting, &lt;br/&gt;publications and the Department of Biology Web site. Usefulness for the society includes the &lt;br/&gt;understanding of how the diagenetic processing is occurring in the dynamic mid wave and &lt;br/&gt;allowing to evaluate changes in the processing due to present and anticipated changes in the &lt;br/&gt;environment as a result of anthropogenic activity. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
