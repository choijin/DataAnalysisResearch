<AbstractNarration>The Pueblo of Laguna Department of Education will implement a comprehensive project for teachers and students that will incorporate Geographic Information Technologies (GIT) into the curricula of several tribal schools serving American Indian students, primarily by providing extensive professional development to a cadre of 20 teachers (2-3 per school).  Teachers will receive at least 120 hours of training each year of the project, with 80 hours accomplished during annual summer workshops.  Additionally, each year a team of five students from each school will be selected to participate in a Summer Institute, where they will receive a concentrated orientation to the Geographic Information Technologies field.  Over the three-year grant period, 120 students will participate in the summer institutes.  The teachers, in workshops and with students in the institutes, will develop their knowledge and skills in utilizing GIT tools and resources and in incorporating GIT into their curricula.  They will potentially involve 2,400+ students in project-related, GIT-infused, problem-solving activities in their classes</AbstractNarration>
