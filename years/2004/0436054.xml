<AbstractNarration>NSF Workshop Proposal  &lt;br/&gt;Metabolic Biochemistry Program &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;"Phytochemical Probes/Substrates Network" &lt;br/&gt;Ikhlas Khan, Ph.D. &lt;br/&gt;NCNPR, University of Mississippi &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Support is requested for a one day workshop for the purpose of drawing key &lt;br/&gt;investigators together to discuss the feasibility of bringing the phytochemistry &lt;br/&gt;community together to share resources for plant natural product research.  For &lt;br/&gt;researchers in plant molecular biology, biochemistry, plant physiology, and other &lt;br/&gt;fields, the ready availability of phytochemicals that may modulate plant &lt;br/&gt;gene/protein expression, or serve as substrates in biochemical pathways of &lt;br/&gt;interest, would greatly facilitate progress in the fields and open up new avenues &lt;br/&gt;of exploration. It is proposed to create a network of phytochemical researchers &lt;br/&gt;which would catalog the availability of such compounds, and where feasible, &lt;br/&gt;establish a repository for compound sourcing.  The network is anticipated to incorporate the following activities:   (1) Creation and maintenance of a web site to serve as an information resource for researchers interested in using phytochemicals as probes/substrates in their &lt;br/&gt;research; (2) Generation of a database of investigators and phytochemicals &lt;br/&gt;available in their laboratories, catalogued by various structural classes; and (3) &lt;br/&gt;Where feasible,  the establishment of a corresponding phytochemical repository &lt;br/&gt;system to facilitate access to these. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;To facilitate discussion of this timely and important topic, a one-day workshop will be held to share information and discuss logistics for creating this network.  A team of 8-10 scientists from phytochemical disciplines, as well as potential users of such resources, will be assembled to discuss these ideas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: Establishment of a phytochemical substrate/probe network will have high impact on the field of plant biochemistry by increasing availability/accessability of rare compounds to researchers studying plant metabolism, molecular biochemistry, functional genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, pharmacology and pharmacognosy.  This is also of importance to researchers at smaller institutions who may not have ready access, economically available sources, or infrastructure to support the isolation/purification/synthesis of needed compounds.  The education and training of students and post-doctoral researchers would also be enhanced by the existence of a phytochemical substrate/probe network increasing information and accessability to a diverse bank of compounds.</AbstractNarration>
