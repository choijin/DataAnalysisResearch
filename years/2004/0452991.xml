<AbstractNarration>Intellectual inquiry in the field of international trade is firmly rooted in an&lt;br/&gt;analytical paradigm: the comparison of an economy in a state of autarky relative to a state&lt;br/&gt;of open international trade. In the context of the Arrow-Debreu model of general&lt;br/&gt;equilibrium, this methodology has facilitated the formulation of some of the most&lt;br/&gt;fundamental theorems in neoclassical economics: the law of comparative advantage, the&lt;br/&gt;Heckscher-Ohlin theorem and the Stolper Samuelson theorem. Since the price is the final&lt;br/&gt;primitive concept in the Arrow-Debreu model, these theoretical theorems are usually&lt;br/&gt;formulated using goods and factor prices under autarky and free international trade. The&lt;br/&gt;alleged impossibility of employing goods and factor price data in autarky and free trade&lt;br/&gt;under the ceteris paribus assumption has been a major difficulty to empirically test these&lt;br/&gt;theorems.&lt;br/&gt;In the current research project, the PIs plan to continue their empirical analysis of&lt;br/&gt;the most dramatic trade liberalization in recorded economic history: Japan.s reopening to&lt;br/&gt;the world economy in 1859 after 200 years of self-imposed isolation. In their previous&lt;br/&gt;research (Bernhofen and Brown, 2004, 2005a), the investigators establish the case of&lt;br/&gt;Japan as a natural historical experiment compatible with the neoclassical trade model and&lt;br/&gt;investigate the pattern and gains from trade related to the law of comparative advantage.&lt;br/&gt;In the proposed project the PIs, together with a Japanese collaborator, plan to engage in a&lt;br/&gt;substantial data creation effort which will entail the collection of goods prices, factor&lt;br/&gt;prices and factor input coefficients of tradable commodities before and after Japan.s&lt;br/&gt;opening up to international trade. This will enable the PIs to provide new and unique tests&lt;br/&gt;of the Stolper-Samuelson and the Heckscher-Ohlin theorem, which are expected to make&lt;br/&gt;substantial contributions to the empirical international economics literature.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project consists of three parts. The first part will provide the first&lt;br/&gt;direct test of a general version of the Stolper-Samuelson theorem. It will investigate&lt;br/&gt;whether factor intensity weighted changes in goods prices predict the observed pattern of&lt;br/&gt;changes in the prices of the corresponding factors after Japan.s opening up. The second&lt;br/&gt;part will provide the first direct test of the Heckscher-Ohlin theorem in its autarky price&lt;br/&gt;formulation. A key advantage of using autarky factor prices as a measure of relative&lt;br/&gt;factor abundance for a test of the Heckscher-Ohlin theorem is that it allows for unequal&lt;br/&gt;factor prices and technologies between Japan and its trading partners.&lt;br/&gt;The third part of the project will use the results from the first two parts of this&lt;br/&gt;project and Bernhofen and Brown (2004, 2005a,2005b) to create an account of the natural&lt;br/&gt;experiment of Japan that is accessible to a wide range of audiences. The PIs expect this&lt;br/&gt;part of the project to have a broad impact on teachers, undergraduate students and&lt;br/&gt;graduate students with an interest in international economic issues. This theory-guided&lt;br/&gt;comprehensive case study will include components designed to meet the pedagogic goals&lt;br/&gt;appropriate to a range of student audiences from the introductory to the Ph.D. level. The&lt;br/&gt;PIs will make this case study publicly available on their website. The website has the potential&lt;br/&gt;to engage student audiences from around the globe.</AbstractNarration>
