<AbstractNarration>The State Science and Technology Institute (SSTI) has held a series of conferences with the goal of strengthening the partnership among higher education and state, regional and local technology-based economic development  (TBED) efforts.   The 8th conference entitled "Building Tech-based Economies:  Preparing for Tomorrow's Challenges" will be held in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on October 13-15, 2004.  A track for the Experimental Program To Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) participants will address issues important to technology based economic development (TBED) in these jurisdictions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference goals envisioned for all participants are: (1) to increase among technology-based economic development professionals recognition of and support of the important roles universities play in building technology-based economies; (2) to attract more university leadership and research administrators to participate in the gathering, allowing the opportunity to foster stronger working relationships with their state, local and regional economic development partners; (3) to provide a forum for universities to discuss shared challenges and issues in and examples of effective tools and techniques for increasing commercialization of university technology, building the research enterprise, encouraging faculty entrepreneurship, and preparing tomorrow's workers and leaders; and (4) to promote interstate and intrastate cooperation toward common goals for research and economic development.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
