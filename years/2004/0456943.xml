<AbstractNarration>One of the primary goals of nuclear physics research is to determine how &lt;br/&gt;the constituents of a nucleus interact with each other and what phenomena &lt;br/&gt;occur due to these interactions.  New opportunities to explore these&lt;br/&gt;interactions have emerged with the development of improved experimental &lt;br/&gt;techniques and facilities.  For example, nuclei whose proton or neutron &lt;br/&gt;numbers are very different from those of naturally occuring isotopes are now &lt;br/&gt;studied with high intensity radioactive beams. A comparison of the expermental &lt;br/&gt;results from these facilities with the predictions of the proposed calculations &lt;br/&gt;will provide an understanding of the phenomena and their dependence on the &lt;br/&gt;underlying interaction.  Such calculations also provide a guide for &lt;br/&gt;experimentalists by telling them which experiments will yield information on &lt;br/&gt;specific components of the interaction or which experiments will produce a &lt;br/&gt;desired phenomena.  Many of these calculations will lead to a better &lt;br/&gt;understanding of the types of radiation emitted from stars and how elements &lt;br/&gt;are made inside stars.  In addition, a theory of how the protons and &lt;br/&gt;neutrons that comprise a nucleus interact with each other can be extended to &lt;br/&gt;the interactions among protons, neutrons, and the many unstable particles &lt;br/&gt;that exist for only fractions of a second.  Therefore, an additional task is to &lt;br/&gt;develop and test these more general interactions.  It is likely that the &lt;br/&gt;particles that are unstable here on Earth can be stable under extreme &lt;br/&gt;conditions such as inside neutron stars and, therefore, alter the properties &lt;br/&gt;of neutron stars.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
