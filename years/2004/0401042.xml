<AbstractNarration>In this project, Avigad and Friedman propose to develop a theoretical base&lt;br/&gt;in mathematical logic to support the development of mechanized proof&lt;br/&gt;assistants for mathematics. They propose to study the definitional structure&lt;br/&gt;of mathematics, and characterize the ways that definitions are used in&lt;br/&gt;practice; to study the methods of inference commonly used in elementary&lt;br/&gt;reasoning in number theory, real analysis, and set theory, and to develop of&lt;br/&gt;algorithms that can mirror these forms of inference; and to develop an&lt;br/&gt;enriched theory of mathematical proof to characterize and classify the&lt;br/&gt;various ``indirect'' methods that are used in mathematical reasoning. A&lt;br/&gt;novel aspect of the proposal is the attention Avigad and Friedman will give&lt;br/&gt;to actual data, i.e. specific formal developments. In particular, Avigad&lt;br/&gt;will complete a mechanically verified proof of the prime number theorem, and&lt;br/&gt;is developing a broad number theory library, using a proof system called&lt;br/&gt;Isabelle; and Friedman has begun a fully formal development of set theory&lt;br/&gt;using in a notational framework of his own devising, with an emphasis on&lt;br/&gt;readability, for a broad audience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is intended to contribute to the general goal of devising&lt;br/&gt;better computer support for the development, manipulation, storage, and&lt;br/&gt;communication of mathematical knowledge. In particular, formal mathematical&lt;br/&gt;libraries and means of handling them are important to verify the behavior of&lt;br/&gt;hardware and software systems, for example, and to support scientific&lt;br/&gt;computing and cryptography. It is well understood that the development of&lt;br/&gt;useable proof assistants will have to combine pure logical considerations&lt;br/&gt;with pragmatic engineering concerns. However, in today's specialized&lt;br/&gt;academic environments, the relevant communities have become largely&lt;br/&gt;disjoint. Avigad and Friedman are committed to bridging the gap, by&lt;br/&gt;developing powerful theory that is guided by, and designed to support, sound&lt;br/&gt;practice. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
