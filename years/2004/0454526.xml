<AbstractNarration>The "Engineering is Elementary:  Engineering and Technology Lessons for Children" project is developing lessons to engage students in grades 1-5 in engineering activities integrated with their science lessons.  The project addresses the need to develop a broad understanding of what engineers do and the uses and implications of the technologies they create.  At the heart of engineering is an understanding of the engineering design process  --  a flexible method of solving problems that is parallel to the inquiry process in science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of the project are to increase the level of technological literacy of the students and to increase the understanding of technology and engineering of elementary teachers in order to enable them to teach these subjects to their students.  The project is developing 16 units, each of which includes an illustrated storybook, teacher background materials, teachers guide, assessment tools, student duplication masters, quick cards, references and resources.  The instructional effort is strengthened by the project website, posters, teacher professional development materials and overviews for administrators and other stakeholders.  By creating and testing lessons that are closely integrated with elementary science topics and linked to popular and effective science programs, the project strengthens the science program while introducing key engineering concepts and fostering positive attitudes toward engineering in ways that include girls and boys from a wide variety of ethnic and cultural backgrounds.  The project seeks to expand children's images of engineering and to broaden their interests and expectations for the future.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
