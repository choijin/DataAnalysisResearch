<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt; Ecological genomics is a new emerging field of biology that studies the genetic basis for formation of an ecological community.  It is a frontier in biology because it provides an evolutionary framework for understanding communities and ecosystems.  Studies of cottonwoods (a dominant tree of a threatened habitat type) show that genes have phenotypes that extend beyond the individual to have community and ecosystem consequences (i.e., extended phenotypes).  Based upon this concept three major hypotheses will be addressed:  1) Biodiversity is an emergent property of extended phenotypes.  2) Community structure, biodiversity and ecosystem processes are heritable.  3) Ecological feedback loops result in genetic covariance and community evolution.  The ability to address these issues is enhanced by four major factors:  1) Established collaborations among geneticists, phytochemists, modelers, community and ecosystem ecologists on two continents.  2) Studies in the wild combined with large experimental forests of known pedigree.  3) Cottonwood is the first tree genome to be sequenced, providing the genetic background necessary for these studies.  4) A new genomics center that will dramatically facilitate genetic analyses.  &lt;br/&gt; Broader impacts: This project will contribute new insights and information for establishing the genetic foundations of communities and ecosystems, for quantifying the impacts of newly introduced organisms on the rest of the community, and for making informed decisions about environmental management.  The participating institutions have a rich tradition in training graduate and undergraduate students in interdisciplinary studies and in mentoring minorities.  Planned outreach through the various nature centers including those operated by federal, state and Native American organizations will reach thousands of visitors.
