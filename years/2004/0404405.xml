<AbstractNarration>0404405&lt;br/&gt;Gruber&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit The coastal oceans are some of the most productive and biogeochemically&lt;br/&gt;active marine environments. Relative to open-ocean cycling, however, comparatively little is&lt;br/&gt;known about the overall role of these areas in the global carbon cycle (e.g. Liu et al. [2000]).&lt;br/&gt;One of the major challenges confronting research in the coastal environment is its very high&lt;br/&gt;spatio-temporal variability mainly as a result of meso- and submesoscale processes. The integral&lt;br/&gt;role of these processes for the coastal ocean carbon cycle and their impact on the net exchange&lt;br/&gt;of CO2 with the atmosphere are virtually unknown.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We propose to address this challenge by conducting an integrated and multi-disciplinary&lt;br/&gt;observational program in Santa Monica Bay, CA. In particular, we will address the following&lt;br/&gt;three goals: (i) quantify the upper ocean carbon budget of Santa Monica Bay over seasonal to&lt;br/&gt;annual timescales, (ii) determine the integral contribution of meso- and submesoscale processes&lt;br/&gt;to this budget and to the air-sea exchange of CO2, and (iii) quantify the relative roles of physical&lt;br/&gt;and biological processes in controlling the carbon balance within mesoscale features as well as&lt;br/&gt;over the entire testbed region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We plan to address these goals with three research elements: (i) time-series observations&lt;br/&gt;from an interdisciplinary moored platform (see http://www.ioe.ucla.edu/mucla), (ii) bi-weekly&lt;br/&gt;shipboard based water sampling at the mooring site for shorebased analysis of water column&lt;br/&gt;carbon and biogeochemical properties, and (iii) process cruises scheduled on an event basis to&lt;br/&gt;study the temporal evolution of the 3-D structure of the carbon and physical fields associated&lt;br/&gt;with a mesoscale or sub-mesoscale phenomenon. Analyses of the results from these efforts will be&lt;br/&gt;greatly aided by the availability of very high-resolution ocean carbon cycle hindcast simulations&lt;br/&gt;of the area using the Regional Oceanic Modeling System (independently funded).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal's unique contribution consists of the embedding of the process studies into the&lt;br/&gt;framework of a multidisciplinary time-series. The proposed work builds upon the strength and&lt;br/&gt;expertise of the PI and his team in the areas of modeling and data analyses, while continuing&lt;br/&gt;the expansion into the observational realm to address an urgent need for critical new carbon&lt;br/&gt;observations. We already have initiated work on all program elements and will be able to leverage&lt;br/&gt;this proposal upon a number of existing grants and synergistic activities of other investigators at&lt;br/&gt;UCLA and at partner institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact By working toward the understanding of the net impact of meso- and sub-&lt;br/&gt;mesoscale processes on the upper ocean carbon cycle in the coastal environment, our proposed&lt;br/&gt;program addresses two formidable challenges that the carbon community is facing currently. The&lt;br/&gt;ubiquitous presence of mesoscale variability poses serious problems for the design of an observing&lt;br/&gt;network that attempts to quantify the coastal ocean sources and sinks of atmospheric CO2, such&lt;br/&gt;as is being planned for the North American Carbon Program. In addition, carbon-cycle modeling&lt;br/&gt;studies that require long integrations, such as those associated with climate change, do not have&lt;br/&gt;the computational resources to resolve all mesoscale and submesoscale processes explicitly and&lt;br/&gt;therefore need to incorporate the net effect of them in a parametric form.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our proposed project will build upon many already existing educational and public outreach&lt;br/&gt;activities. These include the incorporation of data as examples and homework assignments into&lt;br/&gt;several undergraduate classes as well as the undertaking of several educational cruises centered&lt;br/&gt;around the mooring platform. In addition, we will make use of UCLA's long tradition in oceano-&lt;br/&gt;graphic teaching at primary and secondary schools. In particular, we will collaborate with the&lt;br/&gt;NSF funded Center for Ocean Science Education Excellence at UCLA in order to reach out to&lt;br/&gt;K-12 teachers and their students.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
