<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to develop a novel and versatile&lt;br/&gt;nano-manufacturing technology for fabricating defined numbers of nanowire rings on polymer microsphere surfaces. The approach combines compression-induced cracking of polymer-supported thin films, surface chemistry manipulation, and electroless deposition of metals.  Detailed relationships between microsphere size, surface film property, degree of compression, electroless deposition procedure, and the type of nanofeatures generated will be determined to enable a cost-effective and well-controlled nanomanufacturing scheme.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is motivated by the general need for novel nano-manufacturing technologies and concepts. The ability to manufacture micro- and nanospheres with defined sizes, compositions, surface charges, and surface patterns has been critical for advances in many fields such as in the generation of opals, preparation of photonic band gap materials, development of novel electronic devices, manipulation and analysis of biological cells, and production of inks, paints, cosmetics, and other rheological fluids. Most microspheres prepared to date, however, have relatively simple surface structures such as uniform coatings or the "capping" of one half of a sphere. The more elaborate nanopatterned microspheres that will be manufactured through this project will open new possibilities in advanced materials, electronics, and biology. Another important feature of the program is the integration of research and education through the training of students in a technologically significant area. This project is visually striking, experimentally straightforward, and theoretically stimulating. It will provide valuable hands-on laboratory experiences in nanomanufacturing research to graduate and undergraduate students and inspire the next generation of nanotechnology scientists and engineers.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
