<AbstractNarration>9802334  Birnie    Sol-gel chemistry is a popular technique for making new materials  and high technology coatings of a wide variety of types.  Because  of the ever-expanding importance of sol-gel synthesis, and  because of the need to make high quality coatings with a high-  throughput industrial procedure, it is important to understand  the fundamentals of spin coating when performed using sol-gel  solutions.  This project will monitor and understand, in real  time, the coating formation and drying of sol-gel solutions  during spin coating.  Dye molecules will be incorporated into the  sol-gel solutions to help sense the chemical and physical changes  taking place during spin coating.  Two fundamental processes are  critical in controlling coating formation during spin coating in  general: 1) viscous flow and 2) evaporation.  Early stages are  dominated by the viscous behavior, i.e. relatively smooth fluid  flow radially outward on the substrate.  As the fluid layer gets  thinner the outward flow rate reduces until the second process  (evaporation) takes over as the dominant process.  This  transition corresponds to a "setting" point for coating  formation.  When spin coating is performed on sol-gel solutions  then extra complexities arise including accelerated chemical  reaction caused by solvent evaporation and viscosity changes  being driven by the hydrolysis and condensation reactions in  solution.  Thus, sol-gel solutions may be particularly sensitive  to the conditions that are imposed by the spin coating process.  Carefully designed optical measurements will be carried out which  would allow in-depth study of the dynamical and chemical effects  that are occurring in sol-gel solutions during spin coating.  Small concentrations of dye molecules would be incorporated into  the sol-gel solutions for use as structure/chemistry probes  during the spinning process.  The primary focus will be on  molecules that change their absorption spectra depending on the  characteristics of the local envir onment.  Therefore, equipment  would be set up to allow absorption characteristics to be  measured during spin coating processing.  In addition, laser  interferometry would be used to dynamically monitor the rapid  fluid thinning process occurring during spinning.  %%%  It is anticipated that increased understanding of this important  technological process would lead to new methods for improving the  quality of spin coated sol-gel layers, thus allowing the  production of materials with higher reliability and increased  manufacturing yield.  For example, since the evaporation of the  most volatile solution component will dominate during coating  formation, then sol-gel scientists would learn to focus  particularly close attention to the chemical effects caused by  early and rapid removal of this component, especially with  respect to premature gelation.  And conversely, since the  chemical condensation reactions can cause profound viscosity  changes, then coating developers would seek to understand more  about the rheological characteristics of their sol-gel solutions,  even before coating quality issues arise.  ***</AbstractNarration>
