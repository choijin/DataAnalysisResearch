<AbstractNarration>This project is a research experiences for undergraduates (REU) site in Psychology at Middlebury College that offers eight undergraduate students an eight-week summer research experience.  Intellectual Merits- The site is designed to provide undergraduate psychology students with the excitement of the research process as well as a foundation of skills and knowledge necessary to conduct and evaluate research.  To do this, the program provides students early in their academic career the opportunity to work closely with a faculty mentor at Middlebury College investigating psychological research questions. These projects cover a wide range of psychological topics, such as improving children's memory, gender differences in spatial reasoning, the relationship between tolerance and alcohol consumption, the bases of false memories, and the influence of alcohol consumption on risky sexual behavior.  A special component of this REU program is that students work in research teams of three. Teams work in collaboration with each other and two to three faculty members. In addition, students participate in weekly workshop-seminars to develop their understanding of the research process.  Students also attend informal faculty lectures in which faculty highlight the unique dilemmas they have faced as researchers.  Broader Impacts- This project contributes to the training of the next generation of scientists by providing them with an opportunity to learn how to conduct high-quality research through a first-hand, intensive experience. Students are given experience with all aspects of the research process from conceptualization of research questions to dissemination of research results. A special effort is made to recruit students who are unlikely to gain research experience at their home institutions.</AbstractNarration>
