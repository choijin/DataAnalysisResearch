<AbstractNarration>Moll&lt;br/&gt;0409968&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many problems in physics and engineering require the exact&lt;br/&gt;evaluation of integrals in terms of parameters appearing in those&lt;br/&gt;integrals.  These problems come up in the study of particle&lt;br/&gt;physics and classical mechanics. While it is not always possible&lt;br/&gt;to find analytic expressions, the investigator and his colleagues&lt;br/&gt;study questions that appear in the development of an efficient&lt;br/&gt;and robust symbolic software package that should give such&lt;br/&gt;results in closed form, or decide whether such an expression is&lt;br/&gt;achievable.  The investigator's goal is to develop algorithms&lt;br/&gt;that expand upon the capabilities of existing software pacakages&lt;br/&gt;that are widely used in industry and universities.  The&lt;br/&gt;investigator's efforts are concentrated in two classes: rational&lt;br/&gt;functions, and elementary functions related to the Hurwitz zeta&lt;br/&gt;function.  The study of this last class has produced a new&lt;br/&gt;approach to conjectures on the so-called multiple zeta values and&lt;br/&gt;the cloed-form evaluation of Tornheim-Zagier sums.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The problem of definite integration of special functions started&lt;br/&gt;in the eighteen century with the work of J. Bernoulli.  The&lt;br/&gt;knowledge developed from this problem has been central in many&lt;br/&gt;parts of analysis and applied mathematics.  The development of&lt;br/&gt;highly sophisticated symbolic languages during the last part of&lt;br/&gt;the 20th century has required further study of this old problem. &lt;br/&gt;The investigator and his colleagues are developing the&lt;br/&gt;mathematical theory that is needed for the symbolic evaluation of&lt;br/&gt;these integrals.  It is a surprising fact that this endevour has&lt;br/&gt;connections with many areas of mathematics.  The investigator&lt;br/&gt;develops new algorithms that ensure the efficiency and robustness&lt;br/&gt;of the current symbolic languages available to the scientific&lt;br/&gt;community.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
