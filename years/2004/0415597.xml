    <AbstractNarration>Regulation of a disease resistance gene by the Arabidopsis BON1&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Disease resistance (R) genes are central for specificity determination of defense responses in plants. The molecular mechanisms of R gene regulation are not well understood. The Arabidopsis BON1 gene has been identified as a negative regulator of a rapidly-evolved R gene, SNC1. BON1 belongs to an evolutionarily conserved copine family possibly involved in membrane trafficking and signaling. How SNC1 is regulated by BON1 and what cellular processes BON1 modulates will be addressed in this study. First, the biochemical activities BON1 uses to regulate SNC1 will be determined. Second, the hypothesis that BON1 regulates SNC1 protein activity will be tested. Third, the role of a BON1 partner, BAP1, in SNC1 regulation will be investigated. Last, components mediating BON1 repression of SNC1 will be identified by isolating SNC1 interacting proteins and bon1-1 suppressors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study is one of the first efforts to dissect at the molecular and genetic levels the regulation of an R protein activity by a plant protein that is probably involved in basic cellular processes. Revelation about how BON1 regulates SNC1 will generate insight into the mechanisms of R protein activation and the evolution of R genes. These experiments will also likely shed light on the mechanisms by which activation of defense responses occurs by an impairment in growth and development. Furthermore, the function of BON1 uncovered in Arabidopsis will serve as a model for functions of its copine homologs in humans, and thus enhance an understanding of other copine-involved biological processes, such as neuronal activity regulation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The elucidation of regulation of defense responses by BON1 will likely provide tools to create or breed crops with desired growth and defense features, thus improving food production in a sustainable way. In addition to training a graduate student and a postdoctoral fellow, the proposed research will provide research opportunities for master's students who will become high school teachers and undergraduate students, including ones who are under-represented in science. The scientific discoveries from this study will be disseminated through journal publications and presentations at symposia and conferences by undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral personnel.</AbstractNarration>
