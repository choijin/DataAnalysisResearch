    <AbstractNarration>0422555&lt;br/&gt;Stark &lt;br/&gt;Description: This award supports cooperative research in molecular biochemistry between India and the U.S. Its title is: Molecular Mechanism of Vitreoscilla Hemoglobin (VHb) Function: Identification and Characterization of Cellular Partners of VHbs. Professors Benjamin Stark and Dale Webster, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago will collaborate with Professor Kanak Dikshit, Senior Scientist, Institute of Microbial Technology, Chandigarh. Hemoglobins are essential oxygen carrying proteins and microbial hemoglobins are important for optimal growth of certain organisms. Vitreoscilla hemoglobin, which has been used in genetic engineering, has resulted in the improved ability of organisms to acquire and utilize oxygen, and has enhanced their abilities to degrade certain toxic chemicals. The investigators will perform experiments to characterize and obtain understanding on the biochemical function of the "hemoglobin" of the bacterium Vitreoscilla and how, when introduced into a hemoglobin-less bacterium by genetic engineering, it changes the biochemical pathways of its new host's metabolism. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scope: This research is of great scientific and practical value and will contribute to fundamental knowledge. Greater understanding of the mechanisms by which VHb enhances cell growth will help advance technologies in which the use of VHb has been found to be beneficial. Chief among these is the US PIs work on enhancing bacterial degradation of aromatic compounds including those, which have environmental contaminants. The collaboration will exploit the complementary expertise of the two groups of investigators (biochemistry and physical chemistry of proteins on the US side and recombinant DNA technology on the Indian side). The researchers have an established collaboration and have worked successfully. This research and exchange of scientists will be mutually beneficial for graduate and undergraduate students at both institutions</AbstractNarration>
