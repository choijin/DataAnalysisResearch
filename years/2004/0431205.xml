    <AbstractNarration>Wireless sensor networks have a large array of potential applications,&lt;br/&gt;including environmental monitoring, home and factory automation, and&lt;br/&gt;homeland security. This research addresses efficient data collection&lt;br/&gt;from sensor networks, which is one of the fundamental bottlenecks to&lt;br/&gt;large-scale deployment of low-cost sensor nodes. Two key difficulties&lt;br/&gt;are scale (how to manage very large numbers of relatively&lt;br/&gt;unsophisticated nodes) and energy (communication is energy-intensive,&lt;br/&gt;but sensor nodes must operate for months or years on battery, or by&lt;br/&gt;scavenging energy from the environment). This research has two&lt;br/&gt;complementary research thrusts, both investigating novel techniques&lt;br/&gt;for data collection from sensor networks, exploiting the natural&lt;br/&gt;distribution of sensor nodes in space. The first, termed virtual&lt;br/&gt;radar, enables deployment of extremely simple sensor nodes which do&lt;br/&gt;not need networking or position location functionality, by moving the&lt;br/&gt;complexity to a sophisticated data collection node. The second&lt;br/&gt;approach requires more sophisticated nodes, and increases energy&lt;br/&gt;efficiency and range by obtaining the functionality of multi-antenna&lt;br/&gt;transmission by intelligent coordination between neighboring&lt;br/&gt;(single-antenna) sensor nodes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the first thrust, termed virtual radar, sensor nodes with activity&lt;br/&gt;to report electronically reflect a beacon transmitted by a&lt;br/&gt;"driveby" or "flyby" collector node, thus&lt;br/&gt;creating a radar-like geometry. The collector employs sophisticated&lt;br/&gt;synthetic aperture radar like signal processing techniques to obtain&lt;br/&gt;an "image" of the activity in the sensor field.&lt;br/&gt;Tracking of events moving across the sensor field, and exploiting&lt;br/&gt;multiple antennas at the collector, are investigated. The second&lt;br/&gt;thrust, termed distributed transmission, involves investigation of&lt;br/&gt;beamforming, diversity and power gains obtained by coordinating&lt;br/&gt;between neighboring nodes, as a function of the level of&lt;br/&gt;synchronization achieved among the nodes. Methods of achieving such&lt;br/&gt;synchronization are also considered.</AbstractNarration>
