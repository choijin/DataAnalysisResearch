<AbstractNarration>PROPOSAL NO: 0403460&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION: Northeastern University&lt;br/&gt;PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Hopwood , Je_rey&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: NER: Airborne Nanoparticle Detector Based on a Microplasma  Particle Trap&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;This exploratory research focuses on measuring the sizes and concentrations of airborne nanoparticles.  Nanoparticles are difficult to quickly measure due to extremely small size.  As nanotechnology becomes a reality, however, the accurate and rapid sensing of nanoparticles becomes an important part of many manufacturing processes.  Controlling the density and size distribution of nanoparticles is not only key for reliable manufacturing, but also critical to the health and safety of the workforce.   The proposed sensor consists to two components:  a nanoparticle trap and a nanoparticle detector.  The trap uses a small region of ionized gas (i.e., a microplasma) to negatively charge the nanoparticle.  Once the particle is charged, it is trapped by the voltage gradient within the microplasma.  Next, the accumulated nanoparticles are detected by using a voltage pulse to empty particles from the trap.  The charged particles are collected by an electrode that senses both the accumulated charge on each particle and its time-of-flight between the microplasma and the sensing electrode.  These data allow the density and size of the particles to be determined.  Part of the research will concentrate on the basic physics of trapping nanoparticles by examining the multitude of forces exerted on the particles.  The expulsion of nanoparticles from the trap will also be examined using dynamic models and experiments.  The research will not only demonstrate a fast, low-cost sensor for nanoparticles in the environment, but also provide basic data for nanoparticle behavior in gas streams and plasmas.  By including a graduate student and an undergraduate student in this program, the nanotechnology workforce infrastructure will also benefit.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
