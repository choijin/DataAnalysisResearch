<AbstractNarration>This REU program at Ohio State University (OSU) will immerse students in an intense yet rewarding 10-week research experience that allows them to discover firsthand the excitement of science.  Research projects will involve molecular-genetic and biochemical approaches to problems in biology.  After an initial one-week laboratory workshop, which will provide students with a set of basic technical skills, REU participants will spend the next nine weeks working in one of the participating laboratories.  Students will investigate a specific research problem and will be encouraged to develop independence in planning and interpreting experiments.  At the end of the summer, they will write a summary of their experimental results and present them in a poster format.  Students will also attend journal clubs, workshops, and field trips to explore and discuss (i) research, (ii) career options in science, (iii) cutting-edge technology at OSU and in surrounding biotechnology centers, and (iv) ethical issues that they are likely to face as scientists and as citizens.  To promote interactions in relaxed settings, there are planned biweekly social events. Students will be recruited from institutions that focus primarily on undergraduate education. Students from groups under-represented in science are strongly encouraged to apply. Indicators of promise, other than GPA, will be taken into serious consideration in selecting participants.
