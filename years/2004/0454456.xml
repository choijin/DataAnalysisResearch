<AbstractNarration>0454456&lt;br/&gt;Enderle&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the proposed project is the design and construction of projects to aid persons with disabilities by students in the University of Connecticut BME Senior Design course. The purpose of the work is three-fold. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first purpose is to provide an opportunity for practical and creative problem solving by students in addressing a well-defined problem for meeting the required design component of their study program. A positive outcome of this involvement is that persons with disabilities receive devices that provide significant improvement in quality of life and independence at no cost to the recipients. This is especially important in light of the distance learning component of this proposal, as the clients to be served reside in an economically deprived Appalachian region of Southeast Ohio. In many cases, development of devices and/or software for an individual may lead to applications for others with similar disabilities. Students are also exposed to a unique body of applied information on current technology in the area of rehabilitation design.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second purpose is to motivate students, graduate engineers and other health care  &lt;br/&gt;professionals to work more actively in rehabilitation, towards an increased technology and knowledge base, to effectively address the needs of persons with disabilities. This complements the implementation requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The third purpose is to allow for the controlled study of the pedagogical efficacy of the specific experiential teaching/learning processes to be incorporated into the proposed design experiences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gilbert B.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The objective of the project is the design and construction of projects to aid persons with disabilities by students in the University of Connecticut's Biomedical Engineering (BME) Senior Design course.   The purpose of the project is two-fold.  The first purpose is to provide an opportunity for practical and creative problem solving in addressing a well-defined problem to students for meeting the required design component of their study.  A positive outcome of this involvement is that persons with disabilities receive devices that provide significant improvement in quality of life and independence at no cost to the recipients.

The second purpose is to motivate students, graduate engineers and other health care professionals to work more ac&shy;tively in rehabilitation towards an increased tech&shy;nology and knowledge base, to effectively address the needs of persons with disabilities.  This complements the implementation requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act. A total of 52 projects were successfully completed and given to their clients.  Many of the projects were constructed for children with cerebral palsy.  A list and description of projects recently completed include: The Smart Kart: A Recreational Vehicle. This two-seater vehicle is a gas-powered, joystick-steered device that allows the client to drive the vehicle thus interacting with friends and practicing his motor coordination skills. The All-Terrain Power Chair. The all-terrain power chair was designed to travel on light trails and other locations that lack pavement. Custom Tilt-in-space Wheelchair. This custom designed wheelchair has a tilt-in-space feature to accommodate the client's growing needs. The Bicycle Sidecar. The bicycle sidecar was built so that the client could bicycle with her father. The family wanted her next to them when they were riding so that they could talk to her and get her more involved in the experience. A tumbleforms chair seat was used. Beach Wheelchair. The purpose of this project is to design a beach wheelchair for use by the client. The wheelchair was designed to be adjustable in multiple locations to ensure the client could continue to use the chair as he grows. It was also designed to allow for the client to insert a tumbleforms chair seat. Posterior Beach Walker. The purpose of this project is to design a beach wheelchair for use by the client. The client is able to walk, is receptive, and needs no neck or back support. He does require additional support from a walker or quad-canes to move around.  The client's current walker is not designed for use at the beach. The Assisted Skiing Device. The client's parents are avid skiers, who frequently visit the client's grandparents who live at the base of a ski mountain in New Hampshire. While the client is physically incapable of skiing on her own, with the assistance of a skilled skier and the Assisted Skiing Device, she will have the ability to ski. The Adaptive Position Chair. The Adaptive Position Chair (APC) was designed to add ease to the lives of a family with a child of limited motor and communication skills. The most functional piece of the APC is the tray table. It has three planes of motion to allow for many uses relevant to our client and her family's daily life. The APC also includes support mechanisms to help compensate for her lacking motor control. These mechanisms include a pommel that fits between her legs and a butterfly chest harness. The chair is also adjustable in various ways to provide room for growth. The Ride-On Remote-Controller Car. To give the client a sense of mobility and freedom, the ride-on remote-controlled car was constructed. The vehicle is not controlled by Samantha, but by allowing her to be mobile by letting her parents drive the vehicle using a standard RC radio controller.
