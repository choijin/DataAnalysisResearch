<AbstractNarration>A Next Generation Network (NGN) application must operate seamlessly across an integrated network consisting of a combination of circuit, packet, wireless and wireline networks. Services provided by NGN applications will play a crucial role in our day to day lives and hence assurance of the quality of these services is essential. In this proposal the term QoS refers to the quality of a service as perceived by a user. This notion is unlike the traditional notion of QoS which refers to the performance parameters such as delay and jitter of the packet traffic flowing through the network. In this proposal the term QoS may thus refer to parameters such as response time, reliability and availability of a service. &lt;br/&gt;Development of a QoS assurance methodology for NGN applications is the focus of this project. The project will develop techniques for both QoS provisioning as well as monitoring. QoS provisioning is concerned with resource allocation and middleware configuration such that the QoS expectations of a service are met. QoS monitoring is concerned with measuring the actual QoS of a service as experienced by a user. Despite provisioning, users of NGN services may experience QoS degradation due to malicious attacks launched on these services by adversaries. NGN services must be able to withstand these attacks and continue to offer the same level of QoS to its users. In order to be able to withstand these attacks, they must be detected in a timely fashion so as to limit the damage caused by these attacks. Hence the QoS assurance methodology will also involve the development of techniques to detect such attacks.  The QoS assurance methodology will be based on the collection, aggregation and analysis of service and application level data. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
