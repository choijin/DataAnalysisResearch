<AbstractNarration>The research project is a three-year study to investigate mathematics and science teacher turnover and retention framed using an organizational perspective.  The objective of this research project is to empirically address three related research questions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1.) What are the sources of mathematics and science teacher turnover?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2.) Why do particular types of schools, especially those in urban, high-poverty and high-minority communities, have higher levels of mathematics and science teacher turnover?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3.) What impact do preservice teacher preparation, beginning teacher induction programs, inservice professional development and teacher assignment have on the turnover and retention of mathematics and science teachers?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To address these research questions the project team will analyze data on public secondary-level mathematics and science teachers from the National Center for Education Statistics' (NCES) nationally representative Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS) and its supplement the Teacher Follow-up Survey (TFS).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project builds on an established record of prior research by the principal investigator with existing large-scale data from teachers.  It seeks to expand our knowledge in regard to a set of important, but not well understood, issues central to the goals of the Teacher Professional Continuum Program:  What characteristics of districts and schools, especially those serving disadvantaged students, impact their ability to retain qualified mathematics and science teachers? Prior research shows that if schools are to ensure that qualified mathematics and science teachers teach all students, as the No Child Left Behind Act mandates, then they must focus more on improving teacher retention.  This project seeks to provide research results that will help provide direction to policymakers and school leaders on how best to proceed in doing this, especially with mathematics and science teachers and especially in disadvantaged schools, as the existing research has provided limited direction. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
