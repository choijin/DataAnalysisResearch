<AbstractNarration>Abstract for award DMS-0400647 of Wan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The central aim of this proposal is to give a systematic &lt;br/&gt;study of the p-adic variation of zeta functions of toric hypersurfaces over &lt;br/&gt;finite fields. This naturally has three aspects: theory, applications and &lt;br/&gt;algorithms. We expect to make significant progresses on all three fronts. &lt;br/&gt;On the theoretical side, the PI previously proved that Dwork's unit root zeta &lt;br/&gt;function is p-adic meromorphic but no information about its zeros is known  &lt;br/&gt;except in the simpler abelian rank one case. We propose to obtain effective &lt;br/&gt;information about zeros of the unit root zeta function in the general &lt;br/&gt;non-abelian higher rank case, settling this basic problem. This should be &lt;br/&gt;related to the conjectural  non-abelian p-adic L-functions and geometric &lt;br/&gt;Iwasawa theory. As a consequence, we shall give a detailed in-depth &lt;br/&gt;study of some important examples such as a family of Kloosterman sums and &lt;br/&gt;a family of Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces, settling some open problems in the area. &lt;br/&gt;On the application side, we propose to investigate the arithmetic mirror symmetry: &lt;br/&gt;the relation between the zeta function of a Calabi-Yau variety and  the zeta function &lt;br/&gt;of its mirror variety. An experimental/computational study along this direction has already &lt;br/&gt;been made by Candelas etc who disovered some interesting structures about such &lt;br/&gt;zeta functions via the study of the periods of the Picard-Fuch equations. &lt;br/&gt;We propose to give a rigorous mathematical proof of their conjectures. &lt;br/&gt;Recently, along this line, we proposed several apparently harder arithmetic mirror &lt;br/&gt;conjectures, including the generic slope mirror conjecture and the small slope &lt;br/&gt;mirror conjecture. We plan to make these conjectures precise in a general form &lt;br/&gt;and provide substantial evidence to them, opening new areas of research.&lt;br/&gt;Along the way, the link between our decomposition theorems for generic Newton &lt;br/&gt;polygons and the GKZ principal discriminant would be established, obtaining &lt;br/&gt;arithmetic information about the GKZ discriminant. For the algorithmic side, &lt;br/&gt;we plan to exploit some of the finer p-adic theory and computational commutative &lt;br/&gt;algebra to obtain faster and better p-adic algorithms for the zeta functions, &lt;br/&gt;including the harder singular case. The proposed research would involve several &lt;br/&gt;colloborators and graduate students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A fundamental problem in number theory is to understand the number of solutions &lt;br/&gt;of a polynomial equation over a finite field. In addition to its intrinsic &lt;br/&gt;theoretic interest, this problem has connections to several major branches of &lt;br/&gt;mathematics. It also has important applications in coding theory, crpyptography, &lt;br/&gt;and combinatorics. We propose to give a systematic study of this fundamental &lt;br/&gt;problem and obtain an improved understanding. We expect to make significant progresses &lt;br/&gt;on both the theory, application and algorithmic aspects of the problem. As &lt;br/&gt;a consequence, we would settle several open problems in the area, establishing &lt;br/&gt;new links with other areas such as p-adic L-function, computational commutative &lt;br/&gt;algebra, toric geometry and mirror symmetry. Due to the diversity and the scope &lt;br/&gt;of this proposal, the proposed research would involve several colloborators and &lt;br/&gt;graduate students. It is hoped that the proposed research would also lead to &lt;br/&gt;several monographs or books which would make this beautiful subject coherent and &lt;br/&gt;accessible. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
