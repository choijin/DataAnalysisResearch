<AbstractNarration>Fractional factorial designs (FFDs) are among the most popularly used&lt;br/&gt;experimental plans in practice. Most existing theory and methods for&lt;br/&gt;FFDs assume that the factors involved in an experiment are symmetrical.&lt;br/&gt;In many applications, however, this assumption does not hold, because&lt;br/&gt;experiments can involve multiple groups (or types) of factors (MGFs).&lt;br/&gt;Different types of factors have different implications for design and&lt;br/&gt;analysis, therefore they need to be treated differently.  Three typical&lt;br/&gt;examples are Taguchi's robust parameter design experiments, Addelman's&lt;br/&gt;compromise plans and experiments with both qualitative and quantitative&lt;br/&gt;factors. This project is intended to develop general theory and methods&lt;br/&gt;for constructing optimal designs with MFGs. Based on the preliminary&lt;br/&gt;results on robust parameter design, various trade-off strategies will&lt;br/&gt;be generalized to designs with MFGs and their theoretical properties&lt;br/&gt;will be studied and characterized. Due to the presence&lt;br/&gt;of different types of factors, the aliasing properties of these designs&lt;br/&gt;are much complicated. The investigator will study the letter patterns&lt;br/&gt;and the coset patterns so as to propose proper criteria for the&lt;br/&gt;construction of optimal designs. The structure function approach developed&lt;br/&gt;by the investigator earlier will be further extended and used in this&lt;br/&gt;research. The theory and methods for constructing nonregular FFDs with&lt;br/&gt;MGFs will also be investigated and developed. Based on the theory and&lt;br/&gt;methods developed in this project, optimal designs with economical run&lt;br/&gt;size will be constructed and tabulated for experimenters in practice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Statistical design and analysis of experiments are widely used in&lt;br/&gt;scientific investigation and industrial research and development. The&lt;br/&gt;study of experimental design is aimed at constructing optimal experimental&lt;br/&gt;plans that allow experimenters to collect data and discover knowledge in&lt;br/&gt;an economical and efficient way. This project is motivated by the&lt;br/&gt;application of experimental design methodology for quality improvement&lt;br/&gt;in manufacturing industry, especially the robust parameter design&lt;br/&gt;technology. An experiment in robust parameter design usually involves&lt;br/&gt;multiple groups (or types) of factors, which have different implications&lt;br/&gt;in design and analysis. Most existing design theory and&lt;br/&gt;methods assume the symmetry between factors, thus are not directly&lt;br/&gt;applicable for robust parameter design. In general, experiments can&lt;br/&gt;include multiple groups of factors (MGFs), which should be treated&lt;br/&gt;differently in order to generate optimal experimental plans. In this&lt;br/&gt;project, the investigator intends to develop general theory and methods&lt;br/&gt;for constructing optimal factorial designs for experiments with MGFs.&lt;br/&gt;The project consists of three major components. The first component is&lt;br/&gt;to investigate the combinatorial and aliasing properties of fractional&lt;br/&gt;factorial designs with MGFs; the second component is to propose various&lt;br/&gt;optimality criteria for the construction of optimal designs with MGFs;&lt;br/&gt;the third component is to theoretically characterize the optimal designs&lt;br/&gt;and tabulate them for experimenters in practice. The project will advance&lt;br/&gt;the theory and methodology of experimental design as well as enhance&lt;br/&gt;efficient data collection and knowledge discovery in scientific&lt;br/&gt;investigation, quality improvement and other applications.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
