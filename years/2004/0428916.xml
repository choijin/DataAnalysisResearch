<AbstractNarration>1&lt;br/&gt;Project Summary: SST: Nonlinear Dynamics of Microbeam Systems&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: In the proposed study we aim to improve the operation of SPM cantilevers in&lt;br/&gt;air and vacuum by investigating important effects due to nonlinearity, shape, and coupling to nearby&lt;br/&gt;cantilevers. Simultaneous operations of microbeam arrays can lead to significantly increased&lt;br/&gt;throughput in applications including chemical and force sensors, imaging, and data storage. These&lt;br/&gt;effects can lead to dynamically interesting phenomena, including localization and parametric&lt;br/&gt;instability. By understanding these effects, design and operation can be proposed which allow the&lt;br/&gt;cantilevers to synchronize, leading to sensor enhancement. This proposed work will involve&lt;br/&gt;modeling, analysis, and experimentation. In this work the nonlinear response of microbeams near&lt;br/&gt;resonance will be investigated in detail and features will be mapped out that are important for&lt;br/&gt;performance. The analytical investigations will focus on perturbation, symmetry, and phase&lt;br/&gt;reduction techniques applied to weakly nonlinear models for microbeams, which will allow one to&lt;br/&gt;predict the response near resonance. Experimental work will be used for parameter identification,&lt;br/&gt;model verification, and to explore operating regimes suggested by the analysis.&lt;br/&gt;The work will focus on the response of individual microbeams and one-dimensional arrays of&lt;br/&gt;microbeams, such as those being developed for increased throughput of chemical sensors. These&lt;br/&gt;arrays are composed of several nearly identical beams that are weakly coupled to their nearest&lt;br/&gt;neighbors. Systems with these general characteristics are known to experience instabilities and&lt;br/&gt;localized responses, wherein synchronization is lost and the vibration energy is concentrated in a&lt;br/&gt;small subset of beams. The analytical part of the work will concentrate on how these instabilities&lt;br/&gt;and localization are influenced by system and excitation parameters, and the manner in which they&lt;br/&gt;affect overall performance of the sensor. In addition, analytical models that employ intentional&lt;br/&gt;patterns of mistuning will be considered, which are known to minimize the effects of instability and&lt;br/&gt;localization. The experimental work will be used to guide and confirm the analysis, and to test&lt;br/&gt;systems that are designed to operate in a synchronous manner.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: An integrated educational plan has been proposed which integrates outreach&lt;br/&gt;with graduate education. Specifically, the goal would be to incorporate demonstrations and&lt;br/&gt;explanations of observable phenomena that can be accounted for through an understanding of&lt;br/&gt;nonlinear vibrations and dynamics, as well as topics from microscale and nanoscale engineering, to&lt;br/&gt;existing outreach programs. The mechanics principles behind simple cantilever sensors can be used&lt;br/&gt;to illustrate how simple physics principles are used to develop sensors, and show practical, exciting&lt;br/&gt;application of science. At UCSB these programs will be developed through collaborations with local&lt;br/&gt;teachers. At least one of these relationships has already been solidified with a teacher at Santa&lt;br/&gt;Barbara Jr. High. At MSU, this outreach would occur via the MSU High School Engineering&lt;br/&gt;Institute, which targets secondary school students and actively encourages participation in the&lt;br/&gt;engineering sciences.&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact in graduate education and technology transfer will be achieved in part through&lt;br/&gt;partnerships with Veeco, a local company. Veeco has a long-standing relationship with UCSB.&lt;br/&gt;Veeco is currently a member of the California Nanosystems institute, and has funded graduate&lt;br/&gt;student interns at Veeco, including one from the PI's group. Veeco is interested in the technology&lt;br/&gt;we plan to study in this effort, and will allow students to utilize equipment unavailable at UCSB.&lt;br/&gt;Teaming: The proposed effort is a collaboration between Kimberly Turner (UCSB), Steven Shaw&lt;br/&gt;(MSU), and Jeffrey Moehlis (UCSB), and will be carried out at their home institutions. The students&lt;br/&gt;and PIs on both teams will be involved in all aspects of the project, keeping up to date via electronic&lt;br/&gt;communication and by regular visits by the MSU group to the facilities at UCSB.</AbstractNarration>
