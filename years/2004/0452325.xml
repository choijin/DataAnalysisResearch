<AbstractNarration>The Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research (IAI) is an international treaty organization, created to coordinate and promote scientific research related to global change in the Americas.  The Institute has an evolving Science Agenda identifying particular areas for research that have been defined by the scientific community of the Americas. The Science Agenda is complementary to the research priorities of the US Climate Change Science Program.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant will support the second round of the IAI Collaborative Research Program (CRN II).  The program supports 10-12 regional research networks addressing global change issues of regional relevance that  advance the understanding of global change phenomena and their socio-economic impacts.  All projects are highly interdisciplinary. Each network involves Principal Investigators and Co-Investigators from institutions in at least four IAI member countries (Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Costa Rica, Chile, Colombia, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Ecuador, Jamaica, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, USA and Venezuela). The networks were selected on the basis of submitted proposals evaluated for technical merit using a peer-review system. Results from this research will be available to the US scientific community, as a condition of US funding, through an electronic data and information system.  The IAI receives additional support for its activities from the other Parties.  This additional support takes the form of direct contributions to the IAI Budget, in-kind contributions, or in-kind contribution pledges made at the time of proposal submission in the form of investigator salaries, ship-time, computer time, logistical support, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program is integrative, involving the natural and the social sciences in a collaborative way and seeking to provide sound scientific understanding of global change issues in support of sustainable development in the region. CRN II promotes applied science with a focus on emerging issues and themes that have not been dealt with under previous IAI programs or that are not yet (fully) explored. The  CRN program brings together multinational and multidisciplinary teams of researchers to carry out regional-level research projects that no one country or institution could carry out individually. The collective research capacity of the participating institutions is huge, making possible an entirely new structure for participation in multinational and multidisciplinary projects focused on global change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outcomes of the individual projects contribute to the development and strengthening of regional capacity to deal with global change. The program provides a scientific basis for documenting, understanding and projecting changes in the Earth system, and specifically to facilitate the full use of scientific information in policy and decision making. CRN II includes a strong capacity building component in terms of graduate and post-graduate education and enhancement of institutional infrastructure, and also promotes the participation of scientists from countries with less developed global change research communities. The first round of CRN showed that the multinational component of the projects provides an excellent opportunity for dialogue and exchanges among top researchers, students, decision makers and institutions from across the Americas, which in many cases led to partnerships that lasted and evolved far beyond the end of the individual CRN I projects. CRN II also promotes partnerships with other regional and/or international projects and programs, for example those of the Earth System Science Partnership (ESSP). Under the first round of CRN, those linkages were very effective not only in terms of coordination of associated efforts, but also as a medium to distribute the results of CRN science to a very broad audience. The synthesis of CRN II will be done through a technical synthesis for the scientific community and a non-technical synthesis for policy and decisions makers. This second synthesis is part of the IAI's strategy of  communicating scientific information, models, and conclusions to and among researchers, educators, students, resource and industrial managers, policy makers and the public.</AbstractNarration>

IAI programs have made a clear difference in the development of the regional research capacity by supporting early career scientists through training courses and scholarships of up to 4-5 years.    CRN2005 has shown interactions between human and natural factors that define ecotones - the boundaries between ecosystems. Knowledge of these interactions can now be explored for conservation and adaptation decisions.  CRN2014 has shown a significant relationship between belowground diversity of fungal plant symbionts and the nutrition, diversity and density of plant communities.  CRN2015 examined the links between biodiversity, ecosystem processes and ecosystem services. It built a network of scientist who have developed one of the largest databases of plant functional traits in America, recording a large number of species, traits, geographic coverage and climatic ranges.  CRN2017  resulted in a number of practical improvements in the monitoring and prediction of urban air quality. The cities of Santiago, S&atilde;o Paulo, Bogota, and Buenos Aires are now using the project results in the planning of traffic and emission regulations.

CRN2031 examined land use change, causes and impacts in the Plata Basin. It aimed at the decision making processes by farmers, foresters, policy makers and NGOs.  CRN2047 examined climate conditions, snow pack and glacier dynamics in the American cordillera in Canada, Mexico, Bolivia, Chile and Argentina using tree-ring data, precipitation and stream flow records, glacier studies and basin-wide hydrological balances.  CRN2048 improved the understanding of factors controlling the development and tracks of tropical cyclones in the eastern Pacific. It showed that large-scale ocean conditions, such as the temperature-related sea surface height anomaly did not explain activities during the cyclone season.  CRN 2050 has provided long-term data for the entire Caribbean - Central American region that now allows a reconstruction of climate trends. Pollen analysis in the Everglades has established a 5000 year record of sea levels and hurricane disturbance. The study has laid the foundation for integrating high-resolution spatial datasets in a GIS framework to assess the vulnerability of U.S. coastal populations to sea level rise. This methodology is being adapted to the entire Caribbean region.
