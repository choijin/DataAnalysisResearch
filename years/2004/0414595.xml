<AbstractNarration>This IMR award supports the acquisition of a scanning probe microscope (SPM) operating in vacuum of 10-7 torr. Acquisition of the SPM will create the infrastructure to perform a series of experiments to investigate the fundamental interactions between surfaces with separations at the nanometer scale, including Casimir forces and non-contact friction. The vacuum environment, in combination with custom alterations to the sample chamber, will enable the operation of microelectromechanical devices simultaneously with the scanning head in the environmental chamber. The approach and distance feedback mechanism of the SPM head will be utilized in the measurement of the Casimir force using a microelectromechanical oscillator. The SPM will also be used to characterize surface imperfections, including the spatial mapping of surface potential and roughness. Such a complete characterization of the surface is essential in the fundamental test of the theory of Casimir forces. In addition to Casimir force measurements, the SPM will also be used to investigate novel non-conservative effects when closely spaced objects are in relative motion. Students participating in the experiments will acquire invaluable experience in scanning probe microscopy and in the design, fabrication and operation of microelectromechanical devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This IMR award supports the acquisition of a scanning probe microscope (SPM) operating in vacuum of 10-7 torr. Acquisition of the SPM will create the infrastructure to perform a series of experiments to investigate the fundamental interactions between surfaces with separations at the nanometer scale, including Casimir forces and non-contact friction. The vacuum environment, in combination with custom alterations to the sample chamber, minimizes viscous damping and enables the operation of microelectromechanical devices simultaneously with the scanning head. One of the areas to be pursued with the SPM is the study of Casimir forces. The Casimir effect is the attraction between two neutral metallic surfaces arising from the quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field. The approach and distance feedback mechanism of the SPM head will be utilized in the measurement of the Casimir force using a microelectromechanical oscillator. Even though the Casimir force has been experimentally verified by a number of experimental teams, surface imperfections introduce non-negligible corrections to the Casimir force. The SPM will be used to characterize and optimize various surface imperfections. In addition to Casimir force measurements, the SPM will also be used to investigate novel non-conservative effects when closely spaced objects are in relative motion. Students participating in the experiments will acquire invaluable experience in scanning probe microscopy and in the design, fabrication and operation of microelectromechanical devices.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
