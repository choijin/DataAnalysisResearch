<AbstractNarration>This project involves the prototype development and preliminary evaluation of a computationally-based modeling and analysis system that includes integrated scripting and presentation capabilities designed to enable instructors and students to author and use instructional materials that interweave communication, experimentation, and application. Existing software capabilities are being extended and augmented to support these activities, and pilot materials are being created for use and evaluation at the P.I.'s local campus. Faculty at other universities and community colleges will then be given the opportunity to use these pilot materials as a starting point to author their own similar materials. The two primary research questions to be addressed in the ensuing evaluations are: (i) can effective learning materials be constructed using the developed environment; and (ii) is the approach sufficiently attractive and time-efficient that instructors will use it. The dual focus on student learning and faculty buy-in is an important aspect of this project. These research questions are being addressed in collaboration with assessment experts, who are developing suitable instruments to measure student and faculty reactions and experiences.</AbstractNarration>
