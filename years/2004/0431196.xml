<AbstractNarration>Over the past several years, there has been a great deal of research to &lt;br/&gt;improve performance of wireless communications in fading environments by exploiting &lt;br/&gt;transmitter and/or receiver diversity and spatial multiplexing. The pioneering work by Telatar, &lt;br/&gt;Foschini and Gans showed that multiple antenna radios (MAR) in a wireless communication system &lt;br/&gt;can greatly improve the performance. The major roadblock to MAR being a financially viable &lt;br/&gt;option for wireless communications is the cost of the analog portions of the radio. &lt;br/&gt;Point--to--point MAR systems employing complex signaling and signal processing algorithms have been &lt;br/&gt;designed and built and have achieved performance very close to the outage capacity.  &lt;br/&gt;The remaining gains that are achievable in MAR will only be exploited by considering the cost &lt;br/&gt;and complexity of analog circuitry in MAR signalling and signal processing, by considering more &lt;br/&gt;complex models for wireless propagation, and by putting MAR in networking context. The &lt;br/&gt;focus of this effort is to push MAR technology by exploiting the structure in these more &lt;br/&gt;complex models and networking scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of the effort can be succinctly stated as:&lt;br/&gt;1) Communication theory is often interested in normalizing performance &lt;br/&gt;for a fixed average power but in wireless implementations the peak &lt;br/&gt;power is a more critical driver than the average power.  The research &lt;br/&gt;is examining optimization of performance and throughput with a peak &lt;br/&gt;power constraint in multiple antenna radio.&lt;br/&gt;2) Feedback communication is likely going to enable a significant &lt;br/&gt;improvement in throughput and demodulator complexity in a networked &lt;br/&gt;scenario especially in environments with low mobility (e.g., wireless &lt;br/&gt;computer networks).  This research is approaching feedback &lt;br/&gt;communication with a classic scientific method of iterating between &lt;br/&gt;experimentation on real channels and more realistic theoretical problem &lt;br/&gt;formulations based on the results derived in experimentation.&lt;br/&gt;3) The cost driver in wireless communication currently is the analog &lt;br/&gt;circuitry.  This research is examining techniques that would minimize &lt;br/&gt;the complexity of the analog systems in a multiple antenna radio. The &lt;br/&gt;objectives are to being met by the following research tasks&lt;br/&gt;a) Improved channel parameterization for long range prediction for &lt;br/&gt;multiple antenna radio,&lt;br/&gt;b) Design and field testing of a variety of MAR automatic repeat &lt;br/&gt;request algorithms,&lt;br/&gt;c) Experimentation with the proposed feedback algorithms for MAR,&lt;br/&gt;d) Feedback algorithms for MAR with constant envelop modulations,&lt;br/&gt;e) Feedback algorithms for MAR with limited analog capabilities,&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
