<AbstractNarration>Project Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project represents a partnership between Oregon State University and WET Labs to develop a Coastal Autonomous Profiling and Boundary Layer System (CAPABLE). This effort combines the experience of OSU scientists and technicians working in the coastal ocean with the engineering and oceanographic sensor expertise of WET Labs to design and build the next generation, multi-parameter oceanographic sensing system. CAPABLE will be equipped with sensors to measure the ocean temperature, velocity, salinity, nitrate content, dissolved oxygen level, suspended particle load, and chlorophyll concentration. CAPABLE will consist of three components: 1. The ExTended ENdurance Autonomous Moored Profiler (xTEN AMP) based on a winch-on-board design and carrying a suite of interdisciplinary sensors capable of profiling a 200 m water column 8 times per day. The system will telemeter data to shore via radio or Iridium phone and be deployable for 6 months. The xTEN AMP will carry a battery pack capable of being recharged from a power system housed in a bottom-mounted docking station; 2. The Shallow Coastal Upward Looking Profiler Integration Node (SCULPIN) housing the battery recharge system, a deployment/recovery system and a set of instruments for making measurements in the bottom boundary region below the xTEN AMP's lowest measurement. The SCULPIN instrument suite includes an upward-looking acoustic Doppler current profiler to obtain high-resolution velocity profiles, and sensors to measure near-bottom pressure, temperature, conductivity, chlorophyll concentration, and suspended particle load; 3. The Surface Boundary Buoy (SBB) making detailed observations in the air and the upper-ocean region, using a suite of meteorological sensors, a high-frequency acoustic Doppler profiler and sensors to measure upper-layer temperature-conductivity to resolve the upper-ocean structure. The SBB also provides a platform for collecting and telemetering all data to shore. The xTEN AMP will cycle up-and-down through the water column using an electric winch mounted inside the profiling platform rather than on the ocean bottom. The xTEN AMP will feature: a completely self-contained, modularly-integrated sensor, instrument controller, winch, power and telemetry system; a biofouling-resistant and hydrodynamic profiling platform; an intelligent winch controller for dynamic profiling; and an inductive charging system coupling with the SCULPIN. The xTEN AMP will communicate acoustically with the SBB and through an inductive system with the SCULPIN sensors. Data will be sent to shore via HF radio or satellite phone from the xTEN AMP and/or from the SBB. Data will then be sent on the Internet to OSU for data processing, quality control, archiving, and posting on a web portal. As a backup, all data will be stored internally on the xTEN AMP, SCULPIN and SBB. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
