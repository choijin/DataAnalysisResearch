<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Purpose and Objectives:  The purpose of this proposal is to seek NSF funding ($20,000) for travel support of a group of 8-10 invited US side participants to attend a US-INDIA NEES Workshop to be held at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay in January, 2005. The objectives of the workshop are (1) to develop plans to link a few leading research facilities in India with the global NEES network and (2) to discuss opportunities and development of joint research proposals for carrying out collaborative research within the NEES Research Program of the NSF. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:  With available modern IT tools such as tele-presence and networking it is possible to extend the NEES Collaboratory to include participation from other countries where earthquake threat, and excellent research personnel as well as facilities exist. Thus, global participation and networking has been identified as an important component of the NSF-NEES vision. Attendance of US group of participants in the proposed workshop will help develop a number of state-of-the-art research facilities in India as international partners in the NEES &lt;br/&gt;Collaboratory. It will also lay the groundwork for developing joint collaborative research projects. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Research Plan:  The workshop will be held during January 2005 at and hosted by the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay. It will be attended by 10-15 invited participants from selected Indian research institutions and 8-10 US researchers. The workshop agenda will include the following main items: &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;1.  Presentations by US participants on NSF-NEES Facilities. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;2.  Presentations by Indian participants about existing research facilities and current upgrading plans, as well as ongoing research projects. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;3.  Firm up plans to link facilities at selected institutions in India with the NEES Network. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;4.  Discuss plans for developing appropriate joint proposals to conduct collaborative research to be performed under the framework of Global NEES Collaboratory. It is intended that the proposals will be fully developed and submitted during the year 2005 to appropriate funding agencies in India and US. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact - Research:  Attendance of the US group of participants in the proposed workshop will help develop a number of state-of-the-art research facilities in India as international partners in the NEES Collaboratory. It will also lay the groundwork for developing joint collaborative research projects. At a broader level the development of international NEES collaboration will accelerate earthquake hazard reduction at a global scale. &lt;br/&gt;   &lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact . Educational and International Cooperation:  The project will provide great &lt;br/&gt;opportunity for international cooperation. The proposed activity will also encourage diverse groups of researchers to conduct research work of international caliber through collaboration, sharing of information and ideas, and exchange of personnel. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
