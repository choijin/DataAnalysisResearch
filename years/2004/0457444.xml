<AbstractNarration>REPRESENTATION THEORY OF INFINITE DIMENSIONAL LIE&lt;br/&gt;ALGEBRAS AND QUANTUM FIELD THEORY&lt;br/&gt;IGOR FRENKEL&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;The proposal is dedicated to the development of three interrelated areas in the&lt;br/&gt;representation theory of infinite dimensional Lie algebras and their applications to&lt;br/&gt;quantum field theory (QFT). The first part of the proposal is focused on the vertex&lt;br/&gt;operator algebra structure of a modification of regular representations of affine Lie&lt;br/&gt;algebras. The author plans to prove, in particular, his conjecture that the zeroth&lt;br/&gt;semi-infinite cohomology of the reduced vertex operator algebra yields the famous&lt;br/&gt;Verlinde algebra of the Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten model of 2 dimensional QFT.&lt;br/&gt;The second part of the proposal consists of a cohomological and K-theoretic realization&lt;br/&gt;of various algebraic constructions of the first part by means of 4 dimensional&lt;br/&gt;classical Yang-Mills theory. The author proposes to use the geometric construction&lt;br/&gt;due to Nakajima of representations of affine Lie algebras based on Yang-Mills&lt;br/&gt;instantons on asymptotically locally Euclidean spaces, and also a new geometric&lt;br/&gt;construction related to the first one by the level-rank duality discovered by the&lt;br/&gt;author in the algebraic context in his earlier work. Finally, the third part is dedicated&lt;br/&gt;to a new direction in the representation theory of 3 dimensional convolution&lt;br/&gt;and current algebras presently developed by the author. It is based on a new noncommutative&lt;br/&gt;geometry of quantum Minkowski space-time recently introduced by&lt;br/&gt;Jardim and the author in their study of a noncommutative version of the Yang-&lt;br/&gt;Mills theory. The three parts of the proposal are related to each other in that they&lt;br/&gt;constitute a new program: a representation theoretic approach to 4 dimensional&lt;br/&gt;QFT. This is a far reaching extension of the representation theoretic approach to&lt;br/&gt;2 dimensional QFT previously developed by the author and other mathematicians&lt;br/&gt;and mathematical physicists.&lt;br/&gt;The proposal is devoted to problems at the frontiers of modern representation&lt;br/&gt;theory: the field of mathematics that studies symmetries and their realizations.&lt;br/&gt;By its nature representation theory underlies and unifies the structures of diverse&lt;br/&gt;areas in mathematics and physics, and in the past 25 years the author has made a&lt;br/&gt;number of important contributions to this field. The present proposal contains a&lt;br/&gt;new program of development for the representation theory of infinite dimensional&lt;br/&gt;symmetries which is especially relevant to the most advanced part of the existing&lt;br/&gt;theoretical physics that is supported by experimental physics; namely, 4 dimensional&lt;br/&gt;quantum field theory. Progress in this direction will enrich our understanding of&lt;br/&gt;the fundamental mathematical structures that lie at the foundation of the physical&lt;br/&gt;universe.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
