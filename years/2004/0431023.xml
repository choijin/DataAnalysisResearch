<AbstractNarration>We propose to work on several areas of theory. The first concerns game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;theoretic/economic questions. The second concerns several questions about&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;polynomials: zero testing, MOD complexity, and learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will examine a variety of open problems from&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;these areas. Some of the open problems are classic and well known;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;others are new. The mix between known problems that are often&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;difficult and new problems is important. Both types of problems will,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;we believe, advance our understanding of these important questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first questions concern mainly non-cooperative games as well as&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;fair division problems. These problems have often been studied for&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;years, but only recently have researchers looked closely at their&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;computational complexity. It seems clear that the interface between&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;game theory and economic problems with complexity theory has&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;tremendous potential.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second questions concern mainly classic problems from the&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;foundations of complexity theory. They include the power of polynomial&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;under various complexity restrictions and certain learning&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;problems. The problems are important for two reasons. They are&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;important for their own sake. Further, their solution or even partial&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;solution is likely to yield new insights and potentially new&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;techniques. These could then be used to further our understanding of&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;other problems in other parts of theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Games and economic problems are extremely&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;challenging. This is especially true for non-zero sum games. Their&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;complex structure raises many important fundamental questions. We&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;expect to learn a great deal from the study of these important&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;problems. This is also true for the more classic questions concerning&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;polynomials. The questions of testing, mod behavior, and learning are&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;difficult problems. Some have been challenging open problems for&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;decades. We believe that any progress on these problems will require&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;us to use old methods in new ways and to invent new methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The impact of the proposed research into games&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;and economic problems is clear. Progress on the computational aspects&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;of economic problems has a clear impact on society. As commerce&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;becomes more digital, it is clear that any better understanding of games&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;and economic problems will have impact on a very broad community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work on polynomials also will have a broad impact. Some of the&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;most fundamental theory questions would be effected by progress on any&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;of the proposed research. The impact would be far beyond the theory&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;community that studies these questions. It could effect other fields&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;like: cryptography, learning theory, and fundamental parts of&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
