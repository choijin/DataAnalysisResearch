<AbstractNarration>The PI proposes to develope theoretical models of crystalline solids&lt;br/&gt;that are based on the positions of the  atoms that make up the crystal.&lt;br/&gt; As a first step, the PI proposes to study (large) elastic deformation &lt;br/&gt;of perfect crystals. This will help us to understand the critical strain that&lt;br/&gt;the material can sustain before defects form. The PI then proposes to&lt;br/&gt;study the formation, structure, energetics and dynamics of defects in crystals.&lt;br/&gt;Understanding defects in crystals is crucial since defects control the &lt;br/&gt;response and failure of the material, as in, e.g. nano-devices&lt;br/&gt;and semi-conductor thin films.  By understanding the interplay between &lt;br/&gt;loading and failure mechanisms as well as their microscopic origin, the PI  &lt;br/&gt;hopes to give guidelines fordesigning materials that avoid certain modes of failure.&lt;br/&gt;To obtain simplified models that can be readily linked with traditional &lt;br/&gt;theories of continuum mechanics, the PI also proposes to develop &lt;br/&gt;continuum models  in the form of nonlinear elasticity theory &lt;br/&gt;that are derived directly from the atomistic models. Such a theory gives &lt;br/&gt;a much simplified description for the material properties and are &lt;br/&gt;therefore easier to use.&lt;br/&gt;                                                                                       &lt;br/&gt;As applications, the PI proposes to study the mechanical properties of&lt;br/&gt;carbon nano-tubes. Nano-tubes are very good examples for this project&lt;br/&gt;since they can sustain very large elastic deformation before failure. In fact &lt;br/&gt;they are the strongest fiber known to us. The PI proposes to study large &lt;br/&gt;(therefore nonlinear) deformations of nano-tubes, their modes of failure, &lt;br/&gt;as well as properties of nano-tube-reinforced materials.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
