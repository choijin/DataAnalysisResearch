<AbstractNarration>The Major Research Instrumentation program provides funding for the acquisition of a core semiconductor processing tool that is required for a semiconductor research training facility at the University of California at Riverside (UCR). The funds will be used for the acquisition of a chemical vapor deposition system for research in organic/biological-silicon hybrid devices and research training in a broad range of topics related to semiconductor processing. The new tool from Nanomasters Inc. incorporates a dual process-chamber setup and  allows for separation of carbon-rich and carbon-sensitive processing steps. Availability of this tool will forward a broad range of NSF-sponsored projects at UCR ranging from research in organic device components compatible with a semiconductor-processing environment to the development of a semiconductor-related curriculum at a institution that is located in an area which has one of the lowest rate of high school students continuing towards collegiate education.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Major Research Instrumentation program provides funding for the acquisition of a core semiconductor processing tool that is required for a semiconductor research training facility at the University of California at Riverside (UCR).
