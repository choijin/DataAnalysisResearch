<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0432284&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Jozef H. Przytycki&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides partial participant support for the 18th&lt;br/&gt;conference in the series, "Knots in Washington."  This meeting is&lt;br/&gt;devoted to the theme of Khovanov homology, and aims to bring&lt;br/&gt;exponents of that new theory together with recent and current&lt;br/&gt;students in topology, along with experienced researchers in other&lt;br/&gt;aspects of knot theory and quantum topology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A large number of methods have been developed for computing&lt;br/&gt;numbers or polynomials that each measure some aspect of the&lt;br/&gt;complexity of a knotted curve in space.  The Alexander&lt;br/&gt;polynomial, which is approximately 70 years old, is the first&lt;br/&gt;example of this powerful class of tools.   The search for&lt;br/&gt;sharper ways to distinguish one knot from another and to&lt;br/&gt;understand associated geometric questions gathered speed&lt;br/&gt;approximately 20 years ago with the discovery of the Jones&lt;br/&gt;polynomial and related invariants.  Mikhail Khovanov of the&lt;br/&gt;University of California, Davis, found in 1999 that the Jones&lt;br/&gt;polynomial can be viewed as a one-line summary of a richer&lt;br/&gt;theory, and ongoing work with Khovanov's ideas will be the&lt;br/&gt;theme of this conference.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
