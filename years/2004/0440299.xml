<AbstractNarration>     Liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) are rubbers whose&lt;br/&gt;constituent molecules are orientationally ordered, with their&lt;br/&gt;salient feature being a strong coupling between the orientational&lt;br/&gt;order and mechanical strain.  A characteristic feature of LCEs is&lt;br/&gt;that relatively small external effects, such as changes in&lt;br/&gt;temperature or onset of illumination, can produce huge and rapid&lt;br/&gt;deformations.  LCEs will likely assume real technological&lt;br/&gt;importance due of their softness and their ready responsiveness&lt;br/&gt;to applied fields, yielding applications in microfluidic pumping&lt;br/&gt;and switching, and helping to answer basic questions in&lt;br/&gt;locomotion.  By extending the theory of rubber networks, the&lt;br/&gt;investigators develop and explore continuum descriptions of these&lt;br/&gt;materials, and study how LCEs behave in the bulk and in&lt;br/&gt;interaction with an external fluid, and begin to develop&lt;br/&gt;simulational methods for these systems.  Parallel to the&lt;br/&gt;theoretical study is an experimental program that involves the&lt;br/&gt;applications of LCEs, such as to locomotion, but also to new&lt;br/&gt;materials synthesis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) are active flexible&lt;br/&gt;materials whose constituent molecules can be reoriented or&lt;br/&gt;disordered by applying electric or temperature fields.  A&lt;br/&gt;consequence of this is that relatively small external effects,&lt;br/&gt;say in temperature changes or an onset of illumination, can&lt;br/&gt;produce huge and rapid deformations of the material. The&lt;br/&gt;investigators have already demonstrated that LCEs can have&lt;br/&gt;fascinating dynamics when interacting with a fluidic environment,&lt;br/&gt;such as the observed "swimming" of floating LCE samples away from&lt;br/&gt;an illuminated region.  These materials may be of technological&lt;br/&gt;importance due of their softness and responsiveness, suggesting&lt;br/&gt;applications in microfluidic pumping and switching, and helping&lt;br/&gt;to answer basic questions in locomotion.  To fully exploit these&lt;br/&gt;materials the development of soundly based mathematical models is&lt;br/&gt;crucial.  The investigators develop mathematical descriptions of&lt;br/&gt;these materials, and seek to understand the ways in which LCEs&lt;br/&gt;interact with applied fields and with their environment. &lt;br/&gt;Parallel to the theoretical studies is an experimental program&lt;br/&gt;that involves the applications of LCEs, such as to locomotion,&lt;br/&gt;but also to new materials synthesis.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
