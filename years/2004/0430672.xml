<AbstractNarration>It is proposed that a new family of algorithms for linear programming (more&lt;br/&gt;generally, for hyperbolic programming) be further developed, both computationally&lt;br/&gt;and theoretically. Envisioned is a full mathematical development of the new&lt;br/&gt;algorithmic framework, isolation of those ideas that appear likely to be pertinent&lt;br/&gt;for constructing truly practical algorithms, and the free availability of implementations&lt;br/&gt;(partly to encourage other researchers to participate and improve on the&lt;br/&gt;efforts).&lt;br/&gt;Unlike existing algorithms for linear programming, the new framework layers&lt;br/&gt;combinatorial structure. The algorithms work through the layers sequentially,&lt;br/&gt;beginning with the least complex one, and continuing until an optimal solu-tion&lt;br/&gt;is attained, which generally occurs long before reaching the final layer, i.e.,&lt;br/&gt;long before explicitly calculating with the full combinatorial structure. The new&lt;br/&gt;idea of layering is made computationally tractable via the elementary symmetric&lt;br/&gt;polynomials, their hyperbolicity cones, and the discrete Fast Fourier Transform&lt;br/&gt;(dFFT).&lt;br/&gt;Linear programming as a modeling tool is pervasive in daily applications, being&lt;br/&gt;relied upon in all kinds of transportation scheduling, in an array of integrative&lt;br/&gt;financial management activities, and more generally, anywhere that limited resources&lt;br/&gt;need to be deployed most efficiently. A primary bottleneck to even more&lt;br/&gt;extensive use of linear programs,  especially in settings where data change often&lt;br/&gt;is the computational time required to solve linear programs. Consequently,&lt;br/&gt;development of a novel framework such as the one presented here has the poten-tial&lt;br/&gt;of broader impact on society through the creation of algorithms capable&lt;br/&gt;of attaining linear program solutions faster than before, thereby extending the&lt;br/&gt;usefulness of linear programming as a modeling tool.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit for the proposal comes from the new framework's po-tential&lt;br/&gt;to invigorate algorithmic investigations into linear programming (and its&lt;br/&gt;extensions) by infusing inspiring new concepts into the research area, an area that&lt;br/&gt;has largely become staid in the 20 years since interior-point methods created stir.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit also comes from the cohesion brought by the framework, a&lt;br/&gt;framework that stretches from engineering (e.g., linear programming, dFFT) to&lt;br/&gt;classical mathematics (e.g., symmetric functions, Riemannian geometry).</AbstractNarration>
