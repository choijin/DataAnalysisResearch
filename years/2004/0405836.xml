    <AbstractNarration>DMS-0405836&lt;br/&gt;Title: Research in classical minimal surface theory&lt;br/&gt;PI: William H. Meeks, University of Massachusetts (Amherst)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposed Research Project Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this proposal the researcher will study the geometry, asymptotic&lt;br/&gt;behavior, conformal structure and topology of properly embedded&lt;br/&gt;minimal surfaces in three-dimensional Euclidean space. One of the main&lt;br/&gt;goals of the proposal is to classify all of the properly embedded minimal &lt;br/&gt;surfaces which can be parametrized by domains in the Euclidean plane and&lt;br/&gt;to describe the asymptotic geometry of all finite genus examples.&lt;br/&gt;Related theoretical techniques concerning compactness, regularity and&lt;br/&gt;convergence of minimal surfaces of locally bounded genus will be&lt;br/&gt;investigated as well. One hoped for application of this research is&lt;br/&gt;to classify all smooth finite group actions on the three-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;sphere. As an outgrowth of his recent joint manuscript with Charles&lt;br/&gt;Frohman on the topological classification for minimal surfaces, the&lt;br/&gt;researcher proposes to prove that Bryant surfaces in hyperbolic &lt;br/&gt;three-space are unknotted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Classical minimal surface theory has its roots in 18-th and 19-th&lt;br/&gt;century mathematics. Minimal surfaces are the first&lt;br/&gt;important examples of what is called the calculus of variations, first&lt;br/&gt;described by Euler around 1735. Physically minimal surfaces can be&lt;br/&gt;modeled locally as soap films on wires or by surfaces of least-area &lt;br/&gt;relative to their local boundaries. Minimal surfaces play an important&lt;br/&gt;role as a tool in the study of three-dimensional topology and&lt;br/&gt;Riemannian geometry. The subject of minimal surfaces has a broad impact in mathematics and&lt;br/&gt;physical sciences. Minimal surfaces are stationary fluid interfaces,so&lt;br/&gt;their shapes arise in many physical problems. The work in this&lt;br/&gt;proposal would classify the possible physical shapes which could occur&lt;br/&gt;as infinite interfaces. Many of the known examples of minimal surfaces&lt;br/&gt;are observed physically, so it is of interest to have a rigorous&lt;br/&gt;theorem which predicts the shapes which can occur.&lt;br/&gt;The research proposed here strongly impacts the area of classical&lt;br/&gt;differential geometry of surfaces in three-dimensional Euclidean&lt;br/&gt;space. As is well known to geometers, minimal surface theory has been&lt;br/&gt;and continues to be one of the principal tools for proving theorems in&lt;br/&gt;general relativity and three-dimensional topology. One well-known&lt;br/&gt;such application is Schoen and Yau's proof of the Positive Mass&lt;br/&gt;Conjecture. Recent work of Gabai on the Generalized Smale Conjecture&lt;br/&gt;shows the continued importance of minimal surfaces in&lt;br/&gt;three-dimensional topology. Most of the research proposed here is related to and&lt;br/&gt;motivated by the hope that it will lead to a positive solution of the&lt;br/&gt;Pitts-Rubenstein Conjecture and to the classification of&lt;br/&gt;three-manifolds with finite fundamental group. This hoped for&lt;br/&gt;topological application to one of the outstanding classification&lt;br/&gt;problems in mathematics has its roots in previous joint research by&lt;br/&gt;the researcher, Peter Scott, Charles Frohman and S. T. Yau. In part&lt;br/&gt;because of the important connections with other areas of mathematics&lt;br/&gt;and the ease in which it is possible to make computer graphics&lt;br/&gt;pictures of beautiful classical examples, minimal surfaces continue to&lt;br/&gt;be one of the principal topics for popular science articles and public&lt;br/&gt;science exhibits. Thus, indirectly, the exciting research problems&lt;br/&gt;outlined in this proposal help bring many young scientists and&lt;br/&gt;mathematicians to the frontiers of research.</AbstractNarration>
