    <AbstractNarration>The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO)'s goal is the direct detection of gravitational waves from various astrophysical sources to open a totally new window on the Universe. LIGO's widely separated interferometers are used in coincidence to search for gravitational waves emitted by compact binary systems, spinning neutron stars, supernovae and other cosmological phenomena. The LIGO detectors are now approaching design performance and prolonged data taking will commence in late 2005. Development of a more sensitive advanced detector is already well underway. The scientific program of LIGO is the mission of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LIGO's current alternating cycles of data taking, data analysis and detector improvement activities provide an opportunity for the experimental gravity group at Columbia University (GECo) as a new LSC group. The GECo group intends to play a pivotal role in the following critical areas: (1) Timing accuracy and timing diagnostics for LIGO and Advanced LIGO to enable crucial coincidence detection; (2) Improvement, development, and support for detector diagnostic tools and physical environmental monitoring systems needed to improve detector reliability and to quantify data quality; (3) Execution and further development of sensitive and specialized analyses, which take advantage of astrophysical triggers, such as gamma ray bursts and optical supernovae. These activities provide hands-on opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students. The PI will participate in a number of Columbia University programs involving outreach to the local community.</AbstractNarration>
