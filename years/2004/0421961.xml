<AbstractNarration>This project is establishes a partnership between Washington State University (WSU) and Columbia Basin College (CBC) offering scholarships to academically talented but financially needy students pursuing BS degrees in engineering, computer science and mathematics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Well prepared students are identified through an existing Math Engineering Science Achievement (MESA) program that is designed to encourage underrepresented middle and high school students to complete the academic prerequisites necessary to enroll in programs leading to BS degrees in mathematics, engineering and science. This program is well established in several middle and high schools in the area, and had significant success in producing students who earn BS degrees in science and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Student services are in place both at WSU and CBC that have been shown to be successful at assisting students similar to those targeted here during both the transition from high school to college life and the remainder of their academic career. These services include "bridge" programs during transitions between different institutions, free tutoring for core courses and affinity groups that provide encouragement for students during their studies. Where appropriate, the programs involve the entire family unit since they are a very important influence on decisions made by students in the targeted area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A significant result of this project is the enhanced educational achievements by students from Hispanic backgrounds. Many of these students enter the local workforce at one of the numerous corporations in the targeted areas of the state of Washington. These corporations have indicated that they are 1) interested in providing mentors, shadowing opportunities and internships for students in this program, 2) very interested in hiring the students upon graduation with a baccalaureate degree and 3) interested in continuing the funding for the program after the NSF funding in no longer available. Thus, another positive result is increased cooperation between industry and educational institutions.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
