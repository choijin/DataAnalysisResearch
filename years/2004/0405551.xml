<AbstractNarration>Abstract: DMS-0405551 J Lega, University of Arizona&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Current problems in nonlinear dynamics: Macroscopic modeling of microscopic interactions and instability of coherent structures&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A current challenge in the modeling of many complex systems is to&lt;br/&gt;develop comprehensive descriptions that cover all levels of&lt;br/&gt;interactions, from the microscopic to the macroscopic. The first&lt;br/&gt;topic of the proposed research falls into this category, with the&lt;br/&gt;additional complexity of dealing with a system made of living&lt;br/&gt;organisms. The PI and a collaborator have recently developed a&lt;br/&gt;hydrodynamic model describing the dynamics and growth of bacterial&lt;br/&gt;colonies at a macroscopic level. The PI will now investigate the&lt;br/&gt;microscopic dynamics of interacting bacteria. Numerical&lt;br/&gt;simulations of "live" interacting particles will be developed, on&lt;br/&gt;which coarse-graining will be applied to obtain a description at&lt;br/&gt;the macroscopic level. The search will be for a set of collision&lt;br/&gt;rules that can reproduce and explain the collective behaviors that&lt;br/&gt;have recently been observed in dense colonies of bacteria. This&lt;br/&gt;study will also lay the ground for the future development of&lt;br/&gt;kinetic models of collections of living organisms. The second&lt;br/&gt;topic of the proposed research concerns the stability of coherent&lt;br/&gt;structures. The kink-anti-kink profile of a bacterial colony, the&lt;br/&gt;local deformations of an elastic filament, or the ultra-short&lt;br/&gt;pulses propagating in an optical fiber, are all examples of&lt;br/&gt;coherent structures. Such objects are often described as special&lt;br/&gt;solutions of one or more model partial differential equations, and&lt;br/&gt;modern analytical techniques have been developed to address the&lt;br/&gt;question of their stability. The PI will combine such techniques&lt;br/&gt;with numerical calculations and asymptotic expansions, in order to&lt;br/&gt;obtain stability and instability results for coherent structures&lt;br/&gt;observed in nonlinear optics and in reaction-diffusion equations&lt;br/&gt;with nonlinear diffusion. The tools and methods that will be&lt;br/&gt;developed in such a study are general enough to be applied to&lt;br/&gt;other evolutionary partial differential equations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mathematical modeling is nowadays playing an important and growing&lt;br/&gt;role in the life and physical sciences. In particular, models that&lt;br/&gt;are based on our vision of how various building blocks of a&lt;br/&gt;complex system interact with one another, and which translate this&lt;br/&gt;vision into mathematical terms, can be used to test our theories&lt;br/&gt;and make sure our understanding is built on solid ground. The main&lt;br/&gt;challenge we face with such an approach is that our intuition&lt;br/&gt;often feels more at ease at the microscopic - or the building&lt;br/&gt;block - level, even though we live in a macroscopic world. All of&lt;br/&gt;the difficulty lies in bridging the gap between these two worlds.&lt;br/&gt;The first part of this work deals with such a problem: the goal is&lt;br/&gt;to understand how microscopic interactions between bacteria may&lt;br/&gt;lead to collective, macroscopic behaviors, as observed in some&lt;br/&gt;experiments. Such phenomena will be modeled in the case of&lt;br/&gt;laboratory grown colonies of bacteria, but similar principles&lt;br/&gt;could be applied to the formation and dynamics of biofilms, which&lt;br/&gt;have many engineering and medical applications. The second part of&lt;br/&gt;the work concerns general methods for the analysis of mathematical&lt;br/&gt;models which involve nonlinear partial differential equations. In&lt;br/&gt;particular, the stability of solutions of some models relevant to&lt;br/&gt;nonlinear optics and population dynamics will be investigated.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
