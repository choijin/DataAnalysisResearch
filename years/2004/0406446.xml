<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0406446&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Yisong Yang&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is to develop a general existence theory for the&lt;br/&gt;knotted solitons arising in Faddeev's quantum field theory&lt;br/&gt;model. The difficult structure of the problem requires innovative&lt;br/&gt;techniques and ideas beyond the well developed tools such as the&lt;br/&gt;method of concentration-compactness.  Recently, the PI has&lt;br/&gt;collaborated with F. H. Lin on the existence of these Faddeev&lt;br/&gt;knots and a series of important results have been obtained.  A&lt;br/&gt;notable feature in their study is that, although compactness may&lt;br/&gt;fail, existence may be achieved as a consequence of two key&lt;br/&gt;inequalities: the first inequality, called by them the&lt;br/&gt;Substantial Inequality, ensures the existence of at least one&lt;br/&gt;topological minimizer; the second inequality, giving an optimal&lt;br/&gt;sublinear upper growth estimate for the Faddeev energy in terms&lt;br/&gt;of the associated topological charge, implies the existence of an&lt;br/&gt;infinite family of topological minimizers, hence the existence of&lt;br/&gt;the Faddeev knots. This progress opens new directions for&lt;br/&gt;achieving a higher level of understanding of various unsettled&lt;br/&gt;aspects of the Faddeev knots, including the existence of&lt;br/&gt;unit-charge unknots (ring-like solitons), existence of&lt;br/&gt;high-charge knots and their stability, and transition pictures of&lt;br/&gt;knots in view of their topological and energetical&lt;br/&gt;characteristics. The similarity between the Faddeev energy and&lt;br/&gt;the Skyrme energy may be exploited to tackle the difficult&lt;br/&gt;existence problem of the Skyrme solitons. Indeed, a by-product of&lt;br/&gt;the work of F.  H. Lin and the PI will be a proof of the&lt;br/&gt;existence of unit-charge Skyrme solitons which corrects the&lt;br/&gt;flawed (but well-known) proof of M. Esteban published in 1986.&lt;br/&gt;This study may also be extended to the Skyrme model in two&lt;br/&gt;spatial dimensions which has applications in condensed matter&lt;br/&gt;physics and cosmology. This project also suggests new directions&lt;br/&gt;for the study of the existence problems of global energy&lt;br/&gt;minimizers with topological characteristics in other important&lt;br/&gt;related areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The concept of knots is of foundational importance in&lt;br/&gt;science. For example, Lord Kelvin first explored the idea of&lt;br/&gt;using knots to model atoms and molecules.  More recently, the&lt;br/&gt;concept of knots has inspired various fundamental areas,&lt;br/&gt;including particle and condensed-matter physics, statistical&lt;br/&gt;mechanics, cosmology, molecular biology, and synthetic chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;Up until recently, mathematical work had been focused on&lt;br/&gt;topological and combinatorial classifications of knots, but not&lt;br/&gt;on existence.  In 1995, Faddeev and Niemi started a seminal study&lt;br/&gt;on the existence of knots as the soliton solutions of a quantum&lt;br/&gt;field theory model known as the Faddeev model using high-power&lt;br/&gt;computer simulations.  The proposed work develops a mathematical&lt;br/&gt;existence theory of such knots.  This work will give new insight&lt;br/&gt;into the mathematical structure of knots and their computer&lt;br/&gt;realization.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
