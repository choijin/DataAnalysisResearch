<AbstractNarration>What does it mean to be fully educated . especially in the sciences, engineering, and technology&lt;br/&gt;-- in our pluralistic 21st century society? To explore this question, Syracuse University proposes&lt;br/&gt;hosting a workshop, using the intergroup-dialogue model (IGD), to draw together select leaders&lt;br/&gt;from prominent research universities, corporations, government and non- profit organizations.&lt;br/&gt;The inaugural workshop will take place at Syracuse University in spring, 2005, with the&lt;br/&gt;possibility of one or more workshops to follow subsequently. We will extend invitations to&lt;br/&gt;twenty university participants, including institutional presidents, provosts and eminent scholars.&lt;br/&gt;Centrally important to this intergroup-dialogue approach will be inclusion of contrasting -- and&lt;br/&gt;perhaps conflicting -- perspectives within research universities (e.g., public, private and&lt;br/&gt;technological institutions; geographically dispersed; with and without medical schools). The&lt;br/&gt;individual scholars from sciences and engineering selected for this workshop will have&lt;br/&gt;evidenced both deep knowledge of specific domains and considerable breadth across field&lt;br/&gt;boundaries. We will also invite select leaders from major corporations, government agencies,&lt;br/&gt;and non-profit entities (e.g., FASEB, AAAS, NAE, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, and&lt;br/&gt;Burroughs Wellcome Fund, and NACME). The National Science Foundation will play a key&lt;br/&gt;role in these workshops. &lt;br/&gt;Use of the intergroup model applied to our core question . what does it mean to be a fully&lt;br/&gt;educated member of the 21st century workforce . will impact both higher education and society&lt;br/&gt;through the following project objectives: (1) create a forum for diverse stakeholders to engage in&lt;br/&gt;intergroup dialogue addressing the question .what does it mean to be a fully educated member of&lt;br/&gt;the 21st century Workforce?. (2) develop recommendations and possible strategies for higher&lt;br/&gt;education, government agencies, and other key stakeholders to use to achieve this goal; and (3)&lt;br/&gt;assess the effectiveness of the intergroup dialogue model in a new application.&lt;br/&gt;The dissemination plan for this workshop will include distribution of the written&lt;br/&gt;recommendations and the video recordings from the sessions through the Syracuse University&lt;br/&gt;web site.</AbstractNarration>
