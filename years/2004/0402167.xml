<AbstractNarration>Engineering-Engineering Technology (58)  Houston Community College - Northeast (HCC-Northeast) and McNeese State University (MSU) are the foundation of a Gulf Coast - Technology Articulation Partnership (GC-TAP), which provides technicians for the Texas/Louisiana petrochemical industry. The project is developing articulation agreements between McNeese State University and the Houston Community College System to provide AAS degree holders the opportunity to continue their education and achieve a baccalaureate degree in process technology. The project includes Lee College as a partner to test the transferability of the process to the other community colleges within this region that have petrochemical AAS degree programs. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The project includes significant outreach component and support systems to attract and retain Hispanic students. Methods include meeting with parents of high school students, developing promotional materials in Spanish, providing scholarships to students attending both institutions, developing yearly one-day workshops at each institution for counselors and high school teachers to become more informed of process technology and to raise their student's awareness about the opportunities in process technology, creating student cohorts that includes mentoring support, and providing trips to McNeese State University to understand how job opportunities in process technology are enhanced by obtaining a four-year degree.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To achieve these goals, GC-TAP is implementing a seamless pathway between the two institutions by involving highly trained faculty with industry experience throughout the process; offering college faculty as well as secondary education teachers and counselors opportunities for professional development through seminars, workshops and specialized training; developing a Co-op program at each institution; and developing a co-enrollment agreement between the two institutions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is developing web based instructional material to provide access to specialized classes at remote campuses. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
