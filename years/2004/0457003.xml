<AbstractNarration>Project Summary for George Andrews&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The first topic covered in this propsoal is Partitions and&lt;br/&gt; Probability. Here it is proposed to ground the study begun by&lt;br/&gt; Holroyd, Liggett, and Romik in the theory of partitions with&lt;br/&gt; the hope of getting (1) better asymptotics, (2) broader&lt;br/&gt; applications, and (3) further connections with Ramanujan's&lt;br/&gt; mock theta functions.  The second topic, Entire Functions&lt;br/&gt; and the Rogers-Ramanujan Identities, examines the further&lt;br/&gt; implications that arise from two truly amazing formulas&lt;br/&gt; that lay buried in Ramanujan's Lost Notebook.  The third&lt;br/&gt; topic, Engel Transformations, builds upon some &lt;br/&gt; of the original amazing expansion theorems due to A. and&lt;br/&gt; J. Knopfmacher.  This algorithm should be useful in any&lt;br/&gt; mathematical subject (including statistical mechanics)&lt;br/&gt; where q-series expansions play a substantial role.  The&lt;br/&gt; fourth topic, The Okada Conjecture, is one that has been open&lt;br/&gt; for many years.  Recently in joint work with Paule and Schneider,&lt;br/&gt; the PI gave a new proof of the q = 1 case of this conjecture.&lt;br/&gt; This new proof clearly suggests that one should be able to &lt;br/&gt; extend it to general q.  The fifth topic, Ramanujan and&lt;br/&gt; Partial Fractions, was suggested by prior attempts to better&lt;br/&gt; understand some of the more recondite formulas in Ramanujan's&lt;br/&gt; Lost Notebook. Great progress has been made in improving&lt;br/&gt; previous work; it is hoped that these methods may be further developed&lt;br/&gt; to elucidate a general theory of mock theta functions.  Section&lt;br/&gt; 6, the final section, concerns the intersection of the PI's research&lt;br/&gt; with his efforts to improve teacher education.  Put succinctly,&lt;br/&gt; it is clear that the theory of compositions (ordered partitions)&lt;br/&gt; could play a much more substantial role in primary and &lt;br/&gt; secondary education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;           This project is devoted to problems in partitions and q-series,&lt;br/&gt;        especially ones that simultaneously (1) advance the central&lt;br/&gt;        theory of this branch of mathematics and (2) have substantial&lt;br/&gt;        potential for application in other branches of mathematics and&lt;br/&gt;        mathematical sciences. The section on partitions and probability&lt;br/&gt;       especially epitomizes this philosophy.  Applications of this&lt;br/&gt;       topic have already been made to cellular automata.  The work&lt;br/&gt;       on Engel Transformations studies an algorithm wherein there are&lt;br/&gt;       potential applications to problems in statistical physics. Work on&lt;br/&gt;       entire functions, partial fractions  and the Okada conejcture&lt;br/&gt;       should develop methods with substantial applications beyond the&lt;br/&gt;       current focus. Section 6, the final section, concerns the&lt;br/&gt;       intersection of research with efforts to improve teacher education.  &lt;br/&gt;      The theory of compositions (ordered partitions) could well &lt;br/&gt;      play a useful auxiliary role in primary and secondary&lt;br/&gt;      education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
