<AbstractNarration>This proposal requests support for a group from Northeastern University to enable software development, phenomenological studies, and data analysis for the Pierre Auger Observatory (PAO).   The PAO, currently collecting its first dataset in Malargue, Argentina, is the largest air-shower array ever constructed. Over the next several years, PAO will collect an unprecedented statistical sample of cosmic rays with energies above 10^19 eV. Consisting of both a ground array and fluorescence detectors, PAO will be in a unique position to confirm or refute HiRes's observation of the GZK cutoff at around 6x10^19 eV and resolve the discrepancy between previous ground array and fluorescence detector spectral results at these energies. The PAO will also obtain high-statistics arrival direction skymaps for particles at these energies, allowing for significantly improved sensitivity in the search for sources of ultra-high energy cosmic rays in the southern celestial hemisphere. The group also plans searches for signatures of supersymmetry and quantum gravity in cosmic ray interactions.&lt;br/&gt;In the Broader Impacts area, this group has started development of a program called the School Cosmic Ray Outreach Detector (SCROD), which has the eventual aim of deploying cosmic ray detectors at area high schools.  No funding support is requested for SCROD, beyond the time of the Northeastern University PAO staff. Funding for individual detectors is being sought from other sources.</AbstractNarration>
