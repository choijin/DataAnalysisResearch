<AbstractNarration>Radiative corrections have played a central role in the development of theoretical&lt;br/&gt;physics since the original successes of Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) in the late&lt;br/&gt;1940's. Their calculation in atoms and ions is technically challenging because of the&lt;br/&gt;complexity of the electron propagator in bound states. Two theoretical tools will&lt;br/&gt;be used in this project to attack this problem. The first, S-matrix theory, is most&lt;br/&gt;applicable to highly charged ions. QED effects are highly enhanced in these ions,&lt;br/&gt;and recent advances in experiment provide a wealth of data sensitive to this physics.&lt;br/&gt;S-matrix theory can be used to systematically calculate radiative corrections in these&lt;br/&gt;ions, provide tests of QED, and possibly uncover new physics through the comparison&lt;br/&gt;of theory and experiment. The existence of an expansion parameter, 1/Z, leads to&lt;br/&gt;the simplification of having to deal with a limited set of Feynman diagrams. A major&lt;br/&gt;part of this work  involves the calculation of these diagrams, which should allow&lt;br/&gt;the above-mentioned tests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In neutral atoms the 1/Z expansion parameter is not available, and precision tests&lt;br/&gt;are much more difficult. A major development of recent years has been the application&lt;br/&gt;of non-relativistic QED (NRQED) to few-electron systems. This technique allows one&lt;br/&gt;to start with the Schroedinger equation, which can be solved with high accuracy for&lt;br/&gt;few-electron atoms. NRQED provides a systematic method to account for relativistic&lt;br/&gt;and QED corrections. Another major component of the proposed research is applica-&lt;br/&gt;tion of this method to the fine structure of helium, where comparison of sufficiently&lt;br/&gt;advanced theory with already existent experiments should allow a determination of&lt;br/&gt;the fine structure constant with high accuracy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, the evaluation of radiative corrections to parity nonconserving (PNC)&lt;br/&gt;processes in heavy neutral atoms is proposed. The earliest particle physics evaluations&lt;br/&gt;of this radiative correction, which involved free propagators, are significantly changed&lt;br/&gt;when bound propagators are used. A full calculation has not yet been carried out,&lt;br/&gt;but work carried out under the previous grant should be generalizable to this complex&lt;br/&gt;task, which has important particle physics implications.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
