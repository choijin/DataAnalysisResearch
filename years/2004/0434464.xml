    <AbstractNarration>The 5th Gordon Research Conference on RNA Editing will be held January 23 to January 28, 2005 in Ventura, CA. This biannual conference is the only regularly scheduled meeting devoted exclusively to RNA editing and RNA modification. The conference will bring together a small group of scientists for five days in a casual setting that fosters informal discussion among participants. To promote crossfertilization between the editing and modification communities, the conference program will be organized in thematic sessions, which will focus on questions of common interest, including: the discovery of important new enzyme forms that catalyze diverse types of editing and modification; identification of the molecular parts of multi-component editing and modifying machines; delineation of critical sequences in target RNAs recognized by editing or modifying enzymes from plants, Physarum, and yeast; unraveling the biosynthesis and subcellular trafficking of various editing and modifying machines; solving the atomic structures of several enzymes; and important new insights into the roles of editing and modification in mediating cellular processes. This conference will provide investigators with a unique opportunity to discuss new hypotheses and models, exchange information about new experimental strategies, generate ideas for future projects, and initiate collaborations. To stimulate new ideas and strategies, several prominent scientists from outside the field will be invited to present their recent groundbreakings studies on similar questions in related systems. A major goal of the conference is to foster education by encouraging the participation of junior scientists.</AbstractNarration>
