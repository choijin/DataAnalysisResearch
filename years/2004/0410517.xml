<AbstractNarration>Mathematical sciences (21) This project is adapting textbook and modular software materials for an applications-focused and technology-intensive course on coding theory and cryptology to help "bridge" the passage of students to more advanced courses in the mathematical sciences. Several sources of learning materials are being drawn from projects at Williams College, the United States Naval Academy, Cornell University, and Rhodes College (originally funded by DUE - 9555113, that led to a published text) with an eye towards attracting students early in their careers to further study in mathematics. The project team involves cooperating faculty at Olin College (a new, gender-balanced engineering college), Babson College (an established business college), Wellesley College (a renowned women's liberal arts college), and Brandeis University (a comprehensive university). In addition to the core mathematical sciences topics, the course is addressing the technical, social, and historical aspects of coding theory and cryptology.  Students are also improving their communication skills through group work and presentations, while broadening their horizons and improving their teaming skills by working with peers from colleges providing very different educational environments.</AbstractNarration>
