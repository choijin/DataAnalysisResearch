<AbstractNarration>This project is continuing a successful computer science, engineering, and mathematics (CSEM) project by awarding 30 scholarships per year to eligible students enrolled in programs in computer information systems, engineering, engineering technology and mathematics.  This project is recruiting participants from among current students majoring in CSEM disciplines and those who have not declared a major, high school seniors, students at local adult schools and through referrals from community agencies.  Emphasis is being placed on the recruitment of students who are members of populations underrepresented in CSEM disciplines.  Selection of scholarship recipients is based on required basic eligibility criteria, coupled with academic achievement and maturity as evidenced by community commitment.  The project is administered through NJCATE, an NSF-ATE funded center of excellence in technician education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This project builds upon the successes of an earlier CSEMS project.  Of the 57 scholarship recipients in that project, 43.9% (25) graduated and are pursuing bachelors' degrees in a CSEM disciplines (as compared to 15.9% for the College).  Additionally, 38.6% (22) are still enrolled and eligible for scholarships.  One-third (19) of the scholarship recipients began as developmental education students who initially were awarded scholarships in escrow.  The college's typical remediation success rate is 50% while that of the scholarship in escrow recipients is 100%. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Specific objectives of the NJCATE Scholars program are to:&lt;br/&gt;(a) increase the enrollment of high-ability, low-income students, particularly those from populations underrepresented in CSEM disciplines. &lt;br/&gt;(b) increase the retention and graduation rates of students in CSEM disciplines. &lt;br/&gt;(c) enhance transfer opportunities for scholarship recipients. &lt;br/&gt;(d) strengthen partnerships between the college and high technology industry to provide students with career experiences and support. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scholars participate in a variety of support activities to enhance retention and success.  Scholarships held in escrow for CSEM majors enrolled in development education coursework encourage persistence to credit courses.  Faculty advising, group meetings, and career and transfer workshops are designed to form the basis of a learning community of scholars that provide mutual support and encouragement.  A seamless web of existing support services will buttress targeted support.  A Steering Committee of faculty and administrators from involved academic and support departments oversee project implementation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  58% of the students supported with the first grant were minority students. This significant increase demonstrates the impact of financial assistance coupled with targeted support in encouraging the enrollment and success of students from underrepresented populations in CSEM disciplines. Additionally, financial need is often a strong barrier to completion of degrees among students from both minority and majority populations.  Scholarship support reduces the need for outside employment and enables students to focus more intently on studies, reducing the time for degree completion. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
