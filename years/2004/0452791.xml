<AbstractNarration>The researchers propose to use a unique data set, the Survey of International Air Travelers (SIAT),&lt;br/&gt;that will make possible the doctoral dissertation of the co-PI on the subject of the interaction of&lt;br/&gt;international trade with international travel. The SIAT covers all overseas air travel from the&lt;br/&gt;U. S., by destination country, purpose of trip, and characteristics of the travelers including&lt;br/&gt;country of residence. These data are available quarterly for the period 1993 to the present.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit. In her dissertation the co-PI will use the SIAT to investigate at least&lt;br/&gt;three topics. First, the direction of causality between trade and travel will be examined. Using&lt;br/&gt;appropriate panel estimation techniques, it will be determined whether bilateral business travel&lt;br/&gt;helps to forecast bilateral trade and vice-versa. Second, the dissertation will explore the&lt;br/&gt;mechanisms that underlie the increasingly well-established positive relationship between&lt;br/&gt;immigration and bilateral trade. The interactions between immigrant stocks and bilateral&lt;br/&gt;business and leisure travel by immigrants will be estimated for both U.S. exports and U.S.&lt;br/&gt;imports. The hypothesis will be tested that the interaction with leisure travel will be stronger&lt;br/&gt;relative to the interaction with business travel for bilateral imports than for bilateral exports.&lt;br/&gt;This would confirm the conjecture in the literature that the stronger impact of immigrants on&lt;br/&gt;imports than exports reflects the effect of immigrant taste for goods from their countries of origin&lt;br/&gt;over and above their promotion of trade through business contacts and provision of market&lt;br/&gt;information. Third, the co-PI will use the SIAT to extend recent results showing that business&lt;br/&gt;and social networks have a stronger positive impact on bilateral trade in differentiated than&lt;br/&gt;homogeneous products. It has been conjectured that these results reflect the more informationintensive&lt;br/&gt;nature of differentiated products. If this is true than differentiated products should&lt;br/&gt;require both greater sales effort and more after-sales service, and we expect to find stronger&lt;br/&gt;causal relationships running from bilateral business travel to bilateral trade and vice-versa for&lt;br/&gt;differentiated than for homogeneous products.&lt;br/&gt;Because the SIAT is an unknown data set and we were concerned about its quality, the PI's&lt;br/&gt;obtained a small seed grant and purchased data for the first quarter of 2000 for the purpose of&lt;br/&gt;preliminary testing. The PI's added bilateral business travel to a standard cross-sectional gravity&lt;br/&gt;model of bilateral U.S. trade. If bilateral business travel had no explanatory power it would&lt;br/&gt;augur poorly for the usefulness of the full SIAT data set. In fact, the PI's found that bilateral business&lt;br/&gt;travel has a strong positive association with both U.S. bilateral exports and bilateral imports,&lt;br/&gt;especially the former. These preliminary results are a positive indicator for the quality of the&lt;br/&gt;SIAT data and suggest there is much insight to be gained from use of the complete data set.&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts. The qualitative nature and quantitative importance of informal barriers&lt;br/&gt;to international trade remains an important question in international economics. The study will&lt;br/&gt;help to gain a better understanding of how informal barriers to trade work and how large they&lt;br/&gt;are. By quantifying the extent to which international business travel causes international trade,&lt;br/&gt;the study could also help to evaluate the many government programs worldwide that promote&lt;br/&gt;business travel for the purpose of creating trade, including trade missions sponsored by the U.S.&lt;br/&gt;Department of Commerce.</AbstractNarration>
