    <AbstractNarration>0436073&lt;br/&gt;Davidow&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Americas Program award will provide support for the travel of science journalists from the Americas to attend the Jack Ealy Workshop on Science Journalism. This award will support six professionals, three from the U.S. and three from Latin America. The Workshop, to be held July 10-21, 2004, in San Diego, will provide 15 to 20 experienced Spanish-language journalists training in science reporting through practical workshops and presentations by several NSF-supported scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop is designed to advance scientific understanding across the Americas by means of the broader dissemination of scientific and engineering discoveries through the Spanish-language media. The goal of furthering and enhancing public understanding of and appreciation for science and technology in the Latin American and Caribbean regions is a workshop objective. A second objective aims to improve the communication of science and technology at the postgraduate level. The activity will join science journalism professionals with over 40 leading scientists to create a partnership between the leading professional association of journalists in the region, a prestigious think tank on Latin America and four outstanding research institutions. Partners will include the Inter-American Press Association, the Institute of the Americas, UC San Diego, the Center for Scientific Investigation and Education of Ensenada (Mexico), the NSF-supported OptIPuter project, and the California Institute of Information and Telecommunications Technology. It is expected that the scientists' research will be disseminated in the U.S. and Latin America through stories filed during and after the program, enhancing scientific and technological understanding by policy makers, the young, and researchers in North and South America. The Office of Legislative and Public Affairs and the Office of International Science and Engineering are jointly supporting this award.</AbstractNarration>
