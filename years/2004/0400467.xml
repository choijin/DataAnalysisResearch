<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;This is a mathematical research project on core models and their fine&lt;br/&gt;structure, which is a subfield of set theory that was pioneered by Jensen.&lt;br/&gt;Core models are generalizations of Goedel's constructible universe, L,&lt;br/&gt;that arose in the the study of large cardinal axioms. The field today&lt;br/&gt;builds on the fundamental discoveries of Dodd, Jensen, Martin, Mitchell,&lt;br/&gt;Steel and Woodin. The project is on pure core model theory as well as its&lt;br/&gt;interactions with other areas, such as descriptive set theory and&lt;br/&gt;infinitary combinatorics. Several of the research problems are on&lt;br/&gt;combinatorial principles such as Diamond and Square, which were isolated&lt;br/&gt;by Jensen in his work on L. They are among the most commonly used tools in&lt;br/&gt;set theoretic constructions and have applications in neighboring fields&lt;br/&gt;such as model theory and topology.  Other research problems have their&lt;br/&gt;origins outside of core model theory. These include open questions about&lt;br/&gt;descriptive set theory, forcing, singular cardinal combinatorics and&lt;br/&gt;cardinal invariants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The axioms of set theory are the foundation of mathematics. Core model&lt;br/&gt;theory addresses some of the most fundamental questions in set theory in&lt;br/&gt;direct and highly sophisticated ways. Ideas are constantly exchanged&lt;br/&gt;between core model theory and other parts of set theory.  The research&lt;br/&gt;problems to be addressed in this project are central in these respects.  &lt;br/&gt;Some ask for further development of the basic tools of core model theory,&lt;br/&gt;while others are about applications to neighboring fields.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
