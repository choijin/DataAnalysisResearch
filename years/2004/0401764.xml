<AbstractNarration>The Summer Undergraduate Mathematical Science Research Institute (SUMSRI) is a program conducted under the guidance of Miami University's Department of Mathematics and Statistics. One of the goals of  SUMSRI is to prepare participants for the rigor and pace of graduate school. The primary goal of the Institute is to provide approximately 15 nationally selected students with an intensive research experience augmented by formal and informal information sessions. To accomplish these goals, SUMSRI will run seven weeks on Miami University's campus in Oxford, Ohio. During these seven weeks, students will participate in research seminars in mathematics, statistics, or computer science. The program will also include a technical writing seminar, a GRE preparation workshop, two short courses on algebra and real analysis, and colloquium talks given by well known mathematical scientists. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; In 1998, the NSF sponsored a study to discover what areas could be identified that could explain the low number of minorities with advanced degrees in the mathematical sciences.  The results of this study were published in the article, "The Human Capital Liabilities of Underrepresented Minorities in Pursuit of Science, Mathematics and Engineering Doctoral Degrees". This study points out that African Americans and Hispanics lag far behind their white male peers in three areas of Human Capital including background characteristics, undergraduate performance and experience, and the preparation and transition into graduate school.  A recent survey conducted by Dr. John Alexander and Dr. William A. Hawkins titled "Survey of Minority Graduate Students in U.S. Mathematical Sciences Departments," recommends creating programs like SUMSRI to encourage minority undergraduate students to pursue advanced degrees in the mathematical sciences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because of the shortage of minorities and women mathematical scientists, the program is especially interested in, but not limited to, African Americans and other underrepresented minorities and women.  The combination of information, educational experiences and ongoing support is designed to encourage these talented mathematics and statistics students to continue and thrive in the mathematical research environment and thereby eventually increase the number of African Americans and other underrepresented minorities with doctoral degrees in the mathematical sciences. Information about the program can be found on their website, http://www.units.muohio.edu/sumsri/. The website includes an online journal of participants' results.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
