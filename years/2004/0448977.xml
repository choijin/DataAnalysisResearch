    <AbstractNarration>This conference on learning and memory (April 20-24, 2005) will bring together researchers interested in understanding common mechanisms of information acquisition and storage. Projects will be discussed covering synaptic plasticity and memory across invertebrate and vertebrate systems. Young scientists, woman, and minorities will be recruited to participate. The meeting will include platform and poster presentations, and discussions of current research and concepts. Sessions will cover not only invertebrates and vertebrates, but also in vivo and in vitro approaches, raging from cellular molecular to systems approaches.&lt;br/&gt; The impact of this conference will extend to numerous fields of study that are interested in computational models and cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying plasticity and learning. Prior meetings of a similar nature have been held at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory almost every other year since 1992. However, the present conference will be unique in that it will integrate across levels, paradigms and preparations to characterize the cognitive aspects of learning and memory using biochemical, molecular, behavioral, and electrophysiological analyses that induce plasticity and learning. The meeting will include approximately 200 scientists from the US and around the world.</AbstractNarration>
