<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the project is to develop a new combinatorial and&lt;br/&gt;probabilistic approach to geometric functional analysis and its&lt;br/&gt;applications. Some of new major ideas are expected to come from the&lt;br/&gt;concept of the combinatorial dimension, which is a general form of the&lt;br/&gt;classical Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension. Arising from logic, probability&lt;br/&gt;theory and computer science, the use of the combinatorial dimension&lt;br/&gt;looks very promising also in a wide range of areas including geometric&lt;br/&gt;functional analysis (finding nice sections of convex bodies), convex&lt;br/&gt;geometry (study of polytopes), discrete geometry (counting integer&lt;br/&gt;points and cells in sets) and extremal combinatorics. This new&lt;br/&gt;combinatorial and probabilistic method is aimed at one of the hardest&lt;br/&gt;problems in the theory of empirical processes - describe the classes of&lt;br/&gt;functions for which the Central Limit Theorem holds uniformly. New&lt;br/&gt;aspects of the celebrated concentration of measure phenomenon will also&lt;br/&gt;be studied by a combination of probabilistic and purely geometric ideas.&lt;br/&gt;This might give an insight into relationships between random and&lt;br/&gt;deterministic structures in geometric functional analysis, as well as a&lt;br/&gt;new view of local versus global asymptotic convex geometries.&lt;br/&gt;Probabilistic approach will also be developed for problems of finding&lt;br/&gt;nice submatrices of large matrices, which arise in functional and&lt;br/&gt;harmonic analysis as well as in computer science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project opens new connections between functional analysis,&lt;br/&gt;combinatorics, probability, convex geometry and applied mathematics. The&lt;br/&gt;celebrated "probabilistic method" along with deterministic&lt;br/&gt;combinatorial, geometric and analytic methods will merge into one&lt;br/&gt;machinery, which may expand our knowledge on the&lt;br/&gt;relationships between chaos and pattern that arise in a variety of&lt;br/&gt;high-dimensional structures in pure mathematics and in computer science.&lt;br/&gt; From the practical point of view, the results expected from this machinery&lt;br/&gt;include justification of algorithms in machine learning, development of&lt;br/&gt;algorithms for storage of large amounts of data and for data&lt;br/&gt;transmission (such as error correction codes).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
