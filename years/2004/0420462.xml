<AbstractNarration> Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Development of Structure and Material Laboratories for Engineering and Technology Programs&lt;br/&gt;at Alabama A&amp;M University&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will allow Alabama A&amp;M University (AAMU) to acquire a state-of-the-art equipment and associated instrumentation to increase access and promote research, research training, and integrated research/education activities primarily in the area of civil infrastructure and Mechanical engineering.  The requested equipment will support activities that are in line with the research and educational goals of the University. The new state-of-the-art structural engineering research/education laboratories and the integrated testing system will benefit students and faculty in the Civil Engineering Technology , Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering Technology, Electrical Engineering, Electrical Engineering Technology as well as students and faculty from other academic departments such as Physics and Agriculture. Faculty in these departments are actively pursuing and conducting interdisciplinary research projects and have been successful in obtaining the support of private industry as well as state and federal agencies. The primary areas of research, research training, and educational activities that will be supported by the equipment are: (i) structural testing of components and subassemblies; (ii) earthquake engineering and smart structures; (iii) use of advanced materials and FRP composites in civil engineering; (iv) structural health monitoring of civil infrastructure, (v) Safety and security of critical civil infrastructure for homeland security,  (vi) use nanotechnology in civil infrastructure, and (vii) health monitoring of mechanical and aerospace structures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The equipment and instrumentation consists of: (1) two hydraulic actuators, Model 244.51 (220 kips each for the structures laboratory) with servocontrolled valves capable of static, fatigue and dynamic testing; (2) hydraulic service manifolds and hydraulic power pumps; (3) electronic control system; and, (4) high-capacity data acquisition system unit; (5) one MTS 810 Material Testing Machine for the Materials laboratory, Model 318.25B-01 with a load capability of 55 kN (55 kips).  The MTS 810 Material Testing machine is capable of static tensile and compression tests,  fatigue  and  bending  tests.    The MTS 810  is  comprised  of  a  load  unit  assembly  frame,  a  digital  controller,  a hydraulic power unit, a remote station control panel and a desktop computer. &lt;br/&gt;            &lt;br/&gt;The acquisition of the equipment in this project will allow the implementation of materials and structures demonstrations,  teaching  and  research  laboratories.  The  laboratories  will  feature  experimental  testing,  data acquisition and simulation systems to conduct planned tests.  Students will also improve both their creativity and analytical thinking.  More than seventeen (17) courses will be affected by the implementation of the laboratories in addition  to  individual  students  working  on  their  senior  project.      With  the  AAMU  School  of  Engineering  and Technology.s new facility in place and in combination with the proposed equipment, AAMU will be in a position to offer  fully  functional  facilities  that  will  enable  its  faculty,  graduate  and  undergraduate  students  to  carry  out significant research and educational activities that address the nation.s needs.  Additionally, the newly constructed and equipped laboratories will enable AAMU to attract significant corporate and government research funding and draw a larger number of graduate and undergraduate African-American students to pursue careers in engineering and technology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
