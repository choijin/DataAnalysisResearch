<AbstractNarration>REU site: BACHE-REU Scholarship Program in Computer Science&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program, BACHE-REU Scholarship in Computer Science, is designed to&lt;br/&gt;provide undergraduate research opportunities to full-time students attending any of the&lt;br/&gt;five member institutions in the Birmingham Area Consortium of Higher Education.&lt;br/&gt;The five institutions are Birmingham-Southern College, Miles College, Samford&lt;br/&gt;University, the University of Montevallo, and the University of Alabama in Birmingham.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The BACHE REU-CS program is a year-long experience in which&lt;br/&gt;participants are selected from BACHE institutions to take part in projects designed by&lt;br/&gt;faculty researchers from within the BACHE consortium. Each participating institution&lt;br/&gt;will have an assigned faculty coordinator who will publicize the project on his/her&lt;br/&gt;campus. Fourteen students will be selected by acommittee of faculty mentors based on&lt;br/&gt;compatible interest and skills outlined in available projects. Accepted Scholars will&lt;br/&gt;spend up to 10 hours per week for theacademic year and full time during the summer&lt;br/&gt;learning a wide variety of disciplines and approaches. The students will participate in &lt;br/&gt;weekly journal club meetings and monthly research-in-progress meetings. In addition, &lt;br/&gt;the students will present their work in an inter-institutional symposium.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;The primary goal of this program is to give BACHE REU - CS&lt;br/&gt;scholars the experience and confidence to pursue graduate study in computer science.&lt;br/&gt;Several factors shape the design of this program. 1) While all BACHE institutions offer&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate computer science and/or management information system majors, only&lt;br/&gt;the University of Alabama in Birmingham offers graduate study in Computer Science.&lt;br/&gt;This program will increase the research opportunities for students attending&lt;br/&gt;Birmingham-Southern College, Miles, Samford, and the University of Montevallo. 2)&lt;br/&gt;BACHE institutions represent a wide range of student profiles: Samford and&lt;br/&gt;Birmingham-Southern College students are generally upper middle class or affluent,&lt;br/&gt;UAB has a large first-generation college student and international representation, Miles&lt;br/&gt;is an historically black institution, and Montevallo is a state-supported liberal arts&lt;br/&gt;institution. Interaction between faculty and students from such disparate institutions will&lt;br/&gt;be of great benefit to all concerned, and will respond to the NSF's stated goal of&lt;br/&gt;increasing research participation by underrepresented constituencies.</AbstractNarration>
