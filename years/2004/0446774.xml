<AbstractNarration>The English in Singapore is not a single uniform entity; rather there is a well-documented range of Singapore Englishes.  At one end of the spectrum lies Standard Singapore English (SSE), a variety grammatically similar to other standard varieties of English, which is used in formal settings such as educational institutions and the media; at the other end lies Colloquial Singapore English (CSE), an informal variety spoken among friends and family, which is markedly different from the standard.  Individuals command different ranges of this spectrum, and shift among the varieties they command according to setting, topic, and audience.  A variety of linguistic features are involved in differentiating these varieties, including phonological variables like the deletion of final stops and grammatical characteristics like the use of the third singular -s suffix on present tense verbs.  Under the direction of Prof. Gregory Guy, Ms. Laureen Lim will investigate the constraints on these variable processes for her doctoral dissertation, in order to develop a dynamic analysis of the linguistic repertoire evident both in an individual and across the speech community.  This research project will study the ways in which Chinese Singaporeans from English-medium schools vary their speech in sociolinguistic and ethnographic interviews. The question that arises in the face of such diversity is whether to treat these varieties as different styles within a single language, or as more analogous to distinct languages.  Linguistic work on other linguistically complex societies presents several models that are potentially relevant: alternation between different languages (code-switching, bilingualism), alternation between High and Low varieties of one language (diglossia), and stylistic variation within one language.  Which of these models is appropriate when speakers vary between SSE and CSE?  Can the variation in Singapore English be properly characterized using monolingual communities as a model?  If these two varieties have distinct language rules representing two mental grammars, would a bilingual framework be more applicable?  Or, does Singapore English represent a new synthesis for the analysis of linguistic variation? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Situated in a context of explicit language planning and ideology, Singapore offers the sociolinguist a multilingual environment in which this unique variety of English can be studied.  Our investigation into the variation both within a speaker and across speakers will enable us to shed light as to which theoretical model most aptly captures the pattern of variation in Singapore English.  In doing so, we will complement existing theories of language variation.  The proposed research more broadly informs language education practices in Singapore, currently influenced by a general stigmatization of CSE.  By demonstrating that CSE usage is found among individuals who also command SSE, this research supports an alternative practice valuing such linguistic diversity, by showing that competence in CSE need not interfere with the acquisition of a standard variety.  In fact, speakers who command both resourcefully adapt their choice of variety to the social situation.  Such linguistic flexibility may be valued as enhanced social capital, reinforcing national identity and solidarity.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
