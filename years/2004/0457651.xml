<AbstractNarration>The PI  will study interactions between operator algebras and conformal field theories which have proved to be very fruitful lately. The main emphasis of this research is placed on the study of &lt;br/&gt;certain representation theory questions such as Kac-Wakimoto conjecture, orbifolds and boundary states in  conformal field theories  using operator algebraic techniques.   The applications  of these operator algebraic techniques will lead to proofs of representation theory questions and shed lights on exotic subfactors such as those coming from  conformal inclusions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theory of operator algebras was introduced by John von Neumann  in order to provide a proper mathematical framework for Quantum  Mechanics. Conformal field theory  was a theory &lt;br/&gt;describing  critical phenomena in condensed matter physics, and it also plays an important role in &lt;br/&gt;string theory. The remarkable interactions between operator algebras and conformal field theory has  led to many interesting mathematical issues.  The aim of this research is to find solutions to some of  the important mathematical issues that  surface in this context which have a wide range of  applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
