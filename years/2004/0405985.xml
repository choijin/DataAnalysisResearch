<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  We propose to study the dynamics of smooth diffeomorphisms of low&lt;br/&gt;  dimensional manifolds.  A significant theme here is the study of the&lt;br/&gt;  abundance of homoclinic tangencies and its effects. It has been&lt;br/&gt;  known for some time that homoclinic tangencies produce interesting&lt;br/&gt;  phenomena. They form an obstruction to structural stability, and have&lt;br/&gt;  a profound influence on bifurcations phenomena. While most of the&lt;br/&gt;  information we have about homoclinic tangencies may be considered&lt;br/&gt;  negative in regard to our ability to understand the underlying&lt;br/&gt;  dynamics, recently we obtained a positive result: generically they&lt;br/&gt;  lead to topologically transitive sets of maximal Hausdorff&lt;br/&gt;  dimension. One part of the current proposal involves understanding&lt;br/&gt;  the relation between these maximal dimension sets and Lebesgue&lt;br/&gt;  asymptotic measures. These are measures obtained by taking weak&lt;br/&gt;  limits of the averages of the iterates of measures which are&lt;br/&gt;  absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure.  Recently we&lt;br/&gt;  have shown that in many dissipative cases SRB measures on surfaces&lt;br/&gt;  only exist on uniformly hyperbolic attractors.  We wish to extend&lt;br/&gt;  this to area preserving cases and to make progress on the conjecture&lt;br/&gt;  that generically in highly smooth systems  a non-Anosov area preserving&lt;br/&gt;  diffeomorphism of a surface has metric entropy zero. Another&lt;br/&gt;  question we will consider is whether the Henon family &lt;br/&gt;   has no SRB measure for a residual set of&lt;br/&gt;  parameters. It is a celebrated result of Benedicks-Carleson&lt;br/&gt;  and Benedicks-Young that SRB measures exist for a positive Lebesgue&lt;br/&gt;  measure set of parameters.  In addition to the above, we will study&lt;br/&gt;  various questions on the existence of symbolic extensions in smooth&lt;br/&gt;  systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  We propose to study aspects of the orbit structure of non-linear&lt;br/&gt;  smooth dynamical systems.  Our particular emphasis will be on three&lt;br/&gt;  dimensional systems whose orbits return infinitely often to an&lt;br/&gt;  embedded transverse surface.  These systems occur in models which&lt;br/&gt;  arise in many fields of science from Biology to Physics and even&lt;br/&gt;  Economics. For instance, they include the problems of general forced&lt;br/&gt;  oscillations and the Newtoninan motion of three bodies in a plane.&lt;br/&gt;  Considering the so-called first return map to the embedded surface&lt;br/&gt;  we are led to study the iterations of smooth transformations&lt;br/&gt;  (mappings) of a surface to itself.  There are special motions called&lt;br/&gt;  homoclinic motions (first discovered and named by Poincare in the&lt;br/&gt;  three body problem) which are known to produce a rich, interesting,&lt;br/&gt;  and complicated orbit structure.  In particular, typical homoclinic&lt;br/&gt;  motions imply the existence of infinitely many unstable periodic&lt;br/&gt;  orbits and other orbits which behave in an erratic and unpredictable&lt;br/&gt;  way.  It is now known that in many cases such systems can be studied&lt;br/&gt;  by comparing them to statistical objects such as the random flipping&lt;br/&gt;  of a weighted coin.  This gives rise to so-called "symbolic models"&lt;br/&gt;  whose orbit structure can be understood.  Our research concerns the&lt;br/&gt;  types of symbolic systems which can occur in modeling various smooth&lt;br/&gt;  systems.  including the estimation of certain numerical quantities&lt;br/&gt;  called "entropy" and "dimension" which can be used to quantify&lt;br/&gt;  different levels of complicated motion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
