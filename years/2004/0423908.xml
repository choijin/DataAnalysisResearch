<AbstractNarration>0423908&lt;br/&gt;Wang&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research are as follows: 1) Investigate novel granular high permeability (high-m) materials, namely Co-Fe-Hf-O with a saturation magnetization of m0Ms &gt; 1.0 Tesla and a high resistivity of &gt;1000 mWcm, which will enable suppression of eddy current losses and efficient inductor designs. 2) Investigate fundamental mechanisms controlling the magnetic anisotropy in granular high-m materials, which is largely neglected but critical to inductor performance. 3) Design and fabricate integrated inductor structures which will truly unleash the power of high-m materials at a frequency of &gt; 200 MHz. 4) Educate graduate students and undergraduates about integrated inductor technology via doctoral thesis research, research experience for under graduate (REU), and classroom teaching.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts resulting from the proposed activity include: 1) The discovery made in this research would enable miniaturization of power delivery and wireless communication devices, and many other microelectronics applications. 2) The PI has established close collaborations with Intel and HGST to allow a speedy technology transfer to the commercial sector. 3) He has collaborations with researchers in Japan and the Netherlands to make an international impact. 4) The proposed research thrust at Stanford has hosted three undergraduate researchers (one female) in the past two years and can be expected to outreach to more undergraduate students in the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
