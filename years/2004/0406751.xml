<AbstractNarration>In order to overcome deficiencies in geodynamics software, the geophysics&lt;br/&gt;community has been formulating a plan for Computational Infrastructure for&lt;br/&gt;Geodynamics (CIG), whose purpose will be to leverage the current state of the art in&lt;br/&gt;scientific computing into a suite of toolkits and codes that serve the greater geodynamics&lt;br/&gt;community from pure modelers to users of existing models. The emphasis is on&lt;br/&gt;developing toolkits that ease model development and foster the interchange of ideas and&lt;br/&gt;algorithms. If successful, this effort promises to revolutionize the way our community&lt;br/&gt;computes by providing tools and services that allow us to focus more on the science and&lt;br/&gt;less on the science-neutral parts of high-performance computation. The goal is to&lt;br/&gt;empower a larger community of students, researchers, educators with the tools for&lt;br/&gt;quantitative hypothesis testing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to continue to broaden participation from the geophysics community as the&lt;br/&gt;vision for and structure of CIG are finalized and the proposal to fund it are prepared, we&lt;br/&gt;propose to hold a workshop, open to the entire community January 16-17, 2004. By&lt;br/&gt;holding the workshop at this time we are hoping to strike a balance between our desire to&lt;br/&gt;maintain momentum in the CIG initiative with the need for continued engagement with&lt;br/&gt;the community. Our objective is for participants to expend as little time as possible&lt;br/&gt;traveling to the workshop venue. It is for this reason that we propose to hold the two-day&lt;br/&gt;workshop in a hotel with appropriate conference facilities immediately adjacent to the&lt;br/&gt;Los Angeles International Airport (LAX). Our hope is to have about 50 scientists at the&lt;br/&gt;workshop with the majority of the participants spread through the computational&lt;br/&gt;geodynamics community in such a way that we maintain balance between the various sub&lt;br/&gt;disciplines as well as between junior and senior scientists. In addition, we also plan to&lt;br/&gt;invite members of the computer science and computational science communities who we&lt;br/&gt;hope to engage in our planning. Their participation will allow the geophysics participants&lt;br/&gt;to better understand how they can take advantage of advances in information technology&lt;br/&gt;and computational science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The broader impacts of this workshop are likely to be substantial. We&lt;br/&gt;believe that this workshop will allow the geophysics community to come together in a&lt;br/&gt;final push to advance CIG. CIG will likely alter geophysics by strengthening the&lt;br/&gt;infrastructure available to all researchers. CIG will also substantially alter the way&lt;br/&gt;graduate students in computational geophysics are trained in the US.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
