<AbstractNarration>This grant supports theoretical research on quantum gases.  Topics include strongly interacting Fermi gases, quantum gases with large angular momentum, and the dynamics of spin-one and spin-two Bose gases.  These studies are directly related to current experiments in this interdisciplinary field.  At the same time, this research explores new directions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The projects address three fundamental issues in quantum gases: effect of strong interactions; destruction of Bose condensates due to large degeneracy; and quantum dynamics of bosons with internal degrees of freedom.  The projects on Fermi gases focus on the effect of strong interaction on the ground state properties of the systems, the signature of superfluidity in the strongly interacting regime, and the new superfluid phases of molecular condensates with finite angular momentum.  The projects on fast rotating Bose gases study the breakdown of superfluidity due to large orbital degeneracy, the signature of strongly correlated ground states, and the emergence of new quantum Hall states in various environments.  The projects on spin-one and spin-two Bose gases investigates the validity of mean-field dynamics and the general properties of quantum (non-mean-field) dynamics.  All of these projects aim at advancing our conceptual understanding of the fundamental properties of quantum gases.  While exploring the properties of quantum gases under current experimental conditions, they also explore possible new phases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students and postdoctoral associates will participate in these studies.  These projects will provide solid training in many different areas including condensed matter physics, atomic physics and quantum optics.  Collaborations have been established in Europe, Japan and China.&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;This grant supports theoretical research on the properties of gases of ultracold atoms.  This area of research is at the intersection between condensed matter physics and atomic physics.  The experimental verification of the so-called Bose-Einstein condensation has resulted in two recent Nobel prizes.  While research into these gases is challenging and fruitful in its own right, studies of these gases provide unique insight into properties of condensed phase systems.  The research provides an excellent training for students.&lt;br/&gt;***   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
