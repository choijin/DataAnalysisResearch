<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;Proposal DMS 0400718&lt;br/&gt;Title: Calculus of variations in L-infinity, fully nonlinear&lt;br/&gt;subelliptic equations in Carnot groups, analysis of biharmonic and&lt;br/&gt;harmonic maps&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: Changyou Wang, University of Kentucky&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal consists of problems in four main areas. In part 1,&lt;br/&gt;the PI plans to continue his study on analytic issues of calculus&lt;br/&gt;of variations in L-infinity consisting of the relation between absolute&lt;br/&gt;minimizers of L-infinity functionals and viscosity solutions of their&lt;br/&gt;Aronsson-Euler equations which are fully nonlinear degenerate pdes,&lt;br/&gt;and uniqueness of viscosity of Aronsson-Euler equations. In part 2,&lt;br/&gt;based on his recent works on uniqueness of viscosity solutions to&lt;br/&gt;the subelliptic infinity-Laplace equation on Carnot groups, the PI&lt;br/&gt;aims to establish the comparison principle for fully nonlinear&lt;br/&gt;subelliptic pdes including subelliptic Isaas-Bellman&lt;br/&gt;equations and horizontal Hessian equations on Carnot-Caratheodory spaces.&lt;br/&gt;In part 3, the PI plans to further study partial regularity of&lt;br/&gt;stationary biharmonic maps such as the optimal size and possible&lt;br/&gt;structures of the singular set of biharmonic maps and the heat flow&lt;br/&gt;of biharmonic maps in four dimension and its applications.&lt;br/&gt;In part 4, the PI plans to continue his study on weak&lt;br/&gt;sequential compactness and energy quantization of harmonic maps&lt;br/&gt;and the heat flows of harmonic maps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed problems lie in the field of nonlinear pdes which&lt;br/&gt;provide basic laws and play crucial roles in studying problems&lt;br/&gt;from analysis, geometry, applied sciences. Variational problems of&lt;br/&gt;supernorm are not only mathematically important but also of&lt;br/&gt;great practical interests. There are many problems from control&lt;br/&gt;mechanisms, risk managements in operation research, extreme value&lt;br/&gt;engineering where one must design for the worst case&lt;br/&gt;(e.g. determine a control to minimize the cost functional which is the&lt;br/&gt;maximum of a function). On the other hand, since supremum norm&lt;br/&gt;functionals lack strong differentiability and their associated pdes&lt;br/&gt;are degenerate fully nonlinear equations, many new techniques must be&lt;br/&gt;developed for the study. Underlying many physical phenomena is a least&lt;br/&gt;energy principle where certain configurations or geometric shape are&lt;br/&gt;distinguished by having less energy or area than competing objects.&lt;br/&gt;The nonlinear target constraints often lead to singularities. For example,&lt;br/&gt;domain walls in magnetized materials, point, curve, and surface&lt;br/&gt;defects in various liquid crystal materials, and vortices in&lt;br/&gt;superconductivity. We need to develop new mathematical structures&lt;br/&gt;and theories in order to explain and predict such phenomena. The&lt;br/&gt;proposed study on harmonic maps and biharmonic maps is certainly&lt;br/&gt;motivated by these considerations. The research findings in these&lt;br/&gt;directions shall be very important to our knowledge of second (or higher)&lt;br/&gt;order nonlinear elliptic systems with borderline nonlinearities&lt;br/&gt;and many potential applications as well.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
