<AbstractNarration>Fiber-Reinforced Polymer (FRP) composites, used in various applications and environments, are often chosen over conventional materials for their durability. In cold temperatures, especially, designers expect longer lifetimes and lower maintenance for FRP composites as compared to conventional materials. However, the performance of FRP composites can be adversely affected by environment. For applications in civil infrastructure, for example, stiffness and strength degradation can be aggravated by deposits from road-salts in addition to moisture induced swelling and drying from freeze-thaw. The implications of such effects for long-term performance and design must be well understood for successful implementation of FRP composites at very cold temperatures.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed objectives are:&lt;br/&gt;1. Define the state of the art with regards to behavior and prediction of performance of FRP composites at very cold temperatures&lt;br/&gt;2. Identify gaps in the knowledge base regarding behavior and prediction&lt;br/&gt;3. Stimulate ideas for research and collaboration based on the existing knowledge base of FRP composites and other materials at very cold temperatures&lt;br/&gt;4. Draft an integrated research plan for performance and design of FRP composites at very cold temperatures&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the proposed workshop lies in the bringing together of researchers with diverse expertise and the integration of knowledge in different topic areas to advance the state of the art. The study of the performance and design of FRP composites at very cold temperatures spans materials engineering, manufacturing, predictive modeling, and reliability-based measures for incorporation into design procedures. The PI has a good plan to identify the right people.&lt;br/&gt;In the area of broader impacts, the workshop will benefit society through improved application of FRP composites at cold temperatures, where the benefits of FRP over conventional materials can be fully realized.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
