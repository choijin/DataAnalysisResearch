<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0407583&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Craig R. Guilbault, Fredric D. Ancel,&lt;br/&gt;Dennis J. Garrity, Frederick Tinsley, Gerard A. Venema&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides partial support for active research&lt;br/&gt;mathematicians and graduate students participating in three&lt;br/&gt;meetings in an ongoing series of workshops on geometric topology.&lt;br/&gt;The 2004 workshop will be held in Milwaukee, Wisconsin at the&lt;br/&gt;University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee, with Peter Teichner of the&lt;br/&gt;University of California, San Diego as principal speaker.  The&lt;br/&gt;2005 workshop will be take place at Colorado College in Colorado&lt;br/&gt;Springs, Colorado and the 2006 meeting will be hosted by Oregon&lt;br/&gt;State University in Corvallis, Oregon.  &lt;br/&gt;These workshops are designed to focus on recent work, reported by&lt;br/&gt;one of its leading investigators, and to provide a serious but&lt;br/&gt;informal research atmosphere in which graduate students can meet&lt;br/&gt;and learn from others in geometric topology.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An additional component of this award supports work to edit,&lt;br/&gt;type, and distribute several unpublished works of longtime&lt;br/&gt;workshop participant Bob Edwards.  These important contributions&lt;br/&gt;to topology include seminal work on double suspensions of&lt;br/&gt;homology spheres and approximations of cell-like maps by&lt;br/&gt;homeomorphisms, and will be posted on the workshop Web pages as a&lt;br/&gt;step toward more formal publication.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
