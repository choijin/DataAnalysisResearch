<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title:  Gravimetric Analyzer to Gas Sorption Studies&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:  CTS-0417861&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Eva Marand&lt;br/&gt;Institution:  Virginia Polytechnic Institution and State University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this proposal is to secure funding for the purchase of an IGA Gravimetric Analyzer, which would enable the PI to accurately measure the magnitude and dynamics of gas and vapor sorption in nano-composite membranes. Such sorption information would complement permeation data already obtainable in the laboratory with an existing constant-volume permeation apparatus. Together, these two separate experiments would allow the PI to discern the transport mechanism in nano-composite membranes, thus promoting a fundamental understanding of gas transport in heterogeneous materials and permitting efficient design of nano-composite membranes for specific applications. Research projects, which would directly benefit from the acquisition of the gravimetric analyzer, include the development and characterization of polymer/zeolite mixed matrix materials, polymer/nano-layer-aluminophosphate and polymer/carbon nanotube composite membranes for gas separation applications, as well as polymer/silsesquioxane nanocomposites, for applications in sensors, membranes and catalysis. These are multi-investigator projects, involving Virginia Tech faculty as well as faculty from other institutions, all of whom would have access to this instrument. In terms of the broader impacts, the availability of a gravimetric analyzer would promote the various educational and outreach activities, which are associated with these research projects.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
