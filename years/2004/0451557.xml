    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The REU site is headquartered at New Mexico State University's Chile Pepper Institute. The Agricultural Science Summer Undergraduate Research Education and Development (ASSURED) accepts 10 students from farm worker families for an ten-week period in the summer. The program's goal is to have under-represented first generation college students from immigrant farm labor families expand their appreciation of agricultural science in a university, research-rich context. Students work with a faculty mentor to develop their own research projects within an existing mentor's research project. These projects have included genetics, breeding, plant physiology, insect control, economics, weed control, agricultural engineering, etc. Weekly group meetings, workshops, and lectures cover development of scientific inquiry, ethical conduct in research, career awareness, etc. Student participants are required to make an oral presentation, a poster presentation and write a research paper on their research results. Some students will have the opportunity to continue their project during the academic year. Research opportunities for students with disabilities are eligible for the program as well. More information is available by contacting Dr. Paul Bosland or Mrs. Danise Coon at the Chile Pepper Institute, (505) 646-3028, hotchile@nmsu.edu or by visiting http://www.chilepepperinstitute.org/Assured.htm.</AbstractNarration>
