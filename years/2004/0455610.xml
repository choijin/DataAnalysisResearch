<AbstractNarration>This is a four-year project submitted under category B (Resources for Professional Development) of the Teacher Professional Continuum solicitation.  It will develop, pilot and field test an approach to standards-based mathematics in-service professional development, using recently developed standards and curriculum for the Adult Basic Education system.  The model will be piloted and field tested with mathematics teachers in seven states, whose students are in adult education and functioning approximately on a 4th to 8th grade level.  The model uses teacher inquiry and reflective learning to engage teachers in designing and implementing effective mathematics instructional approaches for algebra and data analysis.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project goals are to (1) enhance teacher content knowledge and instructional skills; 2) document teacher learning; and 3) produce a professional development model that can be replicated nationally.  The project will build on the development team's prior work in the areas of adult learning and teacher professional development.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An external evaluator (University of Tennessee's Institute for Assessment and Evaluation) will conduct formative and summative evaluations, examining materials to be produced, teacher learning and effects on student learning.  Dissemination will proceed through websites and national data bases, as well as reports at national conferences. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
