    <AbstractNarration>Abstract : Student Travel Support for 6th International Congress on Biology of Fish&lt;br/&gt;PI: Redding. Institution: Tennessee Technological University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is to request funding to support travel by students and&lt;br/&gt;recent postdoctoral researchers to participate as presenters at the 6th International&lt;br/&gt;Congress on the Biology of Fish for August 1-5, 2004 in Manaus, Brazil. The goal of this&lt;br/&gt;biennial series of meetings is to communicate basic knowledge about the cellular and&lt;br/&gt;organismal physiology of fish and its implications for fish culture and management of&lt;br/&gt;natural populations. This unique meeting highlights new research in the biology of fish and how it can be used to address societal issues such as food production, pollution, global climate change, and species diversity. The meeting is attended by the top fish physiologists representing about 40 nations from around the world. Symposia planned include presentations relating to fish reproduction, growth, nutrition, ion regulation, development, health, and conservation among other topics. As for previous Congresses, extended abstracts based on the presentations will be published in hard-copy for all attendees and in an electronic format available free-of-charge to the public via the Congress website (www.fishbiologycongress.org). Some special symposia may be published in primary journals, such as Fish Physiology and Biochemistry.</AbstractNarration>
