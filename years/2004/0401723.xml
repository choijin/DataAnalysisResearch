<AbstractNarration>Program Summary &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Over the past three years of   Phase II of the Washington-Baltimore-Hampton Roads &lt;br/&gt;Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (WBHR-LSAMP), three new state-based &lt;br/&gt;institutions were added.  The original four partners for Phase I included Howard University (HU), &lt;br/&gt;Hampton University (HAU), Morgan State University (MSU) and the University of the District of &lt;br/&gt;Columbia (UDC). The new Phase II partners included Bowie State University (BSU), Norfolk &lt;br/&gt;State University (NSU) and Virginia State University (VSU).  The addition of these three partners &lt;br/&gt;expanded the diversity of student populations served by the WBHR-LSAMP programs as well as &lt;br/&gt;expanding the numbers of programs available to students enrolled in science, technology, &lt;br/&gt;engineering and mathematics (STEM) within the Alliance. &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual and Technical Merit &lt;br/&gt;The principal objective for Phase III of the WBHR-LSAMP Alliance is to continue to &lt;br/&gt;institutionalize the . best practices. and . lesson-learned. from Phases I and II of the Alliance &lt;br/&gt;and to build the necessary instructional and research infrastructure that will ensure the successful &lt;br/&gt;progression and transition of undergraduate students towards B.S., M.S and Ph.D. degrees in &lt;br/&gt;STEM fields. The specific objectives for Phase III are to: &lt;br/&gt;Provide direct support for junior and senior-level students in order that they can &lt;br/&gt;successfully transition into graduate programs in STEM fields and ultimately replace the &lt;br/&gt;graying. professoriate in major research universities and the scientists and engineers at &lt;br/&gt;national and industrial laboratories. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To develop seamless relationships and partnerships with major research universities so &lt;br/&gt;that students within the WBHR-LSAMP programs completing B.S. and M.S. degree &lt;br/&gt;programs can continue their graduate work with joint mentoring by professors at WBHR-&lt;br/&gt;LSAMP institutions and those offering Ph.Ds by .building bridges for the doctorates..   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To build synergistic research efforts for all STEM students so that institutionalization of &lt;br/&gt;the WBHR-LSAMP initiatives will become permanent mechanisms for degree &lt;br/&gt;production at all levels in the postsecondary educational pipeline. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact &lt;br/&gt;Based on the trendline data, more than 7,500 African Americans have received B.S. &lt;br/&gt;degrees in STEM fields from this WBHR-LSAMP Alliance over the past 10 years and &lt;br/&gt;approximately 30 percent or 2,200 of these students have gone on to enroll in  graduate degree &lt;br/&gt;programs and have received M.S. and Ph.D. degrees as well as other professional degrees. The &lt;br/&gt;WBHR-LSAMP has documented evidence that the LSAMP students are more likely to return to &lt;br/&gt;HBCUs than other students. It is also clear by the number of Ph.Ds produced within the WBHR-&lt;br/&gt;LSAMP institutions, as well as the number of new assistant professors who have been hired &lt;br/&gt;within the WBHR-LSAMP Alliance, that the impact of the WBHR-LSAMP Alliance is not just &lt;br/&gt;within the alliance, but the impact is national as well as global.  We believe that that quality of &lt;br/&gt;African American students attending institutions within the WBHR-LSAMP alliance is among &lt;br/&gt;the highest in the United States. Furthermore, the establishment of new research partnerships will &lt;br/&gt;have as its foundation the establishments of doctoral.level research at WBHR-LSAMP &lt;br/&gt;institutions. The combination of improved instructional and research facilities at WBHR-LSAMP &lt;br/&gt;Institutions will have synergistic affects and benefits for  all of  the WBHR-LSAMP institutions, &lt;br/&gt;as well as the major research institutions that become research partners.  In particular, students &lt;br/&gt;participating in collaborative research benefit because they can be actively involved in a &lt;br/&gt;comprehensive approach to research and development that is typically difficult to achieve in &lt;br/&gt;smaller focused research groups such as those normally found in HBCUs and MIs where research &lt;br/&gt;resources are usually limited.</AbstractNarration>
