    <AbstractNarration>DMS-0400674&lt;br/&gt;Title: Properties of absolutely minimizing functions&lt;br/&gt;PI: Michael Crandall, UCSB&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The problem of finding an extension of a function given on the &lt;br/&gt;boundary of an open&lt;br/&gt;set into the interior of the set in a way which achieves the least &lt;br/&gt;possible value&lt;br/&gt;of some functional defined on such extensions is pervasive in &lt;br/&gt;mathematics and its&lt;br/&gt;applications. If the functional is the Dirichlet integral, one is led to the&lt;br/&gt;Dirichlet problem for the Laplace equation. If the functional is, instead, the&lt;br/&gt;supremum norm of the length of the gradient, uniqueness of minimal &lt;br/&gt;extensions is&lt;br/&gt;lost unless the problem is reinterpreted - the resulting notion is here called&lt;br/&gt;"absolutely minimizing". Owing to work of Aronsson in the 60's and &lt;br/&gt;Jensen in the&lt;br/&gt;90's, one knows that, upon this proper reinterpretation, there is an associated&lt;br/&gt;Dirichlet problem which has a unique solution. However, the partial &lt;br/&gt;differential&lt;br/&gt;equation involved is now a highly degenerate quasilinear elliptic equation, the&lt;br/&gt;"infinity-Laplace" equation. Moreover, the infinity-Laplace operator must be&lt;br/&gt;understood in the generalized sense of viscosity solutions. In the &lt;br/&gt;original works,&lt;br/&gt;the "length of the gradient" was the Euclidean length. For some other &lt;br/&gt;notions of&lt;br/&gt;length, such as the natural maximum norm, there is only an existence theory and&lt;br/&gt;uniqueness is unsettled. This is one simple example of a basic question in this&lt;br/&gt;arena as yet unresolved. Others include, even in the case of the &lt;br/&gt;Euclidean length,&lt;br/&gt;uniqueness in unbounded domains, the famous problem of &lt;br/&gt;differentiability of infinity&lt;br/&gt;harmonic functions (recently settled in two space dimensions by Savin), and the&lt;br/&gt;possibility of other more refined results - perhaps generic - on the &lt;br/&gt;structure of&lt;br/&gt;solutions. These issues will be studied in this project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The infinity-Laplace equation is an archetypal object in the subject called&lt;br/&gt;"calculus of variations in L-infinity" by its founders. Roughly speaking, it&lt;br/&gt;corresponds to designing for the worst case, clearly an important issue with&lt;br/&gt;potential relevance to many fields. One well established area of &lt;br/&gt;application of&lt;br/&gt;absolutely minimizing functions is in image processing. While this project is&lt;br/&gt;primarily mathematical, the questions asked are basic&lt;br/&gt;and aimed at archetypes (as opposed to technically complex generalizations).&lt;br/&gt;Success will illuminate the general theory and thereby its current and future&lt;br/&gt;applications.</AbstractNarration>
