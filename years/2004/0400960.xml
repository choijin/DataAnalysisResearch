<AbstractNarration>We intend to study three topics in combinatorics which are related to&lt;br/&gt;theoretical computer science. We will study the diameter problem for&lt;br/&gt;graphs of polytopes aiming at a polynomial upper bound, and also try to&lt;br/&gt;find versions of the simplex algorithm with sub-exponential worst case&lt;br/&gt;behavior. We will study Boolean functions, their Fourier transform and how&lt;br/&gt;it relates to questions in probability and complexity. We will also try to&lt;br/&gt;find general methods to relate the solution of a positive integer&lt;br/&gt;programming problem and its linear programming relaxation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combinatorics have now become the central mathematical discipline in&lt;br/&gt;theoretical computer science (and various applied areas of computer&lt;br/&gt;science as well). The role of combinatorics in computer science today is&lt;br/&gt;quite similar to the role of logic in the early days of computation.&lt;br/&gt;Problems from theoretical computer science enriched and enforced&lt;br/&gt;combinatorial thinking and areas which were regarded as having clear &lt;br/&gt;intellectual merit have gained surprising real-life applications.  Linear&lt;br/&gt;programming and the simplex algorithm are among the most important&lt;br/&gt;applications of computers and in our earlier work as well as the planned&lt;br/&gt;research. We intend to study fundamental questions concerning linear&lt;br/&gt;programming. Another area of our research, the Fourier analysis of Boolean&lt;br/&gt;functions is a relatively new area which we helped to develop in the past.  &lt;br/&gt;In view of the importance of Fourier analysis in other areas we should not&lt;br/&gt;have been surprised to see its recent applications in combinatorics and&lt;br/&gt;complexity theory and  we intend to explore further connections.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
