<AbstractNarration>The acquisition of a state-of-the-art X-ray computed tomography (CT) system for non-invasive microstructural evaluation of engineering materials will facilitate understanding of the relationship between material microstructure and its evolution and performance for multiple disciplines in engineering and science. The proposed instrumentation will provide critical support for ongoing and pending research projects funded through NSF and other national and state-level agencies and contribute substantially toward additional funding and collaboration. These projects that range from micromechanics of construction materials to characterization of flaws in offshore sediments to analysis of failure modes of rocks include the common need to capture material microstructure for further analysis, simulation, and numerical model verification. The proposed system meets this need through a unique technique for three- dimensional (3-D) visualization of interior microstructural features in opaque solids. The proposal includes an impact and management plan that integrates research and educational activities and ensures proper training. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit Research facilitated with the X-ray CT system will advance the understanding of the microscopic behavior of engineering materials and will lead to improvements in the design of materials with microstructures tailored to achieve specific properties and performance. These improvements can be realized for a wide range of materials, including metals, ceramics, and composites. In addition, X-ray CT provides parameters for and verifies the predictions of continuum performance models through microstructural measurements. X-ray CT images can also be coupled with numerical modeling techniques to simulate engineering processes at the microstructural level for naturally occurring materials and particulate composites containing these materials. The general approaches described integrate experimental characterization, constitutive modeling, and numerical simulation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact The research activities that use the X-ray CT system will advance the state of knowledge and integrate different disciplines toward greater understanding of material behavior at multiscales. The complex behavior of particulate composites calls for the development of an integrated approach based on the fundamentals of mechanics, experimental characterization from microscale to macroscale, and utilization of available computing power to understand material behavior and predict performance. The system provides the necessary experimental measurement and analysis capabilities for this type of approach that promises a significant shift in engineering and science and resulting material performance.  This system will provide an opportunity for expanded interaction with industry and government to ensure the educational system is sensitive to workforce needs. Recruitment of high quality, diverse graduate students will also be facilitated. Transfer of knowledge gained through use of the X-ray CT system will take place in the classroom, through advising of student researchers, in workshops or seminars, and through journal publications and presentations. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
