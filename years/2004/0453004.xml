<AbstractNarration>The theory of Lie algebras, both finite and infinite-dimensional, have &lt;br/&gt;been a major area of mathematical research with numerous applications in &lt;br/&gt;many other areas of mathematics and physics, for example, combinatorics, &lt;br/&gt;group theory, number theory, partial differential equations, topology, &lt;br/&gt;conformal field theory and string theory, statistical mechanics and &lt;br/&gt;integrable systems. In particular, the representation theory of an important class of infinite dimensional Lie algebras known as affine Lie algebras has led to the&lt;br/&gt;discovery of new algebraic structures, such as vertex (operator) &lt;br/&gt;algebras and quantum groups. Both of these algebraic structures have &lt;br/&gt;become important areas of current mathematical research with deep &lt;br/&gt;connections with many other areas in mathematics and physics. This &lt;br/&gt;conference will provide an excellent setting for researchers in mathematics and physics working in the area of Lie algebras, vertex operator algebras and their applications to explore &lt;br/&gt;possible new directions of research in the twenty-first century.&lt;br/&gt;The focus of the conference will be on the following topics:&lt;br/&gt;(i) Finite and infinite dimensional Lie algebras and quantum groups.&lt;br/&gt;(ii) Vertex operator algebras and their representations.&lt;br/&gt;(iii) Applications to number theory, combinatorics, conformal field&lt;br/&gt;theory and statistical mechanics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lie algebras are a class of algebras describing continuous symmetries in&lt;br/&gt;nature. They were first introduced by mathematician S. Lie in the&lt;br/&gt;ninteenth century and have been studied by many prominent mathematicians and&lt;br/&gt;physicists since then.  During the twentieth century, the theory of Lie&lt;br/&gt;algebras developed rapidly into a main research area in&lt;br/&gt;mathematics with numerous important applications in physics. Vertex&lt;br/&gt;operator algebras and quantum groups are relatively new class of &lt;br/&gt;algebras and can be viewed as far-reaching analogues of Lie algebras. &lt;br/&gt;Vertex operator algebras have been used to solve problems related to discrete symmetries and to number theory. They are also an important ingredient in a&lt;br/&gt;physical theory describing phenomena such as the physical state in which&lt;br/&gt;water, ice and steam coexist and in a physical theory called string&lt;br/&gt;theory which some physicists are using to unify all the forces in the&lt;br/&gt;universe. This conference is on Lie algebras, vertex operator algebras&lt;br/&gt;and their applications and it will encourage mathematicians and&lt;br/&gt;physicists to interact and, to join forces to discover&lt;br/&gt;new frontiers. It will be especially beneficial to graduate&lt;br/&gt;students and junior faculty members who have&lt;br/&gt;just started their careers. We will encourage participation from &lt;br/&gt;graduate students, junior researchers, women, minorities, and persons &lt;br/&gt;with disabilities by giving them priority for financial support.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
