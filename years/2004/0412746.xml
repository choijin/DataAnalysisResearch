<AbstractNarration>Collaborative Research:  Sexual Selection on Male Ornaments&lt;br/&gt;PI: Peter Dunn, Corey Freeman-Gallant&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Males often possess ornamental traits such as long tails and bright colors that they use to attract mates.  These ornaments may be favored by female choice or male-male competition.  Female choice is likely to act on different ornaments than male-male competition, particularly when some ornaments are more revealing of male quality than others.  For example, in species with both carotenoid (red, yellow) and melanin (black, brown)-based ornaments, it appears that females often focus their mate choice on the carotenoid-based ornaments, which are generally considered to be better indicators of male condition than ornaments with melanin pigments.  Surprisingly, we have discovered two populations of a monogamous bird, the common yellowthroat, in which male reproductive success is related to the size of a carotenoid-based ornament (yellow bib) in one population (New York) and a melanin-based ornament (black facial mask) in another population (Wisconsin).  Our study will examine sexual selection on each plumage ornament in both populations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will 1) use aviary experiments to identify which ornaments are favored by female choice and male-male competition, and 2) determine if the differences between populations are caused by different mechanisms of selection operating on different ornaments.  Common yellowthroats are one of only a handful of species in which researchers have been able to identify the sires of most young, including extra-pair young, and, as a consequence, make an estimate of the full force of selection on male ornaments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the broader impacts of this project will be to foster training of students in collaborative research, which will give them a better perspective on how science is conducted. To facilitate this training, the PIs will exchange students between their two institutions (one a small undergraduate institution, the other a large graduate program) each year for both the field and laboratory components of the project. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
