<AbstractNarration>     In this collaborative project the investigators Sommese,&lt;br/&gt;Wampler, and Verschelde construct and implement new algorithms to&lt;br/&gt;numerically describe algebraic sets defined by systems of&lt;br/&gt;parameterized polynomial equations.  The scope of work goes&lt;br/&gt;beyond conventional problems, where one seeks the solution set&lt;br/&gt;when the parameters are given, to include the determination of&lt;br/&gt;parameter sets that change the nature of solution components in a&lt;br/&gt;specified manner.  Of special interest are solution sets whose&lt;br/&gt;dimension is exceptionally large.  Problems such as these, e.g.,&lt;br/&gt;the discovery and classification of overconstrained mechanisms,&lt;br/&gt;can be reduced to computing the irreducible decomposition of&lt;br/&gt;certain exceptional loci of polynomial systems with parameters. &lt;br/&gt;This is then reduced to finding the numerical irreducible&lt;br/&gt;decomposition of a finite number of associated polynomial&lt;br/&gt;systems.  As this leads to large systems, a new&lt;br/&gt;equation-by-equation approach to solving polynomial systems is&lt;br/&gt;developed.  To tackle nontrivial problems, the algorithms is&lt;br/&gt;implemented on parallel computers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Solving a polynomial equation -- finding the roots of the&lt;br/&gt;polynomial -- is an old problem that occurs over and over in more&lt;br/&gt;complicated forms throughout science and engineering.  In&lt;br/&gt;applications involving mechanical design, finding the solution of&lt;br/&gt;a system of polynomial equations is only one step in a larger&lt;br/&gt;scheme: to arrive at better designs by describing how the set of&lt;br/&gt;solutions of a polynomial system depends on parameters of the&lt;br/&gt;system.  This problem arises in design of industrial robots, for&lt;br/&gt;example.  The investigators develop new methods for describing&lt;br/&gt;the solution sets of polynomial systems with parameters.  The&lt;br/&gt;methods have the potential to become a standard tool in the&lt;br/&gt;design of robots and mechanisms.  Furthermore, the methods&lt;br/&gt;promise to have a wider impact on the research fields of&lt;br/&gt;numerical analysis and computer algebra, especially in efforts&lt;br/&gt;seeking to provide the scientific community with software to&lt;br/&gt;solve mathematical problems.  An important result of this work is&lt;br/&gt;publicly available software based on these new methods, with&lt;br/&gt;interfaces facilitating use by the wider community.  By solving&lt;br/&gt;some difficult polynomial systems that arise in science and&lt;br/&gt;engineering, the team stimulates interest in these advanced&lt;br/&gt;methods and provides illustration of their usage for the&lt;br/&gt;nonspecialist.  The project includes collaboration with and&lt;br/&gt;training of students.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
