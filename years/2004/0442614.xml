<AbstractNarration>Engineering-Mechanical (56) &lt;br/&gt;The project is developing active learning products (ALP) for Mechanics of Materials courses to create an effective teaching/learning environment for students with different learning styles and needs. ALP products include: (1) active learning aids for the classroom (for example hands-on activities), (2) web/CD content (for example interactive multimedia) and (3) written content in the form of ALP modules for a textbook. The project is unifying, assessing, and disseminating these materials for direct and efficient implementation by educators. Active learning methodologies and procedures are based on the Kolbe Cycle of learning that includes (1) active experimentation, (2) concrete experience, (3) reflective observation and (4) abstract hypothesis and conceptualization. Assessment of student learning is based on their development of critical thinking skills. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is building upon prior, award-winning work that was developed collaboratively by the PI and CoPI at their home institutions, the University of Texas and the United States Air Force Academy. Faculty members from Austin Community College are determining how the material can be adapted and transferred to a community college environment.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts from the project include direct collaboration with the University of Missouri-Rolla, which is developing CD interactive curriculum for the same course. Materials from each project are being created so that they can be integrated into a coherent package. The approach is providing a model for developing teaching aids in Mechanics of Materials as well as other engineering subject matter. National dissemination of the materials is through commercial publishing, commercial web sites, and links to MSC finite element software. Workshops to train faculty to use these techniques are being developed and are being implemented as the project matures.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
