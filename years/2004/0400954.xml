<AbstractNarration>This project will primarily involve work in two areas.  Mitchell has&lt;br/&gt;recently answered a longstanding question of Shelah concerning the&lt;br/&gt;approachability ideal at the second uncountable cardinal, and the&lt;br/&gt;first area of research will further exploit these new techniques to better&lt;br/&gt;understand this ideal and other questions about closed unbounded&lt;br/&gt;sets.   A major aim will be to extend these ideas to the successor of&lt;br/&gt;a singular cardinal.   The second area of research is in inner model&lt;br/&gt;theory, where Mitchell will attempt to better understand the situation&lt;br/&gt;just below a Woodin cardinal and at very large cardinals where no&lt;br/&gt;core model is presently known to exist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These questions concern the basic structure of the universe of sets.&lt;br/&gt;The approachability ideal was defined by  Shelah for use in his analysis of&lt;br/&gt;singular cardinals, such as the first infinite cardinal number which&lt;br/&gt;has infinitely many smaller infinite cardinals below it.   The structure at&lt;br/&gt;such cardinals is much more difficult than the structure at regular cardinals,&lt;br/&gt;and the planned research could contribute significantly to its&lt;br/&gt;understanding. &lt;br/&gt;Much research in set theory studies different the different possible&lt;br/&gt;forms that the universe of sets might take. It has been shown that, under appropriate&lt;br/&gt;assumptions, the "core model" provides an invariant skeleton which shared by all of these&lt;br/&gt;possible universes, and from which they derive much of their&lt;br/&gt;structure.   The work on inner models will aim at an understanding of&lt;br/&gt;exceptional cases where this skeleton is not yet know to exist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
