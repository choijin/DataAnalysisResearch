<AbstractNarration>0457543&lt;br/&gt;Mortazawi&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Electronically  scanned  antennas  have  broad  applications  for  both  commercial  and  military  segments, including  advanced  radars,  cellular  base  stations,  satellite  communications,  and  automotive  collision avoidance radars. The phased array systems can scan the beam electronically at a fast rate, but require complex integration of many circuits, including many expensive solid-state, MEMS or ferrite based phase &lt;br/&gt;shifters,  control  lines,  and  power  distribution  networks.  The  resulting  systems  are complex,  bulky  and have high losses.  One of the critical elements for electronically scanned phased array antennas is a phase shifter. It typically contributes to a significant amount of the cost of producing a phased array antenna and it  is  not  uncommon  for  the  cost  of  the  phase  shifters  to  represent  nearly  half  of  the  cost  of  the  entire electronically  scanned  array.  This  excessive  cost  has  limited  the  deployment  of  electronically  scanned antennas and restricted their use to expensive and specialized systems, such as military radars and certain commercial  systems  such  as  cellular  telephone  base  stations.  Any  substantial  reduction  in  the  cost  of phased array systems will allow much wider deployment of them in commercial arena.  In response to the  above  technology  needs,  we  propose  to  develop  simple  and  low  cost  circuit  architectures  for  the design of millimeter-wave phased arrays with reduced complexity and cost. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact of the Proposed Research &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One  important  application  that  can  take  advantage  of  low  cost  millimeter-wave  phased  arrays  is automotive collision avoidance radar or adaptive cruise control technology.  Building a radar for road use has been technically feasible for many years however as mentioned the core issue is how to make one for a  tiny  fraction  of the costs  usually  involved in making complex  phased  array  radars.  Millimeter-wave &lt;br/&gt;adaptive cruise control is now an option only on luxury models, such as the Mercedes S-class and Jaguar XKE. The  challenge  is  to reduce  the  cost/complexity  of  these systems  so  that  they  find  their  way  into ordinary  cars.    Based  on  the  U.S.  Department  of  Transportation's  report,  during  the  year  2000  in  the United States, 42,000 deaths were reported due to car crashes. The number of injuries that year reached 3 million. Nine out of ten of those crashes were caused through human error.  Through the 1998 Intelligent Vehicle Initiative, the U.S. Department of Transportation identified eight areas where intelligent systems could "improve" or "impact" safety.  Among the eight identified areas, four are based on various collision avoidance sensors. Indeed broad application of collision avoidance radars will significantly improve the road  safety.  These  circuits  will  eventually  be  taught  in  class  room  teaching  to  help  students  better understand the interaction of multiple tunable circuit components in a distributed network for much added functionality. Many commercial systems can benefit from low cost phased arrays.  The dissemination of research will be based on journal publications, conference/workshop presentations will and the Radiation &lt;br/&gt;and Solid-State Laboratories biweekly seminars at UoM that are well attended by both graduate as well as undergraduates.    Special  effort  will  be  placed  in  attracting  underrepresented  students  through  the University of Michigan UROP (Undergraduate Research Opportunities) and Maria Sara Parker Programs specifically designed to provide research experiences to undergraduate and graduate female and minority &lt;br/&gt;students.  Currently PI employs one female undergraduate under Maria Sara Parker Program at UoM. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit of the Proposed Research  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates  a new  class  of circuits  that combine  RF power  distribution  and  phase  shifters into one entity.  The proposed research is expected to have a significant impact on the design of low cost, simple and efficient networks for the design of phased array antennas.  Other applications of such circuits include  tunable  filters  at microwave  and  millimeter-wave  frequencies  for  the  design  of  multifunction &lt;br/&gt;transceivers.  These  systems  have  applications  in  various  areas  of  electronic  communications  including smart  antennas,  radars,  mobile multimedia  services,  automotive  collision avoidance  systems  and  active high  power  filters.    Furthermore  applications  provided  by  satellites  will  also  benefit  from  these developments due to the limitations on size, weight and cost. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
