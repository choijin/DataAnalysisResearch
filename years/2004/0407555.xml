<AbstractNarration>A project is proposed to perform multi-NEES site structural testing of a common structure in conjunction with soil-structure  interaction.  The objective of the proposed project is to provide a realistic test bed application with which to verify and extend the components of the NEESgrid and the NEES equipment sites for distributed simulation. The proposed project will involve the collaboration of three NEES Equipment Sites  (Lehigh University; University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign; and RPI), the NEES System Integrator, and National Center for Supercomputer Applications (NCSA).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The test bed will consist  of  a  model  of  the  I-10  Santa  Monica  Freeway.  This structure was damaged  during  the  1994  Northridge  earthquake.  Each of  the equipment sites will house a physical model of a component of the bridge, with the superstructure being modeled analytically using the NCSA parallel computing facility. Using hybrid testing methods, command displacements  from NCSA will be issued to the physical substructures at each of the equipment sites, which in turn  are  imposed  and  the  measured  restoring  forces  returned  to  NCSA.  The&lt;br/&gt;communication between the sites and NCSA will involve the use of the Internet in conjunction  with  software  and  protocols  developed  by  the  NEES  System Integrator.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project utilizes aspects of simulation that comprise many of the applications of the NEES  Equipment  Sites  and  NEESgrid,  including:  (1) advanced analytical geotechnical modeling under dynamic loading; (2) advanced analytical structural modeling under dynamic loading; (3) advanced geotechnical testing  using  centrifuges;  and  (4)  advanced  structural  testing  using  multi-degrees-of-freedom  testing  facilities. The  Lehigh  NEES  Equipment  Site  will  be responsible  for  one  of  the  bridge  piers. This  pier  will  be  built  and  tested  at  the&lt;br/&gt;Lehigh NEES Equipment Site. Lehigh will also be involved in analytical modeling of structural components of the bridge structure to perform analytical simulations in conjunction with distributed simulation in some of the phases of the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The  results  from  the  proposed  project  will  offer  numerous  benefits. The NEES Equipment  Sites  will  benefit  from  an  evaluation  of  the  software  and  hardware currently established for distributed testing. The data repository and telepresence for NEES will be put into action, enabling the general community to observe the tests and observe that the NEES vision of distributed simulation is finally realized and  proven.  Finally,  the  project  will  help  to  extend  the  state-of-the-art  in integrated experimental-analytical simulation in earthquake engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
