<AbstractNarration>This award funded by the Division of Chemistry provides support to the National Research Council, through its Board on Chemical Sciences and Technology, to conduct a review of the current state of molecular imaging technology.  This will point to promising future developments and their applications, and suggest a research agenda to enable breakthrough improvements to image molecular processes simultaneously in multiple physical dimensions as well as time.  The NRC will assemble a committee of experts that will review the current state-of-the-art, identify gaps and develop a vision for the future of chemical imaging.  They will identify research to meet this vision.  Educational and institutional innovations that could help catalyze advances in this field will be discussed.  The committee of approximately fifteen members from industry and academe will hold meetings, confer with interested parties and receive input from two workshops.  The community will have the opportunity to provide input via a web page.  A report will be generated targeted at researchers in the field, including graduate students, and federal program managers.  The report will be disseminated by the usual NRC mechanisms and permanently documented in the archives of the National Academy.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
