<AbstractNarration>Increasingly, many aspects of biology can be viewed as involving the processing of information. Modern&lt;br/&gt;information and computer science have played an important rolein such major biological accomplishments&lt;br/&gt;as the sequencing of the human genome. On the other hand, biological ideas can inspire new concepts and&lt;br/&gt;methods in information science. This project is motivated by these two observations. Progress in the field&lt;br/&gt;of biological information processing will require interdisciplinary collaborations among computer scientists,&lt;br/&gt;mathematicians, physicists, chemists, and biologists. The project is built around a series of workshops that&lt;br/&gt;will enhance the interdisciplinary collaborations beginning to form and introduce outstanding junior people&lt;br/&gt;to problems and topics at the forefront of research.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The project will be organized around a series of workshops with four themes: (1) Algorithmic Approaches&lt;br/&gt;to Biological Information Processing; (2) Computer Science, Engineering and Biology: Applications and&lt;br/&gt;Analogies; (3) Biological Circuits and Cellular Signaling; (4) Proteomics. Two of these themes represent&lt;br/&gt;approaches and two represent areas of application of these approaches. Under theme 1, planned workshops&lt;br/&gt;are on Detecting and Processing Regularities in High Throughput Biological Data; Machine Learning Ap-&lt;br/&gt;proaches for Understanding Gene Regulation; and Computational Tumor Modeling. Theme 2 workshops will&lt;br/&gt;cover Nanotechnology and Biology; Control, Communication, and Computing in Biology; and The Mecha-&lt;br/&gt;nism and Applications of the RNA Interference Process. For Theme 3, there will be workshops on Strategies&lt;br/&gt;for Reverse Engineering Biological Circuits; Cell Communication and Information Processing in Developing&lt;br/&gt;Tissues; Dynamics of Biological Networks; and Evolution of Gene Regulatory Networks. Theme 4 work-&lt;br/&gt;shops will be on Information Processing by Protein Structures in Molecular Recognition; Proteome Network&lt;br/&gt;Evolution; Functional Proteomics of Neurodegenerative Diseases; and Implications of Mathematical Models&lt;br/&gt;of Infection and Molecular Modeling of Hepatitis B Virus. We expect that the workshops, scientific papers&lt;br/&gt;and books coming out of the project will help to develop the long-term focus of the field, carefully define&lt;br/&gt;problems and directions in computer science, mathematics, chemistry, andphysics of specific interest to and&lt;br/&gt;designed in collaboration with biologists, and lead to new biological concepts that will in uence biological&lt;br/&gt;and information science research in the future. In short, we expect the project to in uence the study of&lt;br/&gt;biological information processing for years to come.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The ideas developed in this project will have impact on a myriad of fields and create cross-disciplinary&lt;br/&gt;connections. A visitor program will encourage senior and junior researchers, including students, to participate&lt;br/&gt;in collaborative research spawned by the workshops. Each workshop will have a fund for support of graduate&lt;br/&gt;students and postdocs amd workshops will have a substantial educational component through talks of a&lt;br/&gt;tutorial/expository nature. The topic lends itself well to undergraduate research and participating faculty&lt;br/&gt;will coordinate topics with an undergraduate research program (REU program) already in existence. To give&lt;br/&gt;the project widespread dissemination, each workshop will have awebsite with relevant references, problems,&lt;br/&gt;and copies of presentations that can make it a resource for a large community. The project should significantly&lt;br/&gt;in uence the careers of a large number of outstanding junior researchers and it should play an important&lt;br/&gt;role in the training and development of scientists who are well-prepared to become leaders in the field of&lt;br/&gt;biological information processing. The project is expected to have a long-term impact well beyond its four&lt;br/&gt;year duration since the workshop, visitor, and dissemination components of the project will allow the ideas&lt;br/&gt;developed to reach hundreds of people nationwide and worldwide.</AbstractNarration>
