<AbstractNarration>This award, called CIREN: Consortium of International Research and Education Network will provide high performance research and education connectivity between the US and Asia.  To provide cross-Pacific connectivity, the CIREN will provision a high-speed circuit between the US west coast and Tokyo. From Tokyo, the Project, with significant contributions from Asia, will construct an intra-Asia backbone consisting of two links.  This first link will be between Tokyo and Hong Kong, facilitating Chinese connectivity.  The second link will be between Hong Kong and Singapore (possibly Tokyo and Singapore), and will provide a backbone peering point and connectivity for South Asia as well as a potential connection point for India.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; James G Williams&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Principal Investigator&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Award:  SCI - 0441096&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
