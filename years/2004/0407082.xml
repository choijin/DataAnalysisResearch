<AbstractNarration>The proposed research investigates the noise and high frequency dynamics of single-wall carbon nanotubes.  The one-dimensional nature of the electron states in nanotubes makes correlations significant, which can lead to the formation of the novel Luttinger liquid state.  Using carbon nanotubes as a laboratory for studying the electron interactions, this research will investigate the quantum shot noise of the Luttinger liquid state, and the electron wave dynamics at microwave frequencies.   The noise to be studied in this system is quite distinctive, and measurements at microwave frequencies can access the basic behavior without the complicating aspect of 1/f noise present at lower frequencies.  The goal is to understand the novel state of one-dimensional electrons.  This project involves collaboration with researchers at Cornell University and will provide excellent training for postdoctoral researchers, graduate and undergraduate students in fabrication and measurement facilities available at both these leading institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; In recent years, the development of novel one-dimensional systems by material scientists has led to electrical conductors with unusual properties.  The carbon nanotube is the prototype of these systems, exhibiting either metallic or semiconducting behavior depending on their geometry.  To fully understand the complex and new aspects of the electrical properties of carbon nanotubes, highly sensitive microwave measurement techniques, developed recently at Yale University, will be used.   These measurements will provide a model study of how to apply the advanced arsenal of tools of nanoscience to nanoscale systems and devices.  The project involves collaboration with Cornell University and will train students at postdoctoral, graduate, and undergraduate levels in frontier nanoscience and technology, thus preparing them for careers in academe, industry, or government.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
