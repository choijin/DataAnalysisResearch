<AbstractNarration>The research addresses a fundamental problem affecting all underground lifelines, namely the effects of &lt;br/&gt;large  differential  ground  deformation  on  buried  pipeline  and  conduit  performance.    The  research  will &lt;br/&gt;produce  a  seminal  outcome  through  state-of-the-art  modeling  and  quantification  of  earthquake-induced &lt;br/&gt;ground movement effects on lifelines. It also will improve the design and construction of lifelines affected &lt;br/&gt;by  landslides,  mining,  extraction  of  subsurface  fluids,  and  underground  construction.  The  research &lt;br/&gt;deliverables include, as a minimum: 1) systematic assessment of lifeline performance under permanent &lt;br/&gt;ground deformation,  2)  quantification  of  serviceability  and  ultimate  limit  states  for  critical  lifelines,  3) &lt;br/&gt;design guidelines, 4) experimental databases for benchmarking future numerical models and guiding the &lt;br/&gt;evolution  of  numerical  simulations  for  soil-structure  interaction,  and  5)  validation  and  guidance  for &lt;br/&gt;advanced materials as well as sensor and robotics deployment in underground conduits. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The research will be performed through physical modeling using the Cornell Large Displacement Soil-&lt;br/&gt;Structure Interaction Facility for Lifeline Systems and the Rensselaer 150 g-ton Geotechnical Centrifuge &lt;br/&gt;in combination with advanced computational simulation.  The 4-year program is organized according to a &lt;br/&gt;matrix  management  approach  in  which  lifeline  response  to  a  comprehensive  suite  of  ground  rupture &lt;br/&gt;patterns is systematically investigated and checked through large-scale experiments, centrifuge tests, and &lt;br/&gt;numerical simulation. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Technical Merits:  The research team at Cornell and Rensselaer has extensive experience in the design, &lt;br/&gt;siting,  and  construction  of  underground  lifelines,  as  well  as  laboratory  and  field  testing  of &lt;br/&gt;pipelines/conduits.    They  have  worked  extensively  together  and  have  earned  a  strong  national  and &lt;br/&gt;international  reputation  for  their  contributions  to  lifeline,  geotechnical,  and  structural  engineering.  &lt;br/&gt;Moreover, they will follow a meticulous and systematic plan for the research that is thoroughly integrated &lt;br/&gt;and managed.  They will use world-class NEES facilities that were constructed specifically for this type &lt;br/&gt;of  investigation.    Research  investments  through  the  proposed  project  will  be  leveraged  into  improved &lt;br/&gt;practices for water, electric power, gas and liquid fuel, telecommunication, transportation, and wastewater &lt;br/&gt;conveyance lifelines representing hundreds of thousands of km of US facilities critical for the delivery of &lt;br/&gt;community resources and services. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  The proposed project addresses safety and reliability of critical infrastructure while &lt;br/&gt;also creating an innovative outreach program with the Sciencenter of Ithaca, NY.  The project team will &lt;br/&gt;develop a 300-SF museum exhibition on earthquake engineering and will explain how engineers at NEES &lt;br/&gt;sites study earthquake effects using networked experimental facilities.  An interactive shake table that can &lt;br/&gt;be controlled by anyone on the Internet will allow museum visitors, school classes, and home users to &lt;br/&gt;participate in earthquake engineering experiments, reaching an estimated 600,000 individuals over four &lt;br/&gt;years.  The  project  will  model  a  process  for  how  other  NEES  sites  can  link  with  400  science  centers &lt;br/&gt;throughout the U.S. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The project involves substantial collaboration with industry, including ADS, Inc., Corning, Inc., Exxon &lt;br/&gt;Mobil, Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, Phillips Driscopipe, Inc., Tokyo Gas Co., Ltd., and &lt;br/&gt;ULC  Robotics,  Inc.    Hence,  the  research  results  will  be  guided  by  industry  for  maximum  impact  in &lt;br/&gt;practice,  continuing  education  of  the  U.S.  work  force,  and  nationwide  dissemination  in  infrastructure &lt;br/&gt;projects. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The  project  will  receive  assistance  from  Cornell  in  supporting  women  and  minority  summer  research &lt;br/&gt;experiences  for  undergraduates,  and  will  benefit  from  a  Sciencenter  program  that  will support  teenage &lt;br/&gt;museum guides from underserved communities.  Additional undergraduate support will be sought through &lt;br/&gt;the NSF REU program, graduate students will be supported, and research results will be integrated into &lt;br/&gt;courses taught by the PIs and their colleagues at Cornell, Rensselaer, and other institutions. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
