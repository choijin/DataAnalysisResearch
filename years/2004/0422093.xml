<AbstractNarration>This project describes a career development program that combines research in the field of astroparticle physics with the development of a new course titled Introductory Cosmology at the University of Utah with the potential of expanding the work toward development of a new curriculum track for physics majors. Astrophysics. Both research and teaching will utilize the unique capabilities of the Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System, VERITAS, currently under construction, to observe very high energy photons from astrophysicsl objects. The specific program proposed will search for one of the candidates for the Cold Dark Matter observed in the universe, Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, or WIMPs. VERITAS has the capability to observe these hypothetical particles through either their interactions with baryonic matter or through the secondary products of their self-annihilation. Part of the study will involve simulations to predict the WIMP densities in the Local Group Galaxies or in the center of our Galaxy. The Cosmology course will utilize the information and data from VERITAS, as well as its outreach program.</AbstractNarration>
