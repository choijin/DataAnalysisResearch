<AbstractNarration>This award by the Division of Materials Research to University of Kentucky is to develop a mathematical model for quantification of texture evolution in continuous cast (CC) aluminum alloy sheets as a function of processing parameters.  This model will show the effect of alloy composition, hot rolling procedure and homogenization practice on the evolution of texture during cold rolling and annealing.  With this award, Professor Zhai will study quantitatively the evolution of texture and microstructure during cold rolling of continuous cast AA 3000 series aluminum alloy sheets, and during their annealing.   The effect of alloy composition, initial texture and microstructure on the evolution of texture in these aluminum alloys will be quantified.  In addition, quantitative analytical relations that describe the evolution of texture and microstructure during the continuous cast processing of aluminum alloy sheets, with a view to predicting their formability will be studied.  It has been a challenge in texture and formability studies to predict with sufficient accuracy the evolution of crystallographic texture during thermomechanical processing of metal sheets, and to quantify their formability by taking into account texture and microstructure parameters.  Attempts have been made to quantify texture evolution during annealing of aluminum alloys using a physically based model or an empirical equation, but large discrepancies between theoretical predictions and experimental results remained.  Improved methods will be used to quantify texture volume fractions by uniquely defining the region of each texture component in Euler space, and accurately quantify the evolution of texture during annealing as well as cold rolling of continuous cast aluminum alloys.  The success of this modeling project would pave the way to accurately predicting formability both from a mechanical anisotropy point of view as well as from a limit strain consideration, and would be valuable in the optimization of the processing of continuous cast aluminum alloys. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project would help the U.S. aluminum industry to significantly improve the formability of continuous casting aluminum alloys by enabling the quantification of texture evolution and sheet formability during and after thermomechanical processing, respectively, and by optimization of processing parameters.  Undergraduate and graduate students trained by this research and education program would prepare them for careers in aluminum industry.  Integration of research into teaching and laboratory projects would benefit the students and prepare them for opportunities in careers or higher education in science and technology.</AbstractNarration>
