<AbstractNarration>0409203&lt;br/&gt;Peggy A. O'Day&lt;br/&gt;The chemical speciation of arsenic in sediments and porewaters of aquifers is the critical&lt;br/&gt;factor that determines whether dissolved arsenic accumulates to potentially toxic levels.&lt;br/&gt;Although we have a general understanding of the biogeochemical cycle of arsenic, there remains&lt;br/&gt;a large gap in our quantitative understanding of the mechanisms of transformations, the role of&lt;br/&gt;iron and sulfur, and the dynamics of natural processes that mobilize arsenic in the environment.&lt;br/&gt;We lack detailed measurements that allow us to quantify seasonal impacts on subsurface arsenic&lt;br/&gt;speciation, and the rates at which speciation changes in response to surface infiltration from&lt;br/&gt;rainfall and vertical fluctuations in water table depth. Using a combination of field, laboratory,&lt;br/&gt;and modeling efforts that employ both molecular and macroscopic methods, we will study&lt;br/&gt;arsenic mobility and natural attenuation at a site near San Francisco Bay as a model system.&lt;br/&gt;These studies will address the following: (i) How do seasonal variations and changes in water&lt;br/&gt;table as a response to storm events influence subsurface arsenic geochemistry, and thus the&lt;br/&gt;mechanisms and rates of arsenic uptake or release? (ii) Does the formation of metastable, mixed&lt;br/&gt;valent iron phases, Fe(II,III) hydroxides (green rust) play an important role in controlling&lt;br/&gt;arsenic attenuation and release? How is the formation and stability of labile iron phases&lt;br/&gt;influenced by storm events and tidal flooding? (iii) Through molecular and macroscopic&lt;br/&gt;modeling based on field and laboratory observations and data, can we predict local changes in&lt;br/&gt;dissolved arsenic and iron concentrations in response to seasonal changes in water table and to&lt;br/&gt;storm events? We will employ X-ray absorption spectroscopic methods, complementary bulk&lt;br/&gt;and spatially resolved geochemical characterizations, hydrologic observations, and molecular&lt;br/&gt;and macroscopic modeling to address these questions at different scales.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Our work will address the mechanisms by which arsenic is attenuated or&lt;br/&gt;mobilized in the environment through identification and understanding of its chemical&lt;br/&gt;speciation. This study will also begin to address the more difficult question of the rates of&lt;br/&gt;arsenic transformation and mobilization in the field, and link temporal changes to mechanisms&lt;br/&gt;identified at molecular and microscopic scales. This comprehensive approach will advance&lt;br/&gt;fundamental understanding of arsenic speciation and mobility, particularly with respect to little&lt;br/&gt;known seasonal fluctuations and field rates of uptake and release.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Worldwide, elevated concentrations of arsenic in groundwater, a known&lt;br/&gt;carcinogen and mutagen, has the potential to adversely impact on the order of 90 million people,&lt;br/&gt;including 13 million in the US. This study will seek mechanistic, thermodynamic, and kinetic&lt;br/&gt;understanding of arsenic mobility in the environment. Our approach seeks to scale results from&lt;br/&gt;molecular to macroscopic and thus, our observations at this model study site will be generally&lt;br/&gt;transferable to other subsurface settings.&lt;br/&gt;The P.I. has recently moved to the University of California at Merced, the first UC&lt;br/&gt;campus to be built in over 35 years. This research proposal will serve to advance both graduate&lt;br/&gt;and undergraduate education at our fledging campus, which seeks to serve underrepresented&lt;br/&gt;groups in the agricultural San Joaquin Valley. In addition, our collaborators for this project&lt;br/&gt;come from industry and a national laboratory, providing opportunities for undergraduate summer&lt;br/&gt;internship programs and collaborative work with graduate students.</AbstractNarration>
