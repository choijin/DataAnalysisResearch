<AbstractNarration>0408895&lt;br/&gt;Silliman&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work examines the transport behavior of LNAPLs in the region bounding the&lt;br/&gt;water table. Defined as the Partially Saturated Fringe, or PSF (Berkowitz et al., 2003),&lt;br/&gt;the region bounding the water table includes the classic Capillary Fringe (CF) and the&lt;br/&gt;region below the water table in which multiple phases (air, water, and/or LNAPL) are&lt;br/&gt;present. This work builds on prior work within our laboratory on Air Entry Barriers (e.g.,&lt;br/&gt;Silliman et al., 2002; Dunn and Silliman, 2003; Dunn et al., 2003) as well as the&lt;br/&gt;substantial literature on LNAPL behavior (e.g., Nambi and Powers, 2000; Illangasekare&lt;br/&gt;et al., 1995a,b; Schroth et al., 1998; Walser et al., 1999; Van Dijke and Van Der Zee,&lt;br/&gt;1997). Of particular interest for the present study is the interaction of the structure of&lt;br/&gt;heterogeneity and the distribution / dissolution of LNAPLs under conditions of a&lt;br/&gt;fluctuating water table. The work is based on a combination of two-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;laboratory and numerical experiments on the distribution of pure- and dissolved-phase&lt;br/&gt;LNAPL in a two-zone porous medium (coarse sand and fine sand). Within the&lt;br/&gt;laboratory, visual and TDR techniques will be used to monitor LNAPL saturation. Mass&lt;br/&gt;of dissolved-phase LNAPL constituents will be monitored at the outflow from the porous&lt;br/&gt;media. Numerical experiments will be performed on simulated random and scaled&lt;br/&gt;porous media and T2VOC, an extension of TOUGH2 [Transport Of Unsaturated&lt;br/&gt;Groundwater and Heat, version II], developed at Lawrence Berkeley National&lt;br/&gt;Laboratory. These experiments will be based on generating a series of realizations of&lt;br/&gt;random distributions of the coarse and fine sands (based on both stationary random&lt;br/&gt;permeability distributions and structured permeability distributions), followed by&lt;br/&gt;simulation of a fluctuating water table with significant LNAPL phase above the original&lt;br/&gt;water table. The laboratory experiments will be utilized to verify LNAPL behavior as&lt;br/&gt;predicted by the numerical model, as well as to provide visualization of LNAPL&lt;br/&gt;behavior. The numerical model will be utilized to address the central hypotheses:&lt;br/&gt;The degree of connectivity (defined within the proposal) of coarse sand lenses&lt;br/&gt;within a fine sand matrix will influence the amount of LNAPL entrapped within&lt;br/&gt;the PSF. Specifically, as the connectivity of the coarse regions increases (with the&lt;br/&gt;same relative volume of coarse and fine sands), the volume of entrapped LNAPL&lt;br/&gt;will decrease.&lt;br/&gt; An increase in the degree of connectivity of coarse sand lenses within a fine sand&lt;br/&gt;matrix will result in a reduced overall rate of dissolution of LNAPL entrapped&lt;br/&gt;within the PSF.&lt;br/&gt;In terms of intellectual merit, this work advances the understanding of controls of&lt;br/&gt;LNAPL distribution and dissolution in the PSF. From a theoretical standpoint, this&lt;br/&gt;provides greater insight into the impact of physical structure on transport characteristics&lt;br/&gt;near the water table. From an applied standpoint, extension of this work holds promise&lt;br/&gt;for innovative means of remediation of LNAPL contaminated systems.&lt;br/&gt;In terms of broader impact, this work will provide training for one Ph.D. and one&lt;br/&gt;Masters student, as well as contributing to undergraduate and graduate courses in&lt;br/&gt;groundwater hydrology and remediation. In addition, this work will aid in further&lt;br/&gt;development of research collaborations with colleagues in western Africa (Benin).</AbstractNarration>
