<AbstractNarration>This Nanotechnology in Undergraduate Education (NUE) award to the Rochester Institute of Technology supports Dr. Sergey E. Lyshevski, Department of Electrical Engineering along with colleagues from Microlectronic Engineering, Department of Physics and the Department of Biological Sciences to develop, evaluate and disseminate a course Nano-Science, Engineering and Technology (NanoSET). This course will integrate six core areas: (1) fundamentals of nano-science and engineering; (2) new physical and chemical phenomena at nanoscale; (3) nanomaterials and nanofabrication; (4) molecular-, carbon- and silicon-based nanoelectronics; (5) nanosystems and biomimetics; (6) hands-on nanoFab and nanoCAD laboratories. In addition, ethics, social issues, economic impact, leadership and entrepreneurship topics will be introduced. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed course integrates vital components of nanoscale science and engineering in a unified interdisciplinary nanotechnology setting. Faculty from the Colleges of Engineering, Science and Liberal Arts will be involved in development and teaching this course. Class notes, experiments, assignments, manuals as well as other course materials and teaching tools will be develop and disseminated. As a part of the dissemination efforts, an interactive web site summarizing the course and allowing free downloading of all course materials will be developed and effectively maintained. We will utilize the best practice and enhance the existing courses in nanotechnology, nanoscience and nanoengineering of different successful Nanotechnology curricula.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal for this award was received in response to the Nanoscale Science and Engineering Education announcement, NSF 03-044, category NUE and was jointly funded by the Division of Engineering Education and Centers (EEC) in the Directorate for Engineering and the Division of Education and Human Resources in the Directorate for Education and Human Resources.</AbstractNarration>
