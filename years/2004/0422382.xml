<AbstractNarration>This project is an extension and expansion of a current CSEMS project scheduled to end in the summer of 2004, and expands the scholarships to two programs in Engineering while continuing to support students in Computer Science, Computer Technology, and Mathematics. It provides twenty-five scholarships per year at Norfolk State University and ten awards to students in their final year at Tidewater Community College, with an understanding that they will receive continued support at the University if they successfully transfer. The major goal of the project is to make awards available to needy and academically strong students, giving them opportunities to be admitted to graduate schools or placed in jobs related to the disciplines as unencumbered as possible. The project also encourages full-time academic study among community college students, encouraging them to transfer into the corresponding University programs.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This project encourages more student concentration on academics, higher acceptances to graduate schools, and better placements into appropriate professions, especially among African-American students. Students are encouraged to do research with faculty advisors and present their work publicly at School and departmental events.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: This project has significant academic and job placement successes among African-Americans and women. It gets their commitments to study full-time and set up professional relationships, and gives them pride and self-esteem as scholarship recipients.</AbstractNarration>
