<AbstractNarration>This condensed matter physics project addresses the behavior of water and its interaction with solid surfaces at the micro and nanoscale. The properties of water in confined geometries are relevant in areas ranging from tribology to biology and atmospheric science. There are controversial results on the fluidity of nano-confined water and the role of surface chemistry and topography is still unclear. The goal of this project is to use state-of-the-art atomic force microscopes to investigate the structure of nano-confined water and its interaction with surfaces at the nanoscale. Students involved in this activity will learn how to use technological relevant instrumentation in an interdisciplinary area. Preparation of courses for graduate and undergraduate students is an integral part of the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Water is the most ubiquitous liquid found in nature. However, it is a much more complicated material than its everyday familiarity might suggest. The goal of this project is to understand the behavior of water and its interaction with solid surfaces at the micro and nano-scale. A better understanding of the behavior of water nano-confined between sliding surfaces can enable improvements in the design and operation of MEMS and hard disks. Furthermore, the structure of water is believed to hold the key to understand protein folding. Students involved in this interdisciplinary project will learn how to use instrumentation relevant in nanotechnology, biology and geophysics. Preparation of courses for graduate and undergraduate students is an integral part of the project.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
