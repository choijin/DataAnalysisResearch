<AbstractNarration>Dr. Chad Mirkin, Chemistry Department, Northwestern University, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division for the rational design of macrocyclic and higher ordered supramolecular structures. The primary objective is to develop a novel synthetic methodology, termed the "Weak-Link Approach" (WLA), for constructing supramolecular structures from symmetrical hemilabile ligands and transition metals. The WLA allows one to rationally design and prepare two- and three-dimensional molecular architectures with dimensions that are extraordinarily large. Moreover, it allows functionality to be introduced into such structures. In this project, two classes of structures are targeted: 1) macrocyclic multimetallic compounds with synthetically programmable structural, chemical, and photophysical properties with unusual host-guest chemistry, and 2) a new type of biomimetic allosteric catalyst for reactions of both synthetic and industrial relevance. Class 1 complexes will consist of ligands and metal centers that provide control over complex size, shape, water solubility, fluorescence, and chirality. Class 2 complexes will use this control to create supramolecular compounds with arrays of metal centers arranged in such a way that reactivity at a distal site will control catalytic chemistry at a catalytic site. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of this proposal are to develop a novel synthetic approach to form very large structures, whose chemical and physical properties can be tailored. A major  aim  of  these  studies  is  to  develop new types of complexes  with  potentially  useful  photochemical  and  catalytic properties. These may have applications in organic synthesis and as molecular sensors. Additionally, these compounds may be useful for separations, particularly of chiral molecules important to the pharmaceutical industry.  The students involved in this project will receive training in both inorganic and analytical methodology, and undergraduate participation will be achieved by leveraging existing REU programs at Northwestern.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
