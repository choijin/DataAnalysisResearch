<AbstractNarration>Proposal to the National Science Foundation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;9th International Conference on Computer-Aided Scheduling of Public Transport&lt;br/&gt;(CASPT 2004)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 9th International Conference on Computer-Aided Scheduling of Public Transport (CASPT) is a forum for recent research and cutting-edge applications of computer-aided methods for scheduling and operating public transport service. The focus of the conference is the field of public transit service planning and operations. Within this field, specific technical topics for the conference cover the areas of information management, network and route planning, vehicle and crew scheduling, and vehicle operations monitoring and management. This conference has been held every 3-4 years since 1975, and has highlighted the interface of academic research with state-of-the-art models and tools used in practice. Historically, the conference has typically drawn 100-150 participants, including internationally recognized researchers, software developers, and practitioners. As such, this conference is by far the most relevant and focused technical conference in public transport service planning and operations in the world. The proceedings from previous CASPT conferences are considered the primary technical reference in this subject area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In its role in promoting fundamental research and advancement of new technical methods, we are requesting financial support from the NSF to conduct this conference. The overall budget for the conference is estimated to be $47,500. We are requesting $16,000 from the NSF to support travel expenses for key participants, to provide reduced conference registration costs for students, and to support the development and distribution of the conference proceedings to participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference is planned for August 9-11, 2004, in San Diego, California. The conference will include both plenary sessions and two parallel tracks for presentation and discussion of technical papers. In this format, we expect that approximately 40 full papers will be presented and discussed at the conference. Those who wish to have their papers accepted for the conference proceedings will be subject to peer review. The selected papers will then be published by Springer-Verlag in their series, Lecture Notes in Economics and Mathematical Systems. All conference attendees will receive a copy of the proceedings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
