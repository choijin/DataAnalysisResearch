<AbstractNarration>Morris College will implement comprehensive approaches to strengthen the institution's undergraduate science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education and research infrastructure. The College will use NSF support to: (1) revise and enhance STEM gate-keeper courses by infusing research and technology into the curricula; (2) enhance student preparation and success by providing on- and off-campus research opportunities, stipends and scholarships, tutorials, and graduate school preparation; (3) enhance faculty development by engaging faculty in on- and off-campus research activities and by attending seminars, workshops and professional conferences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project lies in its use of research, technology and student support activities to enhance student performance in STEM to the level where they become competitive scholars and researchers prepared for graduate school enrollment and success and research careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The impact of this collection of strategies is to increase the representation of under-represented minorities in STEM disciplines and the national STEM workforce.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
