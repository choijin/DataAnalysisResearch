    <AbstractNarration>Proposal DMS-0403983&lt;br/&gt;PI: Nader Masmoudi, Courant Institute-NYU&lt;br/&gt;Title: Asymptotic problems in fluid mechanics, gas dynamics&lt;br/&gt; and quantum mechanics&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Principal Investigator (PI) proposes to continue working on&lt;br/&gt;some asymptotic problems coming from Fluid Mechanics, Gas&lt;br/&gt;Dynamics and Quantum Mechanics. These asymptotic problems arise&lt;br/&gt;when a dimensionless parameter (such as the Reynolds number, the&lt;br/&gt;Mach number or a time scaling) goes to zero or to infinity. In&lt;br/&gt;studying these problems, many mathematical difficulties arise.&lt;br/&gt;These difficulties are mainly due to the change of the type of&lt;br/&gt;the equations, the presence of many temporal and spatial scales,&lt;br/&gt;the presence of resonances, the presence of boundary layers ...&lt;br/&gt;Many tools have been developed to circumvent these difficulties&lt;br/&gt;such as the introduction of different types of measures to&lt;br/&gt;describe the defect of strong convergence,&lt;br/&gt; the use of compensated compactness type&lt;br/&gt; arguments, the use of averaging lemma, the use of&lt;br/&gt;energy methods and relative entropy methods ... Of course, many&lt;br/&gt;other tools should be developed in the future. More specifically&lt;br/&gt;the PI plans to continue working on the hydrodynamic limits of&lt;br/&gt;the Boltzmann equation when the Knudsen number goes to 0&lt;br/&gt;especially in bounded domains and relate this to some of the known&lt;br/&gt;results in the compressible-incompressible limit. He also plans to&lt;br/&gt;look at the limit when the Weber number goes to infinity in the&lt;br/&gt;water wave problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI proposes to study some asymptotic problems coming from&lt;br/&gt;Fluid Mechanics, Gas Dynamics and Quantum Mechanics. The study of&lt;br/&gt;these asymptotic problems is very important to get a better&lt;br/&gt;understanding about the behavior of complicated systems in&lt;br/&gt;different limiting cases. This also allows to have a better&lt;br/&gt;understanding of the real physical phenomenon taking place.&lt;br/&gt;Moreover, it provides a way of giving rigorous derivations of&lt;br/&gt;different physical models. It also gives a better knowledge about&lt;br/&gt;the domain of validity of each simplifying model. This is very&lt;br/&gt;important for engineers and physicists who are looking for the&lt;br/&gt;simplest model that captures the phenomenon to implement&lt;br/&gt;numerically or to apply in real life.</AbstractNarration>
