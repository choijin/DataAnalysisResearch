<AbstractNarration>The Hot Quarks 2004 Workshop will take place on July 18-24, 2004 &lt;br/&gt;in Taos, NM. The main topic of the workshop is the physics&lt;br/&gt;of strongly interacting nuclear matter at extreme energy densities.&lt;br/&gt;Quantum Chromo-Dynamics, the theory describing the forces acting &lt;br/&gt;within atomic nuclei, predicts that at sufficiently&lt;br/&gt;high temperatures and/or densities, matter should undergo a&lt;br/&gt;transition from the standard hadronic phase to a plasma of&lt;br/&gt;deconfined quarks and gluons (Quark Gluon Plasma, QGP) - a&lt;br/&gt;transition which, according to our cosmological models,&lt;br/&gt;took place in the early universe about 10 microseconds after the Big&lt;br/&gt;Bang.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Already the programs at the Brookhaven National Laboratory&lt;br/&gt;Alternating Gradient Synchrotron (AGS) and the CERN Super Proton&lt;br/&gt;Synchrotron (SPS) have produced evidence for the onset of new&lt;br/&gt;phenomena. The research in this field is now successfully&lt;br/&gt;continuing at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC) at BNL&lt;br/&gt;while the next phase, to take place at the CERN Large Hadron&lt;br/&gt;Collider (LHC), is under preparation. There are around 2000&lt;br/&gt;physicists worldwide working in the field: a very active&lt;br/&gt;and lively, expanding community. In such a context, good&lt;br/&gt;communication and networking, especially among the young and&lt;br/&gt;productive members in the field, are vital.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of this particular workshop is to enhance the direct &lt;br/&gt;exchange of scientific information among the younger &lt;br/&gt;members of the community (graduate students, postdocs and &lt;br/&gt;junior faculty), both from the experiment and theory. &lt;br/&gt;Participation in the workshop will be by invitation &lt;br/&gt;only - in order to strengthen  the emphasis on younger members&lt;br/&gt;of the community, participation will be restricted to people&lt;br/&gt;who have obtained their Ph.D. no earlier than 1989.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This particular approach makes the workshop unique among the &lt;br/&gt;various workshops and conferences in the field. &lt;br/&gt;For young scientists it represents an opportunity &lt;br/&gt;for exchange and exposure that that they would not have in one of &lt;br/&gt;the major big conferences. It will help to stimulate &lt;br/&gt;the next generation of the field and strengthen their sense &lt;br/&gt;of community. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
