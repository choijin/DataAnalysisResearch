<AbstractNarration>Engineering-Mechanical (56) &lt;br/&gt;This proof-of-concept project is developing a hands-on and virtual mechanics of materials laboratory module that uses MEMS optical switching to detect flexural and torsional modes in a micro-size cantilever beam. In addition, the project is developing web-based curriculum to support the laboratory. The laboratory experiment is being developed two ways. One method uses minimum facilities and equipment so that the equipment can be easily transported for use in outreach programs to recruit pre-college students. The other uses electronic measuring and data acquisition systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The on-line web-based virtual laboratory includes a series of steps that must be followed to complete the lab. At each step the students are asked rhetorical and analytical questions about the experiment in order to reinforce a particular concept about mechanics of materials. The online material is being designed so that it can measure the growth of students' reasoning and problem solving skills through a pre-post assessment process. Students are being divided into sets of control groups to determine the effect that each of the methods has on students' conceptual development of mechanics of materials and its applications to MEMS. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The MEMS experiments project is advancing the knowledge and understanding about MEMS, semiconductor materials and properties, and how they can be used in developing micro sensing devices to study fundamental concepts in solid mechanics, electrostatics and introductory physics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;Sandia National Laboratories is collaborating with the PIs to help develop the material. The web-based materials permits global access to the experiments and are being disseminated through conferences and publications. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
