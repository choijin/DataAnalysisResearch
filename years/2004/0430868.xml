<AbstractNarration>Title: "Models and Methods for Robust and Conic Optimization"&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;Uncertainty is an inevitable feature of many decision making &lt;br/&gt;environments. On a regular basis, engineers, economists, investment&lt;br/&gt;professionals, and others need to make decisions to optimize a system&lt;br/&gt;with incomplete  information and considerable uncertainty. &lt;br/&gt;Understanding, quantifying, and managing uncertainty is critical&lt;br/&gt;to the success and effectiveness of their decisions. &lt;br/&gt;Robust optimization refers to the modeling of optimization problems&lt;br/&gt;with data uncertainty with the objective of  &lt;br/&gt;obtaining a solution that is guaranteed to &lt;br/&gt;perform well under all possible realizations of the uncertain parameters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will introduce novel approaches&lt;br/&gt;for the characterization of robustness in uncertain systems&lt;br/&gt;and develop efficient and reliable optimization algorithms for &lt;br/&gt;identification of robust solutions. &lt;br/&gt;In particular, the project will focus on (i) developing methods to &lt;br/&gt;identify solutions that are ``relative robust'', i.e., solutions that &lt;br/&gt;are good in each scenario, where the quality of the&lt;br/&gt;solution is measured relative to the best solution of &lt;br/&gt;each scenario; (ii) developing new models and methods for&lt;br/&gt;``adjustable robust optimization'', i.e., for problems with &lt;br/&gt;uncertainty where a subset of the decision variables can be&lt;br/&gt;adjusted after some of the uncertain variables are&lt;br/&gt;observed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In many cases, robust optimization formulations are expressed&lt;br/&gt;as the problem of optimizing a linear function over a set defined &lt;br/&gt;by linear equalities and cone membership constraints, a so-called&lt;br/&gt;conic optimization problem. Implementation efforts will &lt;br/&gt;include the development of structure-exploiting algorithms &lt;br/&gt;for the solution of large-scale conic optimization problems. &lt;br/&gt;In particular, problems with fixed variables, cone intersection &lt;br/&gt;constraints, and quadratic objectives will be studied. &lt;br/&gt;The resulting algorithms will be carefully implemented and &lt;br/&gt;the software will be freely distributed.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Robust and conic optimization formulations are used to model  &lt;br/&gt;a wide array of applications in many diverse fields. &lt;br/&gt;For example, robust optimization problems arise when some &lt;br/&gt;of the input parameters of a given optimization problem &lt;br/&gt;are unknown or uncertain, which is &lt;br/&gt;common in finance, economics, and engineering models. &lt;br/&gt;Conic optimization problems are encountered in truss design, &lt;br/&gt;control and system theory, statistics, eigenvalue optimization, &lt;br/&gt;antenna array weight design, and mathematical finance.&lt;br/&gt;Given their wide applicability, the progress achieved through this&lt;br/&gt;project in solving these problem classes more efficiently&lt;br/&gt;and effectively, will benefit activities in many of the&lt;br/&gt;disciplines listed above. In addition, the project work&lt;br/&gt;will be integrated into the PI's ongoing teaching, training,&lt;br/&gt;and  outreach activities through &lt;br/&gt;(i) the CMU Summer Institute, (ii) the teaching of a &lt;br/&gt;project-based course that benefits local industries and organizations, &lt;br/&gt;(iii) "NEC: Give a Day, Make a Difference" program.</AbstractNarration>
