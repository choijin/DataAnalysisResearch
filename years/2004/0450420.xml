<AbstractNarration>Abstract for: &lt;br/&gt;Evaluating Bridge Reliability Following Natural and Man-Made Hazards in Real-Time: Formulating an International Collaborative Research Program, CMS proposal 0450420&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI:  Ahmet Aktan, Drexel&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is being submitted to NSF's Structural Systems and Engineering: Structural&lt;br/&gt;Systems and Hazards Mitigation of Structures program of the Division of Civil and&lt;br/&gt;Mechanical Systems. Dr. Steven McCabe is the Program Director and Dr. Galip Ulsoy is the&lt;br/&gt;Division Director. The objective of the proposal is to solicit a small travel grant for a&lt;br/&gt;group of academic, government and industry representatives to travel from the US to Japan&lt;br/&gt;for three related purposes: (a) Participating at the International Association for Bridge&lt;br/&gt;Management and Safety Conference at Kyoto, Japan (IABMAS?04, 18-22 October, 2004), (b)&lt;br/&gt;Participating at a meeting of the Executive Council of the International Society for&lt;br/&gt;Structural Health Monitoring and Intelligent Infrastructures (ISHMII) that is being&lt;br/&gt;arranged to take place at Kyoto on October 20, (c) Participating at a half-day Workshop&lt;br/&gt;between the US and International participants of a problem-focused collaborative research&lt;br/&gt;project: "Evaluating the Reliability of Highway Bridges In Real-Time Following Hazards By&lt;br/&gt;Structural Health Monitoring" during 17 October.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research project for "Bridge Reliability Following Hazards.." offers significant&lt;br/&gt;potential for buy-in from bridge owners. This is necessary to overcome the reluctance of&lt;br/&gt;most bridge owners to embrace new technology and to demonstrate how leveraging recent&lt;br/&gt;research and technology development pays by advancing the state-of-practice for&lt;br/&gt;post-hazard emergency response and recovery of the highway transportation infrastructure.&lt;br/&gt;We note that there is consensus between government engineers from State DOT's such as&lt;br/&gt;CALTRANS, as well as FHWA and USGS that reliable post-hazard condition assessment of&lt;br/&gt;critical elements of the highway infrastructure is perhaps the single most pressing&lt;br/&gt;problem urgently requiring research and leveraging of technology for advancing the&lt;br/&gt;state-of-practice. Based on various meetings between groups of stakeholders at Sacramento,&lt;br/&gt;Irvine and Bethlehem, the outline of a collaborative multi-institutional research project&lt;br/&gt;has been formulated by a group of academic, government and industry participants. The&lt;br/&gt;research will be detailed in a proposal before January '05. The US participants of this&lt;br/&gt;collaborative project will be soliciting funding from various federal and state government&lt;br/&gt;agencies, and especially the NEES Program, while the European and Japanese participants&lt;br/&gt;already have or will receive funding from their respective governments. The outline of&lt;br/&gt;this project and the current participants will be described further in the following.&lt;br/&gt;In addition to supporting the travel of a US delegation to continue building an extremely&lt;br/&gt;rewarding international collaboration with their counterparts from Canada, Europe and the&lt;br/&gt;Far East, a travel grant requested by this proposal will continue to serve for building a&lt;br/&gt;strategic relationship between the two U.S. federal government agencies that have&lt;br/&gt;responsibility for advancing the engineering and management of critical infrastructure&lt;br/&gt;systems. Since 23 April 2003, NSF and FHWA have been exploring a synergistic partnership&lt;br/&gt;for launching a holistic and problem-focused research initiative to enhance the&lt;br/&gt;operations, protection and preservation of the highway transportation infrastructure. This&lt;br/&gt;program is envisioned to take advantage of actual highways and bridges as test-sites that&lt;br/&gt;will be transformed into field laboratories for scientific research. There is further&lt;br/&gt;opportunity to expand an NSF-FHWA partnership by including USGS and NIST as we expect that&lt;br/&gt;delegates from these latter agencies will also be present. Additional information on the&lt;br/&gt;background of the proposed partnership for research and collaborations between the&lt;br/&gt;academic and industry communities associated with NSF and FHWA is presented in the&lt;br/&gt;following sections of the proposal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
