<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will develop and qualify a Non-Intrusive Electrical Monitor product (NEMO) to provide inexpensive, accurate, in-depth monitoring of electrical usage, permit expanded energy savings and provide additional information, like potential equipment faults and failures.  NEMO can greatly increase the amounts and kinds of diagnostic information that can be gleaned from a single set of electrical measurements, thus lowering the cost of monitoring building energy management systems.  NEMO needs only voltage and current measurement at the point of electrical service entry to the building.  By analyzing the transient signatures produced when different electrical equipment draws power, NEMO can identify which of multiple loads turn on and off and assess their condition.  The objectives of the research are to determine: the reliability of NEMO algorithms in the presence of multiple loads, prioritize several possible diagnostic analyses for the commercial product, and maximize the automation of NEMO data analysis while minimizing the need for human scrutiny and intervention. The Phase I research plan calls for installation of qualified prototype hardware in commercial buildings and collection of energy use pattern data.  Data analysis will reveal inefficiencies in building operation and effectiveness of the algorithms themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop a system for non-intrusive detection and identification of multiple electrical loads with major energy conservation and other benefits.  Time of use data can be used to create new automated algorithms that minimize energy use and optimize heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system operation without affecting occupant comfort, while electrical health diagnostics can signal when a motor is nearing failure or a valve has jammed.  A reduction in the cost of in-depth monitoring allows more commercial facilities to reap energy and maintenance savings from these algorithms and the NEMO product that contains them.  Actual measurement rather than estimation of initial and ongoing electrical power consumption of electrical equipment within a commercial building enables verification of upgrade performance.  It also facilitates design and operation of intelligent, energy efficient buildings and assists in attaining Leadership in Energy Efficient Design (LEEDTM) certification.  By promoting energy efficiency in buildings, NEMO will enable commercial and government building customers to reduce their energy costs and increase their profitability.  The net result should also be a decrease in America's reliance on imported energy sources.</AbstractNarration>
