<AbstractNarration>Biological Science (61). This CCLI Adaptation and Implementation Type II project supports the collaboration of six regional Appalachian institutions from five states (Ferrum College, King College, Sewanee: The University of the South, Lindsey Wilson College, West Virginia Wesleyan College, and Montreat College) who are seeking to strengthen their field science offerings by the collaborative study of watersheds near their respective colleges.  The project addresses the need to engage students in hands-on inquiry-based experimental activities through the adoption of a small watershed research approach -- providing shared curricula (via an online Lab Manual for Small Watershed Studies (eManual)), electronic data sharing, and participation in cross-site collaborative student research projects supported by fully equipped field sites at each campus.  In addition to inquiry-based laboratory exercises (modeled after LTER and GLOBE activities), and participation in a common research project across all watershed sites, students may conduct personally designed field studies, sharing their findings online and at a student research symposium.  Instructors also receive training in the use of the equipment and methodology at faculty development workshops.  This project may serve as a model for other small undergraduate institutions hoping to improve student learning via a collaborative approach to environmental or field studies.</AbstractNarration>
