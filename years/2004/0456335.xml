<AbstractNarration>This is a collaborative study between seismologists, mineral &lt;br/&gt;physicists and geodynamicists at UC Berkeley and at the Univ. of &lt;br/&gt;Michigan, the goal of which is  to combine observational constraints &lt;br/&gt;and theoretical tools from their respective&lt;br/&gt;fields and investigate large scale 3D variations in temperature and &lt;br/&gt;major element chemistry in the earth's upper mantle directly from the &lt;br/&gt;inversion of seismic waveforms.  At the heart of this proposed study &lt;br/&gt;is the conjecture, supported by theoretical&lt;br/&gt;considerations, that the one step inversion of seismic waveforms for &lt;br/&gt;physical parameters such as composition C and temperature T, should &lt;br/&gt;yield more stable results than the standard approach of first &lt;br/&gt;inverting for velocity and attenuation structure separately, and then &lt;br/&gt;interpreting the obtained maps in terms of physical  parameters. The &lt;br/&gt;latter is currently inhibited by the poor resolution in 3D upper &lt;br/&gt;mantle attenuation, Q, due to contamination of amplitudes by largely &lt;br/&gt;unmodelled, but&lt;br/&gt;significant, effects of focusing and scattering. The coupled &lt;br/&gt;character of the equations in the one step approach, combined with &lt;br/&gt;the strong sensitivity of amplitudes to T (through anelastic terms) &lt;br/&gt;should offset the approximate character of the available mineral &lt;br/&gt;physics partial derivatives as well as the errors due to inadequate &lt;br/&gt;theoretical treatment of focusing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators will: 1) invert a global collection of long period &lt;br/&gt;seismic waveforms for T and radial anisotropy, using recent&lt;br/&gt;experimental contraints on dispersion and attenuation in the &lt;br/&gt;uppermost mantle; 2) starting from the model obtained in (1), they &lt;br/&gt;will test their ability to invert for lateral variations in &lt;br/&gt;composition (as expressed in terms of basalt depletion).  Partial &lt;br/&gt;derivatives with respect to C and their uncertainties will be &lt;br/&gt;evaluated and provided by the mineral physicists in the team using a &lt;br/&gt;self-consistent formalism  which incorporates results from &lt;br/&gt;experiments and first principles calculations.  At this point, they &lt;br/&gt;will also incorporate geodynamical constraints  to increase &lt;br/&gt;resolution of the compositional component of the inversion.  An &lt;br/&gt;iterative procedure will be required at each step in the inversion &lt;br/&gt;process, because of the dependence of various partial derivatives on &lt;br/&gt;temperature, due to the presence of strong attenuation and phase &lt;br/&gt;changes, as well as the large uncertainties remaining in the &lt;br/&gt;estimation of these partial derivatives.  The project includes &lt;br/&gt;funding for two students and a post doc, who will be trained using a &lt;br/&gt;cross-disciplinary approach.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
