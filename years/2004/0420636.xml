<AbstractNarration>With this grant, we will purchase a scanning probe microscope (Quesant Instruments Model 350) for the characterization of various material systems by atomic force microscopy.  The instrument will include accessories to allow us to image systems in liquid environments.  Two specific projects will benefit immediately from the acquisition: (1) in-situ measurements of the dissolution of lead apatite and (2) characterization of semiconductor thin films.  The former is motivated by the common practice of reclaiming lead-contaminated soils by immobilizing the lead in the stable lead apatite.   We propose to study the microstructural changes that occur in this mineral in acidic environments, as acidic environments are known to increase the solubility of lead apatite.  The latter project involves a collaboration with the University of Utah where the atomic force microscope will provide complementary information to the electronic and optical characterization of heterogeneous semiconducting materials conducted at that institution.  An example of such a system is microcrystalline silicon, where the size of crystalline grains can dramatically affect the electronic properties and device characteristics.  This acquisition will also benefit the educational mission of our institution, as the instrument can be used in several classes either for classroom demonstrations or instructional exercises.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this grant, we will acquire an atomic force microscope, an instrument capable of imaging materials on the sub-micrometer scale, for undergraduate research in physics and geosciences.  This acquisition will, by itself, significantly enhance the research capabilities of our institution.  Two faculty members at Weber State University and several undergraduate students will use this equipment to study such problems as the reclamation of lead-contaminated soils and the structure of materials used for semiconducting devices, such as solar cells.  The instrument will also be used for several instructional laboratories and class demonstrations for the geoscience and physics departments at Weber State, affecting dozens of students in several of our courses every year.  Results of undergraduate research and materials related to this instrumentation relevant to our classes will be posted on our websites, which reach a large number of students inside and outside our departments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
