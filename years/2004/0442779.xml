<AbstractNarration>Human anatomy and physiology are complex and difficult subjects for students when typically first encountered in college coursework.  The complexity arises from the functional interactions of multiple organ systems; the difficulty from an extensive and unique terminology and intricate spatial relationships.  One limitation to learning stems from the mode of presentation, which typically consists of static images of artists' two-dimensional illustrations or abstract diagrams.  Another is the limited, or complete lack of access to human cadavers in college level anatomy and neuroscience classes.  Combined with a shrinking supply of qualified faculty (National Research Council, 1998), there is clearly a need for alternative teaching and learning experiences. The long-term goal for this project is to design, develop and evaluate interactive, multimedia educational programs that help students efficiently learn and understand human gross anatomy, neuroanatomy and physiology.  When fully developed, the educational material will explore the gross anatomy, histology and function of the sensory portion of the nervous system.  The specific aims of this proof-of-concept proposal are to: &lt;br/&gt;a) Develop a prototype that focuses on one sensory system, i.e., visual system, using interactive multimedia elements. &lt;br/&gt;b) Conduct a pilot test to evaluate the usability of the prototype and its impact on student learning with the intended audience of undergraduate students and instructors. &lt;br/&gt;c) Report findings of the evaluation and communicate information about the prototype to professional communities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With Anatomy Revealed - Sensory Systems (and its prototype), students are able to:&lt;br/&gt;(1) Explore interrelationships between nervous system structures using a dynamic, interactive learning program, (2) appreciate how the material is relevant to their personal life, as well as basic human biology and health, and (3) test their knowledge and progress using both formative and summative feedback.  In addition, since college instructors of human anatomy and physiology rarely have human anatomical material available, the software serves as a "virtual cadaver" to help make these complex systems more easily understandable.  While these learning tools will be useful to many students, the highly visual and interactive tutorial approach could meet the needs of a variety of learning styles.  The three evaluation sites, Kentucky State University (KSU), University of Kentucky and Owens State Community College, have diverse student populations. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
