<AbstractNarration>Proposal DMS-0401323&lt;br/&gt;Title: Linear partial differential equations on singular spaces&lt;br/&gt;P.I.: Jared Wunsch, Northwestern University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will study differential operators on manifolds with singular metric&lt;br/&gt;structures.  One project focuses on the wave equation on singular spaces;&lt;br/&gt;together with Melrose, the PI has shown that in general, a singularity of&lt;br/&gt;a solution to the wave equation interacts with a cone point to produce a&lt;br/&gt;"diffracted" spherical wavefront emanating from the cone point.  The&lt;br/&gt;singularity of the diffracted front may be weaker than that of the&lt;br/&gt;incident front if the latter is not too precisely focused on the cone&lt;br/&gt;point.  Melrose and the PI hope to generalize these results to more&lt;br/&gt;complex singular geometries, perhaps eventually to include a large class&lt;br/&gt;of stratified spaces.  Another direction of research involves the&lt;br/&gt;Schroedinger equation on noncompact manifold endowed with "scattering"&lt;br/&gt;metrics (e.g. short-range perturbations of Euclidean spaces).  Together&lt;br/&gt;with Hassell and Tao, the PI is involved in a project to prove sharp&lt;br/&gt;Strichartz estimates for the Schroedinger equation in this geometric&lt;br/&gt;setting.  Hassell and the PI also hope to provide a precise description of&lt;br/&gt;the propagator for the Schroedinger equation, extending an earlier result&lt;br/&gt;which yielded part of its Schwartz kernel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A central question in the mathematical theory of quantum mechanics is:  &lt;br/&gt;what is the relationship between the classical dynamics of a particle and&lt;br/&gt;its corresponding quantum states?  Insights into this problem have come&lt;br/&gt;not only from the direct study of the quantum mechanical energy operator&lt;br/&gt;or "Hamiltonian" itself, but also from studying a host of other&lt;br/&gt;fundamental equations involving it, such as the heat equation, the wave&lt;br/&gt;equation, and, naturally, the time-dependent Schroedinger equation.  The&lt;br/&gt;focus of the PI's research is thus the geometric analysis of several kinds&lt;br/&gt;of partial differential equations.  One project investigates what happens&lt;br/&gt;to waves as they interact with (a certain generalization of) sharp&lt;br/&gt;corners---the geometry of how wavefronts move can be quite subtle in these&lt;br/&gt;cases owing to the effects of diffraction.  Another project is to study&lt;br/&gt;the structure of solutions of the Schroedinger equation on unbounded&lt;br/&gt;spaces; such solutions describe the time-evolution of a quantum particle.  &lt;br/&gt;A related focus of research is to obtain certain estimates of solutions to&lt;br/&gt;the Schroedinger equation in order to improve our understanding the&lt;br/&gt;nonlinear Schroedinger equation, which arises in nonlinear optics and the&lt;br/&gt;theory of Bose-Einstein condensates, among other physical applications.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
