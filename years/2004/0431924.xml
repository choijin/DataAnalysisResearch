<AbstractNarration>The Departments of Electrical and Computer Engineering and Mechanical Engineering in collaboration  with educational colleagues is planning to develop new and reformulated curricula in computer, electrical, and mechanical engineering. The project is titled Vertical Integration of Computer, Electrical and Mechanical Engineering Education, or VIE, which is symbolic, as the word vie means to invite, challenge, strive, compete. This project will invite and challenge a number of constituencies to work together to improve student learning through integrated programs and experiences. The fundamental premise of the proposed project is integration: curriculum integration, integration of research and teaching, integration of interdisciplinary information, and integration through community. This project proposes the learning stream model with multifaceted educational objectives, including: curriculum integration through the learning stream model, application of the learning stream model to inquiry-based learning, integrated information resources to support interdisciplinary learning streams, and extension of the learning stream model to precollege engineering education. The goal of VIE is to create a connected learning environment, in which college students see connections across courses and disciplines, pre-college students see connections to engineering, undergraduates see connections to research and practice, and students and teachers at all levels benefit from the interaction and mentoring that takes place in the process of discovery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The VIE project introduces the novel concept of a learning stream and defines the learning stream model for an engineering program. The learning stream model naturally bridges research and inquiry with teaching, through problem-based learning. A component of this project will apply a new resource model to develop an integrated set of educational resources for a learning stream. This facilitates interdisciplinary learning streams. In addition to connecting students across courses in a learning stream, the VIE project proposes an outreach component to connect graduate, undergraduate, precollege students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The model itself is expected to be a reference for any engineering program. The goal of re-shaping the curriculum is to better prepare engineering students and graduates to learn and apply knowledge. As a result, it will serve many sectors having a stake in the quality of engineering graduates. The model is designed to close the knowledge gaps between courses. The model can be extended to enhance educational opportunities for all students, including precollege, women, and minority students. The model will help faculty teach differently, and it will help students learn differently. It has the potential to change the social fabric of the academic environment.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
