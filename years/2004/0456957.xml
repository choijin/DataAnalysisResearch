<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests funds to support the inaugural Northeast&lt;br/&gt;Student Workshop on Nonlinear and Hybrid Control, to be held at the&lt;br/&gt;Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute from Friday, April 1, through&lt;br/&gt;Saturday, April 2, 2005. The goal of the workshop is to offer&lt;br/&gt;educational opportunities to graduate students and junior&lt;br/&gt;researchers to learn about the latest developments in control&lt;br/&gt;systems research, particularly in emerging application areas; to&lt;br/&gt;present their research results; and to share and discuss ideas with&lt;br/&gt;their peers, as well as with faculty members from other&lt;br/&gt;universities. The proximity of the universities in the Northeast&lt;br/&gt;provides an excellent opportunity to realize this goal with minimal&lt;br/&gt;travel cost. Upon a successful initiation with the help of NSF&lt;br/&gt;funds, these workshops will be continued biannually. The&lt;br/&gt;intellectual merit of the proposed activity is that it will provide&lt;br/&gt;a stimulus for sustained research in control systems theory, as well&lt;br/&gt;as increased number of applications in other fields of science and&lt;br/&gt;engineering. The broad impact resulting from the proposed workshop&lt;br/&gt;will be the encouragement of a broader and more diverse group of&lt;br/&gt;students (than those who are already able to attend major&lt;br/&gt;conferences in the field) to pursue research careers.</AbstractNarration>
