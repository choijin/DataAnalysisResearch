<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Olafsson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project deals with a variety of problems in modern harmonic analysis.&lt;br/&gt;It combines ideas and problems from abstract harmonic analysis&lt;br/&gt;and representation theory on Lie groups related to&lt;br/&gt;symmetric spaces with tools and questions well&lt;br/&gt;known from classical Euclidean harmonic analysis. Our list of&lt;br/&gt;problems includes a detailed study of series of representations occurring&lt;br/&gt;in the regular representation on Pseudo-Riemannian symmetric spaces and, in&lt;br/&gt;particular,  geometric realizations of those representations using&lt;br/&gt;tools from complex analysis. Part of this study is the interplay between&lt;br/&gt;special functions and the spherical character of representations&lt;br/&gt;occurring discretely in the regular representation.&lt;br/&gt;Our study also includes  compactification&lt;br/&gt;of symmetric spaces, application of representation theory to special functions,&lt;br/&gt;in particular, Laguerre functions and polynomials.&lt;br/&gt;On the other hand the proposal includes problems related to wavelet theory,&lt;br/&gt;function spaces on cones and other symmetric spaces, in particular,&lt;br/&gt;Besov spaces. The proposed work combines methods and ideas from several areas&lt;br/&gt;of mathematics: Complex analysis, group actions on manifolds and function&lt;br/&gt;spaces, in particular, Besov, Fock, and Hardy spaces, and  classical harmonic analysis. &lt;br/&gt;It even borrows some ideas from applied mathematics. Parts of the proposed work will be&lt;br/&gt;done in collaboration with our students as well as specialists in USA and Europe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Harmonic analysis has its origin in the work of Fourier on the heat equation,&lt;br/&gt;which led him to consider the expansion of a periodic functions into superposition&lt;br/&gt;of trigonometric functions. This can be interpreted either as the spectral&lt;br/&gt;decomposition of the differential operators with constant coefficients, or&lt;br/&gt;as decomposition of regular representation into irreducible representations.&lt;br/&gt;In short, the subject of harmonic analysis is to study functions or&lt;br/&gt;function spaces by decomposing the functions into  simpler functions. In&lt;br/&gt;the theory of differential equations this decomposition  means to  write&lt;br/&gt;an arbitrary functions as a sum or integral of eigenfunctions. In several&lt;br/&gt;applications,  as in image processing, the wavelets shows up as the basic&lt;br/&gt;atoms used to approximate or represent the signal. If we have a symmetry&lt;br/&gt;group acting on the system, then we would like to write an arbitrary&lt;br/&gt;function as a sum of  functions that transforms in a simple and controllable&lt;br/&gt;way under the symmetry group, leading  to representation theory of&lt;br/&gt;the symmetry group. Both aspects usually involve the study of integral&lt;br/&gt;transforms and the corresponding kernel function.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
