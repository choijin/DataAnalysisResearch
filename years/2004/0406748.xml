<AbstractNarration>This proposal addresses the fundamental challenge of creating a theory &lt;br/&gt;that gives rise to directionally unbiased, fast processing of images &lt;br/&gt;and multidimensional data structures. The proposed Isotropic Multiresolution &lt;br/&gt;Analysis (IMRA) enables decompositions of data structures without &lt;br/&gt;orientational preference that parallel the numerical efficiency of one &lt;br/&gt;dimensional MRA-wavelet constructions. A crucial ingredient of this new theory &lt;br/&gt;is an MRA of radial functions based on an innovative concept of radial &lt;br/&gt;translations. Together with a suitable angular resolution, this allows to &lt;br/&gt;replicate all the beneficial characteristics of classical one-dimensional &lt;br/&gt;MRA-wavelets in higher dimensions. Therefore, IMRA-wavelets are expected to &lt;br/&gt;parallel the success of their one-dimensional predecessors in isolating edges &lt;br/&gt;and separating textures. Compared to previous attempts of MRA-construtions &lt;br/&gt;in higher dimensions, IMRAs combine symmetry properties, smoothness, and &lt;br/&gt;compactness of support of scaling functions and wavelets to an unprecedented &lt;br/&gt;degree. The proposed theory is anticipated to have a significant impact on all &lt;br/&gt;areas of digital signal processing in two or more dimensions, especially in &lt;br/&gt;biomedical image processing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To date, digital image processing systems commonly handle data in a row &lt;br/&gt;and column fashion. Although this pixelized approach is natural for digital &lt;br/&gt;machines, it is much less natural if the objective is to extract information &lt;br/&gt;from natural images or more general multidimensional data structures. In this &lt;br/&gt;proposal, we create a mathematical theory that mimicks features of retinal &lt;br/&gt;processing by mammalian visual systems. Retinal processing is known to detect &lt;br/&gt;edges and textures at different scales of spatial and temporal resolution, &lt;br/&gt;regardless of their orientation and of the topology of their boundary contours. &lt;br/&gt;The proposed theory of Isotropic Multiresolution Analysis (IMRA) offers a way &lt;br/&gt;of digitizing analog signals and of synthesizing analog signals from digital &lt;br/&gt;data in a manner that is more compatible with the "digitization" of natural &lt;br/&gt;images performed by our retina. One particular component of IMRAs is the use of &lt;br/&gt;radial translations, inspired by the evolving wave pattern created when a rock &lt;br/&gt;falls in a pond of calm water. To ensure fast numerical processing &lt;br/&gt;capabilities, we use concepts similar to those in the framework of wavelets, &lt;br/&gt;which have proved computationally efficient in the processing of one- &lt;br/&gt;dimensional signals, e.g. audio. The intellectual merit of this work is that it &lt;br/&gt;delivers directionally unbiased, fast processing capabilities to all areas of &lt;br/&gt;digital signal processing of two or more dimensions, in particular to &lt;br/&gt;biomedical image processing. The Fast Isotropic Wavelet Algorithms resulting &lt;br/&gt;from our theory will be applied to anonymized medical patient data provided to &lt;br/&gt;us by the world renowned Texas Heart Institute (THI) in a joint effort for the &lt;br/&gt;accurate and early detection of the formation of vulnerable plaque in coronary &lt;br/&gt;arteries. The goal of this effort is an accurate non-invasive initial screening &lt;br/&gt;test to assess the risk of mycardial infarcts using CT-scans of the heart. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
