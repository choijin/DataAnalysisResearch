<AbstractNarration>This project is producing and disseminating a series of twenty instructional videos based upon laboratory exercises contained in five new information and communications technology textbooks that were developed and published with earlier funding.  The videos serve as enhancements to the textbooks and allow for customization by end users as stand alone products.  The PI plans to deliver all videos in a variety of formats including CDs, DVDs, and streamed through the PI's institution's website.  This flexibility allows instructors to addresses distance-learning needs and the diversity of student learning styles and backgrounds.  All videos are being enhanced by closed captions, voice narration and talking menus and all are being produced in both English and Spanish.  The PI will disseminate the videos in CD and DVD formats through the center's network of partnering colleges and through the textbook publisher, Delmar Publishing.  In their evaluation, the investigators plan to use a mixed method approach involving both qualitative and quantitative data to assess student and instructor satisfaction as well as gains in student learning.</AbstractNarration>
