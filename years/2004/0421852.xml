<AbstractNarration>It is self-evident that in society, many if not the most important &lt;br/&gt;decisions are made by groups. Group involvement is endemic, whether it be &lt;br/&gt;voting among large populations or deliberation by small committees. A &lt;br/&gt;standard view of group decision-making is that it facilitates exchanges of &lt;br/&gt;ideas and information, which necessarily lead to better outcomes. This view &lt;br/&gt;stands in contrast to a striking empirical regularity, dubbed group &lt;br/&gt;polarization, whereby members of a deliberating group predictably move &lt;br/&gt;toward a more extreme point in the direction indicated by the members' &lt;br/&gt;predeliberation tendencies. The aim of this project is to bridge the gap &lt;br/&gt;between the standard naive view of group decision-making and the empirical &lt;br/&gt;literature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project focuses on two distinct processes of group &lt;br/&gt;polarization. The first process operates in group decisions over risky &lt;br/&gt;prospects, where group members exhibit choice-shifts: They tend to take on &lt;br/&gt;more extreme levels of risk (either riskier or more cautious), relative to &lt;br/&gt;the levels of risk they would accept as individuals outside the group. The &lt;br/&gt;researchers propose an explanation for choice shifts, which is based on a &lt;br/&gt;model of individual decision-making. Hence, the framework they offer &lt;br/&gt;applies not only to choice shifts observed in groups but also to commonly &lt;br/&gt;observed biases in individual decision making. The second process analyzed &lt;br/&gt;in this proposal operates in groups that face a threat of disagreement. &lt;br/&gt;This threat plays an important role in explaining the fact that preference &lt;br/&gt;intensities matter in group interaction, and do so in non-additive ways. &lt;br/&gt;The researchers propose a dynamic model of group deliberation where each &lt;br/&gt;member wishes to implement a distinct policy, and the favorite policy of &lt;br/&gt;each member imposes externalities on the other members. The researchers &lt;br/&gt;discuss how this model can accommodate notions of `extremism' and &lt;br/&gt;`tolerance', and offer a methodology to study the formal relation between &lt;br/&gt;these two concepts. The proposed framework has the potential of allowing &lt;br/&gt;the researchers to rank different supermajority rules by the level of &lt;br/&gt;`extremism' that they impose in equilibrium.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
