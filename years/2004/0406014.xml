<AbstractNarration>The purpose of the project is to probe the dissipation&lt;br/&gt;mechanism in viscous approximation of multidimensional compressible&lt;br/&gt;potential flow by studying the regularity property, positivity of density,&lt;br/&gt;and dynamics of convective singularity surfaces, to justify the relation&lt;br/&gt;between variety of plate theories and three dimensional elasticity theory by&lt;br/&gt;deriving the asymptotic limit of three dimensional nonlinear elasticity,&lt;br/&gt;to deepen the understanding of optimal transport mechanism in&lt;br/&gt;non-turbulent semi-geostrophic equations, to investigate evolution of&lt;br/&gt;interface in multi-phase crystal growth in material science, stochastic&lt;br/&gt;solutions of Hamilton-Jacobi equations which model many interesting&lt;br/&gt;physical processes such as front propagation in combustion.&lt;br/&gt;    Rigorous mathematics in the study of the nonlinear partial&lt;br/&gt;differential equtions addressed in the project make it possible both to&lt;br/&gt;conduct stable numerical computation in, and to understand the qualitative&lt;br/&gt;features of the phenomena addressed above. One of our objectives is to&lt;br/&gt;study viscous oompressible potential flow and semi-geostrophic flow. The&lt;br/&gt;advance in the knowledge of global large solutions of mathematical&lt;br/&gt;equations has important impact on our fundamental understanding of air&lt;br/&gt;flow. The second objective is to analyze the front propagation of crystal&lt;br/&gt;growth and thin-film blistering in the semiconducting materials from which&lt;br/&gt;computing devices are manufactured. The third objective of this project is&lt;br/&gt;the training of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in the&lt;br/&gt;mathematical analysis of applied problems.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
