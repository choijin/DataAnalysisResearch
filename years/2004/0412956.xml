<AbstractNarration>Theoretical research will be conducted on condensed matter systems with strong correlations.  The research is awarded under the umbrella of the NSF-wide Mathematical Sciences Priority Area.  Merits of the research include understanding systems with qualitatively new behavior, such as have arisen in studies of magnets with frustrating interactions, high-temperature superconductors, and topological quantum computation.  This work will utilize field-theoretic techniques, especially non-perturbative methods useful for understanding novel phases which cannot be approached by conventional methods.  The research will include: continuing to derive exact results for topological phases, where quasiparticle excitations do not have the quantum numbers of the electron, i.e., are fractionalized; discovering and describing quantum critical points which separate novel phases from phases with conventional order; probing more deeply the symmetry structure of one-and two-dimensional models of strongly correlated electrons; using integrable field theory in quantum impurity problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principle investigator has extensive experience in developing and utilizing modern techniques.  Successful applications of these techniques in current research include: deriving many exact results for the widely-studied classical and quantum dimmer models; exploring in depth the phase diagrams of models with topological phases; utilizing supersymmetry to describe the ground state of strongly correlated electron systems; describing different kinds of density-wave order in models with competing interactions, such as in a model of bosons in a one-dimensional optical lattice; deriving exact results for models with disorder; deriving correlation functions and other exact results for Haldane-gap spin chains; understanding Fano resonances in quantum dots and atomic systems.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a broader context, this type of research is pushing condensed matter theory into brand new arenas.  In these systems, the traditional Landau paradigm of treating quasiparticles as electron-like does not give even a good qualitative description of the physics, much less an accurate quantitative prediction.  It is important that the field broaden and develop new ideas and methods to attack these problems.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An even broader impact will come from a book being written entitled Up Against the Infinite.  This book will explain to general audiences the new sorts of theories used to probe physics in extreme conditions, e.g., ultra-low temperature, code-cracking quantum computers, the early universe, and how the renormalization group links physics at vastly different length scales.&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;Theoretical research will be conducted on condensed matter systems with strong correlations.
