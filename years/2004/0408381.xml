<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Probablistic Random Walk Solutions of Engineering Problems in Wave Scattering and Diffraction&lt;br/&gt;David B. Bogy, UC Berkeley&lt;br/&gt;NSF Proposal #0408381&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wave scattering and diffraction are important phenomena in acoustics, optics, electromagnetics and earthquakes.  For example, how do we identify the shape and size of an object measuring the amplitudes and phases of the waves it scatterers? The rigorous description of wave scattering has long been associated with cumbersome formulas that require large and expensive calculations and Ph.D. level knowledge. However, the situation may soon be changed due to the development of the proposed novel approach to wave propagation that provides mathematically exact solutions in a simple form accessible to average undergraduates or even high-school students. This approach to wave studies was not published until the 21st century, but it already has made it possible to get simple but rigorous solutions of a number of long-standing problems, including the 3D problem of diffraction by a plane sectorial screen of arbitrary angle, or the 2D problem of diffraction of acoustical waves in a half-space with surface breaking cavities and cracks of arbitrary shape. The research proposed here included further development of the method, solution of important applied problems and integration of the method into graduate courses offered at UC Berkeley.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
