<AbstractNarration>This project is focused on the development of new and effective methods for the synthesis of conducting polymers and an understanding of how to optimize their electronic and optical properties. Highly conducting, self-assembling block copolymers containing conducting stereoregular polythiophenes that undergo polymer phase separation to give conductive nanowires and other interesting morphologies will be explored. Directed self-assembly will be achieved through designed side chain and end group modification. The design and synthesis of very stable conducting polymers will be coupled with the development of new conducting polymer sensors, focusing on transitioning fundamental discoveries into materials with commercial applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this renewal award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Professor Richard D. McCullough, of the Department of Chemistry at Carnegie Mellon University. Professor McCullough's research efforts target the design, synthesis, and study of conducting polymers. For these materials to evolve from academic curiosities to components in real technological applications (e.g., ink-jet printing, wires and contacts, polymer switches and colorimetric biosensors), new, easy, and inexpensive synthetic methods and an understanding of how to optimize electronic and optical properties are required. The goal of this research program is the design, synthesis, assembly and engineering of new conducting polymeric materials in order to optimize material properties and to create new functional properties.</AbstractNarration>
