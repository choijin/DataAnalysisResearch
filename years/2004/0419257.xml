    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a&lt;br/&gt;novel integrated reactive abatement module (IRAM) that effectively removes solidifying&lt;br/&gt;chemicals from the exhaust effluent of deposition and etch manufacturing processes. Growing&lt;br/&gt;safety concerns and escalating costs dedicated to environmental protection is one of the drivers to&lt;br/&gt;continuously migrate semiconductor manufacturing outside of the US. In this project,&lt;br/&gt;hazardous chemicals will be reactively converted into inert solid films over a removable high-area filtration element. An integrated high-speed downstream pressure control will actively&lt;br/&gt;suppress IRAM-induced pressure fluctuations that may affect the process. The reactive process&lt;br/&gt;will apply highly effective chemical reactions to convert the solidifying chemicals into stable&lt;br/&gt;inert films. Objectives include superior maintainability of low-pressure exhaust manifolds and&lt;br/&gt;pumps and substantially improved safety of device processing systems, hence promoting safe and&lt;br/&gt;environmentally benign semiconductor manufacturing at a competitive cost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact: Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD), Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) and&lt;br/&gt;Reactive Ion Etching (RIE) are considered the cornerstones of semiconductor manufacturing&lt;br/&gt;technology. In the last decade these manufacturing-technologies have also migrated into the&lt;br/&gt;explosively growing area of nano-technology. These process techniques emit reactive, toxic and&lt;br/&gt;solidifying chemicals and produce a hazardous and destructive residue in low-pressure exhaust&lt;br/&gt;manifolds that clogs up the conduits and destroys the vacuum pumps. Slow and inefficient&lt;br/&gt;chemical reactions, driven by the typically low pressure and low temperature conditions in&lt;br/&gt;exhaust manifolds, convert the reactive exhaust mixture into hazardous residue instead of&lt;br/&gt;completely reacted inert films. Frequent maintenance requires ambient exposure of these&lt;br/&gt;hazardous-residue-containing exhaust manifolds with risks to the workers and the workplace.&lt;br/&gt;Growing safety concerns and escalating cost dedicated to environmental protection severely&lt;br/&gt;hampers the semiconductor industry and reduces its competitiveness in the US. Overcoming this&lt;br/&gt;deficiency, IRAM technology will apply environmentally benign chemistry with a localized&lt;br/&gt;production of short-lived highly reactive species capable to completely extracting the solidifying&lt;br/&gt;chemicals out of exhaust streams to produce inert solid films. This novel chemistry has a broad&lt;br/&gt;range of device processing applications and can positively impact manufacturing costs.&lt;br/&gt;Key Words: CVD, RIE, ALD, abatement, semiconductor manufacturing, LPCVD, foreline,&lt;br/&gt;EH&amp;S, environmental health and safety.&lt;br/&gt;E.B.A 5/24/04</AbstractNarration>
