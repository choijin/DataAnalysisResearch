<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will investigate the feasibility of using Wire Mesh&lt;br/&gt;Reinforced Inorganic Matrix (WMRIM) as blast-resistant retrofits for unreinforced&lt;br/&gt;masonry walls. The proposed work is part of full-scale blast tests based on&lt;br/&gt;Glass Fiber Reinforced Polymer (GFRP) retrofits. Through full-scale blast testing, we&lt;br/&gt;will experimentally validate a methodology for designing WMRIM retrofits as a cost-&lt;br/&gt;effective solution to blast resistant retrofits. The results of this research will enable&lt;br/&gt;retrofit techniques to be designed based on simple static tests on structural&lt;br/&gt;components rather than more expensive blast tests on full-scale structures.&lt;br/&gt;The hypothesis of the research is that the initial blast wave causes significant&lt;br/&gt;damage to masonry walls. This phenomenon and the subsequent stiffening of the wall due to arch action need to be characterized to adequately model blast effect on&lt;br/&gt;structures. The key elements of this research are:&lt;br/&gt;i) Wire-mesh Reinforced Inorganic Matrix (WMRIM&lt;br/&gt;ii) Static Flexure Tests and&lt;br/&gt;iii) Blast Pressure Response Model&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;Approximately 40% of the budget will leverage planned full-scale blast tests by&lt;br/&gt;EMRTC to obtain test data for our WMRP retrofits. Over 70% of the remaining&lt;br/&gt;budget for this research will directly support graduate student training. The University&lt;br/&gt;of New Mexico is a minority institution (Hispanic and American Indian). The PI has&lt;br/&gt;always had a significant ( 40%) number of minority graduate students in his research&lt;br/&gt;program. The full-scale explosive test facilities are located in Socorro, 1 hour drive&lt;br/&gt;from the University of New Mexico campus. This synergy couldallow the university to build a strong reputation in the design and testing of hardened&lt;br/&gt;(blast-resistant) structures and provide needed information for blast resistant design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
