<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0456590&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Bo'az B. Klartag&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project explores several challenging directions in the study&lt;br/&gt;of high dimensional convex bodies. The unifying theme of the&lt;br/&gt;project is that high dimensionality, when viewed correctly, may&lt;br/&gt;entail simplicity and order, rather than enormous diversity which&lt;br/&gt;is impossible to control, the so-called ``curse of&lt;br/&gt;dimensionality''. In particular, the PI will address the&lt;br/&gt;fundamental questions regarding distribution of mass in high&lt;br/&gt;dimensions, the typical shape of lower-dimensional sections of a&lt;br/&gt;given convex set, and the interplay between convex-geometric&lt;br/&gt;inequalities and functional inequalities, mostly in the category&lt;br/&gt;of logarithmically concave functions. While classical convexity&lt;br/&gt;focuses on fine properties of bodies or shapes in a fixed&lt;br/&gt;dimension, in the asymptotic theory one views the dimension as&lt;br/&gt;being finite, yet tending to infinity.  We aim at bridging&lt;br/&gt;between these two disciplines, both by applying classical tools&lt;br/&gt;to the study of asymptotic questions, and by drawing corollaries&lt;br/&gt;of a classical flavor from asymptotic results. These corollaries&lt;br/&gt;are often of an almost-isometric nature, not only isomorphic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study of high dimensional objects is common to various&lt;br/&gt;scientific disciplines, including statistical mechanics, the&lt;br/&gt;theory of machine learning and asymptotic combinatorics, to name&lt;br/&gt;a few. Connections between these areas and asymptotic convex&lt;br/&gt;geometry have already begun to emerge.  A better understanding of&lt;br/&gt;the high dimensional phenomena from the geometric viewpoint has&lt;br/&gt;the potential to contribute to the development of the&lt;br/&gt;aforementioned fields and to others&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
