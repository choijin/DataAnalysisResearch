<AbstractNarration>This Track 2 proposal builds on successful outcomes from GeoKids LINKS, a collaboration bringing together faculty and students from Saint Josephs University and the Wagner Free Institute of Science, a natural science museum. The partners are collaborating with K-6 schools in the School District of Philadelphia to develop and implement place-based thematic life science units that incorporate hands-on activities, stimulate student inquiry and include considerable reading and writing. Fellows are better communicators, more knowledgeable about methods of education in general, and about issues facing urban elementary children and teachers in particular. Elementary students who had GeoKids improved more over the first year in reading, math, and science, compared with students in the same schools who did not have GeoKids, based on a standardized test administered nationwide. Their teachers report that the students have an increased interest in science and in learning in general, and children reading far below grade level seem to be especially motivated. Teachers report increased knowledge of science content and comfort with teaching science. Four teachers became involved in summer research with GK-12 faculty and Fellows. Additional intellectual merit of proposed activities includes further development of the collaboration and the curriculum as a model that works with underachieving urban children living in poverty. The proposed expansion using Service Learning students who are also future elementary school teachers, and the potential for integrating GeoKids curriculum into the curriculum frameworks of the School District of Philadelphia speak to broader implications. In addition, documentation of a careful mentoring system for graduate Fellows through two years of increasing responsibility for teaching and curriculum development may be an important outcome. There is strong support for building GeoKids LINKS infrastructure at Saint Joseph's University; 10 of the 34 graduate Fellowship years and 12 of the 16 undergraduate Fellowships will be funded by SJU through conversion of Graduate School assistantships. Faculty with Fellows are supported by the University with summer stipends, and Fellows have access to funds for research and travel to meetings. GeoKids also qualifies for corporate donations through a state education improvement tax credit program for which the Wagner is eligible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is receiving partial support from the Directorate for Geosciences.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
