<AbstractNarration>This is a collaborative project between Rice University and the University of Michigan to develop and implement a flexible computational module that will calculate ground magnetic disturbance patterns, based upon input from various theoretical space physics models. The module will compute time-series of simulated magnetic field disturbances across the network of magnetic observatories (i.e., theoretical magneto grams) using a distribution of currents in the ionosphere and inner magnetosphere, and a specification of the global magnetic field far from the Earth's surface, provided by a theoretical model. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basis for the module is a method that combines numerical integration of the Biot-Savart law over a finite volume with a scalar potential representation of the field produced by unspecified currents external to the volume. This approach attempts to take into account all major currents in the magnetosphere-ionosphere system, including ground induction currents, field-aligned and partial ring currents, and large-scale currents in the outer magnetosphere and solar wind. Thus the computed ground disturbance fields will be the most realistic possible for a given model. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intended as a general-use tool, the proposed module will provide the means of comparing a broad range of models, including ring current models and convection models, as well as comprehensive global magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere models currently under development. In the implementation phase of the project, several issues related to the Earth's ring current will be explored with the ground-magnetogram computational module. Traditionally, ring current models have been tested against ground-based observations indirectly, through the Dst index and its relationship to the total particle energy via the Dessler-Parker-Sckopke relation. The new computational machinery will allow much more detailed model-magnetogram comparisons that consider both the temporal and spatial variation of the magnetic disturbance field. The comparisons will provide new information on physical issues such as: (1) Magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling and the ionospheric closure path for the partial ring current that develops in the main phase of a geomagnetic storm; (2) The mechanism by which a self-consistent conductance influences this closure path and how the feedback from the ionospheric current results in a modification of the magnetospheric currents; (3) Quantitative identification of the currents that contribute to the Dst index, that will help resolve the ongoing controversy about the physical meaning of that index. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are several broader impacts of this proposed research. Foremost is that it allows a more effective utilization of the data from the vast array of ground based magnetometer stations. Advancing our knowledge of the ionosphere-magnetosphere system will result in the creation of more reliable space weather codes, which will benefit society. The project also provides educational support for graduate students and a postdoctoral fellow.</AbstractNarration>
