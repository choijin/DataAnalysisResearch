<AbstractNarration>Title:  ITWF Collaborative Research: Increasing the Representation of Undergraduate Women and Minorities in Computer Science&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CNS 0420436, PI Horwitz, Univ. of Wisconsin-Madison&lt;br/&gt;CNS 0419340, PI Huss-Lederman, Beloit College&lt;br/&gt;CNS 0420312, PI Munson, Univ. of Wisconsin-Milwaukee&lt;br/&gt;CNS 0420337, PI Dunsmore, Purdue University&lt;br/&gt;CNS 0420343, PI Rodger, Duke University&lt;br/&gt;CNS 0420358, PI Binkley, Loyola College of Maryland&lt;br/&gt;CNS 0420368, PI Biggers, Georgia Institute of Technology&lt;br/&gt;CNS 0420433, PI Ryder, Rutgers University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This collaborative ITWF project implements a new approach to introductory computer science with the goal of increasing the enrollment and retention of women and under-represented minorities in undergraduate computer science degree programs. The project adapts the Emerging Scholars Program and the Peer-led Team Learning approaches, which have been proven successful in mathematics and other sciences, to computer science. It is a collaborative project between the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Beloit College, Duke University, Georgia Institute of Technology, Loyola College of Maryland, Purdue University, Rutgers University, and the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. The project includes targeted recruitment of students with strong mathematics and science backgrounds to the new course. The course includes students working in small groups on challenging problems with group facilitation by outstanding undergraduates.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project lies in the strong basis on models that have been successful in other disciplines. The collaborative represents a team of investigators with significant expertise in educational reform and transformation. Implementation will take place at the diverse set of institutions represented by the collaborative partners, thus providing an excellent environment for evaluation of this innovative approach and illustrating the possibilities for replication and adoption by a wide range of institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the project lie with the potential increasing the participation of under-represented groups in computer science. The method to be tested is relative low cost and straightforward to implement, thus it has a high potential for broad impact across the country.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
