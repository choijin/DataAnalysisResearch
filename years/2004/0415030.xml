<AbstractNarration>Statistical approaches to machine translation (MT) have been the subject of a great deal of recent research in natural language processing. A seminal piece of work in the field is that of researchers at IBM in the early 1990s; many of the original concepts within statistical MT were introduced within this paper, and much of the more recent work in statistical MT has built upon these ideas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project involves research that investigates alternative approaches to the IBM models.  In particular, we are investigating the use of global feature-vector representations of translations, along with discriminative training methods.  A first aim of the project is to develop a new framework for statistical machine translation.  A second aim is to use the approach as a testbed for new features in machine translation systems.  Our goal is to use the new approach to make a systematic study of issues such as word-sense disambiguation and the use of syntactic knowledge in statistical MT systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Improvements in the quality of machine translation systems could have a major impact on society.  Recently, users of the world wide web or digital libraries (English speaking or otherwise) face a huge amount of text written in foreign languages.  Human translation of any significant proportion of this text is not feasible.  Machine translation systems could make a major impact on our ability to access natural language information in electronic form.  In addition, this research will facilitate research on a wide range of features in MT systems, by a wide range of researchers.</AbstractNarration>
