<AbstractNarration>Dynamic friction models for micro and nano-systems&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract: The purpose of this project is to combine unique experiments with a long tradition of friction modeling to develop dynamic models of friction that can be used for friction compensation in NEMS and MEMS systems. The availability of unique experimental equipment, the Hysitron nanoindenter in the Microsystems Characterization Lab at UCSB offers interesting possibilities to improve the state of the art of friction models through precise experiments.  The PI and Co-PI bring together expertise in modeling and experimental microscale mechanics to attempt to model the observed experimental phenomena. An interesting property of the microindenter is that is may be possible to make similar experiments in different scales by changing the tip design. This may make it possible to compare friction atomic and macro-scale in similar experiments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this proposal lie in the ability to not only create physically based friction models, but in performing precise experiments which will verify such models, and yield improved ones. In this feasibility study (exploratory basic research) the team intends to explore what can be done with the nanoindenter and to make a preliminary investigation of improved friction models. A particular focus will be on the nature of friction forces for small displacements at slow velocities. The hypothesis is that such experiments will give considerable insight. If this is true there is significant scope for a more elaborate research program including both the nano and the macro scale. Both the PI and the Co-PI are very active in education of undergraduates. Should this project be successful, undergraduate researchers will be involved though REU supplements. In addition, the models developed will be incorporated into the MEMS curriculum in the undergraduate Mechanical Engineering courses at UCSB. As this is a one-year SGER, preliminary work will be primarily research-based, and many broader impact outcomes will occur after the duration of the funding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
