<AbstractNarration>The proposed research includes two main projects. The first one, counting&lt;br/&gt;manifolds, is in a sense a continuous analog of asymptotic group theory.  &lt;br/&gt;The guiding line is to convert finiteness results about locally symmetric&lt;br/&gt;manifolds, which follow from rigidity phenomenon and arithmeticity, to&lt;br/&gt;concrete quantitative statements. It is closely related to some central&lt;br/&gt;questions in mathematics such as the congruence subgroup problem, and to&lt;br/&gt;the remarkable finiteness theorem of Borel and Prasad, and it has&lt;br/&gt;applications in Riemannian geometry, number theory and theoretical&lt;br/&gt;physics. This project continues earlier work of the P.I. and joint work of&lt;br/&gt;the P.I. with Burger, Lubotzky and Mozes. The second main project concerns&lt;br/&gt;embeddings of free groups into groups with some geometric structure. This&lt;br/&gt;plays a central role in the study of linear and topological groups (in&lt;br/&gt;particular subgroups of Lie groups over local fields), and impacts some&lt;br/&gt;topics in differential geometry, ergodic theory, geometric group theory,&lt;br/&gt;unitary representations and profinite groups.  One target, which the P.I.&lt;br/&gt;pursues in collaboration with E. Breuillard, is to obtain an effective&lt;br/&gt;version to Tits alternative, a weak version of which was proved by Eskin,&lt;br/&gt;Mozes and Oh, while solving Gromov's exponential growth conjecture. Other&lt;br/&gt;problems are related to the Auslander conjecture. This project is also&lt;br/&gt;related to the study of dense subgroups of analytic Lie groups, and the&lt;br/&gt;``opposite'' problem of classifying the (analytic) metric completions of a&lt;br/&gt;given countable group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are several classical finiteness statement concerning locally&lt;br/&gt;symmetric spaces which have been known for more than 30 years, and yet&lt;br/&gt;have no quantitative proofs, or for which the existing estimates are&lt;br/&gt;suboptimal. One example is the classical theorem of Wang (and its strong&lt;br/&gt;version due to Borel and Prasad) about the finiteness of the number of&lt;br/&gt;manifolds with bounded volume; we would like to have good estimates for&lt;br/&gt;this number. Another example is the fact that the fundamental group of a&lt;br/&gt;manifold with finite volume is finitely presented; the size of a minimal&lt;br/&gt;presentation can be estimated in terms of the volume. More generally, we&lt;br/&gt;study relations between the volume of manifolds and their geometric&lt;br/&gt;structure. The second project deals with free subgroups. In his celebrated&lt;br/&gt;1972 paper J. Tits proved that any finitely generated linear group which&lt;br/&gt;is not virtually solvable contains a non-commutative free subgroup. This&lt;br/&gt;result, known today as the Tits alternative, answered a conjecture of Bass&lt;br/&gt;and Serre and was an important step toward the understanding of linear&lt;br/&gt;groups. Any improvement in Tits' theorem has immediate corollaries in&lt;br/&gt;various different fields of mathematics. The P.I. and E. Breuillard had&lt;br/&gt;recently established a topological version of Tits theorem which answered&lt;br/&gt;several questions in dynamics, Riemannian foliations and profinite groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
