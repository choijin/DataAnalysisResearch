    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will demonstrate the ability to selectively condense and recover deposits rich in a valuable element from the gas-cooling regions of integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) plants. Deposits plugging gas-cooling heat exchangers in commercial coal IGCC systems are rich in a valuable element. The work will involve the design and construction of a pilot-scale on-line metalloid recovery (OMR) system that will be tested at bench scale on simulated synthesis gas, and on slipstreams from small-scale gasifiers. Phase II work will determine the effects of particulate matter and pressurized systems on the ability to concentrate and remove the valuable element from the gas stream.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The on-line recovery of deposits rich in a valuable element will have two distinct commercial benefits. The first benefit is the cost savings associated with eliminating down time required for cleaning. By eliminating one cleaning outage, a gasification plant could save $4.9 million. The second benefit is the creation of an additional revenue stream from the recovery of these deposits, which can be sold to a recycler.</AbstractNarration>
