<AbstractNarration>Horizontal gene transfer among microorganisms is a critical process &lt;br/&gt;that impacts bacterial evolution over long time horizons as well as &lt;br/&gt;the spread of traits such as antibiotic resistance on short time &lt;br/&gt;scales.  Recently there has been heightened public concern about the &lt;br/&gt;risk of gene transfer from genetically engineered organisms to &lt;br/&gt;indigenous organisms and its consequences.  Many environmental &lt;br/&gt;microorganisms spend a large part of their viable life cycle in the &lt;br/&gt;porous medium of the natural subsurface, such as soils and aquifer &lt;br/&gt;materials.  Because it is a natural filter for water the subsurface &lt;br/&gt;also provides a mixing zone for different strains of bacteria, that &lt;br/&gt;each partition between the aqueous and solid phases.  Thus to &lt;br/&gt;understand the ramifications of horizontal gene transfer in the &lt;br/&gt;natural environment, it is important to study the interactions &lt;br/&gt;between different species as they undergo fate and transport in &lt;br/&gt;porous media.  The primary goal of this project is to evaluate the &lt;br/&gt;kinetics of microbial attachment-detachment to porous media solid &lt;br/&gt;surfaces, and the coupled kinetics of horizontal gene transfer in &lt;br/&gt;porous media via conjugation.  The green fluorescent protein (GFP) &lt;br/&gt;gene expression system will be used with known hosts and recipients &lt;br/&gt;originally isolated from soils to quantify rates of conjugative gene &lt;br/&gt;transfer in controlled micromodel experiments.  The gene transfer is &lt;br/&gt;expected to be limited by the paired residence time of host and &lt;br/&gt;recipient cells together on solid surfaces, and so the distributions &lt;br/&gt;of these paired residence times and the distribution of gene transfer &lt;br/&gt;times will be compiled from the micromodel experiments.  The model &lt;br/&gt;for these data will be crafted by combining a biased Levy motion with &lt;br/&gt;drift for the bacterial transport in the porous media, with an &lt;br/&gt;alpha-stable random variable for residence time attached to surfaces, &lt;br/&gt;with a non-Markovian reaction kinetic model for the gene transfer &lt;br/&gt;from host to recipient.  The intellectual merit of this project &lt;br/&gt;arises from the coordinated collaboration of people with expertise in &lt;br/&gt;hydrology, microbiology, molecular biology, applied mathematics, and &lt;br/&gt;physics, to (1) adapt new tools in genetic analysis and microscopy to &lt;br/&gt;study microbial activity and gene exchange at a molecular level in &lt;br/&gt;micro flow chambers, and (2) use mathematics to extrapolate the &lt;br/&gt;findings to understand processes at higher scales in the subsurface. &lt;br/&gt;By combining experiment with theory we may be able to determine the &lt;br/&gt;major requirements for successful gene transfer.  The broader impacts &lt;br/&gt;of this project arise from the wide applicability of the results to &lt;br/&gt;many areas including human health, disease propagation, medicine, &lt;br/&gt;contaminant remediation, and evolutionary biology.  All of these &lt;br/&gt;phenomena involve the processes studied here, many in porous media &lt;br/&gt;(subsurface or biotic).  Educationally the project provides the venue &lt;br/&gt;by which results from the collaborative study can be incorporated &lt;br/&gt;into the PI's undergraduate and graduate courses in microbiology, &lt;br/&gt;engineering, and mathematics.  The PI's also have a solid record in &lt;br/&gt;involving minorities and women in research, via the MARC/AIM program &lt;br/&gt;at Purdue, and the Women In Engineering (nee' Women Engineering Link) &lt;br/&gt;program at UC Davis, and this habit will be continued in this project.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
