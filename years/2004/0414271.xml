    <AbstractNarration>The grant supports junior scientists' participation in the 2004 Gordon&lt;br/&gt;Conference on Nuclear Chemistry. The objective of the Gordon Research&lt;br/&gt;Conference on Nuclear Chemistry is to provide the international community of&lt;br/&gt;nuclear scientists with a unique forum where the most recent developments in&lt;br/&gt;this field can be presented, discussed and criticized. The emphasis in this&lt;br/&gt;year's Conference is placed on central nuclear reactions, with a particular&lt;br/&gt;attention devoted to the role of flavors in nuclear dynamics. Flavor is&lt;br/&gt;what distinguishes neutrons from protons in an atomic nucleus and the&lt;br/&gt;nucleons from some more exotic particles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The agenda of this Conference provokes new ideas for future research, in&lt;br/&gt;ensuring that discussions facilitate vigorous and open interactions between&lt;br/&gt;scientists. This requires the participation of a significant number of the&lt;br/&gt;leaders, including both internationally recognized senior scientists and the&lt;br/&gt;young and rising stars. Bright and promising postdoctoral researchers and&lt;br/&gt;graduate students are selected for participation in this Conference and&lt;br/&gt;encouraged to present their ideas. Their participation provides them with&lt;br/&gt;unique and extensive access to the leaders in their field, exposes them to&lt;br/&gt;new research opportunities and techniques and helps prepare them for the&lt;br/&gt;leadership roles they will assume in the future. Some of the young&lt;br/&gt;scientists have been invited to present talks. For others, poster sessions&lt;br/&gt;are organized to provide a forum for their ideas, with best displays&lt;br/&gt;additionally selected for oral presentations.</AbstractNarration>
