<AbstractNarration>The human immune system consists of armies of immune cells, such as the T cells, that circulate the body patrolling for disease.  One of the primary tasks of T cells is to identify and destroy virally infected cells.  It has recently been discovered that T cells perform their surveillance by forming a specialized junction with the target cell.  Within this so-named immune synapse, the biochemical reactions of recognition and signal transduction take place.  A critical breakthrough was the realization that proteins and signaling molecules within these immune synapses become arranged in spatial patterns, and that these patterns seem to convey information.  This observation can be likened to the fact one must pay attention to the sequence of the letters in this sentence, not just the number of each type of letter, in order to discern the meaning.  Is there a language of spatial patterns of molecules that cells use to communicate?  What mechanisms control the formation and dissolution of these patterns?  Within this project, these questions will be addressed from a chemical perspective by creating hybrid junctions between living cells and nanofabricated chip substrates.  This configuration allows imposition of spatial constraints on the motion of signaling molecules in living T cells from structures fabricated onto the solid substrate.  Experiments will probe the role of geometrical molecular patterns in the function of the immune system.  In more chemical language, the aims of this project investigate how geometrical constraints can modulate the chemical outcome of a reaction.  Emphasis will be directed towards elucidating the cooperative roles played by the cell cytoskeleton and membrane to coordinate assembly of signaling proteins into geometrically distinct patterns.  It is anticipated that new mechanisms of signaling discovered in the immune synapse may reveal general themes common to many types of cell-cell interactions. This project will have a broader impact by bridging the physical and biological sciences. The educational program will introduce interdisciplinary science to pre-college and college students and foster their interest in the emerging field at the interface of biology, chemistry and physics. Some high school and undergraduate students will also be involved in the project through summer internships, while graduate students will be involved in carrying out the research aims.</AbstractNarration>
