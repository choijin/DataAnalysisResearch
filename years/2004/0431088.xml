<AbstractNarration>The goal of the wireless revolution is to provide ubiquitous tetherless connectivity and access to information.&lt;br/&gt;The last decade has seen great progress towards this goal with cellular phones and wireless LAN cards&lt;br/&gt;now being commonplace. In particular, space-time processing, spurred by the use of multiple antenna&lt;br/&gt;arrays, has emerged as a key enabler of wireless technology. Notwithstanding recent advances in wireless&lt;br/&gt;communications research and technology, the state-of-the-art is far from realizing the capacity of wireless&lt;br/&gt;networks because of significant gaps in our fundamental understanding of the shared physical wireless&lt;br/&gt;channel. The key challenges posed by the wireless channel are due to its dispersive nature in time, frequency&lt;br/&gt;and space resulting from physical signal propagation over multiple spatially distributed paths. This motivates&lt;br/&gt;the central questions at the heart of this project:&lt;br/&gt;What are the key factors that govern reliable communication over dispersive wireless channels?&lt;br/&gt;What are the fundamental limits on communication over dispersive wireless channels?&lt;br/&gt;What are the key principles that guide practical system design?&lt;br/&gt;We will leverage a novel framework based on a virtual representation of physical wireless channels to&lt;br/&gt;address these multi-faceted questions. The virtual representation is a powerful deconstructing tool for unraveling&lt;br/&gt;the rich structure underlying dispersive wireless channels. As we demonstrate in this proposal,&lt;br/&gt;the insights afforded by the virtual representation framework have deep and wide ranging implications in&lt;br/&gt;the design and analysis of wireless communication systems. Within this framework, our proposed research&lt;br/&gt;program has three broad integrated thrusts:&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
