<AbstractNarration>The College of Engineering and Technology (CET) at Northern Arizona University (NAU) is providing 120 National Science Foundation (NSF) Computer Science, Engineering, and Mathematics Scholarship (CSEMS) scholarships for academically promising and financially needy computer science and engineering students.  This project is an extension to the existing CSEMS program award number 9987153. Over the past 3 years, CET has provided scholarships to 108 students (91 undergraduates and 17 graduates). The NSF scholarships awarded to these students have produced 3 notable accomplishments, 1) an increase in graduation rates for CSEMS recipients versus the general engineering student population at NAU, 2) an increase in graduation rates for Native American engineering students at NAU, and 3) an increase in graduation rates for female engineering students at NAU.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NAU is building upon the success of the past award and striving to increase the impact on Hispanics and graduate engineering students. The disciplines being served include Civil, Environmental, Computer Science, Electrical, and Mechanical Engineering, as well as the newly established Master of Engineering program.  The objectives of the scholarship program include improved retention, academic success and graduation rate of low-income, academically talented undergraduate and graduate students in engineering. Scholarships provide support for tuition, fees, and textbook charges per academic semester.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students are recruited to apply for the scholarship program through many existing support services offered to engineering students. These include the NAU Engineering Talent Pipeline Program (part of a $1 million Hewlett Foundation Grant), the Multicultural Engineering Program, Pathways Leading to Success Program, and the 10 nationally recognized engineering student chapters active at CET.  Students eligible for the award include United States citizens who are enrolled full time in a declared major in engineering at the baccalaureate or graduate level; have demonstrated academic potential or ability; and have demonstrated financial need.  Preference is given to minority students reflecting the diverse nature of our college with regard to under-represented groups, including Native Americans, Hispanics, women, and students in the first generation of their family to attend a four-year college. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
