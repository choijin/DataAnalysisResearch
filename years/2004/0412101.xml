<AbstractNarration>Dominick Casadonte, Texas Tech University, is a Discovery Corps Senior Fellow for the 2004-2005 academic year. Casadonte will lead an intergenerational chemistry education study involving senior citizens and students in the Lubbock public schools. He will train a group of senior citizens in both pedagogy and general chemistry principals. The senior citizens will then volunteer as teacher's aides, mentors or resource persons in the Lubbock Texas school system. Many aspects of the program will be evaluated, including the classroom effectiveness of the senior volunteer, the educational outcomes for the students, the attitudinal, physical and cognitive outcomes for the seniors, and the overall efficacy from the perspective of the classroom teacher . This Discovery Corps Senior Fellowship is supported by the Division of Chemistry and the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Discovery Corps Fellowship Program is a pilot program seeking new postdoctoral and professional development models that combine research expertise with professional service.  Discovery Corps Fellows leverage their research expertise through projects that address areas of national need. Their projects enhance research capacity and infrastructure and contribute to workforce development and job creation.  The Discovery Corps Program supports both Postdoctoral Fellows and Senior Fellows.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
