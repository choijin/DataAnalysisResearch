<AbstractNarration>The project is awarding thirty scholarships per year to students who are enrolled in a computer information technology, computer networking, computer programming analysis, engineering technologies or mathematics transfer program and/or to enter the workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is providing multiple support systems for the CSEMS scholars such as academic counseling in "Student Success" workshops and supplemental instruction, peer and online tutoring, cohort meetings, career exploration events, financial aid sessions, a "Computer Technologies Club, and career planning. Business and industrial connections are being promoted through Career Exploration Events, a "Tech Camp" which is providing hands-on experiences in technology, "Career Exploration Events" held three times per year, and by taking students to business sites for tours and work exposure.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is targeting underrepresented classes of students who are financially needy and academically talented to attain educational goals and become workers in a myriad of high technology jobs in a region that has the nation's fifth largest high tech workforce. The project is building upon a previous CSEMS grant and is incorporating lessons learned into this project.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
