<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Implementation of successful structural health-monitoring programs requires selection and placement of sensors suitable for measurement of key parameters that influence the performance and health of the structural system. In addition to the structural considerations, sensors need to be chosen based on compatibility with the materials and the range and scope of measurements. Despite the recent technological advances in the field of sensors, their applications in civil infrastructure systems have met with many challenges. Some of the primary issues of concern that impede rapid implementation of sensor technologies include large size of structures and the need for multiplexing a multitude of sensors, harsh construction environment, adverse exposure conditions, long term reliability and durability, and inexistence of sensors for measurement of relevant parameters of importance in civil structures. There is a need for development of a coordinated research program to address these issues. The proposed workshop will aid NSF in prioritization and planning of a coordinated research program for research and development of sensors and sensor packages for specific use of civil engineering type of structures, such as bridges, dams and tunnels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will address the key link between the material performance and the sensing capability. The final products of the workshop will be in the form of a hardbound book detailing the state-of-the-practice, and a comprehensive report outlining a detailed five-year national plan for research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
