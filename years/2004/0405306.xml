<AbstractNarration>0405306&lt;br/&gt;MacKay&lt;br/&gt;Our proposed project has significant intellectual merit because it explicitly addresses two key&lt;br/&gt;problems facing hydrology. The first problem concerns the opposing views of stomatal control of&lt;br/&gt;water fluxes, with one perspective assuming carbon assimilation control, and the other assuming&lt;br/&gt;an environmental control. Our conceptual model combines both of these perspectives in a unified&lt;br/&gt;mechanistic framework that combines both assimilation and water potential controls on&lt;br/&gt;transpiration. The second problem addressed by our conceptual model is the tendency towards&lt;br/&gt;favoring complex and often mathematically ill-posed canopy models over simpler, verifiable&lt;br/&gt;ones. We explicitly address this fundamental issue in hydrologic modeling by using a novel,&lt;br/&gt;object-oriented canopy model that can flexibly adjust its structure and mechanisms to the data it&lt;br/&gt;is provided. By adjusting model complexity spatially we will gain deep insights on species&lt;br/&gt;plasticity and restrictions thereof across spatial gradients, thus providing a rigorous approach to&lt;br/&gt;testing our conceptual model within our study site in northern Wisconsin.&lt;br/&gt;The knowledge gained from our proposed research has broad implications for land surface&lt;br/&gt;modeling efforts seeking to generate accurate predictions of global change effects on water&lt;br/&gt;cycling. By developing our conceptual model we will be able to provide a relatively simple, but&lt;br/&gt;transportable and scientifically defensible model. Such models are essential foundations for the&lt;br/&gt;creation and implementation of credible state, federal and international policies aimed at&lt;br/&gt;mitigating or otherwise adjusting to the consequences of anticipated global change. The&lt;br/&gt;educational emphasis of this project is multi-faceted. First, we will seek additional funding and&lt;br/&gt;other means of supporting, advising and training an integrated team of undergraduate students&lt;br/&gt;from the economically disadvantaged region of Northern Wisconsin, using this project as the&lt;br/&gt;principal context for their education in Forest Ecology at UW-Madison. Also, in connection with&lt;br/&gt;the NSF Research Collaboration Network project entitled "Chequamegon Ecosystem-&lt;br/&gt;Atmosphere Study," for which Mackay is a core project participant, we will hold a nationally&lt;br/&gt;advertised workshop on multi-scale canopy flux measurements and modeling. The PIs will&lt;br/&gt;continue to recruit and hire minorities and other underrepresented students in our respective&lt;br/&gt;fields.</AbstractNarration>
