<AbstractNarration>Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Communication with multiple antennas is a promising technology for&lt;br/&gt;future high-rate wireless communication systems. It is often referred&lt;br/&gt;to as space-time communication because the transmitted signal is&lt;br/&gt;encoded both across the antennas (space) and time. Over the past ten&lt;br/&gt;years, various space-time coding and decoding schemes have been&lt;br/&gt;developed. They can be roughly divided into two categories:&lt;br/&gt;short-frame code designs and long-frame code designs. Relatively less&lt;br/&gt;attention has been given to the transceiver design issues in&lt;br/&gt;space-time communications with medium-length frames, i.e., those&lt;br/&gt;containing more than a few but less than, say, a thousand bits. We use&lt;br/&gt;medium-length frames in practice for several reasons: i) The data may&lt;br/&gt;be bursty and of medium-length, which is often the case in Internet&lt;br/&gt;traffic; ii) There may be stringent delay constraints which forbid&lt;br/&gt;long frame transmissions, such as in real-time computing and control&lt;br/&gt;applications. Such medium-length transmissions are not in the&lt;br/&gt;space-time block-code (or short-code) paradigm and yet not long enough&lt;br/&gt;to allow powerful error-control codes such as turbo or low-density&lt;br/&gt;parity-check codes to demonstrate their full ``power''.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates several key issues in medium-length&lt;br/&gt;space-time communications. Firstly, it pursues the problem of&lt;br/&gt;transmitter code design for delay-constrained space-time&lt;br/&gt;communications. Secondly, it investigates the problem of high decoding&lt;br/&gt;complexity in space-time systems with a large number of transmit&lt;br/&gt;antennas and/or a large modulation constellation, and develops&lt;br/&gt;low-complex detectors for such scenarios. Thirdly, it deals with the&lt;br/&gt;problem of space-time channel estimation at the receiver with or&lt;br/&gt;without training symbols. The research in these topics will also&lt;br/&gt;benefit long-frame space-time communication systems, as well as&lt;br/&gt;important applications in multi-user detection and in future sensor&lt;br/&gt;networks.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
