<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant provides funds to partially support the travel of U.S. authors to attend the Third IFAC Symposium on Mechatronic Systems to be held in Sydney, Australia, from September 6th through September 8th, 2004. The U.S. participants will include both faculty and graduate students. The faculty are involved in education in the field of mechatronics and will be able to incorporate the new material presented at the conference into their teaching. For the students, this conference offers the opportunity to expose themselves to the international community in their field and to prepare for &lt;br/&gt;their future careers. As mechatronics considers the synergistic application of knowledge from the fields of mechanics, electronics, and information technology, dynamic systems and control are central topics of relevance to its practice. Furthermore, mechatronics is essential to the proper application of advances in control to industrial applications.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
