    <AbstractNarration>This award will provide partial support for the 27th International Conference on the Physics of Semiconductors will be held during the week of July 26-30, 2004, in Flagstaff, Arizona, USA. The International Conference on the Physics of Semiconductors has a long and respected tradition as the prime conference covering the entire field of semiconductors. The scientific program will include plenary sessions, four parallel oral sessions including invited talks, and poster sessions. The NSF funds will be use to reduce fees for students (over 200 expected), support young participants from Latin America, provide reduced fees for participation of qualified semiconductor physicists from minority institutions, and provide support for invited speakers, especially from colleagues from Eastern European countries and from other institutions overseas, who do not have the funds to participate.</AbstractNarration>
