<AbstractNarration>AAD: A Software Tool for Asynchronous-Algorithm Development&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zhiyuan Li, Ananth Grama, Ahmed Sameh&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Department of Computer Sciences&lt;br/&gt;Purdue University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Data communication and memory access latency will continue to be the most severe&lt;br/&gt;performance-limiting factor for high-end computing problems. This proposal takes the view that, for a wide range&lt;br/&gt;of applications, the computation efficiency can be substantially improved by a fundamental change to &lt;br/&gt;the data propagation model in parallel algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many important applications use iterative solvers to solve partial differential equations (PDEs). In such solvers, each data point is iteratively updated&lt;br/&gt;using the new values of its neighbors.&lt;br/&gt;Data values are therefore propagated across the problem domain over the time&lt;br/&gt;steps. Currently, the predominant way&lt;br/&gt;to propagate the data requires the processor to suspend its computation until all data computed at a predetermined time step have arrived from its neighbors.&lt;br/&gt;Such a rigid model not only&lt;br/&gt;incurs a heavy performance penalty due to processor waiting, but&lt;br/&gt;it also severely limits the compiler's ability to transform programs to achieve&lt;br/&gt;more efficient parallel execution and better data locality. &lt;br/&gt;The PIs propose a software tool which supports a new model called the asynchronous model. &lt;br/&gt;Under this model, each data point is updated based on whatever the &lt;br/&gt;most recent values available from its neighbors, instead of waiting for values&lt;br/&gt;computed at a predetermined step. The new model will hence overcome&lt;br/&gt;the difficulties mentioned above. The asynchronous model, nonetheless,&lt;br/&gt;may change the convergence rate of the algorithm.&lt;br/&gt;Hence, based on the tradeoff between the convergence rate and the&lt;br/&gt;parallel execution efficiency,&lt;br/&gt;the application programmer should tune the frequency at which&lt;br/&gt;the data propagation is re-synchronized in order to&lt;br/&gt;accelarate the convergence. The proposed tool will make it easy&lt;br/&gt;for the application programmer to perform such important tuning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The success of this project will contribute substantially to&lt;br/&gt;the advance of high-end computing.&lt;br/&gt;Moreover, it will also make significant educational and outreach impact.&lt;br/&gt;The PIs plan to use the proposed software tool in Purdue's educational&lt;br/&gt;computational science and engineering (CSE) graduate program. Students and &lt;br/&gt;faculty in this program will use the tool in courses on parallel computing&lt;br/&gt;and performance evaluation, as well as in research projects that can benefit &lt;br/&gt;from fine-tuning performance on high-end parallel computing platforms.&lt;br/&gt;The software developed in this project can also be an effective tool&lt;br/&gt;in CSE education programs elsewhere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs have a track record of transferring research ideas to&lt;br/&gt;industrial labs and such collaboration will continue to project&lt;br/&gt;positive influences on high-performance computer industries.&lt;br/&gt;This project will also further enhance PIs' ability to engage a broad community of undergraduate students in various disciplines, through Honor Seminars, special mentoring programs and undergraduate research opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
