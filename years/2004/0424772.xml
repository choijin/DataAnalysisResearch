<AbstractNarration>The overall goal of this research is to develop an improved understanding of university&lt;br/&gt;resource allocation in agricultural research by examining the ethics and values associated&lt;br/&gt;with research outputs (articles, patents, and doctorates), potential changes in the&lt;br/&gt;direction of and audience for scientific researchers (e.g., basic vs applied, firms for&lt;br/&gt;licensing vs broader public dissemination), and the observable quality of the research (in&lt;br/&gt;terms of citations, licensing revenues, or other measures). The project will examine the&lt;br/&gt;resource allocation process at the university level as well as at the level of individual&lt;br/&gt;researchers within the agricultural and life science colleges of U.S. Land Grant&lt;br/&gt;universities (LGU).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the university level, the project is built on a 20-year panel database on university&lt;br/&gt;research inputs, outputs, and patent revenues that two of the principal investigators&lt;br/&gt;(Barham and Foltz) have developed over the past 4 years. At the individual level, the&lt;br/&gt;project will undertake a major survey of university researchers at LGUs asking them&lt;br/&gt;detailed questions about their research direction, outputs, grant sources, stakeholders,&lt;br/&gt;and attitudes. This survey of scientists follows up on a previous survey done by another&lt;br/&gt;of the principal investigators in the mid-1990s (Buttel) as well as an earlier effort by&lt;br/&gt;Lacy and Busch in 1979.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research methods in this project advance the literature on academic patenting in a&lt;br/&gt;number of important ways. First, the theoretical framework, "motivation crowding,"&lt;br/&gt;provides a novel framework for understanding how monetary incentives affect scientists'&lt;br/&gt;ethics, values, and research choices and the framework's use advances the theory by&lt;br/&gt;providing an empirical test of its propositions. Second, by building on past data&lt;br/&gt;collection efforts, this work will have both cross-section and time-series information&lt;br/&gt;that can advance our understanding of scientist ethics, values, and research choices.&lt;br/&gt;Third, this work will be able to integrate the scientist data with university level&lt;br/&gt;information across time and universities. Fourth, by having an interdisciplinary research&lt;br/&gt;team, this project will be able to combine the ethics and values concerns of sociology&lt;br/&gt;with the data and theory driven analytic tools of economists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates a series of regulatory and legal changes that appear to be&lt;br/&gt;having a major impact on the way in which research is done at agricultural colleges in&lt;br/&gt;LGUs. The incentives created by university patenting are changing the ethics and values&lt;br/&gt;of scientists, the types of projects they choose, the outlets for their research, and how&lt;br/&gt;that research gets disseminated to the public (e.g., patents or open publications). Given&lt;br/&gt;the central role of public sector research to generating new agricultural technologies&lt;br/&gt;over the last century, these changes in LGU research focus and scientist values may have&lt;br/&gt;significant impacts on the long-term sustainability of US agriculture (Goldberger and&lt;br/&gt;Buttel, 2001).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A deeper understanding of resource allocation and outcomes in university research can&lt;br/&gt;contribute toward the design of better policies and incentive structures to promote&lt;br/&gt;agricultural and life science research at LGUs, including efficiency and equity outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;Findings from this study will be presented to key decision makers at Land Grant&lt;br/&gt;universities, in state legislatures, and to interdisciplinary audiences.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
