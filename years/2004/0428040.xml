<AbstractNarration>The events of September 11, 2001, have highlighted the impact of malicious attacks on critical national&lt;br/&gt;infrastructure components. This has resulted in an increased appreciation for improving the physical security of&lt;br/&gt;critical electric power system components like substations, transmission lines, and generators. These observations&lt;br/&gt;together with the major North East blackout of August 14 th , 2003 highlight the importance of the electric grid as an&lt;br/&gt;energy transport medium and its critical importance to the nation's economy and global competitiveness.&lt;br/&gt;The electric power grid is a highly automated network. A variety of information networks are interconnected to the&lt;br/&gt;electric grid for the purpose of sensing, monitoring, and control. Any disturbance or dislocation in the electric&lt;br/&gt;network is sensed primarily by observing the electrical behavior of the power system via the observations and&lt;br/&gt;analysis done using the data obtained using measurements of electrical quantities. The sensor technology that&lt;br/&gt;aids the deployment of distributed sensing systems has improved vastly in the recent past. However, even though,&lt;br/&gt;standards do exist for physical security of substations, very few modern sensing mechanisms have been utilized to&lt;br/&gt;meet the physical security standards.&lt;br/&gt;With this scenario in mind we will undertake the following research in the sensing and information processing of the&lt;br/&gt;electric grid: (1) examine new sensors to sense physical quantities in power systems; (2) design a wireless sensor&lt;br/&gt;information network to transmit these measurements to the central control center; (3) develop algorithms for sensor&lt;br/&gt;placement, data aggregation, fault diagnosis, and load balancing for the sensor information network; and (4) fuse the&lt;br/&gt;physical sensor data with conventional electrical sensor data to devise more effective control strategies following&lt;br/&gt;large disturbances. We will demonstrate the developed techniques and validate them on a test bed that we have&lt;br/&gt;created to emulate a large power system using an operator training simulator. The key elements of the proposed&lt;br/&gt;approach consist of the following steps:&lt;br/&gt;1. Design structure of the wireless sensor information network that maintains connectivity under a variety of&lt;br/&gt;contingency scenarios in two modes, a) Partial mode that helps in detection of failures, and b) Full mode which&lt;br/&gt;helps in diagnosis of the problem.&lt;br/&gt;2. The sensor network in Partial Mode will be used to zero in on portions of the power grid where the system&lt;br/&gt;would like to get physical sensor information to fuse with existing electrical sensors to detect disturbance, and&lt;br/&gt;or catastrophic failures based on: a) On-line risk based engine, b) Unusual or abnormal measurements from&lt;br/&gt;certain sensors like temperature, motion, or chemical sensors, or c) Weather and unusual conditions.&lt;br/&gt;3. This leads to a decision on transferring to Full Mode operation where more information collection via sensor&lt;br/&gt;activation and deactivation, communication network connectivity, and power usage considerations will be made&lt;br/&gt;from the critical local portion of the power grid identified by the above analysis.&lt;br/&gt;4. This information leads to further diagnosis of the network condition that is used by central control center to&lt;br/&gt;invoke appropriate control action to safeguard the power network.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit of the proposed research lies in developing novel concepts for integrating a broad range of&lt;br/&gt;sensors that monitor both physical security and operational security of the nation's most critical infrastructure  the&lt;br/&gt;electric grid. The project aims at using the combined data from these sensors together with the detailed development&lt;br/&gt;of the associated communication and information network to enhance the security and reliability of the power grid.&lt;br/&gt;The team has combined their expertise to take a fresh view at the different kinds of sensors currently available and&lt;br/&gt;extract appropriate data from them for several key issues related to power system physical security.&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this research will be two fold. First, it will enhance the state of art in sensing, monitoring,&lt;br/&gt;and controlling the electric power grid by combining the multidisciplinary expertise of the investigators. Second, the&lt;br/&gt;new sensor network will be applied to develop an emergency response system for the national electric grid, which is&lt;br/&gt;essential to the vitality of the nation's economy, and will provide protection to it.&lt;br/&gt;Education: Our educational goal is to train the next generation of students, train new cadres of doctoral researchers&lt;br/&gt;and most importantly, share the excitement that comes with working in engineering with the youngest of students, in&lt;br/&gt;the K-12 program, to attract them into science and engineering. The college of engineering at Iowa State University&lt;br/&gt;has a dedicated effort to attract minority scholars into the graduate program and the university has an ongoing&lt;br/&gt;program to employ high school students and teachers in research programs during the summer. We will leverage&lt;br/&gt;these efforts.</AbstractNarration>
