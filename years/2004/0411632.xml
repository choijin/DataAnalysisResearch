<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title:  Preparation of Zirconia Aggregates for Use as Adsorbents in Bioseparations&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:  CTS-0411632&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Anuradha Subramanian&lt;br/&gt;Institution:  University of Nebraska&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to develop methods to produce zirconia particles and monoliths of varying particle sizes with controlled and hierarchical pore structure and to further modify zirconia surfaces with polymers, inorganic or organic substrates to yield chemically bonded zirconia surfaces with novel selectivities.  Supports based on zirconia, particles with high density and excellent thermal and chemical stability have the potential to offer novel selectivities or overcome the shortcomings of existing supports that are relevant for use in the preparative-scale purification of proteins.  A goal is to develop a reliable method of producing zirconia particles with the appropriate size, density, porosity, and thermal stability for use in process scale purification of therapeutic or diagnostic biomolecules.  Previous results have indicated the possibility of generating zirconia particles and documented their use as a stable chromatographic support. The primary goal of this application is to design, synthesize, and develop porous zirconia particles with hierarchical pore architecture over distinct size scales and that can be used in preparative chromatography of biomolecules.   In terms of the broader impacts, a coherent, concerted educational effort in bioseparations will be integrated into the undergraduate curriculum.  This work may lead to a promising application of zirconia as a column-packing material for preparative separations based on conventional packed-bed or expanded-bed adsorption.  Monoclonal antibodies are increasingly important as potential therapeutics, and there is a need for improved stationary phases.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
