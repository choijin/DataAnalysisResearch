<AbstractNarration>Pacific Resources for Education and Learning (PREL), in collaboration with the University of Hawaii, proposes to implement a master's degree program in evaluation, delivered largely through distance learning technology, with an initial cohort of culturally diverse students from the U.S. affiliated Pacific region.  In the fall of 2002, PREL received an exploratory research grant from NSF to document the need and develop a plan for this program.   &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The program would incorporate a specialization in evaluation into an existing master's degree program within the University of Hawaii College of Education, Department of Educational Foundations.  The program of study will require completion of 30 credit hours over the course of 6 semesters.  The two-year program will consist of courses offered in a "hybrid asynchronous/synchronous format" and is modeled after PREL's successful distance learning Master of Science degree program in Instructional Technology and Telecommunications. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to increase the capacity of the Pacific region to conduct high quality, innovative, and useful evaluations of educational programs, including science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.  The project has the following objectives: &lt;br/&gt;o to increase regional capacity to provide graduate training in evaluation.   &lt;br/&gt;o to increase the capacity of regional education agencies to engage in high quality, &lt;br/&gt;innovative, and useful evaluations.    &lt;br/&gt;o to strengthen regional capacity to apply the results of program evaluations in educational program and policy decisions.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
