<AbstractNarration>Project Summary &lt;br/&gt;The Geological Society of America (GSA) has been approached by the Biogeosciences Working Group &lt;br/&gt;and asked to prepare a proposal to design, build and host an independent, stand-alone Web site in support &lt;br/&gt;of the entire biogeoscience community. In Task I, www.biogeoscience.org is envisioned as a conduit &lt;br/&gt;through which information would flow to the biogeoscience community from funding agencies, program &lt;br/&gt;managers, societies, and others. In Task II, the Web site would be enhanced and expanded to support &lt;br/&gt;community building and dialog that will help guide and shape scientific discourse. At this time, GSA is &lt;br/&gt;seeking funding for Task I of the project. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Presently, there is no single source of information about biogeoscience funding opportunities, current &lt;br/&gt;research, centers of activity and other important resources. There is a need for a clearinghouse, a principle &lt;br/&gt;source of information about the biogeosciences. A wealth of information is available, and an easy to use, &lt;br/&gt;main source of up-to-date information is needed.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Defining the architecture and constructing the Web site will be the responsibility of a project team &lt;br/&gt;composed of members of the Biogeosciences Working Group, GSA staff and a student intern. The project &lt;br/&gt;team will conduct most of its work via teleconference and E-mail and may hold face-to-face meetings &lt;br/&gt;during scientific meetings attended by members of the team. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;In Task I, the Web site would function as an information resource. A wide range of information would be &lt;br/&gt;posted, updated frequently, and made compelling with features on research, people or programs. Other &lt;br/&gt;content that will pull traffic would be job postings and funding announcements.  An important Task I &lt;br/&gt;function is search capability that will make the Web site as useful as possible to site visitors. In addition, &lt;br/&gt;the site would contain meta tags to ensure that search engines would easily find it. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;In Task II, it is envisioned that the Web site would become an interactive, community-building, dialog site. &lt;br/&gt;The Working Group has identified three broad topics that it will examine and about which it needs input &lt;br/&gt;from the community. Initially, these topics will be the focus of input sought from the community. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;GSA is very well qualified to undertake this project for the Working Group with NSF support. GSA has &lt;br/&gt;many years of experience with creating and developing useful, easily navigated, and very attractive Web &lt;br/&gt;sites. GSA continually adds functionality and interactivity to its own Web site, www.geosociety.org.  GSA &lt;br/&gt;is thoroughly familiar with the geoscience community and can bring much knowledge about the needs, &lt;br/&gt;wants and preferences of the community to the project.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;www.biogeosciences.org will serve this emerging science in several ways: it will attract new researchers to &lt;br/&gt;the biogeosciences, support those already in the field, and help both the biogeosciences and its scientists &lt;br/&gt;flourish. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
