<AbstractNarration>This research is based on a comprehensive multi-scaled, &lt;br/&gt;multi-disciplinary approach to study complex information age issues that &lt;br/&gt;involve the combination of people and the information and communication &lt;br/&gt;technologies they use. This study extends work on social actors, &lt;br/&gt;developed through prior NSF-funded research. The social actor is an &lt;br/&gt;empirically derived model of people+ information and communication &lt;br/&gt;technologies (ICTs). To make this model useable for a wider community of &lt;br/&gt;researchers and policy- makers, who need robust models with solid &lt;br/&gt;measures of attributes and behaviors that conflate people and their &lt;br/&gt;technologies, some formalization of the social actor is required. Using &lt;br/&gt;metrics derived from institutional theory, appropriate measures based on &lt;br/&gt;social actor concepts will be developed and related to formal models and &lt;br/&gt;theories of cognitive understanding and collaborative decision making to &lt;br/&gt;establish a better basis for reasoning about ICT-infused environments. A &lt;br/&gt;theoretically supported, empirically grounded, social actor model will &lt;br/&gt;then be used to simulate dynamic agents, with scenarios developed in &lt;br/&gt;collaboration with RAND organization researchers. The empirical work &lt;br/&gt;will involve modeling social actors as people + IC in organizational and &lt;br/&gt;institutional settings using agent-based systems (ABS). Agent-based &lt;br/&gt;modeling allows a researcher to examine complex adaptive systems with &lt;br/&gt;sophisticated computational models that integrate empirical research and &lt;br/&gt;formal modeling. These systems help researchers and policy-makers &lt;br/&gt;explore the dynamic issues that attend the complex interactions of &lt;br/&gt;collaborative and competitive social units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
