<AbstractNarration>The Rustbelt RNA Meeting (RRM) will be held on November 19 and 20, 2004 in the Lodge at Deer Creek State Park &amp; Resort in Mt. Sterling, OH.  The RRM is the only major Midwest regional meeting of RNA researchers.  Approximately 120-140 participants from Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and New York are expected to attend.  The intellectual objective of the RRM is to provide an inexpensive, high caliber, interdisciplinary meeting for RNA researchers in the Midwest.  The field of RNA structure/function and processing is growing at a rapid pace and RNA processing has proved to be a critical step in many important biological phenomena such as carcinogenesis and development.  Consequently, research groups need a forum where they can hear and discuss new results and techniques in all areas of RNA research that can result in furthering an individual lab's aims.  The size and organization of the meeting has proven to be an excellent environment for active discussions between research groups, including those between PIs, PIs and trainees as well as between trainees themselves.  Such interactions are more difficult at larger national meetings.  The RRM emphasizes trainee participation and participation of women investigators.  In addition to offering opportunities for interactions with PIs and other trainees, the RRM provides invaluable experience presenting research in an educational and supportive atmosphere.</AbstractNarration>
