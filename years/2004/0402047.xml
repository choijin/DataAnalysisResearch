<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has two major parts. First, we take a rather&lt;br/&gt;non-obvious definition of "monodromy" for difference equations due&lt;br/&gt;to Birkhoff and aim to develop a general theory of transformations&lt;br/&gt;of difference equations which preserve the monodromy. The&lt;br/&gt;resulting structure bears some similarity to the classical theory&lt;br/&gt;of isomonodromy deformations of differential equations and&lt;br/&gt;degenerates to it in a certain limit. Second, we apply the&lt;br/&gt;isomonodromy transformations of difference equations to evaluation&lt;br/&gt;of the so-called gap probabilities in discrete probabilistic&lt;br/&gt;models of random-matrix type which arise in many different domains&lt;br/&gt;including combinatorics, representation theory, percolation&lt;br/&gt;theory, tiling models, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theory of isomonodromy deformations of ordinary differential&lt;br/&gt;equations with rational coefficients is a classical subject&lt;br/&gt;developed in the end of the XIXth -- beginning of the XXth century&lt;br/&gt;by Riemann, Schlesinger, Fuchs, and Garnier. Since then the&lt;br/&gt;isomonodromy deformations have found numerous applications in very&lt;br/&gt;different domains of mathematics and mathematical physics, from&lt;br/&gt;algebraic and differential geometry to random matrices and&lt;br/&gt;representation theory. On the other hand, in recent years there&lt;br/&gt;has been considerable interest in analyzing a certain class of&lt;br/&gt;discrete probabilistic models which in appropriate limits converge&lt;br/&gt;to well-known models of random matrix theory. The sources of these&lt;br/&gt;models are quite diverse, they include combinatorics,&lt;br/&gt;representation theory, percolation theory, random growth&lt;br/&gt;processes, tiling models and others. The goal of the research&lt;br/&gt;presented in this proposal is to develop a general theory of&lt;br/&gt;"isomonodromy transformations" for linear systems of DIFFERENCE&lt;br/&gt;equations with rational coefficients. In these probabilistic&lt;br/&gt;models mentioned above, we often see how two problems which seem&lt;br/&gt;to be unrelated to each other, and which even come from parts of&lt;br/&gt;mathematics that do not seem to have any overlap, lead to the same&lt;br/&gt;final result. We believe that the project will provide a visible&lt;br/&gt;common ground for many of such coincidences and thus will promote&lt;br/&gt;and accelerate the exchange of methods and ideas accumulated by&lt;br/&gt;different groups of researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
