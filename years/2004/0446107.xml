<AbstractNarration>The focus of this research is to show how the solubility properties of soluble macromolecules can be controlled, modified and used to advantage in synthesis and catalysis.  Studies with spectroscopic probes will examine the subtle effects of copolymer microstructure on polymer phase selective solubility, using parallel syntheses to minimize effects of polydispersity and other variables normally encountered in polymer synthesis.  Further, the project will demonstrate new ways to use covalent, ionic or environmental stimuli to control a soluble polymer's phase selective solubility.  Also, biphasic mixtures of phase selectively soluble polymer supported reagents or catalysts will be used to facilitate high dilution reactions.  The project will lead to the syntheses of new polymers with high solubility with high capacity that are designed for synthesis and catalysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this renewal award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research and educational activities of Dr. David E. Bergbreiter in the Department of Chemistry at Texas A&amp;M University.   Professor Bergbreiter will focus his work on developing methods for preparation of new polymer supported catalysts and new soluble polymer supports with useful phase selective properties.  The advantages of controlling polymer concentrations in specific phases under biphasic conditions and how such effects can facilitate known catalytic or synthetic reactions and their workup is the unifying theme of the project.   Broader impacts are strong in the area of training for both undergraduate and graduate students and the work has significant implications for Green Chemistry. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
