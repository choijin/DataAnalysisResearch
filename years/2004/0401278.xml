<AbstractNarration>The rapid evolution of micro-scale systems technology is generating a demand for power electronic circuits that achieve unprecedented levels of miniaturization.  Furthermore, there is a tremendous need for these power electronics to be manufacturable via batch microfabrication techniques and integrable with other microsystem components. The passive energy-storage components used in power electronics are a major obstacle to achieving miniaturization and integration.  The energy storage density limitations of passive components and their poor scaling characteristics impair converter performance at small scales.  Integrated fabrication of micro-scale power electronics requires components and topologies that circumvent these problems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research program described here addresses the twin challenges of miniaturization and integrated fabrication of micro-scale power electronics.  Two closely-related approaches for meeting these challenges are proposed. The first approach explores novel passive components and circuit topologies based on multi-resonant filter networks that take advantage of the ratiometric matching available through microfabrication. These structures and topologies are compatible with conventional power conversion methods, but require much lower passive-component size. The second approach explores alternative micro-scale passive components that incorporate mechanical modes of energy storage. These microelectromechanical filter components are compatible with the new circuit topologies explored here, can be implemented with MEMS fabrication techniques, and exhibit improved scaling characteristics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research results have the potential for tremendous impact on the size, performance, and manufacturability of micro-scale power electronics.  In pursuing this project, we will also address an important education issue:  the need for engineers that are capable of bringing micro-scale power electronics into widespread application.  This will be accomplished by engaging students in the research, incorporating key research results into our education and community outreach efforts, and by forging synergistic ties between the research and courses at MIT.  As part of these efforts, we will endeavor to engage students with a broad variety of backgrounds in the work, and especially to engage students from under-represented groups.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
