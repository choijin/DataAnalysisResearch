<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;The Principal Investigator (PI), with various collaborators, studies an&lt;br/&gt;area of number theory concerned with representations of Galois groups over&lt;br/&gt;the rationals and cohomology of finite-index subgroups of GL(n,Z).  The&lt;br/&gt;link between these is given by the action of Hecke operators on the&lt;br/&gt;cohomology and the image of Frobenius elements in the Galois&lt;br/&gt;representation.   The PI explores the "ADPS" conjecture, where the&lt;br/&gt;cohomology and Galois representation are both mod-p valued.  He outlines&lt;br/&gt;an approach for proving this conjecture in certain 3-dimensional cases,&lt;br/&gt;testing it in certain 4-dimensional cases, and independently verifying&lt;br/&gt;some of its consequences for Diophantine problems.  The PI states a new&lt;br/&gt;conjecture that links the mod-p objects with automorphic representations&lt;br/&gt;and suggests an approach for proving this conjecture in the 3-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;case.  Finally, the PI and a colleague continue their study of p-adic&lt;br/&gt;families of automorphic cohomology.  On the one hand, for certain classes,&lt;br/&gt;e.g those on GL(3) not lifted from GL(2), they consider questions of&lt;br/&gt;p-adic rigidity.  On the other hand, for deformable classes, they&lt;br/&gt;investigate 2-variable p-adic L-functions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ability to solve systems of algebraic equations has been central to&lt;br/&gt;modern science and engineering.  It has also always been one of the main&lt;br/&gt;topics in mathematics, driven both by these applications and by its&lt;br/&gt;intrinsic aesthetic appeal.    When the equations have whole-number&lt;br/&gt;coefficients, their study becomes part of number theory.  The theory of&lt;br/&gt;prime numbers (numbers without smaller divisors except 1, such as 2,3,5&lt;br/&gt;and 7) is central here.  In the last 50 years, applications of these&lt;br/&gt;theories have become crucial to cryptography and communications theory.&lt;br/&gt;The Principal Investigator studies delicate questions concerning the fine&lt;br/&gt;structure of sets of solutions to systems of polynomial equations, the&lt;br/&gt;symmetries they exhibit, and their (often surprising) relationship to&lt;br/&gt;various interesting geometric and topological objects.    These&lt;br/&gt;relationships are mediated by how the equations behave with respect to the&lt;br/&gt;various prime numbers.  There are a number of conjectural explanations of&lt;br/&gt;these relationships, and the PI studies them, proving them in certain&lt;br/&gt;"easy" cases and verifying them by computer in more complicated cases.  He&lt;br/&gt;also investigates phenomena which compare whole families of these&lt;br/&gt;structures with respect to a fixed prime number.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
