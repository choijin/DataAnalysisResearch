<AbstractNarration>Abstract: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI plans to study the geometry of convex bodies using&lt;br/&gt;methods of harmonic and functional analysis. One direction&lt;br/&gt;is to express different properties of convex bodies in terms&lt;br/&gt;of the Fourier transform and then use methods of Fourier&lt;br/&gt;analysis to solve geometric problems. This approach will lead&lt;br/&gt;to new results on sections and projections of convex bodies,&lt;br/&gt;characterizations of different classes of bodies, new results&lt;br/&gt;of the Busemann-Petty type. Another direction of research is&lt;br/&gt;related to a new connection between convex geometry and the&lt;br/&gt;theory of L_p-spaces, which has recently been found by the PI&lt;br/&gt;and allows to get new geometric results by extending different&lt;br/&gt;facts about L_p-spaces to negative values of p. Particularly&lt;br/&gt;interesting is the question of whether intersection and polar&lt;br/&gt;projection bodies are isomorphically equivalent. A solution to&lt;br/&gt;this problem will represent a big step in understanding the&lt;br/&gt;duality between sections and projections, which remains one&lt;br/&gt;of the most intriguing mysteries of convex geometry. The PI&lt;br/&gt;also plans to apply these methods to several open problems of&lt;br/&gt;asymptotic geometric analysis, including the central limit&lt;br/&gt;problem for convex bodies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study of geometric properties of convex bodies based on&lt;br/&gt;information about sections and projections of these bodies has&lt;br/&gt;important applications to many areas of mathematics and science,&lt;br/&gt;from the classical theory of x-rays and geometric tomography to&lt;br/&gt;different problems of engineering and medicine. A new approach to&lt;br/&gt;sections and projections of convex bodies, based on methods of&lt;br/&gt;Fourier analysis, has recently been developed by the PI. This&lt;br/&gt;approach has already led to several results, including a Fourier&lt;br/&gt;analytic solution of the Busemann-Petty problem on sections of&lt;br/&gt;convex bodies asking whether bodies with uniformly smaller central&lt;br/&gt;sections necessarily have smaller volume. The proposed research&lt;br/&gt;will lead to better understanding of the geometry of convex bodies&lt;br/&gt;and will further relate methods and results of convex geometry to&lt;br/&gt;harmonic analysis, functional analysis and probability. New techniques&lt;br/&gt;for computing the Fourier transform, developed in this project, will&lt;br/&gt;have independent value and can be applied to signal processing and&lt;br/&gt;statistics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
