<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0407732&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Lars Andersson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal aims to investigate the Cauchy problem for the&lt;br/&gt;Einstein equations. Several aspects will be studied, including&lt;br/&gt;nonlinear stability of cosmological spacetimes, as well as the&lt;br/&gt;nonlinear stability of various versions of the Einstein equations&lt;br/&gt;for spacetimes with one spatial Killing field. Studies of the&lt;br/&gt;asymptotic behavior near spacetime singularities will be carried&lt;br/&gt;out, with particular attention to aspects of the BKL proposal and&lt;br/&gt;asymptotic silence. Here a combination of numerical and&lt;br/&gt;analytical methods will be used.  Elliptic gauge formulations for&lt;br/&gt;the Einstein equations will be investigated. These are of&lt;br/&gt;interest for large scale numerical computations, as well as for&lt;br/&gt;the Cauchy problem for rough initial data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Einstein equations describe the geometry of spacetime, which&lt;br/&gt;in turn determines the motion of bodies (planets, stars,&lt;br/&gt;galaxies) in space, as well as the dynamics of fields and&lt;br/&gt;particles via their respective field theories. The geometric view&lt;br/&gt;of the universe provided by the Einstein equations has led to&lt;br/&gt;some of the most fundamental and paradoxical features of our&lt;br/&gt;picture of the universe, including the initial spacetime&lt;br/&gt;singularity or Big Bang and black holes. The mathematical study&lt;br/&gt;of spacetimes in extreme conditions such as near the Big Bang&lt;br/&gt;singularity or near the singularity in black holes has led to a&lt;br/&gt;far reaching conjecture called ``Cosmic Censorship'', which&lt;br/&gt;implies that phenomena which violate the intuitive notions of&lt;br/&gt;causality must be hidden (censored) from observers. In this&lt;br/&gt;project, problems related to cosmic censorship are studied using&lt;br/&gt;a combination of computer based and analytical techniques, with a&lt;br/&gt;particular focus on the evolution of geometry from initial&lt;br/&gt;conditions.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
