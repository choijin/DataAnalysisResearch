<AbstractNarration>This project will develop the necessary geometric algorithms and design technologies that support subdivision surface based modeling in computer automated product realization (CAD/CAM) applications. Subdivision surfaces have already been used as primitives in several commercial systems such as AliasIWavefront's Maya, Pixar's Rederman, Nichiman's Mirai, and Microspace' Lightwave 3D. However they have not been used as a major surface representation in CAD/CAM systems as yet because the necessary geometric algorithms and modeling techniques in surface tessellation, surface fairing, shape design and surface trimming are still lacking. These algorithms and technologies are important as they will be the building blocks of many subdivision surface based modeling operations for next generation surface representation in CAD/CAM systems. Specific research will address surface tessellation through error control techniques and adaptive refinement techniques; automatic surface fairing through fairness indicating methods and automatic surface irregularity detecting and correcting techniques; shape design through interpolation-based shape design and control mesh manipulation methods; and new surface trimming curve representation schemes to avoid excessive computational requirements. The proposed research will provide significant advancement in subdivision surface based modeling, with a precise and efficient way to generate input to the finite element process while also addressing manufacturability issues. Design engineers will be provided with effective tools to sculpt a surface into a desired shape that has not been created before. This is expected to be accomplished through the new Boolean operations to form more complicated objects. The resulting tools are expected to be more reliable in supporting next generation surface representation for CAD/CAM product design and development. Graduate courses in both Geometric Design and Freeform Solid Modeling will be enhanced with the integration of these research results.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
