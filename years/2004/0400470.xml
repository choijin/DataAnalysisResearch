<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;It is proposed to conduct research on the design of output feedback control of nonlinear systems.&lt;br/&gt;In the past several years, the principal investigator's team has introduced and developed a new&lt;br/&gt;approach to this problem that combines high-gain observers with saturation nonlinearities. The&lt;br/&gt;approach proved useful in achieving fundamental progress in semiglobal stabilization, sliding-mode&lt;br/&gt;control, servomechanisms, and adaptive control. The earlier work has emphasized robustness and&lt;br/&gt;asymptotic behavior, which quite often come at the expense of the transient performance. The&lt;br/&gt;goal of this proposal is to develop new tools for nonlinear design that ensure acceptable transient&lt;br/&gt;performance, while ensuring robustness and a desired asymptotic behavior. There are two main&lt;br/&gt;thrusts in the proposal. The first one it to develop the tool of conditional integrators and ser-&lt;br/&gt;vocompensators, which was recently introduced by the principal investigator's team, to a much&lt;br/&gt;wider class of nonlinear systems and design methods. The second one is to develop a logic-based&lt;br/&gt;switching control strategy for a class of nonlinear systems, as an alternative to robust and adaptive&lt;br/&gt;control, in order to improve performance in the face of large model uncertainties.&lt;br/&gt;The class of nonlinear systems under consideration arises in many applications such as mechan-&lt;br/&gt;ical systems, aircraft control, and electric motor drives. Earlier results have been applied to the&lt;br/&gt;control of induction motors and a mechanical system known as the pendubot. It is planned to&lt;br/&gt;continue using these two systems as testbeds for the new techniques.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
