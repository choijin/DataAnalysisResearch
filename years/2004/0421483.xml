<AbstractNarration>Project summary&lt;br/&gt;We propose the acquisition of a picosecond streak camera system for time-resolved&lt;br/&gt;measurements of photoluminescence from semiconductor nanostructures. The equipment will be&lt;br/&gt;located in the PIs optics laboratory in Ginzton, where it would be completely accessible to the&lt;br/&gt;co-PIs and their students residing in the same building, as well as to the interested users from&lt;br/&gt;other research groups around Stanford. Ginzton Laboratory has a strong infrastructure for&lt;br/&gt;nanophotonics research, including state-of-the-art optics laboratories of the investigators and a&lt;br/&gt;shared microfabrication facility. In addition, the Stanford Nanofabrication Facility is located in&lt;br/&gt;the neighboring building and is extensively used by the investigators. The streak camera will&lt;br/&gt;complement the existing capabilities of the PIs and broaden their research in the fields of&lt;br/&gt;nanoscale photonics and quantum information processing, which are already major thrusts in the&lt;br/&gt;Ginzton Laboratory. Moreover, the camera will enable research training of a large number of&lt;br/&gt;graduate and undegraduate students from the research groups of the investigators in performing&lt;br/&gt;time-resolved spectroscopy and will thus be important in education of a new generation of&lt;br/&gt;scientists who will exploit nanophotonics at its full potential. The PIs also place an emphasis on&lt;br/&gt;research training of women and other underrepresented groups; for example, there are usually&lt;br/&gt;around 10 women researchers (mainly experimentalists) across their groups.&lt;br/&gt;The streak camera system is capable of unprecedented sensitivity in performing time-resolved&lt;br/&gt;photoluminescence measurements. If the NSF decides to fund this project, the activity that would&lt;br/&gt;result would be time-resolved study of light emitted from photonic nanostructures (e.g., photonic&lt;br/&gt;crystal structures) with embedded emitters, such as excitons in quantum dots or quantum well&lt;br/&gt;impurities. This is crucial for development of novel low-threshold and high-speed lasers and&lt;br/&gt;optical modulators, as well as hardware for emerging technologies such as quantum computation&lt;br/&gt;and quantum communication (e.g., single and entangled photon sources and photon storage&lt;br/&gt;components). PIs are presently leading research programs focused on quantum information&lt;br/&gt;processing in the optical domain and on development of optical interconnects; these programs&lt;br/&gt;would also greatly benefit from the acquisition of the proposed equipment.</AbstractNarration>
