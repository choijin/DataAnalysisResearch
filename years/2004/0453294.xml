    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The EMBARC Program (Experiences in Molecular Biology Academic Research Careers) at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) will provide a comprehensive ten-week residential summer research program for eligible undergraduates. Participants will conduct individual research projects focused on the "Structure and Function of Biological Molecules" with faculty mentors drawn from three departments: Biological Sciences, Chemistry and Biochemistry, and Chemical and Biochemical Engineering. REU Trainees will work closely with their faculty research mentors and members of their research labs. The Trainees will participate in a weekly Summer Research Seminar Course in ethics, scientific communication, and career choices related to the research doctorate. Students will also receive laboratory safety training and participate in a GRE Preparation Course. Regular group meetings with the Program Directors will be held to monitor student progress and to encourage professional interaction and group camaraderie. Trainees will discuss their research projects at the group meetings and complete portfolio assignments related to the elements of a scientific poster. The student research experience will culminate in an end-of-the-summer Undergraduate Research Fest with other campus programs in which all participants will describe their projects using posters or platform talks. Recruitment will target community and four-year colleges with significant student populations of groups that are under-represented in the sciences. Further information and application materials are available by contacting Dr. Janice Zengel at Zengel@umbc.edu, 410-455-2876, or visiting http://www.umbc.edu/EMBARC.</AbstractNarration>
