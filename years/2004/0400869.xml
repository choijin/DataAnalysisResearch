<AbstractNarration>Proposal DMS-0400869&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Inverse anisotropic problems and resonances&lt;br/&gt;PI: Plamen Stefanov, Purdue University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will work in the areas of Inverse Problems and Resonances. The PI&lt;br/&gt;will study mainly inverse problems of recovering a Riemannian metric from&lt;br/&gt;boundary or inverse scattering data. The central problem is the boundary&lt;br/&gt;rigidity problem for Riemannian metrics (called also inverse kinematic&lt;br/&gt;problem),  where one has to recover a Riemannian metric in a bounded domain&lt;br/&gt;from the lengths of geodesics connecting every two boundary points. This&lt;br/&gt;problem is closely connected to the inverse problem of recovering a metric&lt;br/&gt;from the associated hyperbolic Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DN) map on the&lt;br/&gt;boundary, and also to an associated inverse spectral problem. The PI plans&lt;br/&gt;to study the problem of generic uniqueness for simple metrics and stability&lt;br/&gt;estimates. Related problems in integral geometry will be studied, like the&lt;br/&gt;linearized problem: recovery of tensors from integrals along geodesics and&lt;br/&gt;stability estimates. The PI will also work on the elliptic anisotropic&lt;br/&gt;inverse boundary value problem, the inverse backscattering problem for the&lt;br/&gt;acoustic equation, and related inverse problems where one has to recover the&lt;br/&gt;coefficients of the principal symbol of the differential operator from&lt;br/&gt;boundary or scattering data. In the area of Resonance Theory, the proposer&lt;br/&gt;plans to study the location and asymptotic distribution of resonances for&lt;br/&gt;various systems. Both scattering systems and semi-classical Schroedinger&lt;br/&gt;type of equations  will be considered. Among the problems that will be&lt;br/&gt;studied are sharp upper bounds of the number of resonances in a disk or&lt;br/&gt;sector in the complex plane, upper and lower bounds connected with various&lt;br/&gt;characteristics of the trapped sets of the associated classical mechanics&lt;br/&gt;problem. Mathematical justification of numerical methods for computing&lt;br/&gt;resonances will be also considered. The properties of the scattering&lt;br/&gt;amplitude near resonances will be studied as well, which is related to the&lt;br/&gt;problem of observability of resonances. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inverse Problems, and in particular the problems in this proposal, is a&lt;br/&gt;mathematical tool of great importance to other sciences. Applications are&lt;br/&gt;numerous: they are used in medicine for imaging the internal structure of a&lt;br/&gt;human body and for medical diagnostics, in non-destructive material testing,&lt;br/&gt;in geophysics for obtaining information about the inner structure of the&lt;br/&gt;earth from seismic waves, in oil exploration, etc. Riemannian metric models&lt;br/&gt;anisotropic media, where the speed of wave propagation may depend not only&lt;br/&gt;on the position but also on the direction. The boundary rigidity problem is&lt;br/&gt;of interest not only to scattering theory but also to Riemannian geometry,&lt;br/&gt;its linearized version is a problem of independent interest in integral&lt;br/&gt;geometry as a generalized Radon transform. Resonance Theory is part of&lt;br/&gt;Scattering Theory for quantum mechanical and wave equation type of systems&lt;br/&gt;in unbounded domains. Resonances are certain frequencies that can be&lt;br/&gt;observed in a variety of situations in Quantum Chemistry, Physics,&lt;br/&gt;Acoustics, etc. Besides being motivated by applications in other natural&lt;br/&gt;sciences, Resonance Theory uses tools from and encourages further&lt;br/&gt;development of mathematics areas as Microlocal Analysis, Dynamical Systems,&lt;br/&gt;and Geometry. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
