    <AbstractNarration>This grant supports the 2004 Physical Metallurgy Gordon Research Conference on "Property Prediction: The Challenge of Scales". The meeting will be held on July 25-30th at the Holderness School in Plymouth, New Hampshire. The goal of this conference is to provide a forum for active discussion of recent scientific advances in the area of material property prediction with emphasis on montonic and cyclic properties of complex materials at various length scales. In recent years there have been dramatic advances in experimental, theoretical and computational aspects of property prediction. This meeting highlights these advances and identifies key directions for future research in this field. The agenda has been organized around several critical topics including the Design-Materials Interface, Characterization of Structures Across Scales, Deformation Structures, Connecting Dislocations and the Continuum, Novel Techniques for Property Measurement, Time- and Rate-Dependent Deformation, and Variability, Probabilistics and Life Prediction. Since the 2000 Physical Metallurgy Conference highlighted advances in process modeling, one session will be devoted to the linkage between these two classes of models. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NSF funds support conference fees and travel expenses for graduate students and post-doctoral researchers attending the conference. Each of the student candidates will present a poster on their research. Diversity is a primary consideration in the selection of the student/postdoctoral candidates. The speakers and chairs represent a diverse group of experts from leading institutions around the world. The meeting is composed of approximately 100-130 researchers from academia, national laboratories and industry.</AbstractNarration>
