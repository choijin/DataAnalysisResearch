<AbstractNarration>Matrix computations are ubiquitous in scientific and engineering applications.&lt;br/&gt;The existence of high-quality algorithms and resulting software packages, such as&lt;br/&gt;LAPACK and MATLAB, greatly alleviates the burden on scientists and engineers, allowing&lt;br/&gt;them to devote their energy to the particular application at hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is addressed towards identifying and solving some novel and fundamental matrix&lt;br/&gt;problems that arise in modern applications. The last decade has&lt;br/&gt;seen significant advances in communications technology and infrastructure;&lt;br/&gt;prime examples are the world-wide web, wireless computing and sensor networks.&lt;br/&gt;These modern applications lead to a vast variety of interesting problems --- these range&lt;br/&gt;from complex design constructions, data warehousing and retrieval problems, to the need for &lt;br/&gt;intelligent analysis of huge amounts of data. As a response to these needs,&lt;br/&gt;many new matrix problems arise that need to be solved robustly and efficiently.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some of the most challenging problems in the analyses of large data matrices are the&lt;br/&gt;related problems of clustering, co-clustering (simultaneous clustering&lt;br/&gt;of rows and columns), and matrix approximations. In many applications, the data&lt;br/&gt;is not Gaussian, and hence traditional techniques, such as singular value&lt;br/&gt;decomposition (SVD) and classical Euclidean k-means are often inadequate.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project formulates new matrix approximation problems related to&lt;br/&gt;co-clustering: these formulations appeal to a generalized maximum entropy principle&lt;br/&gt;to search for structured matrix approximations that arise naturally for an important&lt;br/&gt;class of statistical distributions, known as exponential families. The aim of the&lt;br/&gt;project is to develop the theory as well as robust, numerical software for these&lt;br/&gt;matrix computations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another important class of problems contains varied inverse problems: given&lt;br/&gt;a set of desirable properties, construct a data matrix that satisfies these properties.&lt;br/&gt;Such inverse problems arise in diverse applications, such as the design of&lt;br/&gt;kernel similarity matrices for statistical learning and the design of Gram matrices&lt;br/&gt;with low cross-correlations for wireless communications. The plan is to&lt;br/&gt;use alternate projection schemes, and numerical optimization to solve such design&lt;br/&gt;problems. The outcome of the project would be a unified framework for these inverse&lt;br/&gt;problems, including modeling, algorithms and software.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is anticipated that there will be two broad research impacts of the proposed project.&lt;br/&gt;The first contribution would be to applied mathematics and computer science&lt;br/&gt;--- the formulation and proposed solutions of the novel matrix problems that&lt;br/&gt;arise naturally in applications. It is hoped that the proposed work will vitalize the&lt;br/&gt;search for better algorithms, and further deepen the connections between applied mathematics&lt;br/&gt;and engineering.  The second contribution would be to the applications themselves. Posing particular&lt;br/&gt;application tasks in terms of well-defined matrix problems should lead to faster&lt;br/&gt;and more reliable methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will support the graduate education of 2 or 3 students. These students will be trained in the&lt;br/&gt;multidisciplinary areas of computational linear algebra, data mining, statistical pattern recognition and &lt;br/&gt;wireless computing. Specialized courses in all these areas are available in the Computer Science,&lt;br/&gt;Applied Mathematics and Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering departments at UT Austin.&lt;br/&gt;Such a broad education will fill the need for substantial academic and industrial demand in these&lt;br/&gt;multidisciplinary areas for educated personnel.&lt;br/&gt;The project will also support research experience for one undergraduate, and a conscious effort&lt;br/&gt;will be made to recruit women and minority students.&lt;br/&gt;Results of the project will be published in the linear algebra, data-mining, and information theory&lt;br/&gt;literatures, contributing to each of these areas as well as their cross-fertilization.&lt;br/&gt;Data and software developed under the project will be shared with the scientific community&lt;br/&gt;via a public web site.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
