<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is focused on the development of a protein-based biosensor for immunity assessments in companion animals.  The objective is to develop a prototype of a disposable biochip/fluidics cartridge and associated reader for a panel of canine diseases.  A sandwich immunoassay on a biochip will be developed to measure antibody titer levels associated with canine diseases.  In contrast to existing biochips, the fluorescent labels typically used will be replaced by magnetic nanobeads.  These nanonbeads can be detected individually using an array of magnetic field sensors embedded in the biochip.  The anticipated result of this project will be a biosensor that is simpler, more sensitive and less expensive than existing fluorescent-based biosensors.  Moreover, the commercial biosensor may be readily adapted to detect biowarfare agents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is growing evidence that the standard protocol of routine revaccinations of canines is often unnecessary because the animal still has protective immunity levels.  Not only do over-vaccination create additional costs for dog owners, health risks exist with every vaccine - ranging from life-threatening conditions to conditions that degrade quality of life.  The ability to use a biosensor to perform low-cost, real-time immunity assessments address the current over-vaccination problem by allowing veterinarians to provide tailored disease protection protocols.  Immunity assessments are currently not part of the standard vaccination protocol because current immunity assessments solutions are either:  1) too costly, 2) take too long, 3) do not test a full vaccine panel, or 4) provide results that are difficult to interpret.  This solution combines all of the key features necessary to be part of a veterinarian's immunity assessment protocol.</AbstractNarration>
