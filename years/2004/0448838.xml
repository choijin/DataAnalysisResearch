<AbstractNarration>This CAREER award supports fundamental computational and theoretical research on granular materials and the infusion of new educational methods in teaching at Yale.   &lt;br/&gt;The research component focuses on developing a deeper understanding of athermal and glassy particulate systems, such as granular materials, foams, colloids, and glasses, near the onset of jamming.  As density, temperature, or applied stress are tuned, these systems can transform, often unpredictably, from flowing to 'jammed' solid-like states.  These systems are out-of-equilibrium, and so the powerful tools used to study equilibrium thermal systems do not generally apply. The PI will use computer simulation techniques to address three important questions:  (1) How does the distribution of jamming onsets depend on polydispersity, particle shape, and applied stress?  (2) What physical mechanisms give rise to spatially inhomogeneous flow profiles?  (3) Can a generalized temperature defined from fluctuation-dissipation relations be used to describe steadily sheared athermal systems? The answers to these questions will contribute to the development of a theoretical description of materials near jamming.   &lt;br/&gt;The education component contributes to the education infrastructure at Yale. The PI aims to develop course materials for group learning experiences that will be incorporated into the ME curriculum. The PI plans to increase opportunities for students to improve their computational and numerical skills by designing new courses in numerical methods and simulation techniques, adding computational modules to existing courses, and setting-up a Computation and Simulation Laboratory. The PI will also provide educational and research opportunities for students and faculty at nearby secondary schools and universities by hosting research open houses, giving public lectures on his research, and participating in college and career fairs.  The PI intends to actively and personally recruit students from underrepresented groups.  He has made progress in this area by mentoring students from the STARS program at Yale. &lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;This CAREER award supports fundamental computational and theoretical research on granular materials and the infusion of new educational methods in teaching at Yale.
