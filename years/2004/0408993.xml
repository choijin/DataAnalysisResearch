<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0408993&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Richard B. Melrose and Victor Guillemin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigators propose to study a variety of basic&lt;br/&gt;questions relating analysis, differential geometry and topology&lt;br/&gt;and especially concerned with the appearance of singular&lt;br/&gt;phenomena.  In various collaborations, they plan to study the&lt;br/&gt;solvability properties of elliptic differential and&lt;br/&gt;pseudodifferential operators on manifolds with singularities and&lt;br/&gt;to calculate the topological obstructions, particularly through&lt;br/&gt;K-theory, to invertibility. Jointly, and in other collaborations,&lt;br/&gt;they also intend to continue the study of the propagation of&lt;br/&gt;waves, typically in the form of singular fronts, on manifolds&lt;br/&gt;with singularities and the relationship between these two&lt;br/&gt;problems.  Projects in Kaehler and symplectic geometry emphasize&lt;br/&gt;moment maps for groups acting on these spaces and constructions&lt;br/&gt;such as cutting, gluing, and reduction by groups of symmetries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the features of several of these projects is the&lt;br/&gt;expression of analytic objects on a global scale through the&lt;br/&gt;differential topology of the underlying space.  For example, many&lt;br/&gt;geometric spaces carry versions of the equation describing wave&lt;br/&gt;motion, and aspects of the shapes of the spaces are recorded in&lt;br/&gt;the decay and scattering properties of waves on them.  This work&lt;br/&gt;tends to bring together various strands of research in&lt;br/&gt;mathematics and physics, in particular quantization theory and&lt;br/&gt;symplectic geometry, the study of spaces on which Hamiltonian&lt;br/&gt;mechanics can be defined.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
