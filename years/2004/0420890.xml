<AbstractNarration>This grant provides researchers at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology (RHIT) and surrounding colleges with access to an x-ray machine that is capable of (i) producing publishable x-ray diffraction patterns for faculty and student research projects; (ii) providing students training on a modern research tool used in basic materials science and engineering, and (iii) generating enthusiasm for science in middle school students.  The grant will enable research on novel magnetic materials and shape memory alloy (SMA) based MEMS devices by providing the ability to identify the materials and phases produced by various fabrication techniques.  The magnetic material research uses two fabrication techniques.  The first technique uses a modified carbon-arc technique with 1) faster cooling rates during the synthesis and/or 2) higher pressure reactions to create an alloyed samarium cobalt/carbon nanoparticle.  The second technique uses sputtering with controlled annealing to deposit a SmCo-carbon thin film, which allows for more control over particle size during nucleation from the solid phase.  Two projects are being proposed in the field of SMA-MEMS: 1) an electrical engineering project involving the development of a MEMS model of a sarcomere (the building block for muscles) and 2) a mechanical engineering project developing a heat engine capable of using waste heat as an energy source.  The MEMS model sarcomere will use multiple SMA-MEMS heat actuators to move a model sarcomere in a manner similar to biological sarcomeres.  The MEMS heat engine design, based on the high work densities of SMAs, will result in an oscillating device driven by a temperature gradient.  The grant also provides training to students in the use of an x-ray diffraction machine and will enhance student cognitive understanding of the theory of x-ray diffraction. Finally, middle school students will have an opportunity to use the x-ray machine in RHIT's Explore Engineering program. The x-ray machine will be useful for research, training undergraduates, and generating enthusiasm in students of all ages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant provides researchers at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology (RHIT) and surrounding colleges with access to an x-ray machine that is capable of (i) producing publishable results for faculty and student research projects; (ii) providing students training on a modern research tool used in basic materials science and engineering, and (iii) generating enthusiasm for science in middle school students.  The x-ray machine provides the ability to utilize novel materials that are necessary in materials research.  The grant also provides for training of students in the use of an x-ray diffraction machine and enhances their cognitive understanding of the theory of x-ray diffraction through the modification of existing experiments and the development of new laboratories.  Finally, middle school students in RHIT's Explore Engineering program will be given the opportunity to generate diffraction patterns of common materials such as pennies and to use these patterns in determining the composition of the materials.  The x-ray machine would be useful for research, training undergraduates, and generating enthusiasm in students of all ages.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
