<AbstractNarration>Wireless channel is a challenging communications medium with relatively low capacity per&lt;br/&gt;unit bandwidth, random amplitude and phase uctuations due to multipath time-selective fading,&lt;br/&gt;intersymbol interference due to delay spread and multipaths, and interference from other users&lt;br/&gt;due to the broadcast nature of the radio channel. The physical link design goal is to achieve data&lt;br/&gt;rates close to the fundamental information capacity limits of the channel. Recent results have&lt;br/&gt;shown that MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) channels with multiple transmit and receive&lt;br/&gt;antennas are capable of achieving enormous capacity gains over single antenna channels. This&lt;br/&gt;has spurred key advances in space-time processing to capitalize on increased Shannon capacity.&lt;br/&gt;Accurate knowledge of the CSI (channel state information) of MIMO systems is a prerequisite for&lt;br/&gt;most MIMO physical layer approaches. Traditionally a training sequence, in lieu of the information&lt;br/&gt;sequence, is transmitted during the acquisition mode to enable the receiver to design an equalizer or&lt;br/&gt;estimate the channel in the presence of the aforementioned uncertainties. In the fast time-varying&lt;br/&gt;case, the training sequences may have to be transmitted periodically. For a given bandwidth, use&lt;br/&gt;of training sequences decreases the effective information rate. In blind channel estimation (system&lt;br/&gt;identification) and equalization no training sequences are available or used. In semi-blind channel&lt;br/&gt;estimation approaches, a combination of training and information sequence-based data is used so&lt;br/&gt;that in addition to the training-based data, one also exploits the information in the rest of the&lt;br/&gt;received signal. In superimposed training-based approach the training sequence is \on" all the time&lt;br/&gt;and is transmitted (at low power) concurrently with (superimposed on) the information sequence.&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is concerned with all such three techniques for channel estimation for both single user&lt;br/&gt;and multiple users systems and for both time-invariant frequency-selective channels and frequency-&lt;br/&gt;and time- selective fading channels.&lt;br/&gt;Identification of fast-varying nonstationary processes is best handled via structured nonsta-&lt;br/&gt;tionarities. Our initial focus is on time-varying channels described by a discrete-time complex&lt;br/&gt;exponential basis expansion model (CE-BEM) resulting in either a single-input multiple-output&lt;br/&gt;(SIMO) time-varying linear system for single user systems or a multiple-input multiple-output&lt;br/&gt;(MIMO) linear system for multiuser systems. For wireless channels such canonical models can be&lt;br/&gt;derived based on certain physical parameters such as signal bandwidth, channel Doppler spread and&lt;br/&gt;multipath spread, up to some unknown time-invariant constants. Other modeling approaches such&lt;br/&gt;as wavelet and polynomial bases, will also be considered. We are investigating blind, semi-blind&lt;br/&gt;and superimposed training-based system identification techniques for SIMO and MIMO channel es-&lt;br/&gt;timation, multiuser interference suppression, and equalization and detection of desired user's signal&lt;br/&gt;over asynchronous frequency- and/or time-selective fading channels.&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the proposed research lies in its focus on some fundamental modeling,&lt;br/&gt;signal design and channel estimation issues that cut across several applications areas (e.g. wireless&lt;br/&gt;communications systems and networks, radio communications, and underwater acoustics). Both&lt;br/&gt;theoretical and applications aspects are being considered.&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the project lies in graduate education of underrepresented groups,&lt;br/&gt;research at an EPSCoR institution, participation of students in professional society meetings, and&lt;br/&gt;dissemination of the research results through teaching at both undergraduate and graduate levels&lt;br/&gt;(particularly the courses that are part of the newly established Bachelor of Wireless Engineering&lt;br/&gt;degree program at Auburn University).&lt;br/&gt;A-1</AbstractNarration>
