<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the lack of visualization technology for hierarchical overlapping structured grids created through a process known as Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR).  Although the AMR structure makes possible simulations that would have otherwise been too computationally and memory expensive using a uniform grid approach, it leaves the scientist with a lack of visualization tools to properly render the resulting volumetric data.  Therefore, there is a need for visualization tools that are focused on volume rendering the large, multivariate, time-varying data produced by simulations using the AMR technique.  In this project, a volume rendering approach is described that will enable scientists to effectively visualize the results of their simulations.  A ray casting algorithm will be implement allowing for accurate visualization with the ability to trade quality for speed, flexible compositing of multivariate data, and adaptability across a variety of computational platforms from massively parallel to a desktop computer.  A prototype visualization system will be created which will demonstrate interactivity through the use of level of detail techniques, advanced transfer function editing for multivariate data, and intermixing of the volume rendering solution with standard geometric techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Early in the development cycle, the core AMR visualization technology will be incorporated into the open source Visualization Toolkit in order to gain valuable feedback and to gain recognition in this field.  This inclusion will provide researchers with early access to these visualization techniques, freeing up valuable time currently spent implementing custom solutions.  The availability of these AMR visualization methods as source code will enable future research in the area of AMR visualization to be based upon the results obtained through this effort.  The documentation (including a commercially available textbook and users' guide) and the training classes for the Visualization Toolkit will be updated to include AMR visualization, providing educational opportunities for new researchers in the area.  In addition to the availability of this technology as part of an open-source toolkit, a commercial application will be developed to provide AMR visualization in a turn-key application.  AMR visualization provided in an end-user application will eliminate the need for most researchers to develop their own visualization solutions, allowing more time to be focused on the core science.</AbstractNarration>
