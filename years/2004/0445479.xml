<AbstractNarration>The long-term objective of the project is to study important molecular targets for deciphering the regulatory mechanisms of cell life and death, and to gain new knowledge about how a cell functions as a basic unit of life.  Protein kinases are enzymes that catalyze the reactions to add a phosphate group to a protein, thereby regulating the function of the protein.  Protein kinases are encoded by one of the largest gene families in the genome of various living organisms including mammals, and through reversible phosphorylation of substrates they mediate signal transduction pathways that control virtually every aspect of cell function and survival.  The goal of this project is to investigate the regulation of Schizosaccharomyces pombe fission yeast Dsk1 and Kic1 protein kinases during the cell cycle.  Dsk1 and Kic1 belong to a newly emerging class of dual-specificity protein kinases, the prototypes of which are featured with the "LAMMER" signature motif.  These LAMMER-related kinases are conserved throughout evolution and are implicated in the regulation of cell growth, death, and differentiation during development including neurogenesis.  Although critical, the regulation of these kinases in response to external signals and internal cues for cell survival and function remains unclear.  The project aims to build upon the earlier work on Dsk1 and Kic1 by the Principle Investigator and to gain a better understanding of their functions in cell growth and proliferation.  This study will fill the gap in the in vivo investigation of the kinase families and shed light on the biological roles of the kinases, which are fundamental to all living organisms.  Besides the scientific impact, implementing the research activities will contribute a unique perspective to the scientific environment in undergraduate colleges.  The project will directly involve over 25 undergraduates every year in research and incorporate part of the project into the Cell Biology and other courses in the Molecular Biology Program, thus engaging students with project-based laboratories and promoting the integration of research and science education.  This project will also provide opportunities for students to experience the excitement of current biology and stimulate students' interest in biological research.  Moreover, this project will contribute to the diversity of future scientists in biology by encouraging underrepresented minority and women students to participate in research.</AbstractNarration>
