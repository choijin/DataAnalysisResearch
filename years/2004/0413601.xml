<AbstractNarration>In the last decade the field of organic electronics has received a tremendous impetus; performance improvements coupled with the ability to process these materials at low temperatures over large areas on flexible substrates provide unique technologies and generate new applications. This award from the Instrumentation for Materials Research Program provides support for the acquisition of a thin film deposition (TFD) system at the University of Missouri-Columbia which will be primarily used for the growth of organic films, organic/hybrid optoelectronic devices, and gold nano-functionalized materials. The TFD system, while strengthening the materials growth facility within the physics department, will broaden interdisciplinary cooperation between departments on campus. The broader impact of the proposal derives from the introduction of experimental and instrumentation courses both for undergraduate and graduate physics/materials science students, where the TFD system will be incorporated as part of the course curriculum. Such hands-on courses will enhance the quality of education by preparing students for employment in materials science, biotechnology, and semiconductor based academic research or industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award from The Instrumentation for Materials Research program provides support for the acquisition of a thin film deposition (TFD) system at the University of Missouri-Columbia which will be primarily used for the growth of organic films, organic/hybrid optoelectronic devices, and gold nano-functionalized materials. In particular, the TFD system will allow: (1) thin film growth of organic polymers and molecules for photophysical studies (including electronic and vibrational spectroscopy under hydrostatic pressure) and fabrication of OLEDs, photodetectors and potential spintronics devices; (2) thin film growth of gold nanoparticle absorbed substrates for application in biosensors; (3) fabrication of ZnO-based devices. The proposed work on electronic and vibrational spectroscopy from oriented films and nanofibers of organic materials will probe structure-property relationships and their influence on both charge-transport and photophysical properties. Self-assembled thin films of gold nanoparticles with collagen fibrils provide applications in tissue regeneration and chip-based biosensors. Further, ZnO-based devices provide unique opportunities in optical storage and biomedical imaging. The broader impact of the proposal derives from enhancing the quality of education by the introduction of hands-on courses for upper-level undergraduate and graduate students in physics/materials science.</AbstractNarration>
