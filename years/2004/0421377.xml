<AbstractNarration>1. PROJECT SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;We request funds to acquire a scanning electron microscope that will be capable of high-resolution&lt;br/&gt;electron imaging and cathodoluminescence spectroscopy and imaging (CL) with 1 nm&lt;br/&gt;resolution. The proposed instrument will be located in the cleanroom (Class 100) in the Micro&lt;br/&gt;and Nanotechnology Laboratory at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The&lt;br/&gt;Laboratory is an interdisciplinary research user facility that houses advanced equipment for&lt;br/&gt;materials and device processing. The laboratory has been very successful in facilitating cross-disciplinary&lt;br/&gt;research and collaborations. Over 40 faculty, 20 postdoctoral fellows, 200 graduate&lt;br/&gt;students, and many undergraduates have access to the laboratory. The users span across various&lt;br/&gt;disciplines and departments on campus. The user list is steadily growing as we facilitate&lt;br/&gt;discussions between various groups on the versatility of nanotechnology. Personnel from&lt;br/&gt;neighboring academic institutions are users of the laboratory also.&lt;br/&gt;The availability of the proposed SEM+CL system is critical to many research programs active at&lt;br/&gt;the University of Illinois. Three illustrative examples of these research programs are described in&lt;br/&gt;detail. These are:&lt;br/&gt;Nanoscale Pattern Formation in Soft Materials (John Rogers and Ilesanmi Adesida)&lt;br/&gt;Nanophotonics: Quantum Dots and Photonic Crystals (James Coleman and Kent&lt;br/&gt;Choquette)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Silicon Bionanotechnology (Gregory Timp)&lt;br/&gt;Various other projects make use of the facilities in the laboratory and among these are the&lt;br/&gt;projects that have recently being started under the newly awarded NSF Center for Nano-Chemical-&lt;br/&gt;Electrical-Mechanical Manufacturing Systems (Nano-CEMMS) at the University of&lt;br/&gt;Illinois. The proposed research instrumentation is vital to these projects since they involve&lt;br/&gt;fabrication at length scale less than 20 nm.&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this proposal is in the new science and innovations that will be&lt;br/&gt;facilitated. The proposed instrumentation will enable imaging and spectroscopy at the nano-regime;&lt;br/&gt;understanding phenomena in organic and inorganic structures and systems at this scale&lt;br/&gt;will open a vista to new applications. The proposed instrumentation will facilitate collaborations&lt;br/&gt;across various disciplines and the research will lead wide-ranging applications in medicine, food,&lt;br/&gt;environment and electronics.&lt;br/&gt;For the broader impact, the proposed instrument will see significant use in&lt;br/&gt;graduate/undergraduate research and education programs. Minority and under-represented&lt;br/&gt;students will be recruited through various mechanisms involving our campus-wide Summer&lt;br/&gt;Research Opportunity Program (SROP) and through our collaborative programs with minority&lt;br/&gt;serving universities in Centers such as the Nano-CEMMS. Faculty from these schools will have&lt;br/&gt;access to the laboratory through these Centers also. Programs for k-12 teachers to conduct&lt;br/&gt;summer research in the laboratory with access to the research instrumentation is in place. Self-operation&lt;br/&gt;of the equipment by all qualified researchers regardless of institutional/departmental&lt;br/&gt;affiliations or source of funding is encouraged so as to enhance their education. With the&lt;br/&gt;availability of the proposed instrumentation, we envisage an increase in usage by and&lt;br/&gt;collaborations with industry.&lt;br/&gt;The total estimated cost of acquiring the proposed instrument is $688,338. Of this amount, we are&lt;br/&gt;requesting $481,837 from the National Science Foundation. The University of Illinois will&lt;br/&gt;provide cost sharing of $206,501 (30.0 %) of the total cost of the instrument.</AbstractNarration>
