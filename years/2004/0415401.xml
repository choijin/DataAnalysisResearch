<AbstractNarration>This award will facilitate the incorporation of genome-enabled science into the Microbial Diversity Summer Course at the Marine Biological Laboratory at Woods Hole, MA. Thomas Schmidt (Michigan State University) and William Metcalf (University of Illinois) will be co-directors of the course, which is an intensive 6.5-week lecture and laboratory-based experience designed for graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and established investigators. The Microbial Diversity course takes advantage of the diverse natural environments found near Woods Hole: microbial mats in salt water marshes, anaerobic communities in freshwater bogs, pelagic and benthic communities in marine ecosystems, and the many marine animals and plants that harbor microbial symbionts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The emphasis on culture-based approaches has been the historical backbone of the course; however, the revolution in molecular methods and their impact on the study of both cultivated and yet-to-be cultivated microorganisms will not be ignored. The continued infusion of genomic approaches into the course will provide instruction in the use of sequence-based methodologies, molecular phylogenetics, and comparative genomics to mine the riches of diverse microbes. A significant new addition to the course will be the inclusion of modules exploring the use of metagenomics as a tool for examining the genetic traits that allow microbial populations to thrive in their environments. By integrating principles from evolutionary and genomic sciences, the course will offer a perspective of metabolic diversity that is informed by the natural selective forces that have shaped microbes and their genomes. One of the broader impacts of offering such a course is that participants form around the world and from underrepresented groups in the sciences will be in a position to share a unified, contemporary vision of microbiology with colleagues at their home institutions.  Discovery based research will be used as a vehicle to teach both the cultivation and molecular approaches to study microbial biodiversity. Importantly, a significant portion of the course is devoted to in-depth independent research projects, allowing each student to tailor their course experience to their respective educational needs and interests. A series of mini-symposia on current topics of interest in the areas of microbial diversity, genomics, and ecology are also planned. These allow students the opportunity to meet and interact with world-renowned investigators, as well as young investigators conducting cutting-edge research in microbiology. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
