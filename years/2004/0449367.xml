<AbstractNarration>Award Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall aim of this project is to better understand color vision in insects and other invertebrate animals. Insects use color as an important cue in navigation, avoiding predators and identifying food sources. Dr. Britt will study how different forms of the visual pigment rhodopsin are tuned to different colors of light. Using the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster as a model system, Dr. Britt's laboratory will identify specific amino acids within the rhodopsin protein that are responsible for differences in color sensitivity and that play a role in activating the protein when light is absorbed. &lt;br/&gt;Drosophila melanogaster utilizes forms of rhodopsin that have unique color properties, and these visual pigments can be studied using well-developed molecular biological, genetic and physiological methods. In addition, this experimental system provides the opportunity to examine diverse invertebrate visual pigments, such as those from the butterfly Papilio glaucus. Dr Britt will conduct comparative experiments between fruit flies and butterflies with the aim of identifying fundamental principles underlying the similarities and differences in how these animals distinguish between different colors of light. Dr. Britt's work may ultimately provide important insight into how light influences insect behavior, and thus a means to manipulate insect behavior.  Dr. Britt is also an active mentor for students of underrepresented minorities and involves them in his research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
