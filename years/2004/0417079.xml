<AbstractNarration>This project enhances the current Information Assurance curriculum at the Atlanta University Center, extending it from upper-level courses to be systematically incorporated into the undergraduate syllabus. This project incorporates Information Assurance pervasively throughout the undergraduate Computer Science programs at the Center schools. Further, it enhances specialized Electrical Engineering courses to include concepts of Information Assurance, and builds a research component in Wireless Security. This research will tie faculty efforts in curriculum development to current advances in the field and provide early research experiences to undergraduate students. While each individual school in the consortium does not currently have the resources to develop full-fledged education and research in Information Assurance, as collaborative institutions sharing resources, this can be substantially accomplished. The overall objective of this capacity building is for students in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering to be exposed in a very fundamental fashion to the security ramifications of software and communications technologies. The broader impacts of this effort will include the development of curriculum material that provide a model of a concerted approach to integrating IA concepts into the curriculum, and increasing the pipeline of students, especially African Americans, who will pursue graduate studies in IA in particular and STEM fields in general.</AbstractNarration>
