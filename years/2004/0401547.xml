<AbstractNarration>Dr. Kannappan is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship to carry out a program of research and education at the University of Texas. Despite the success of hierarchical theories of galaxy formation, fundamental gaps remain in our understanding of disk formation, the bulge-disk connection, and the process of mass assembly. Dr. Kannappan will carry out a program of observational research in three areas: (1) direct detection of late-epoch bulge growth and galactic black hole growth, aimed at testing the hypothesis of co-evolution (2) direct detection of gas and stellar disk formation for a broad sample of nearby disk galaxies, and (3) analysis of dynamical scaling relations for galaxies at low and high redshift to study star formation histories, dark and baryonic matter distributions, and the evolution of the velocity function of galaxy halos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Kannappan will also manage a three-part education &amp; outreach program in which she will: (1) create new galaxy-themed activities to meet the astronomy requirement in the Texas state science standards and visit local schools to test these activities, (2) write a "Science in Action" article series for StarDate magazine, and (3) design and mentor a student research project.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
