<AbstractNarration>0409279&lt;br/&gt;Wang&lt;br/&gt;The physics of displacement of water by an invading liquid or gas is an important&lt;br/&gt;geologic and engineering process. Examples include the migration of oil or gas into&lt;br/&gt;brine-saturated rock or remediation of contaminated aquifers by injection of air. The&lt;br/&gt;distribution of the invading fluid can include intricate fingering due to the inherent&lt;br/&gt;randomness of the pore structure and its influence on capillary forces. A successful&lt;br/&gt;method to simulate the invading air is through a pore-scale, modified invasion&lt;br/&gt;percolation model in which the rock's void space is represented by a statistical&lt;br/&gt;distribution of pore and throat sizes. Each pore is connected to several throats. The&lt;br/&gt;throat on the air-water interface that is invaded is the one at which the driving potential&lt;br/&gt;summing gravity, capillary, and viscous forces is greatest. The scientific goal of this&lt;br/&gt;project is to connect the distribution of the fluid phases obtained from the percolation&lt;br/&gt;model to predict the elastic and electrical properties of the bulk rock formation. The&lt;br/&gt;innovation proposed is to use a process-based quantification of fluid saturation at the pore&lt;br/&gt;scale as the basis for predicting physical properties that are extremely sensitive to the&lt;br/&gt;fluid distribution. These predictions are important for inferring the fluid saturations from&lt;br/&gt;geophysical measurements. The working hypothesis is that the size distribution of the&lt;br/&gt;defending water clusters is critical to the bulk elastic behavior. Small, isolated water&lt;br/&gt;clusters behave in an elastically soft manner because the water is able to flow into nearby&lt;br/&gt;air-filled voids. New laboratory measurements of elastic wave velocities during&lt;br/&gt;evaporative drying are proposed. They and recent electrical resistivity measurements&lt;br/&gt;during evaporative drying conducted at Louisiana State University will be used to&lt;br/&gt;calibrate and test the modeling process.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;This research is expected have applications in exploring hydrocarbon reservoirs and in&lt;br/&gt;monitoring remediation of contaminated aquifers. This research will provide key rock&lt;br/&gt;laboratory measurements and modeling tools to simulate the displacement of water by air&lt;br/&gt;or gas and then predict the changes in geophysical properties. New data collected on&lt;br/&gt;changes of elastic wave velocities during evaporative drying will be useful to other&lt;br/&gt;researchers testing their models. The research results will be disseminated through&lt;br/&gt;publications and oral presentations. The computer codes that will be developed as part of&lt;br/&gt;the research will be useful to researchers in industry and will be made available on the&lt;br/&gt;internet.</AbstractNarration>
