<AbstractNarration>The CUNY AGEP Program, MAGNET-STEM, was launched in 1999 to produce a significant &lt;br/&gt;number of underrepresented minority doctoral students in science and engineering fields and to &lt;br/&gt;prepare  them  for  academic  careers. The  major  goal  of  this  project, MAGNET-STEM  II,  is  to &lt;br/&gt;build  on  previous  gains  and  institutionalize  effective  practices  by  strengthening  the  alliance's &lt;br/&gt;undergraduate-to-graduate- to- post graduate infrastructure. This goal is in accord with the NSF &lt;br/&gt;priority  to  "catalyze  changes  in  institutional,  departmental  and  organizational  culture  and &lt;br/&gt;practices that will result in significant increases in the recruitment, retention, degree conferral and &lt;br/&gt;STEM career (especially academic) entry of minority students." Activities will include:  &lt;br/&gt;(1)  undergraduate  /graduate  summer  research  and  internships;  (2)  mentoring  and  mentoring &lt;br/&gt;training;  (3)  conference  presentations;  (4)  colloquia  and  seminars    on  teaching,  science  and &lt;br/&gt;mathematics education, and on communication technologies. MAGNET-STEM II will comprise &lt;br/&gt;an inclusive scholarly community of STEM faculty and students from diverse ethnic, racial, and &lt;br/&gt;geographic backgrounds, as well as persons with disabilities. Students will be guided by experts &lt;br/&gt;in their scientific field to engage in research activities that enable them to master the knowledge &lt;br/&gt;and investigative approaches in their chosen areas of specialization. The project will promote the &lt;br/&gt;social  as  well  as  academic  integration  of  all  AGEP  students  within  departments  and  the &lt;br/&gt;improvement  of  advisement,  in  addition  to  offering  financial  support.  Informal  and  formal &lt;br/&gt;interaction between faculty and students to socialize AGEP scholars to the academic profession &lt;br/&gt;increases the likelihood that they will graduate and move into postdoctoral and faculty positions. &lt;br/&gt;The  intellectual  merit of MAGNET-STEM II derives from the acquisition by AGEP &lt;br/&gt;scholars  of  a  broad  background  of  knowledge  that  enables  them  to  relate  issues  in  science, &lt;br/&gt;mathematics, and technology education to one another and to specialize in one of these areas. To &lt;br/&gt;increase the knowledge base and to develop further their research interests, AGEP scholars will &lt;br/&gt;have access to affiliated institutions such as Bell Laboratories, Brookhaven National Laboratory, &lt;br/&gt;Institute  for  Basic  Research  in  Developmental  Disabilities,  the  Albert  Einstein  College  of &lt;br/&gt;Medicine, and the Center for the Analysis and Research of Spatial Information (CARSI), a large &lt;br/&gt;state-of-the-art GIS and Remote Sensing Laboratory considered to be one of the finest on the East &lt;br/&gt;Coast.  The City University of New York Graduate Center offers to AGEP scholars training in &lt;br/&gt;mentoring,  and  enrollment  in  the  Colloquium  on  College  Teaching  and  in  the  Science, &lt;br/&gt;Mathematics,  and Technology  (SMT)  in  Education  Seminars,  which  focus  on  college  teaching &lt;br/&gt;and  STEM  education  from  K-12.    SMT  seminars  address  contemporary  research  issues  in  the &lt;br/&gt;fields  of  mathematics,  science  and  technology  in  education.  This  includes  the  education  of &lt;br/&gt;students about technology  in society and its relations to science and mathematics. The CUNY &lt;br/&gt;Graduate Center, as lead  institution,  conducted the  prior AGEP research project,  MAGNET-&lt;br/&gt;STEM  I  (1999-2004),  which  resulted  in  increases  in  the  number  of  minority  applicants, &lt;br/&gt;enrollments and degree conferrals.  &lt;br/&gt;The  broader  impacts  of  MAGNET-STEM  II  will  occur  through  the  production  of  an &lt;br/&gt;increased  number  of  doctoral  students  from  underrepresented  populations  trained  in  their &lt;br/&gt;academic specialties working in our nation's laboratories and classrooms and who have developed &lt;br/&gt;mentoring  experience.  Moreover,  as  a  result  of  participation  in  the  Science,  Mathematics,  and &lt;br/&gt;Technology in Education Seminars offered by the CUNY Graduate Center's Ph.D. Program in &lt;br/&gt;Urban  Education,  AGEP  graduates  will  have  knowledge  of  effective  forms  of  curriculum &lt;br/&gt;articulation  and  partnerships  in  STEM  education  that  extend  to  university,  school,  community, &lt;br/&gt;and  corporate  partnerships,  and  that  move  along  the  urban-education K-16  continuum.  In  this &lt;br/&gt;connection,  AGEP  scholars  will  work  to  prepare  teachers  of  STEM  education,  leading  to  an &lt;br/&gt;improvement  of  student  achievement  in  STEM  education  within  culturally  diverse  urban &lt;br/&gt;populations and, hence, to systemic reform.</AbstractNarration>

All doctoral students in STEM fields were eligible to participate in all program activities. Students in SBES (Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences) disciplines also participated.  The major goals of the (MAGNET-STEM II) Alliance for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (AGEP) program grant awarded to the CUNY Graduate Center were 1) to increase the applicant pool of students from historically under-represented groups in the Sciences, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics and, importantly, 2) to increase the number of doctoral degrees conferred in this demographic and to prepare them for professional careers, especially in the academy.  Through proactive recruitment that targeted underrepresented groups, this MAGNET-STEM  alliance was able to increase minority applications and to lift enrollments in this demographic in absolute numbers from an average of 122 in the pre-grant period to an average of 171 in MAGNET-STEM  II.  The minority percentage of the total STEM pool rose from an average of 14 percent in the pre-grant period to 16 percent during MAGNET STEM II. As a result of sustained support services for these enrollees, during the grant period an average of 16  degrees were awarded to minority students each year, or about 15% of total STEM degrees awarded annually by this alliance, up from 8.2 per year or 5 % of the total during the pre-grant period.

The majority of these support services have been institutionalized.  Students in this alliance from all STEM fields who participated in these activities, but especially those from the funded disciplines, which included biochemistry, biology, chemistry, computer science, earth &amp; environmental sciences, engineering, mathematics, physics, psychology, speech-learning-hearing sciences,  and technology  benefited academically and  socially, as well as financially.  Intellectual merit: Participating students met regularly in monthly colloquia not only with doctoral students from their own discipline, but with those from other STEM disciplines, as well as from their peers in SBES. In discussing their research, students learned how disciplines other than their own advance knowledge and benefit society. Additional interdisciplinary perspectives for broader impact were afforded through the annual conferences held at the CUNY Graduate Center at which undergraduates, graduates, postdoctoral fellows, faculty, administrators, and  policy makers from around the country presented  their research, shared views and engaged intellectually on p...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
