<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this CAREER proposal is to understand a novel laser-based directed assembly approach and evaluate its potential as an innovative surface nanostructure manufacturing technique. These objectives will be achieved by combining experimental research with computational work. Ordering of Co, Ag and Ti nanostructures will be studied on Si and SiO2 substrates. Ordering will be achieved in a single-step by simultaneous laser-interference irradiation during physical vapor film deposition. The assembly will be studied as a function of laser and thin film growth parameters and will be characterized via AFM,SEM, TEM and XRD techniques. Computational modeling via kinetic monte carlo techniques will be used to understand modifications to film growth under laser irradiation. The educational objective of this work is to promote fundamentals of materials science and technology to a wide audience, including, students, teachers and the broader community. This will be achieved through various means, including: 1) a new interdisciplinary nanoscience course for undergraduates and graduates; 2) by involving high-school students and teachers in summer research in the PI's laboratory; and 3) through general science lectures in the local community. These activities will strengthen and enhance the country's contribution to technologies of the future, including, innovative manufacturing, nanotechnology and thin film technology. If successful, this research will provide fundamental and quantitative insight on laser-based dynamic thin film assembly. This will enable a single-step process for nanomanufacturing of ordered surface structures and will be: 1) simple to implement; 2) highly cost-effective; 3) environmentally friendly; and 4) widely applicable to a range of film-substrate materials. The education and outreach will lead to highly trained students and a more knowledgeable general public, which are crucial in maintaining the leading role of the US in future materials technologies.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
