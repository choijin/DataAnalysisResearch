<AbstractNarration>In the past 10-15 years there have been significant developments in the&lt;br/&gt;areas of  applied regression and classification. Much of the impetus&lt;br/&gt;originally came from outside of the field of statistics, from areas&lt;br/&gt;such as computer science, machine learning and neural networks. In some&lt;br/&gt;cases, statisticians have helped to synthesize these innovations, often by&lt;br/&gt;reinterpreting them from the point of view of standard statistical models.&lt;br/&gt;As a result, we now have at our disposal a very powerful collection of&lt;br/&gt;techniques for adaptive regression and classification.  These are now&lt;br/&gt;being applied to medical diagnosis, bioinformatics and genetic modeling,&lt;br/&gt;chemical process control, shape, handwriting, speech and face recognition,&lt;br/&gt;financial modeling, and a wide range of other important practical&lt;br/&gt;problems.  In this proposal,  the investigator develops new methods for&lt;br/&gt; adaptive regression and classification, with particular application&lt;br/&gt;to problems in bioinformatics and  genomics.  One such method is  the&lt;br/&gt;"fused lasso", a technique which seeks solutions which are both sparse&lt;br/&gt;and  and smooth. It is designed for problems in which the features have&lt;br/&gt;a natural ordering, e.g. in time or space. Protein mass spectometry&lt;br/&gt;represents one such area of application.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this research, the investigator develops new statistical algorithms&lt;br/&gt;for analyzing data from biological and human  experiments.  This work&lt;br/&gt;is part of the exploding field of "bioinformatics", which seeks to make&lt;br/&gt;sense of the huge volume of data produced by new technologies in biology&lt;br/&gt;and medicine. This kind of  work represents the next step after the&lt;br/&gt;sequencing of the human genome, and has enormous potential for societal&lt;br/&gt;impact through disease prevention and treatment.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
