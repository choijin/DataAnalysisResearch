<AbstractNarration>Fellows will rotate through an internship with several distinct K-12 schools that serve disadvantaged children. Master Teachers who have been involved in research at JHU or who are currently participants in a Native American Math Science Partnership will work with the Fellows: to develop pedagogical skills to teach children with different learning styles; to enhance the content knowledge of district teachers; and to facilitate the creation of standards aligned content based on cutting-edge research. Each project will focus on topics from Environmental Engineering and Geography (EEG), including geology, hydrology, ecology, geomorphology, environmental chemistry, human factors (relations between human activities and environmental change). The Fellows will relate each project: (1) to standards, such as the American Association for the Advancement of Science.s Project 2061, Flow of Matter in Ecosystems;. (2) to compelling social issues as global climate change, and preservation of ecosystems; and (3) to the utilization of materials by students with physical limitations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit lies in the potential to advance our understanding of how formal university-K-12 partnerships can improve teaching and learning by delivering challenging and relevant science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) content to traditionally disadvantaged K- 12 students with a wide range of learning styles. A team of eminent scientists, future STEM faculty, leading K-12 teachers, and education experts will work as teams to use engaging EEG content and pedagogy to overcome barriers such as: students. unstable learning environments, curriculums that are in transition due to educational policy shifts, the lack of accommodations for students with physical disabilities, and the scarcity of resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact will be achieved through the development of sustainable K-12 curriculum and laboratory modules deployed by teachers prepared to deliver advanced, multi-disciplinary, and multi-contextual material spanning the STEM disciplines. An independent evaluator will gather information and report the findings on the feasibility of using EEG activities and instructional materials to improve the academic achievement of disadvantaged students with diverse needs.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
