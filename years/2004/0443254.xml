<AbstractNarration>This proposed two-day workshop, from the University of Michigan and Internet2, addresses the "Wizard Gap" involved in networking problems experienced by the scientific application community.  The workshop will involve multiple discipline communities.  It will be the first workshop to simultaneously address this gap from both the network engineering standpoint, and the network expert (or wizard) point of view, and also will be significant in bringing together these experts with members of scientific research communities that use demanding, network-driven applications, along with developers of these applications and campus network engineers.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The goals of the workshop are to: &lt;br/&gt;1) Share the needs, expectations, and related challenges of using networks by scientific applications with network engineers,  &lt;br/&gt;2) Identify commonalities of end-to-end network problems and issues across various scientific communities to prioritize problem solving and focus research &lt;br/&gt;3) Raise awareness and inform the use of various diagnostic tools to facilitate science by making better use of cyberinfrastructure resources. &lt;br/&gt;4) Advance research into designing integrated software and frameworks to support troubleshooting for the most complex end-to-end problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal seeks to construct and execute a workshop focused on performance in grid computing environments.  The workshop will approach this area from a new perspective - that of the user. The workshop will evaluate current approaches to understanding and improving grid performance for applications. Gaps will be identified and areas for future concentration will be summarized in a report. Measurement (what and how), analysis (how to apply measurements), and simulation (applying measurement and analysis) will provide the focus areas. The workshop is targeted for 45 invited experts over 2 days, with funding sources from several agencies.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
