<AbstractNarration>The electrochemical actuation method based on water electrolysis is used to achieve three novel functionalities; one-point self-calibration (zero-point), extension of linear detection range, and increase in sensitivity. Two kinds of oxygen microenvironments (oxygen-depletion and constant oxygen) can be established by using an integrated electrochemical actuation system around the glucose microsensor. The effect of these two microenvironments on the enzymatic reaction kinetics (oxygen dependency of glucose oxidase reaction) is expected to provide the novel functionalities. The amperometric glucose microsensors are fabricated on a flexible polyimide substrate (Kapton or Upilex ) using integrated circuit technology.  The specific objectives are (1) optimization of device structure (geometries of microsensor and microactuator) and actuation signals (magnitude and duration of electrochemical current) to obtain the novel functionalities, (2) development of a smart calibrator based on the stochastic algorithm, and (3) implementation of array to improve reliability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI has a joint appointment in the Departments of Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering and Biological Sciences at the University of Missouri-Rolla (UMR). The primary responsibility of the PI is to bridge the gap between the two disciplines through interdisciplinary research activities and education of the students from both departments. The on-campus Minority Engineering Program (MEP) includes offering of freshman/transfer scholarship, hosting seminars on career and educational opportunities, and sponsoring minority engineering student organizations. UMR runs Women in Engineering and Science Program (WIES) and supports a female engineering student organization to increase the number of female graduates entering our nation's technical workforces.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
