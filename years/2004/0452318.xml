    <AbstractNarration>In this renewal project, the PI will continue to study the characteristics of subtropical cyclones, but will now focus on the occurrence of such cyclones in the Atlantic ocean basin. A climatology of sub-tropical cyclones will be made for a ten-year period from high-resolution analyses. The investigation will employ both synoptic-climatological and case study approaches as well as simulations with a regional high resolution model. The latter will be used to study the evolution of a subtropical cyclone into a tropical cyclone. Weather events associated with these developments are of interest to weather forecasting in North America and improved predictions are likely to have large benefits for society. Both undergraduate and graduate students will be involved in this research.</AbstractNarration>
