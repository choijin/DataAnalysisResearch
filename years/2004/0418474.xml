<AbstractNarration>The proposed  research  seeks to answer two questions: What explains the different  treatment of ethnic-others during violent conflicts between forces split along ethnic lines?  Under what conditions does ethnicity affect the different treatment of ethnic-others? To  answer these questions, the project will study the patterns of violence in the villages of  two municipalities in Bosnia-Herzegovina  --Prijedor and Sanski Most-- during the civil  war from 1992 to 1995. These municipalities are contiguous, were under the control of  Serb forces throughout the civil war, and present similar demographic characteristics. Yet  the Muslim and Croat population in Prijedor experienced a much harsher treatment than  in Sanski Most, and within each municipality some villages were exposed to harsher  measures compared to others.  &lt;br/&gt; The  project  has  the  following  intellectual  merits.  First,  it  goes  beyond  the  existing  literature on civil wars by  focusing on the processes of violence once a civil war starts  rather than the initial causes of the violence. Second, it problematizes the role of ethnicity  in civil wars fought between forces split along ethnic lines. The conventional wisdom in  the field of political science so far has been that ethnicity plays a significant role in these  contexts.  However,  the  existence  of  village  level  variation  in  the  treatment  of  ethnic- others in areas under  the control of one  ethnic  group raises questions about the  significance of ethnicity as a motivation for violence. The proposed project will advance  knowledge  about the role of  ethnicity  in violent contexts by  both testing it against  alternative explanations such as military strategy, and by exploring whether and why the  importance of ethnicity varies from village to village. The Co-PI for the project has been  learning  Serbo-Croat  to  be  able  to  engage  in  research  in  Bosnia-Herzegovina  since  September 2002 and has conducted exploratory research in Bosnia-Herzegovina during  the summer of 2003.   &lt;br/&gt; The broader impacts of the study are threefold. First, the proposed project will generate  data at the level of small units such as villages, which is rare in studies of violence. Thus  the project will provide data for other researchers who want to study micro-dynamics of  violence. (The results and the data will be shared with the academic community, will be  published in academic journals, and presented as part of doctoral dissertation). Second,  the study will be the first to engage in field research to study the patterns of violence in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. This type of research is important, as several scholars have used the  case to propose solutions to ethnic  wars,  yet these recommendations  have  relied on  assumptions about the role of ethnicity in Bosnia during the  civil war, rather than  empirical work. Finally, along with other projects with similar questions, the proposed  project would contribute to the accumulation of knowledge on which regions are more  likely to be in need of humanitarian aid and intervention during civil wars.       &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
