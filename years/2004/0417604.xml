<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;Signal Processing for Communications (SP-COM) is an area that focuses on re-search associated with the infrastructure, hardware, and algorithms of future generation digital communications systems. The primary objective of the CRCD/EI project is to provide scientific and investigative experiences to under-graduate students by immersing them into state-of-the-art communications and signal processing research. The methods employed to accomplish this ob-jective use curriculum strategies that include: a) immersing research-oriented modules in four existing junior and senior level classes, b) offering a new senior level undergraduate course entitled "Introduction to signal processing and communications research," c) the integration of senior-level capstone projects in the ongoing research activities of the PIs, d) the institution of summer research freshman and sophomore camps along with an outreach program. The project will impact student learning by instilling the process of scientific inquiry through a continuous research exposure in the undergraduate curriculum. Several SP-COM research topics, such as those dealing with channel equaliza-tion, source and channel coding, are immersed in courses within the framework of this CRCD project. CRCD curriculum courses and modules involve at least one self-contained computer laboratory experience.  ASU's Java-DSP (J-DSP) web-based simulation environment is used for these laboratories. Students can access J-DSP on the web, perform computer laboratory exercises, and submit electronic lab reports. Significant pedagogical foundations and strategies for the transition of research to the curriculum are formed with the assistance of in-structional specialists. Dissemination and assessment strategies include: an annual CRCD workshop, a CRCD interactive web site, publications in research and education journals, industrial dissemination through industry partners.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
