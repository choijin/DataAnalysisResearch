    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is seeking funding for the purchase of an instrumentation suite composed of two high-speed digital cameras capable resolving three dimensional position, velocity and acceleration. The camera is specially outfitted to make it of particular use over a wide range of needs. Applications for this system vary from resolving phenomena which move anywhere from 0.1 m/s to 800 m/s and resolving images to a resolution ranging from meters to sub-millimeters. The cameras, two Phantom v7s, are capable of capturing 800x600 pixel images at 4,800 frames per second (FPS), up to 150,000 FPS. This proposal includes the cost of 3 lenses: a 50 mm and a 70-200mm zoom lens for larger scale objects and a model KC long distance microscope for resolving small scale objects. The microscope lens coupled with the camera is capable of producing a resolution of 0.0075 mm at 4,800 FPS; more than adequate for the studies in this size range, projects 1, 3, 4 and 8 listed above. The captured images will be the input to a software package, Tema3D, capable of resolving three dimensional position, velocity and acceleration of selected fiducial points as they move through the cameras field of view. This feature is especially useful for resolving motion required by projects 2, 5, 6, 7 and 9 listed above. The three dimensional capability requires two cameras. The proposed equipment is portable and will receive near continuous use through the academic year both for research, research training and educational purposes. The equipment will be used by 9 senior faculty members, several graduate students and approximately 70 undergraduate students per year in two lab sections: Measurement and Mechatronics Laboratory and Thermodynamic/Fluid/Heat Transfer Laboratory. The research projects benefiting form this investment are funded through a variety of sources from industry sponsors such as Greenheck Fan, Ford Motor Company, Rotor Finish, Rockwell Automation and Kimberly-Clark to governmental agencies such as NSF and the Naval Surface Warfare Center. Two of these projects represent undergraduate research training sponsored by the Marquette College of Engineering and the Mechanical Engineering Department. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this capability is to enhance our ability to provide new educational and research training opportunities to our students, attract outside industry participation, move forward in several research programs.</AbstractNarration>
