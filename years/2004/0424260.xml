    <AbstractNarration>This award will provide partial support for the 2004 Correlated Electron Systems Gordon Research Conference to be held in South Hadley, MA, on 20 - 25 June 2004. The traditional emphasis of the meeting has been on understanding material systems with novel electronic properties, such as heavy fermion metals, oxide superconductors, and low-dimensional magnets. The understanding of strongly correlated electron materials contains many fundamental challenges as well as a number of possibilities for technological impact. In an effort to break down the traditional boundaries between communities with common research goals, the 2004 conference will include sessions on charge and spin in nanoengineered systems of reduced dimensionality and on manipulation and control of ultracold atoms. Support for the conference will enable the participation of under-funded junior researchers and members of historically under-represented groups.</AbstractNarration>
