<AbstractNarration> &lt;br/&gt;The dissertation research described in this proposal explores the intersection of labor &lt;br/&gt;economics and urban/regional economics.  The work is motivated by two key &lt;br/&gt;observations: (1) Theoretical work in urban economics provides good reasons to expect &lt;br/&gt;price variation across locations, and empirical evidence verifies that this variation is &lt;br/&gt;substantial.  (2) Standard economic models of labor market behavior, such as human &lt;br/&gt;capital investment, labor supply, or discrimination, are derived under the assumption &lt;br/&gt;(implicit or explicit) that individuals face the same prices.  More importantly, empirical &lt;br/&gt;work based on these models nearly always uses data from national data sources, but &lt;br/&gt;ignore the fact the individuals live and work in local labor markets and thus face different &lt;br/&gt;local prices. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The researcher proposes to revisit standard theories of the returns to education, labor &lt;br/&gt;supply, and racial discrimination in models that recognize that people live in different &lt;br/&gt;locations and thus face different prices.  She then intends to evaluate the likely empirical &lt;br/&gt;importance of these theoretical insights.  The empirical work will entail evaluations of &lt;br/&gt;local labor markets, and thus will require the use of very large data sets.  The researcher &lt;br/&gt;is requested funding from the National Science Foundation to support her use of the &lt;br/&gt;long-form files of the U.S. Census at the Michigan Research Data Center. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Preliminary theoretical work, presented in this proposal, shows how local price variation &lt;br/&gt;is likely to affect important objects of study in labor economics, including the return to &lt;br/&gt;education and labor force participation.  Preliminary empirical work demonstrates that &lt;br/&gt;there are indeed very large differences in the measured returns to education across cities &lt;br/&gt;in the U.S., and also substantial systematic differences in female labor supply.  It is quite &lt;br/&gt;possible that if researchers ignore this variation, resulting empirical work will lead to &lt;br/&gt;serious misunderstandings.  There appears to be little literature on this issue. &lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Empirical labor economics is an important enterprise, providing key inputs to policy &lt;br/&gt;analysis on such important issues as the impact of income taxes, the advisability of &lt;br/&gt;subsidizing education, and the analysis of welfare policy.  The research outlined in this &lt;br/&gt;proposal holds promise of improving our ability to conduct this valuable research. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
