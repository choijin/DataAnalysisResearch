<AbstractNarration>Harmful algal blooms (HABs) are a serious and growing problem in the US and the world.  Among the multiple poisoning syndromes linked to HABs, Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning (PSP) is arguably the most widespread and significant on a global basis. Dinoflagellates within the genus Alexandrium (and in particular within the tamarensis and minutum species complexes) are responsible for many of these PSP outbreaks in the US and in Europe. Several characteristics of the temporal and spatial pattern of Alexandrium species are noteworthy. First, over the last several decades, the distribution of species within both complexes has expanded geographically as a result of natural and human-assisted dispersal mechanisms. Second, there are both toxic and non-toxic varieties of certain species within each of these complexes, and sometimes these bloom in relatively close proximity to each other. This latter observation is particularly noteworthy given recent results, which demonstrate that toxic, and non-toxic strains of A. tamarense can mate and produce resting cysts, but the cells that germinate from these cysts quickly die as they attempt to divide. A reproductive barrier thus exists for at least some strains of this species. The overall objective of this project is to investigate mating compatibilities among toxic and non-toxic members of the tamarensis and minutum species complexes of Alexandrium. This will involve a combination of laboratory and field studies in a direct collaboration between US and EU partners under the EC-NSF Cooperative Activity in Environmental Research. Specific objectives are to: 1) Establish and characterize additional toxic and non-toxic Alexandrium cultures from the northeastern U.S. and Europe; 2) Determine mating compatibility between toxic and non-toxic strains of A. tamarense and A. minutum; 3) Identify a genetic marker to distinguish between toxic and non-toxic minutum; 4) Develop methods to determine the toxic/non-toxic genotype of planktonic cells and cysts; 5) Determine mating selectivity of toxic and non-toxic A. minutum and A. tamarense strains; 6) Participate in European field surveys to map Alexandrium populations in the plankton and sediments; and 7) Employ growth rate, grazing rate and mating preference data to model the outcome of a variety of invasion scenarios and to evaluate the potential of introduced non-toxic Alexandrium species as a bloom control or mitigation strategy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scientific merits of the proposed study are significant, as the mating incompatibilities to be explored may explain observed distributions of toxic and non-toxic Alexandrium species throughout the world and relate directly to the potential success of an invasion of one toxin-type into the domain of the other, such as through natural currents and storms, or ballast water discharge. The broader impacts are also significant. HABs represent a serious threat to public health and efficient utilization of coastal resources. In addition to practical implications with respect to species dispersal via ballast water discharge or other human-assisted means, a novel bloom control or mitigation strategy of potential value to society will be investigated whereby a non-toxic strain of Alexandrium could be introduced to an area subject to toxic outbreaks in a manner analogous to the release of sterile males to control insect pests. Other broad impacts include strengthening the EU-US HAB network of scientists, communicating results via conference presentations, scientific publications, and articles in the popular press, and training and education of young scientists. In the latter context, students and postdoctoral investigators from both the US and the EU will work in the PI's laboratory on this project, supported by outside fellowships, EU funds, internal WHOI funds (Summer Student Fellowships, Minority Traineeships), and REU (Research Opportunities for Undergraduates) support, for which proposals will be submitted. The PI has always placed a high priority on the integration of research and education, and this project will be no exception.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
