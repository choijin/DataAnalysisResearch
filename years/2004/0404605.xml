<AbstractNarration>This award by the Division of Materials Research to University of Missouri Rolla (UMR) is to investigate the usefulness and reliability of a high-temperature differential scanning calorimeter (HTDSC) to measure heat capacities and enthalpies of transition materials at temperatures of 1500 degrees C or higher.  The investigation will measure the heat capacities of "unknowns" gold and ti-tanium oxide, using standard calibration procedures, comparing them against previously deter-mined values.  The impact of sample heating rate, sample mass, choice of cover gas, and sample holder material on the accuracy and uncertainty level will be assessed, after recalibrating for each experimental condition.  A second phase of the experimental program will examine the ability of HTDSC to measure enthalpies of transition, focusing on the enthalpy of melting of gold and that of the alpha-beta transition in neodymium oxide (Nd2O3).  Determining the conditions un-der which the temperature and enthalpy change associated with these transitions can be accu-rately reproduced will improve the usefulness of HTDSC still further. The availability of HTDSC capability at UMR will facilitate cooperation with other research facilities measuring high-temperature Gibbs energies or enthalpies of formation of new ceramic or metallic phases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This investigation will establish appropriate experimental procedures for high-temperature dif-ferential scanning calorimeter (HTDSC) study of materials.  In addition, research studies by this award will enhance U.S. capabilities in high-temperature research, and create a research protocol that can be used by undergraduates and high-school students as well as graduate assistants.  This research will allow integration of HTDSC into existing programs at the University of Missouri - Rolla (UMR) for undergraduate research and interaction with high-school students.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
