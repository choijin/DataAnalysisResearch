<AbstractNarration>Project Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Calcium ions (Ca2+) are used as messengers in all eukaryotic cells to trigger physiological responses to internal and external stimuli, such as hormones and environmental stresses.  The initial perception of Ca2+ is accomplished by proteins that specifically bind the metal and in turn modulate the activities of other cellular proteins.  The best characterized example of this class of proteins is calmodulin (Cam).  Cam proteins have long been implicated in regulating plant growth and development as well as responses of plants to stressful stimuli, but the specific mechanisms by which they participate in these responses are not well understood.  This proposal focuses on defining the role of ATCam9, a novel member of the AtCam gene family of Ca2+-binding proteins in Arabidopsis.  Preliminary data have revealed that AtCam9 might function by a mechanism similar to, but not identical with, more conventional Cam proteins.  This suggests that AtCam9 functions by interacting with and regulating a unique set of proteins.  In addition, knockout mutants of AtCam9 display a rapid growth/overall enlarged phenotype compared with control Arabidopsis plants; knockouts of conventional Cam genes yield plants with reduced growth phenotypes.  Thus, AtCam9 appears to function in a manner distinct from conventional Cam proteins on both the molecular and organismic levels.  &lt;br/&gt;The hypothesis that will be tested in this proposal is whether AtCam9 functions as a negative regulator of the rate of plant growth.  To test this model and define the pathway(s) by which AtCam9 modulates growth, the project will pursue four specific aims:&lt;br/&gt;(1) It will be determined whether AtCam9 regulates growth by modulating cell expansion or whether it also plays a role in cell division.  &lt;br/&gt;(2) It will be determined whether conventional AtCam proteins can substitute for AtCam9, and conversely, whether AtCam9 can substitute for conventional Cam proteins. &lt;br/&gt;(3)  The cell types and subcellular locations in which AtCam9 is expressed will be defined.  As part of this aim, it will be determined whether AtCam9 is freely diffusible, a property that will indicate whether AtCam9 functions by interacting with other proteins.  &lt;br/&gt;(4)  The identities of AtCam9-interacting proteins will be determined, and the timing and subcellular locations of the interactions with AtCam9 will be defined.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact of the Proposed Activity.  Elucidating the specific functions mediated by AtCam9 will provide a deeper understanding of the roles of Ca2+ in regulating plant growth and development, factors that are central to agricultural productivity.  Understanding the molecular bases for the unexpected phenotype displayed by AtCam9 knockout plants may facilitate novel strategies for engineering or controlling plant growth.  The project will provide training for students from the undergraduate through the postdoctoral levels in protein biochemistry, Arabidopsis molecular genetics, analyses of plant growth and cellular imaging.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
