<AbstractNarration>The preparation and investigation of conjugated organic chromophores attached to metal nanoparticles is the focus of this NIRT project.  The investigators will, a) synthesize organic chromophore-metal nanoparticle systems b) investigate steady-state and time-resolved absorption and fluorescence properties, c) determine two-photon absorption spectroscopic properties d) characterize charge transport properties and e) probe electronic interactions at the surface utilizing scanning tunneling microscopy.  Specifically, this project will probe the electronic coupling (due to multipolar and electronic overlap interactions) between the states of the organic-chromophore and the metal particle surface plasmon.  The broader impacts of this project will include the production of novel nanoparticle systems with potential applications in fluorescence sensing, nonlinear optics, and nanoscale electronic devices such as DNS sensors.  The activities of this program will be closely correlated with industrial partners that are also intensely focused on creating revolutionary materials and better trained scientific and engineering workforce.  Students participating in this program will receive integrated interdisciplinary research training in state-of-the-art research laboratories which will help graduates find future positions in industrial and academic institutions.  The experience for students from underrepresented groups will help build interest and confidence in participating in this area of scientific research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project concerns the creation of new nanoscale materials composed of organic dyes attached to small metal particles.  The interaction of these two components may give rise to new and interesting properties which may be applied to biomedical imaging, novel eye protection materials, as well as ultra-small electronic devices.  The project will develop new materials which will subsequently be investigated by various sensitive optical and surface experimental techniques.  These experiments will help us to develop an understanding of the behavior of organic dyes connected to small metal particles.  The activities of this NSF-NIRT program will involve collaboration with industrial partners that are also interested in developing and understanding new materials that can be useful for electronic and optical devices.  Students participating in this program will receive an integrated interdisciplinary research training in cutting-edge research laboratories and device fabrication facilities.  This experience will help graduate students in future positions at industrial and academic institutions.  The experience for students from underrepresented groups will help build interest and confidence in participating in this area of  scientific research.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
