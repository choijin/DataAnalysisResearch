<AbstractNarration>This project builds upon the prototype Physics Teaching Web Advisory (Pathway), which was designed to demonstrate the ability to address issues related to the lack of preparation of many physics teachers, and to provide resources that can enliven even the most expert physics teachers' classrooms.  Pathway's Synthetic Interviews and related video materials are beginning to provide pre-service and out-of-field in-service teachers with much needed professional development and well-prepared teachers with new perspectives on teaching physics.  By extending Pathway to the full curriculum, teachers and their students of all backgrounds will benefit immensely.  Pathway combines Carnegie Mellon University's state-of-the-art digital video library technology, pedagogical advances developed at Kansas State University and materials contributed by master teachers.  This dynamic digital library for helping teachers goes beyond simply creating a collection of teaching and learning materials.  It provides continuously improving assistance and expertise for teachers, all of which is related to the National Science Education Standards and to results of contemporary physics education research.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
