<AbstractNarration>This project aims to address the issue of inadequate software support for High Performance &lt;br/&gt;Computing by improving two widely used standard libraries, LAPACK and ScaLAPCK, both &lt;br/&gt;of which provide numerical linear algebra kernels. &lt;br/&gt;By a combination of algorithmic research, an on-going user and vendor survey (at &lt;br/&gt;icl.cs.utk.edu/lapack-survey.html), and anticipation of the demands and opportunities of new &lt;br/&gt;architectures and modern programming languages, the following key improvements to the &lt;br/&gt;current versions have been identified. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The use of novel, improved algorithms. &lt;br/&gt;Improved ease of use. &lt;br/&gt;Performance Tuning. &lt;br/&gt;Improved reliability and support. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;First, new state-of-the-art algorithms will improve speed, accuracy, and memory efficiency.  &lt;br/&gt;Second, improved user interfaces that exploit features of modern programming languages are &lt;br/&gt;important for better ease of use and also hide some of the underlying complex, possibly &lt;br/&gt;distributed, data structures.  Third, the performance of both libraries crucially depends on a &lt;br/&gt;number of machine-dependent parameters whose setting can benefit from automatic tuning &lt;br/&gt;techniques developed very successfully in the ATLAS project.  Last, there is a huge demand for &lt;br/&gt;ongoing support and maintenance of both LAPACK and ScaLAPACK, and there is a need for &lt;br/&gt;installing a formal mechanism for user feedback, for tracking bugs, for version management, &lt;br/&gt;and facilitated installation.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;LAPACK and ScaLAPACK have been adopted by many vendors as the basis of their own &lt;br/&gt;libraries: SGI/Cray, IBM, HP-Convex, Fujitsu, NEC, NAG and IMSL, and the Mathworks &lt;br/&gt;(producers of Matlab).  For this reason, the proposed changes will have a large impact.  &lt;br/&gt;Furthermore, recent origin of most of the algorithms described in this proposal means that there &lt;br/&gt;are not yet any easily accessible descriptions suitable for education.  As part of the project &lt;br/&gt;documentation, tutorial material will be developed that is suitable for classroom instruction and &lt;br/&gt;wide educational outreach. &lt;br/&gt;The development of LAPACK and ScaLAPACK is part of a long and successful history of &lt;br/&gt;collaboration between the PIs.  In addition, for the current improvements, numerous outside &lt;br/&gt;collaborators have offered support ranging from software and ideas to help in programming &lt;br/&gt;and development.</AbstractNarration>
