<AbstractNarration>This Track 1 FERMAT GK-12 project unites the efforts of mathematics faculty from a federally designated Hispanic-serving institution with educators from a school district with a large Hispanic/Latino student population to place 12 graduate mathematics students as Fellows in three pairs of high schools and feeder middle schools in the district. FERMAT's focus is the quality of the education provided to mathematics graduate students so they become competent professionals who are skilled in communicating mathematical knowledge. It is also aimed at improving teacher quality in the participating schools. Its design fosters the creation of a learning community in which Fellows, partnered with teachers, secondary mathematics coordinator, exemplary teachers, and CSUN mathematics and secondary education faculty, all collaborate as professional colleagues in the four fundamental features of our project: recruitment, training, interaction, and mentoring. As a result, honors-quality Algebra I and Geometry instruction will be offered to pupils with different learning styles from diverse populations. Other special features of our project are a program for qualifiable minority undergraduates, portfolios of Fellows activities, a graduate seminar, a graduate newsletter to inform and track Fellows, and a website for dissemination. Finally, the outcomes of the project will be continuously and carefully evaluated by an external evaluator to improve the FERMAT model during and following the grant period, fostering institutionalization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The FERMAT project is partnership-driven, builds on previous CSUNLAUSD collaborations and CSUN efforts involving graduate students in educational projects, and uses methods of demonstrated efficacy. Fellows and GK-12 Teachers search for pedagogical methods that address age-related abilities to deal with abstractions, while engaging pupils in challenging problems that connect them to their larger world. Our Fellows assist teachers to build capacity for teaching challenging courses and through applications of mathematics and creative use of computers, Fellows and teachers improve learning in their classrooms. Using a balanced approach between discovery and direct instruction, their pupils progressively advance their logical and abstract thinking to succeed in mathematics. Finally, the FERMAT projectl comprehensively develops Fellows communication and teamwork skills, in addition to sharpening and broadening each Fellow's vision of mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: In addition to enriching the quality of mathematics taught in the participating schools, FERMAT experiences enhances the teaching competency of both Fellows and GK- 12 Teachers, extending the project's benefits to future students. Via the graduate seminar, graduate newsletter, and a website, this project has an impact on faculty and students in mathematics who are not directly involved in FERMAT. By recruiting qualifiable minority students, in particular Hispanic students, and turning them into highly qualified Fellows, the project develops and trains graduate students who share the cultural and ethnic backgrounds of the pupils in the project's schools. These role-model Fellows organize and lead academic enrichment activities for secondary pupils, inspiring them to seek careers in mathematics or related fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is receiving partial support from the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
