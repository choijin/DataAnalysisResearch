<AbstractNarration>This is a collaborative proposal between seismologists and &lt;br/&gt;geodynamicists to address three major questions.  (1) What is the &lt;br/&gt;temperature structure of the Pacific lithosphere and upper mantle? &lt;br/&gt;(2) What are the dynamical causes of some of&lt;br/&gt;the more prominent temperature variations? In particular, are the &lt;br/&gt;dynamics controlled largely by near-surface physical processes (e.g., &lt;br/&gt;thermal boundary layer instabilities or TBI), by processes whose &lt;br/&gt;genesis lies deeper within the earth (hot-spot plumes, large-scale &lt;br/&gt;upwellings), or by interactions  between deep-seated and shallow &lt;br/&gt;processes (e.g., plumes exciting thermal boundary instabilities)? (3) &lt;br/&gt;What complementaryinformation is available in radial and azimuthal &lt;br/&gt;anisotropy? These questions are motivated, in part, by a preliminary &lt;br/&gt;model  of the thermal structure of the Pacific that reveals that the &lt;br/&gt;Pacific lithosphere has experienced a punctuated cooling history, &lt;br/&gt;cooling diffusively for its first 70 Ma and then reheating in the &lt;br/&gt;Central Pacific between ages of 70 and 100 Ma predominantly at depths &lt;br/&gt;between 70 and 150 km. New geodynamical simulations show that TBI &lt;br/&gt;forms naturally as the plate cools and may play an important role in &lt;br/&gt;the observed cooling history of the Pacific plate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The seismological research will continue to develop data sets and &lt;br/&gt;theoretical methods to improve the seismic and  temperature&lt;br/&gt;models of the oceanic upper mantle. The geodynamic research will aim &lt;br/&gt;to understanding the dynamic interplay between the oceanic &lt;br/&gt;lithosphere and upper mantle. Particular emphasis will be placed on &lt;br/&gt;how the two-stage cooling inferred for the Pacific lithosphere may &lt;br/&gt;occur, what controls it, and why it may not occur beneath other &lt;br/&gt;oceans. Particular interest is in how TBI initiate and evolve, how &lt;br/&gt;plumes erode and reheat the lithosphere and on what controls the &lt;br/&gt;efficiency of this process, and the interrelation between TBI and &lt;br/&gt;thermal plumes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A graduate student and undergraduate researchers will work at the &lt;br/&gt;interface between geodynamical and seismological modeling. In &lt;br/&gt;addition, the research will provide a synoptic view of the oceanic &lt;br/&gt;upper mantle that will be valuable for a number of new and on-going &lt;br/&gt;initiatives such as Margins, Ridge2000, and Ocean Mantle Dynamics &lt;br/&gt;(OMD).&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
