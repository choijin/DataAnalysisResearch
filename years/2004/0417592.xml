<AbstractNarration>Rachel Slocum&lt;br/&gt;Independent researcher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Developments in theory and social activism have opened questions of power in society.  An examination of how racialization, class structure and gender relations interact can reveal the unevenness of power throughout society. While many studies render visible oppressive circumstances, fewer catalog the difficult politics of alliance across race, class and gender differences.  Such alliance and the challenges it entails might be expected among progressive social movements.  The research uses the insights of feminist and anti-racist theory to examine the community food security movement that is gathering momentum in parts of US society.  This movement critiques modern food production, processing and distribution and proposes an alternative: a community food system.  A community food system supports smaller scale farmers and promotes accessible, affordable, nutritious and culturally appropriate food for all.  Those who are food insecure are those with fewer economic advantages and tend to be disproportionately people of color and women.  The movement combines ideals of social justice and community, but is unclear how these ideals are put into practice. The research will determine if and how groups that comprise the movement engage in an analysis of the power dynamics of race, class and gender to inform their practice and seek to ally across these differences.  The research uses qualitative methods (interviews, text analysis and focus groups) as well as quantitative approaches (statistical analysis of a nation-wide survey) to gain insight into this question.  It anticipates establishing the types of organizations that address racism, gender inequality and class structure, the specific approaches used and the learning involved in the process.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The past decade has witnessed increasing concern in the US about the source, nature and availability of food.  The prevalence of hunger and/or obesity among communities of color, low income youth, adults and the elderly, as well as female single heads of households is an issue of social justice.  A community food security movement has formed to address these issues.  The study will determine whether this movement, in its work to promote affordable, accessible and nutritious food for all, actively confronts racism, gender dynamics and class, which play a role in food insecurity and continue to be significant forces in US society.  The research seeks to understand whether alliances around food and justice that cross race, gender and class lines have been formed and how they are being sustained.  The study will provide important knowledge, more generally, on how social divisions in society are successfully overcome.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
