    <AbstractNarration>The 13th International Congress on Catalysis will be held in Paris, France on July 11-16, 2004. This is the most prominent international scientific meeting in catalysis, which is held every four years and which involves more than 1200 attendees from over 25 countries. The attendance at these meetings has had significant increases due to a renewed worldwide interest in the synthesis of alternative fuels, specialty chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and other value-added products. US participation at this meeting is central to our presence in this crucial area of research that impacts a significant fraction of the American economy. Further, catalysis remains central to the solution of many environmental problems. The Paris meeting will focus on catalyst preparation and characterization, catalytic reaction mechanisms, catalytic reaction engineering (multiscale approach), fuels and energy for the future, synthesis of chemicals and polymers (towards cleaner processes and atom economy), and pollution prevention and remediation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proceedings of all International Congresses on Catalysis are published and constitute a significant contribution the scientific literature on catalysis. The purpose of this grant is to help defray costs for US faculty participation in the meeting, especially for persons presenting papers and/or chairing sessions; priority will be given to requests from younger faculty, minority faculty, and faculty from underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>
