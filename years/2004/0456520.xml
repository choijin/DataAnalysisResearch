    <AbstractNarration>This grant supports a broad range of research in subatomic theory. &lt;br/&gt;Work in four particular directions will receive NSF support, two each &lt;br/&gt;by the PI and co-PI. However, these two researchers have interests in &lt;br/&gt;each other's work, so collaboration between the two is possible in any &lt;br/&gt;of these topics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lebed and a collaborator will analyze the excited states of baryons &lt;br/&gt;(such as protons and neutrons) using a new formalism that has been &lt;br/&gt;developed for studying these short-lived states. He will also work to &lt;br/&gt;uncover the nature of patterns among the measured parameters from the &lt;br/&gt;masses and mixing of neutrinos, particles that emerge from both nuclear &lt;br/&gt;reactors and the sun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Belitsky will continue developing an approach to discern the most &lt;br/&gt;detailed possible information about the interior structure of protons, &lt;br/&gt;neutrons, and other strongly-interacting particles. He will also &lt;br/&gt;pursue his studies of a hidden symmetry that helps to shed light on the &lt;br/&gt;fundamental nature of quantum field theories with strong interactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant will provide not only support to the PI and co-PI, but a &lt;br/&gt;postdoctoral research associate as well. Such a group of critical mass &lt;br/&gt;should be much more effective not only in producing published results, &lt;br/&gt;but also for disseminating our research findings as broadly as &lt;br/&gt;possible.</AbstractNarration>
