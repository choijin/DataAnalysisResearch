<AbstractNarration>Abstract: 0405899, J. Rauch, University of Michigan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Applied Hyperbolic Partial Differential Equations &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator will investigate mathematical problems&lt;br/&gt;involving hyperbolic partial differential equations.  These equations&lt;br/&gt;appear in the description of waves which propagate with finite speed,&lt;br/&gt;for example acoustics, electromagnetism, fluid and aero dynamics,&lt;br/&gt;plasmas, lasers, telegraphy, radio, television, cell phones, shock&lt;br/&gt;waves, music, power lines, .... etc.  Typical mathematical problems&lt;br/&gt;involve showing that specific problems, motivated by applications,&lt;br/&gt;have solutions and studying their qualitative properties, for example&lt;br/&gt;stability and methods for effective computation.  A first set of&lt;br/&gt;problems in the proposal concerns the damping of acoustic waves by&lt;br/&gt;enclosing the acoustic cavity in a diffusive medium.  Two situations&lt;br/&gt;easy to understand are the protection of pilots and passengers in&lt;br/&gt;airplanes from the noise of the engines and the absorption of sound in&lt;br/&gt;a submarine so that it will not escape to the sea.  There are also&lt;br/&gt;applications to the automatic control of mechanical systems immersed&lt;br/&gt;in fluids.  A second problem concerns the scattering of solutions of a&lt;br/&gt;strongly nonlinearly damped wave equation.  A third problem is to show&lt;br/&gt;that the phenomenon of continuum generation in focused laser pulses is&lt;br/&gt;a consequence of nonlinear electromagnetic models without ionization.&lt;br/&gt;Self focused laser beams exhibit continuum generation.  The band of&lt;br/&gt;frequencies present in the focused beam is much broader and spans a&lt;br/&gt;continuum of frequencies (in contrast to a discrete set) than before&lt;br/&gt;the focusing.  Current explanations are frankly not very convincing.&lt;br/&gt;This is a fundamental problem long recognized in the laser physics&lt;br/&gt;community.  It is a place where mathematics may add important&lt;br/&gt;insights.  Focused beams are used in many situations including a&lt;br/&gt;surprising application to reduce resistance in hypersonic aircraft.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposer will study the behavior of solutions of the differential&lt;br/&gt;equations that govern the propagation of waves.  One problem&lt;br/&gt;investigated is how well sound can be excluded from a region by&lt;br/&gt;enclosing the region is an absorbing layer.  Here the absorption in&lt;br/&gt;the layer is supposed to be of a diffusive nature, like one would have&lt;br/&gt;for a gel.  Applications include sonic insulation of airplane&lt;br/&gt;fuselages and submarines and the control of immersed mechanical&lt;br/&gt;systems.  A second problem to be studied is that of white light&lt;br/&gt;generation in focused lasers.  When high power lasers focus, their&lt;br/&gt;color changes from the color of the carrier frequency to nearly white&lt;br/&gt;light.  There are a variety of explanations of this, none very&lt;br/&gt;convincing. The PI will try to find a better one.  There is convincing&lt;br/&gt;experimental evidence that the phenomenon does not require ionization&lt;br/&gt;of the propagation medium and this will help to keep the equations&lt;br/&gt;under study manageable and well founded.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
