<AbstractNarration>0413961&lt;br/&gt;Verweij&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description:  This award is to support a cooperative research project between Dr. Hendrik Verweij, Department of Materials Sciences and Engineering, Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio and Dr. Emad El-Meliegy, Department of Ceramics, National Research Center, Cairo, Egypt.  They aim to synthesize nanocrystalline gas sensing oxide, particularly doped titanium oxides via sol-gel route. The morphology and microstructure of oxides will be controlled to suit their use as a sensor for internal combustion engine exhaust gases. The sensing oxides will be used to determine the air/fuel ratio or the oxygen/unburned or partially burned hydrocarbon ratio in the exhaust emissions in order to improve the automobile efficiency. The synthesized nanocrystalline sensing oxides are expected to be on the order of 1-100 nm. They are expected to be of high purity and agglomerate free with narrow to uniform particle size distribution and can be sintered to ideal compact with uniform three-dimensional structure.  The investigators plan to address problems in traditional sensors that occur as a result of the severe conditions in the internal combustion engine exhaust gases, such as chemical stability, mechanical shock, and cracking. Also, the problems that arise during the synthesis of nanocrystalline sensing oxides, such as high costs, low yield, lack of morphology control (grain size, shape and size distribution), purity of nanopowders, powder agglomeration and environmental safety, will be addressed to optimize synthesis conditions.  Essential sensor performance parameters such as stability, sensitivity, and selectivity are expected to be greatly improved by the use of the nanocrystalline sensing oxides with novel characteristics in sensors construction. This research will address the need for synthesis of nanocrystalline sensing oxides and the need for further detailed analysis of the morphology, microstructure and chemistry of these oxides.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scope and broad impact: The project is expected to lead to sensing devices that will help the automobile industry cut air pollution emissions from automobiles.   It is expected that more stable and less expensive sensors for air and other gases will be developed which can be used for similar applications.  This project is being supported under the US-Egypt Joint Fund Program, which provides grants to scientists and engineers in both countries to carry out these cooperative activities.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
