<AbstractNarration>Workshop on Simulation-Based Engineering Science&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Chairs: Ted Belytschko (Northwestern), Jacob Fish (Rensselaer), Tom Hughes (U Texas), Tinsley Oden (U Texas)&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Advances in computational engineering science offer hope for resolving a variety of fundamental problems that affect every branch of engineering and science, the health and security and the quality of life of all Americans. These new advances are encompassed in the emerging field of Simulation-Based Engineering Science, wherein modern computational methods and devices and collateral technologies can be combined to resolve fundamental issues far outside the reach of traditional scientific and engineering methods. By integrating the fields of engineering science, computational and applied mathematics, computer science, various imaging and sensor  technologies, visualization, and distributed and grid computing, a new level of capabilities can be reached that will benefit society in many ways, such as improved products at reduced cost, improved  health and environment, and enhancements in security and safety.  Efficient mechanisms for managing and funding the research needed to advance the discipline of Simulation-Based Engineering Science (SBES) may not exist within NSF or other agencies, due to the interdisciplinary character of the subject and due to the absence of programs specifically aimed at simulation science and engineering. The primary objective of this workshop is to explore this issue, to provide a more detailed definition of the field and its place in contemporary engineering.  The broader impact resulting from the proposed activity is to determine how the research in the Simulation-Based Engineering Science can be accelerated and brought to bear on pressing problems of broad national interest. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
