<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of North Carolina Chapel Hill (UNC-CH) invites rising college juniors and seniors to apply for admission to the REU program in cell and molecular biology. Students will join a larger community under the Summer Undergraduate Research Experience (SURE). The REU program offers students considering careers in research and science education a mentored research experience focusing on basic mechanisms of cell function. Students will use cutting-edge genetic, molecular, cellular and biochemical approaches in many model organisms to tackle complex biological problems in the post-genome era. During the 10-week program, students will become active members of their host lab and will work with their mentors to develop an independent research project. REU students will gain an appreciation of the scientific process and will learn how to collaborate and work as part of a larger research team. Students will also learn a variety of new technologies through their lab experience and through group activities designed to expose them to a broad range of research questions, model systems and approaches. Students will learn from journal clubs and seminars designed to further their understanding of the scientific process and will interact with graduate students and postdoctoral fellows at UNC-Chapel Hill. At the end of the summer, REU students will present their research at a special scientific symposium.
