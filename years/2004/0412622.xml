<AbstractNarration>Proposal Number: 0412622&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title: Special Year in Number Theory and Combinatorics&lt;br/&gt;Received on 12/17/03&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: F. Garvan&lt;br/&gt;CO-PI(s): Miklos Bona&lt;br/&gt;Neil White&lt;br/&gt;Richard Crew&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Florida&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT             &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The 2004-2005 Special Year at the Department of Mathematics, University&lt;br/&gt;of Florida is in Number Theory and Combinatorics and features two&lt;br/&gt;parallel programs.  The Number Theory part of Special Year 2004-05 &lt;br/&gt;will be highlighted by two conferences: (i) An International Conference &lt;br/&gt;on Additive Number Theory in November 2004, and (ii) An International &lt;br/&gt;Conference on Arithmetic Geometry in February 2005. The highlight of &lt;br/&gt;the Combinatorics part of the Special Year Program will be (iii) A &lt;br/&gt;Workshop on Automated Deduction in Geometry in September 2004, and &lt;br/&gt;(iv) The Third International Conference on Pattern Avoiding&lt;br/&gt;Permutations in March 2005. There are plans to publish the refereed&lt;br/&gt;proceedings of these conferences. Topics for these conferences have &lt;br/&gt;been chosen from areas of our research strengths but involve broader &lt;br/&gt;themes. The conferences will be augmented by lectures throughout &lt;br/&gt;the year on the latest trends in research by eminent visiting &lt;br/&gt;mathematicians, as well as History Lectures which should appeal &lt;br/&gt;to students.  The Additive Number Theory Conference will involve&lt;br/&gt;three main themes:   partitions and q-series; Goldbach, Waring type problems, &lt;br/&gt;and sieves; and basis and density questions. The Arithmetic Geometry &lt;br/&gt;Conference will be devoted to p-adic methods in arithmetic and algebraic &lt;br/&gt;geometry.  Automated Deduction in Geometry Workshop will be a forum to &lt;br/&gt;exchange ideas and views, to present research results and progress, &lt;br/&gt;and to demonstrate software tools on the intersection between geometry &lt;br/&gt;and automated deduction.  The Conference on Pattern Avoiding Permutations &lt;br/&gt;is on the exact and asymptotic enumeration and structural analysis, &lt;br/&gt;of permutations with subsequence conditions. This area is connected &lt;br/&gt;to the theory of Young tableaux, labeled trees, partially ordered sets, &lt;br/&gt;and planar maps, as well as sorting and searching.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The Special Year Program in Number Theory and Combinatorics  &lt;br/&gt;will be of interest even to researchers outside of mathematics and &lt;br/&gt;therefore will strengthen ties with other disciplines. Number Theory is &lt;br/&gt;the study of the properties of whole numbers and is the oldest branch &lt;br/&gt;of mathematics.  Topics such as partitions, elliptic curves, and &lt;br/&gt;cryptography, covered by our conferences in number theory will be &lt;br/&gt;of interest to physicists and those in computer science.  Combinatorics is &lt;br/&gt;the study of discrete collections of objects, and how they can be arranged&lt;br/&gt;and counted efficiently.  The areas covered by the conferences in &lt;br/&gt;combinatorics will be of appeal to computer and engineering sciences. &lt;br/&gt;Number Theory and Combinatorics are ideally suited to attract the attention of &lt;br/&gt;non-experts and students to significant developments in mathematics. &lt;br/&gt;Thus the History Lectures in these areas will inform graduate and &lt;br/&gt;undergraduate students as to how fundamental ideas and concepts &lt;br/&gt;developed, and this in turn will help in attracting talented &lt;br/&gt;students to take to more advanced study in mathematics.     &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
