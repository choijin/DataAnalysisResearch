<AbstractNarration>Everyone worries to some degree.  Someone with financial problems may worry about paying the rent, keeping a roof over their head.  Worry is closely linked to fear and anxiety as it anticipates potentially negative events.  Although everyone worries, not everyone worries to the same degree.  Worrying too much causes irritability and fatigue, interferes with concentration, and impairs performance of normal daily tasks.  Worry can also affect memory.  A sad person is more likely to remember previously sad events, thus negative feelings can be self-amplifying.  &lt;br/&gt;Dr. David Tucker and Matt Brown, M.A. will explore such phenomena with support from the National Science Foundation.  The project will focus on identifying how worry and mood affect memory for related and unrelated experiences.  Broader impacts include results that may enhance treatments for anxiety and mood disorders and early identification of individuals at high risk for developing anxiety or mood disorders, aiding in the development of potential prevention or early intervention strategies.  This project will take place in the context of Mr. Brown's dissertation studies and will provide educational opportunities for students who participate in conducting research&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
