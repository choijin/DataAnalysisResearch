<AbstractNarration>This proposal is to explore a connection between the type-A affine &lt;br/&gt;Weyl group and symmetric functions called k-Schur functions.  The &lt;br/&gt;k-Schur functions arose in a study of the Macdonald polynomial basis, &lt;br/&gt;a basis for the symmetric function space that plays an important role &lt;br/&gt;in geometry, representation theory, and physics.  As the k-Schur &lt;br/&gt;functions were investigated more deeply, it came to light that these &lt;br/&gt;functions may not only offer an approach to difficult problems in the &lt;br/&gt;theory of Macdonald polynomials, but also provide a fundamental &lt;br/&gt;basis for a subspace of the symmetric space.  A wealth of beautiful &lt;br/&gt;combinatorial conjectures that extend and refine classical ideas in &lt;br/&gt;symmetric function theory came out of the study of k-Schur functions.&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is to work on these conjectures and to further investigate&lt;br/&gt;the k-Schur functions.  For example, recent work with the k-Schur&lt;br/&gt;functions suggests a connection between the Macdonald polynomials and&lt;br/&gt;the affine symmetric group.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combinatorics is a vast area of mathematics loosely described as &lt;br/&gt;the study of counting collections of objects that satisfy specified &lt;br/&gt;criteria.  As such, combinatorics plays an integral role in &lt;br/&gt;the development of many fields, and combinatorial methods are employed &lt;br/&gt;by scientists ranging from biologists to theoretical physicists.&lt;br/&gt;The PI seeks to understand a natural refinement for the beautiful &lt;br/&gt;combinatorics that arises in the theory of symmetric functions - &lt;br/&gt;a classical part of mathematics with a wide variety of applications in &lt;br/&gt;fields including physics, engineering, and computer science.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
