<AbstractNarration>Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;Rotating machines based on fluid-film journal bearings are susceptible to &lt;br/&gt;flow-induced instability, which are caused by the mechanical-fluid flow &lt;br/&gt;dynamic interaction in the rotor-bearing system. Although flow-induced &lt;br/&gt;instability was discovered 80 years ago, it still remains an unsolved &lt;br/&gt;problem. This is indicative that the two most fundamental questions remain &lt;br/&gt;without definite answers: Can operating conditions that cause flow-induced &lt;br/&gt;instability be accurately predicted? How can flow-induced instability be &lt;br/&gt;mitigated? The essential difficulty of the problem is flow-induced &lt;br/&gt;instability is a highly nonlinear, coupled phenomenon. The PI believes &lt;br/&gt;systems &amp; control researchers can bring a fresh perspective to the problem &lt;br/&gt;through a systems theory-based approach. To that end, the research &lt;br/&gt;objectives of this project are: i) develop models that predict the nonlinear &lt;br/&gt;mechanical-fluid flow dynamic interactions, ii) exploit stability analysis &lt;br/&gt;tools for nonlinear systems to better characterize flow-induced instability, &lt;br/&gt;iii) conceive an innovative sensor/actuator paradigm for controlling the &lt;br/&gt;instability, and iv) synthesize nonlinear feedback controllers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LSU, like many schools, has systems &amp; control faculty and students &lt;br/&gt;throughout several engineering departments. However, LSU is unique in that &lt;br/&gt;its Math Department is one of the few in the nation whose main focus area is &lt;br/&gt;mathematical control theory. To take advantage of this strength, LSU is in &lt;br/&gt;the process of creating a Systems &amp; Control Group that will comprise four &lt;br/&gt;Engineering departments and the Math Department. The educational plan of &lt;br/&gt;this project will be a key component in this effort. The plan will include &lt;br/&gt;four activities aimed at engaging a diverse community of students, promoting &lt;br/&gt;cross-disciplinary interactions, and increasing the ethnic/racial diversity &lt;br/&gt;of students attracted to the field: i) development of a much-needed control &lt;br/&gt;laboratory course, ii) development of a systems &amp; control "tune-up" workshop &lt;br/&gt;for graduate students, iii) involvement and mentoring of minority students &lt;br/&gt;through collaborations with a local HBCU, and iv) development of a systems &amp; &lt;br/&gt;control summer camp for middle and high school students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will attract the interest of researchers in the areas of fluid &lt;br/&gt;mechanics, tribology, and systems &amp; control alike. The proposed activities &lt;br/&gt;will advance the state-of-knowledge within and across these fields by &lt;br/&gt;introducing innovative bearing concepts and new control design tools for &lt;br/&gt;uncertain nonlinear systems and infinite-dimensional systems. The broader &lt;br/&gt;impacts include opportunities for minority students; outreach towards &lt;br/&gt;secondary education; broadening the accessibility of systems &amp; control to &lt;br/&gt;students across campus and across the state; and dissemination and &lt;br/&gt;technology transfer via the activities and industrial partnerships of the &lt;br/&gt;Center for Rotating Machinery under establishment at LSU.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
