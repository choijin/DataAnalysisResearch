<AbstractNarration>The objective of this project is to develop advanced numerical methods&lt;br/&gt;for modeling flow and transport processes in coupled surface&lt;br/&gt;water/ground water systems.  As the relevant processes, and spatial&lt;br/&gt;and temporal scales, can strongly differ in the various subdomains of&lt;br/&gt;a coupled hydrosystem, different modeling concepts must be chosen for&lt;br/&gt;these subdomains. The PIs will investigate appropriate mechanisms for&lt;br/&gt;coupling mass, momentum and species transport in ground water and surface&lt;br/&gt;water regions.  This will include mathematical formulation and&lt;br/&gt;algorithmic and software tool development between different domains&lt;br/&gt;and models.  Efficient discretization techniques, based on finite&lt;br/&gt;element technology developed by the PIs and adapted to the dominant&lt;br/&gt;processes in each region, will be developed.  The stability of&lt;br/&gt;these methods will be analyzed, and a priori and a posteriori error&lt;br/&gt;estimates will be derived.  Time-stepping strategies for accurately&lt;br/&gt;handling the different temporal scales within these flow and transport&lt;br/&gt;domains will be studied, and fast and robust solution methods for the&lt;br/&gt;resulting linear and nonlinear systems of equations will be developed.&lt;br/&gt;Representative benchmark problems based on laboratory and field&lt;br/&gt;experiments will be formulated and will be used to validate the&lt;br/&gt;numerical methods.  The resulting methodology will be implemented&lt;br/&gt;within a parallel computing framework for distributed and grid&lt;br/&gt;computing platforms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sustainable management and protection of water resources is one of the&lt;br/&gt;key problems of the 21st century.  Comprehensive, long-range water&lt;br/&gt;resource management requires a careful study of the interaction of&lt;br/&gt;ground water and surface water.  Historically, ground water aquifers&lt;br/&gt;and surface water bodies, such as streams, lakes and wetlands, have&lt;br/&gt;been studied in isolation, without properly accounting for the&lt;br/&gt;interactions between them.  Recent data, however, collected in the&lt;br/&gt;United States and abroad, give startling evidence of the effect&lt;br/&gt;surface water and ground water systems have on each other.  These&lt;br/&gt;studies indicate, for example, that water contamination can easily be&lt;br/&gt;transmitted from ground to surface water and vice versa.  In many&lt;br/&gt;cases, the precise location of initial contamination is irrelevant,&lt;br/&gt;because the close proximity of ground and surface water can result in&lt;br/&gt;both being contaminated.  Advanced computer simulators are needed to&lt;br/&gt;study and predict the movement of potentially harmful chemical species&lt;br/&gt;within these complex environments.  In this project, the PIs will&lt;br/&gt;develop mathematical models and state-of-the-art computational&lt;br/&gt;algorithms and technologies for simulating large-scale ground and&lt;br/&gt;surface water systems.  The project will involve the collaboration of&lt;br/&gt;the PIs with researchers at government laboratories and state&lt;br/&gt;agencies, and will include the training of graduate and undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;students.  The technology to be developed has potential application to&lt;br/&gt;other areas, including thermal and chemical processing, biomedicine,&lt;br/&gt;and sequestration of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
