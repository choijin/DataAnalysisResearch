<AbstractNarration>A grant has been awarded to Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory (RMBL), under the direction of Dr. Ian Billick, to renovate researcher and student housing at the RMBL.  The RMBL is a biological field station that was established in 1928 to promote research and education in the biological sciences.  Scientists and students from numerous institutions throughout the United States visit the RMBL to conduct research and take classes.  Many of the cabins used to house the scientists and students were constructed 75-120 years ago.  This grant will allow the RMBL to provide safe, clean living facilities for the students and scientists who live onsite.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant will pay for the renovation of three cabins. These structures, built in 1880 and 1914, house up to 19 students and research assistants.  As part of this project the internal electric system wil be redone and an upgrade will be made to the external system powering the buildings.  An environmentally friendly photo-voltaic system that will generate energy sufficient to power the buildings will also be installed.  This work will not only improve the quality of housing, but will also reduce the safety risk to the inhabitants of the buildings.  Because of the remote location, almost all scientists and students must live onsite.  Consequently this grant will allow the RMBL to continue to offer research and educational opportunities to numerous scientists and students.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
