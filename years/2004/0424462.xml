<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;Low-Cost Distributed Solar-Thermal-Electric Power Generation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We discuss the technical and economic feasibility of a low-cost distributed solar-thermal-electric&lt;br/&gt;power generation technology based on the use of a solar thermal collector (STC)in conjunction with&lt;br/&gt;a free-piston Stirling engine.The solar thermal collector is to be comprised of low-concentration&lt;br/&gt;nonimaging concentrators and absorbers with spectrally selective coatings.The Stirling engine&lt;br/&gt;converts moderate temperature heat to electricity by way of integrated electric generation.In spite&lt;br/&gt;of its relatively low conversion e .ciency,the proposed system can be a cost-e .ective alternative to&lt;br/&gt;solar photovoltaic (PV)modules,as discussed in the project description.&lt;br/&gt;The system is conceived to operate with collector temperatures in the range of 125 .C to 150 .C,&lt;br/&gt;which is consistent with the use of stationary solar thermal collectors employing low-concentration&lt;br/&gt;nonimaging re .ectors.Thus,the system avoids the costs and maintenance issues associated with&lt;br/&gt;tracking collectors based on high concentration ratio concentrators.&lt;br/&gt;We take the view that cost e .ectiveness of solar electric technologies should be judged by&lt;br/&gt;output power per dollar rather than by e .ciency or other technical merits.This view re .ects the&lt;br/&gt;observation that there are vast untapped siting opportunities in both urban and rural regions of&lt;br/&gt;the world.Research into photovoltaics has been focused on improving e .ciency because there&lt;br/&gt;has been no signi .cant decrease in the inherent cost of silicon wafer area.However,the proposed&lt;br/&gt;solar-thermal-electric system is designed for fabrication out of low-cost materials.A collector is&lt;br/&gt;built of glass,aluminum,copper,and insulation,while engines and generators are primarily steel,&lt;br/&gt;aluminum,copper,and plastics.In high-volume manufacturing,the cost of the proposed system&lt;br/&gt;will be determined by the weight of its bulk materials.This study of solar-thermal-electric systems&lt;br/&gt;involves searching for a more cost-e .ective balance between system e .ciency and materials cost.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts Energy independence and diversi .cation through the use of renewable dis-&lt;br/&gt;tributed sources is essential for the future of our society.In the project description,we make a case&lt;br/&gt;that the proposed technology will cost on the order of $1 per Watt of peak output power.As such,&lt;br/&gt;this technology would represent at least a .ve-fold improvement over photovoltaic technology in&lt;br/&gt;terms of cost.A simple estimate of energy cost using the proposed technology based on an average&lt;br/&gt;of only four hours per day of operation over a modest ten year lifetime indicates a cost of about&lt;br/&gt;$0.066/kW-hr.Although not equal to the lowest costs for electricity,this is certainly an energy&lt;br/&gt;cost that makes the technology very valuable when considering the additional advantages of its&lt;br/&gt;nature.Namely,this is a distributed renewable energy source with an availability that is fairly well&lt;br/&gt;matched to peak demand times.Further,this technology is well suited to distributed deployment&lt;br/&gt;in an analogous manner to that of photovoltaic generation.As such,it will be valuable for remote&lt;br/&gt;sites where utility infrastructure is non-existent or too costly as well as for residential and business&lt;br/&gt;sites as an alternative to photovoltaics.&lt;br/&gt;The PI has been active in integrating research into new and existing classes,and plans to con-&lt;br/&gt;tinue this in conjunction with the proposed work.The PI also actively seeks to include underrep-&lt;br/&gt;resented student groups in his projects.UC Berkeley hosts the SUPERB (Summer Undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;Program in Engineering Research at Berkeley,http://www.coe.berkeley.edu/cues/superb/index.html)&lt;br/&gt;program which targets underrepresented and minority students.The PI plans to actively recruit&lt;br/&gt;in the SUPERB program for students to participate in the proposed project during the summer&lt;br/&gt;periods.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit A direct strategy for enabling a renewable energy source by seeking to min-&lt;br/&gt;imize the cost-to-output-power ratio is outlined.We analyze the cost of an integrated system&lt;br/&gt;including a solar thermal collector and a low-temperature Stirling engine.Novel multi-phase free-&lt;br/&gt;piston Stirling machine designs are proposed along with rigorous analysis techniques for their design&lt;br/&gt;and evaluation.Speci .cally,a Stirling machine with no mechanical linkages and only three moving&lt;br/&gt;parts is discussed.This is a design that inherently permits for a long maintenance-free lifetime and&lt;br/&gt;for very low frictional losses.&lt;br/&gt;1</AbstractNarration>
