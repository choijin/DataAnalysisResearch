<AbstractNarration>The project will lead to the acquisition of a X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) instrument, which represents a major advance in commercially available instrumentation. XPS has become a critical technique in the characterization of the chemical composition, oxidation and bonding states in various materials, including polymers, catalysts, metals, and semiconductors. The XPS instrument will provide real time chemical state and elemental imaging capabilities using the full range of pass energies and multi-point analysis from either real time or scanned images without the need for sample translation. The instrumentation further comes with the ability to obtain data over a large field of view, while maintaining photoelectron and Auger peak positions. The initial research foci of the instrument will include fundamental studies of: designer surfaces for biomedical applications; advanced micro-probes for neural prostheses; chemo-mechanical nanopatterning of polymer substrates for cell culture; surface-modified nano-fibrous scaffolds for tissue engineering applications; surface-modified microfabricated chemical analysis devices; controlled anchoring of DNA molecules at chemically tailored surfaces; coaxial semiconductor nanowires; smart surfaces assembled from molecular switches; directed self assembly of nanostructures by focused ion beam patterning; fuel processors for PEM fuel cells; lean NOx traps for automotive emission control; semiconductor alloy surfaces; surfaces and interfaces for electronic devices; and GaInNAs for high efficiency solar cells. The instrument will also have broad impact upon the research and educational infrastructure at U of M. Most faculty involved in the project have Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP) and Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) students in their research groups actively working on characterization of materials. The instrument will be used in summer research projects for minority high school students and young women. For example, a number of students from under-represented groups participating in the NASA Summer High School Apprenticeship Program (SHARP) have worked on projects with instruments at the University of Michigan's Electron Microbeam Analysis Laboratory (EMAL), which will be the home of the new XPS instrument. As soon as the proposed instrument is installed, it will be included in this program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will lead to the acquisition of a X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) instrument with advanced capabilities. XPS has become a critical technique in the surface characterization of various materials, including polymers, catalysts, metals, and semiconductors. The XPS instrument will enable the real time chemical state and elemental imaging of surfaces. In essence, it will allow us to determine and image the chemical composition of the outermost layers of a material. Initially, the instrumentation will support research in the areas of biomaterials, surface science, nanoscience, catalysis, and fuel cells. The instrument will also have broad impact upon the research and educational infrastructure at U of M. The new XPS instrument will be used in the undergraduate and graduate curriculum, as well as in summer research projects for minority high school students and young women. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
