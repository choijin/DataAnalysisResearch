<AbstractNarration>Testosterone and cortisol are some of the most intensively studied biological substances, yet our understanding of their behavioral effects in human beings is surprisingly limited.  In many species, variations in hormone levels are powerful predictors of a wide variety of behaviors, and human beings should be no exception.  The proposed research is designed to test a critically important idea underlying hormones and behavior -- that individuals high in testosterone possess a need or desire to maintain high status.   &lt;br/&gt;The core of this proposal seeks to test the hypothesis that differential testosterone levels, whether chronic or the result of transient changes, bear a functional relationship to status-seeking behavior. The initial experimental proposition put forth in this application is straightforward.  After a competitive interaction, individuals either lose status or gain status.  Then, they are given the option to attempt to regain their lost status or defend their high status. The primary prediction associated with this experiment is that individual differences in testosterone will predict a person's intention to pursue further competition.  Change in cortisol level, a reliable measure of the stress response, is predicted to influence behavioral intention as well, but only among individuals with high levels of testosterone, who presumably possess strong status-seeking motives.  An implicit measure of unconscious status seeking and power, the Picture Story Exercise will also be administered as a means of validating the hormonal measures.  Further confirmation and validation of these measures will be assessed through cognitive activation of status needs using a modification of the Stroop color-naming procedure.&lt;br/&gt;This research also has the potential to move experimental social psychology and the study of biological basis of social behavior forward through the innovative synthesis of these areas.  Furthermore, this work will provide the theoretical foundation for future research that addresses the chronic problem of representation, retention, and achievement of talented individuals from underrepresented groups who may have status concerns.  This enhanced understanding could inform strategies to increase the participation of women and minorities in science, engineering, and math.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
