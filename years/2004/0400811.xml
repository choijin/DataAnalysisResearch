<AbstractNarration>This award provides support for purchase of several instruments used in analysis of plants and microbes. The equipment includes a 16 capillary DNA sequencer,  PCR machines, a liquid robotic handler, and necessary software.  The instrumentation has the increased throughput capacity needed for several ongoing  research  projects of faculty and students at the OSU campus in Wooster, and at nearby Hiram College.  The instruments will be placed in the  Molecular  and  Cellular  Imaging Center  (MCIC),  a  multi-disciplinary  core  facility  on the campus.  Research programs expected to use the instruments include studies of  variation  in tomato  fruit  morphology, studies of the molecular  basis  of  interactions  between  oomycete fungi  and  their  plant  hosts, molecular studies of quantitative variation in plant resistance to disease and abiotic stress, and high throughput genotyping and sequencing of microbial genomes.  In addition to its role in research, the equipment will be integrated into a broad range of ongoing outreach and training activities for which the MCIC  is  currently  a  focal  point.  Graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, faculty and technical staff from more than  28 laboratories in ten different departments use the facility for studies related to their thesis work or research.  In  addition,  undergraduate  students  from  private,  state,  community,  and  minority  colleges  participate  in  summer research programs on the Wooster campus .  These students will have access to training and use of  the  requested  instrumentation.  The  MCIC  hosts  frequent  tours  for  high  school  students and teachers, K-12 students, as well as area residents to provide a greater understanding of plant,  animal  and  microbial  research  and  to  engage  the  broader  community  in  science-related  activities .</AbstractNarration>
