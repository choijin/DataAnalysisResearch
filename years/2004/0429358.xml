<AbstractNarration>Emergency  Medical  Systems  (EMS)  agencies,  as  first  responders  in  medical  emergency scenarios,  are  uniquely  positioned  to  provide  valuable  data  for  surveillance  and  early  warning systems.  In most states, all  patients  who  enter  the  EMS  are  tracked  through  their  pre-hospital care to the emergency room using the Pre-Hospital Care Report. The PCR is used to gather vital patient  information  that  is  used  by  health  care  administrators  as  a  resource  to  identify  trends through macro analysis. Currently, the PCR data exists mostly on paper forms and the process of keying this data into a database that can be processed and mined for information can take up to several years as there is no automated means to extract this data from hospitals and transmit them to  a  central  location  for  collating  and  analysis.  The goal of this research is to  attach  this  deficiency  by using  document  image understanding and handwriting analysis.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt;The research team work toward  solutions to extraction and recognition of handwritten text data from medical forms with loosely constrained layout structure, large medical vocabulary, and abundance of abbreviations and non-standard writing styles. If successful, this work will advance the state-of-the-art in handwriting recognition  limited to applications with small 'pristine' vocabularies of less than a thousand words. The proposed task of machine recognition of PCR data from scanned forms requires recognition with vocabularies of tens of thousands  of  words  which must  also  allow  for  non-standard  abbreviations  and medical jargon. &lt;br/&gt;The  research  challenge in this case will  be  to  use  cues  from  fields  on  the  form  that  can  be  recognized &lt;br/&gt;accurately and efficiently, such as check box data, to constrain the size of the vocabulary of the words in the narrative fields. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact &lt;br/&gt;Despite the publicity surrounding the issue of preparedness to guard against possible bioterrorist attacks, there have not been many short to middle-term practical technological solutions proposed to address the problem. The proposed project will greatly improve the speed of collecting PCR data  to populate  a  national  EMS  database,  thereby  providing  emergency  medical  service providers and health care administrators a wealth of data that can be used in trend analysis for the early  detection  of  outbreak  of  diseases  as  well  as allocation  of  public  resources  for emergency services. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
