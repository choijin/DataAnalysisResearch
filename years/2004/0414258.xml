    <AbstractNarration>Much of the organic carbon in lakes originates from surrounding terrestrial ecosystems.&lt;br/&gt;Degradation of this terrestrial carbon in lakes implies that lake food webs are potentially&lt;br/&gt;supported by external sources, rather than solely by internal primary production. Prior&lt;br/&gt;experiments in small lakes using inorganic carbon-13 additions revealed significant&lt;br/&gt;terrestrial support of aquatic food webs. This project will directly address the relative&lt;br/&gt;importance of terrestrial support of food webs in lakes 4-10 times the size of lakes&lt;br/&gt;studied previously. Carbon-13 will be added to two large lakes and analyzed with&lt;br/&gt;several models developed by the investigators. Results will determine the importance&lt;br/&gt;terrestrial subsidies in these larger lakes that are in the top quartile for size in the&lt;br/&gt;Northern Highlands of Wisconsin and Michigan and representative of a large class of&lt;br/&gt;temperate lakes globally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will contribute to understanding lakes in a landscape context by&lt;br/&gt;assessing whether differences in lake size influence food webs and carbon cycling.&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of this project include promoting public understanding of lake&lt;br/&gt;ecosystems as well as research training for graduate and undergraduate students.&lt;br/&gt;Results will be incorporated into an ongoing outreach effort on the future of the Northern&lt;br/&gt;Highland Lake District.</AbstractNarration>
