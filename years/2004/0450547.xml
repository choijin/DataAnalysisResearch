    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to capitalize on the Phase I success of Novel OptoCeramic Materials for High Efficiency Ceramic Lasers. During Phase I period, tasks were investigated and critical issues related to the proposed approach were addressed. Extensive research has been conducted and a lot of results have been obtained which will be very valuable for a Phase II program. Erbium (Er3+), ytterbium, erbium-ytterbium (Er3+/Yb3+), and neodymium (Nd3+) doped, transparent ceramics were developed in this program, which will have a great impact to ceramic multi-function lasers and the electro-optic technologies. The results show a promising future for developing microchip and high power ceramic lasers using Er3+, Er3+/Yb3+, Nd3+, or other rare earth doped ceramics. These Electro-Optical (EO)-based, rare earth doped ceramics would have unique features in wavelength tunability and phase and mode self-modulation that will lead to revolutionary laser systems of higher efficiency, more compactness, and integrated multi-functions. After successfully executing the Phase I plan and achieving the Phase I objectives, this work is ready to be extended to bring a new generation multifunction laser host materials with state-of-the-art performance to the marketplace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technology developed in this program could greatly benefit many technology sectors, including materials processing, laser and luminescent materials and applications. High efficiency laser materials developed from this project would be very valuable by enabling high power and low cost solid state laser systems which have tremendous strategic and commercial values for both military and civilian applications. These include remote-sensing applications, target recognition and detection, missile guidance illumination, measurements from airborne and space-borne platforms, multiple wavelengths next-generation measurement systems, and industrial laser machining.</AbstractNarration>
