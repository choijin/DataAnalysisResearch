<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;Nanotechnology is set to revolutionize the human condition through fundamental contribution to science&lt;br/&gt;and technology. The ability to control and manipulate matter at atomic scales wields an immense potential -&lt;br/&gt;especially in areas of biology, material science and physics. Its impact is already evident from the remarkable&lt;br/&gt;feats achieved in the last two decades towards the goals of probing and manipulating matter at atomic scales.&lt;br/&gt;The potential of this technology is evident from its proposed use in quantum computing, quantum information,&lt;br/&gt;drug discovery and tailoring material with atomic scale specificity. Micro-cantilever based principles, (Atomic&lt;br/&gt;Force Microscopy for example) form the main methods by which matter is investigated and manipulated at the&lt;br/&gt;nanoscale. Devices based on these principles were the first to demonstrate the feasibility of routine interrogation,&lt;br/&gt;control and manipulation of matter at atomic scales. Even though impressive science has resulted with their use&lt;br/&gt;significant challenges need to be met to tap their full potential. This proposal is geared towards harnessing this&lt;br/&gt;potential thereby enabling the nanotechnology promise to be realized.&lt;br/&gt;Under the proposal's goals the PI will exploit a fundamental idea that complex dynamics often manifest&lt;br/&gt;themselves as an abrupt change in the qualitative behavior of the dynamics that can be employed to provide&lt;br/&gt;unparalleled resolution in detection of changes in the environment. Theoretical and experimental tools to understand&lt;br/&gt;the complex dynamics and the parameters that control and trigger the abrupt change will be developed.&lt;br/&gt;These parameters will be associated with the property being detected.&lt;br/&gt;It is evident that robust broadband nanopositioning is a necessity to realize the goal of interrogating and&lt;br/&gt;manipulating matter at the nanoscale. Present methods predominantly employ ad-hoc methods that result in&lt;br/&gt;large deficits in achievable bandwidth as they fail to address the multi-objective concerns of nonlinear behavior&lt;br/&gt;of piezoelectric actuators, coupling effects, the effects of positioner dynamics on imaging and the uncertain and&lt;br/&gt;diverse environment. The PI will develop a paradigm for robust broadband nanopositioning with emphasis on&lt;br/&gt;nano imaging. This paradigm will be utilized in realizing a new state of the art atomic force microscope.&lt;br/&gt;The microcantilever force sensor provides for a unique specificity with which bio-affinity between various&lt;br/&gt;molecules can be unravelled. Based on this feature there are various combinatorial strategies that utilize microcantilevers&lt;br/&gt;for drug discovery. Several of the associated objectives fall under the rubric of resource allocation&lt;br/&gt;problems. These optimization problems are non-convex and computationally complex. The PI will develop a&lt;br/&gt;unique and attractive theoretical direction for combinatorial resource allocation problems that several groups in&lt;br/&gt;the control community are addressing. The algorithms will be based on the central concepts of the deterministic&lt;br/&gt;annealing method used by the data compression community. There will be an emphasis on obtaining global&lt;br/&gt;optima in the presence of algebraic and dynamic constraints on the resources. Related metrics will be researched&lt;br/&gt;for the drug discovery problem in collaboration with a molecular biologist.&lt;br/&gt;Data in many microcantilever based strategies are stored in predetermined patterns. For example, the nanoarrays&lt;br/&gt;store bio-assays in arrays of cells that are well characterized and in IBM's data storage devices data is&lt;br/&gt;stored in the form of bits arranged in a prespecified pattern. During the retrieval of the data the micro-cantilever&lt;br/&gt;tip geometry convolves with the data and has the potential to significantly lower the spatial resolution. The PI&lt;br/&gt;will develop methods for image restoration using unique methods that he has pioneered that exploit the pattern&lt;br/&gt;in the way the data is stored. Such a problem transcends AFM applications and the PI will focus on developing&lt;br/&gt;a general framework and specialize it to the AFM applications.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This proposal brings together researchers from the traditional areas of engineering, mathematics,&lt;br/&gt;physics and biology. It is at the confluence of dynamic systems and control theory, control applications,&lt;br/&gt;numerical analysis and optimization theory. All of the proposed goals are geared towards nanotechnology -&lt;br/&gt;the successful completion of the proposed project will give a good theoretical understanding of the devices and&lt;br/&gt;translate into huge technological and economic gains. The experimental aspects of the proposed research will&lt;br/&gt;be accomplished in collaboration with Asylum Research, Bioforce Nanosciences Inc. and IBM Research Lab,&lt;br/&gt;Zurich. This provides an opportunity for the labs involved to learn the tools and methods of different areas and&lt;br/&gt;for outreach to the industry. The graduate students involved will be trained in a unique interdisciplinary manner&lt;br/&gt;that exposes them to the diverse set of expertise mentioned. They will be trained both in the theoretical and&lt;br/&gt;experimental aspects as is warranted by the proposal needs.&lt;br/&gt;1</AbstractNarration>
