<AbstractNarration>There  is  increasing  international  concern  about  the  tremendous  disparities  in  the living  conditions  between  developed  and  developing  nations.  Economic  development  is regarded as a necessary condition for closing wealth gaps and subsequently easing attendant social tensions.  In the science and technology policy community, technological innovation is seen  as  an  engine  for  economic  growth  and  therefore  a  contributor  to  closing  economic gaps.  National Innovation Systems theories identify institutional configurations that promote  technological  innovation  in  societies.    The  theories  and  configurations  have evolved largely in the industrialized world context.  As attention turns to the condition of the &lt;br/&gt;developing world, the applicability of the National Innovation Systems framework must be critically assessed. There  is  a  specific  need  for  further  examination  of  the  social  aspects  of  National Innovation Theory.  Economic development strategists, social scientists and historians, from across  the  spectrum  of  wealth,  emphasize  the  role  of  science  and  technology  as  being instrumental in closing the gap between nations.  Scientific and technological innovation are seen  as  essential  engines  in  mobilizing  the  ability  of  societies  to  make  better  use  of  their natural  resources.    The  role  and  potential  benefit  of  science  and  technology,  however, cannot be considered without social sensitivity; for the craft of science and the evolution of technology are at their root social artifacts.  As a result, the hope for science and technology to  be  instrumental  in  closing  the  wealth  gap  between  nations  must  be  anchored  to  social realities.  This Research on Science and Technology Dissertation Improvement Grant is  a component of the  effort to promote scientific and technological innovation as an effective tool in economic development.   This  research  attempts  to  examine  the  applicability  of  the  National  Innovation Systems  framework  in  the  developing  country  context  by  introducing  the  concept  of innovation as a tool for liberation.  Particularly in developing nations that have endured both slavery  and  colonization, innovation  is  more  than  a  tool  for  economic  development.    It  is also a tool for liberation. The  project  will  explore  the  experiences  of  the  sugar  industry  in  Barbados  and Guyana as case studies.  Innovation will be treated as a concept with dual functions: 1) as a tool for economic development and 2) as a tool for liberation.  An analysis that considers &lt;br/&gt;innovation in the sugar industry in these two dimensions allows for the influence of the specific  histories  of  countries  whose  pasts  include  being  enslaved  and  colonized.  Examination of the sugar industry is justified both by the impending decisions of the World trade Organization with regards to preferential trading in sugar as well as the five hundred year history of sugar in the Caribbean.   Caribbean  critical  literature  has  surfaced  the  cultural  meaning  of  innovation  as liberation.  Innovation theory has prescribed institutional structures and  relationships that foster innovation.  This research will focus on the fusion of those two bodies of thought in an attempt to apply innovation theory more effectively in the developing world.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
