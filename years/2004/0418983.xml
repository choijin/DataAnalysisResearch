<AbstractNarration>Earth's climate during the late Paleozoic (ca. 300 Ma) was profoundly affected by both large-scale&lt;br/&gt;continental glaciation and monsoonal circulation. Accordingly, key elements of its climate exhibit&lt;br/&gt;parallels to Earth's modern climate, which has intrigued both those who model climate, and those who&lt;br/&gt;reconstruct climate using proxy data. Validation and further sophistication of climate models of this&lt;br/&gt;interval are hampered, however, by low-resolution geologic datasets. That is, although the broad strokes&lt;br/&gt;of Pangea's climate system are well established, many aspects remain unconstrained.&lt;br/&gt;Preliminary geochronologic and sedimentologic data collected by the PIs from a lower Permian&lt;br/&gt;loessite-paleosol couplet in the study region document a profound shift in equatorial wind direction and&lt;br/&gt;strength; the PIs hypothesize that this shift signals a geologically abrupt change in the intensity of&lt;br/&gt;monsoonal circulation of western Pangea between glacials, and interglacials. The objective of the&lt;br/&gt;proposed study, therefore, is to examine and characterize in detail the character, variability, and&lt;br/&gt;chronology of such high-frequency shifts in atmospheric circulation in western equatorial Pangea, just&lt;br/&gt;before and after onset of monsoonal conditions. To achieve this, the PIs and students will study loessite&lt;br/&gt;(eolian silt) and intercalated paleosols that record alternating glacial-interglacial states. The PIs have&lt;br/&gt;targeted for study loessite-paleosol couplets that represent wide geographic coverage in western&lt;br/&gt;equatorial Pangea (western U.S.), and that date from (1) middle-late Pennsylvanian (zonal), and (2) early&lt;br/&gt;Permian (monsoonal) times. Each study couplet will be subjected to several previously-tested techniques&lt;br/&gt;including detrital-zircon based provenance analysis, magnetic susceptibility, whole-rock geochemistry,&lt;br/&gt;and grain-size analysis as proxies for various climatic parameters including wind direction, strength, and&lt;br/&gt;seasonality, and relative aridity. High-precision, radio-isotopic (U-Pb) dating of the youngest (volcanic)&lt;br/&gt;detrital zircons and some experimental dating of pedogenic carbonate will be used to improve absolute&lt;br/&gt;age constraints on the target couplets, and constrain durations of these glacial-interglacial shifts.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit of Proposed Activity-- Project results will enable examination of late Paleozoic&lt;br/&gt;icehouse variations in atmospheric circulation at an unprecedented detail, and in particular, high-resolution&lt;br/&gt;(glacial-interglacial) shifts in equatorial circulation during both zonal and monsoonal states of&lt;br/&gt;the Pangean interval. Results will also provide improved age constraints on target strata, and durations of&lt;br/&gt;climatic fluctuations, and will enable further testing of the paleosol-carbonate dating technique.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts Resulting from Proposed Activity "Project results will provide better constraints for&lt;br/&gt;climate models of the late Paleozoic and for natural variation in climatic conditions of interglacials over&lt;br/&gt;geologically long periods of time. Accordingly, results should further our understanding of Earth's&lt;br/&gt;climate system in general, ultimately contributing to improved climate predictions in our modern&lt;br/&gt;interglacial world. The PIs will fund and train at least two graduate students directly from this proposed&lt;br/&gt;research, and have a strong commitment to, and history of, involving undergraduate geoscience majors in&lt;br/&gt;their research, which they will continue in the proposed project. OU's formal agreement with Fort Valley&lt;br/&gt;State University (a Historically Black University), in which upperclassmen complete their geology&lt;br/&gt;degrees at OU, offers an excellent opportunity to involve minority students in this undergraduate research.&lt;br/&gt;MJS has also used NSF funds to support science-education majors in undergraduate research projects, and&lt;br/&gt;will actively recruit at least one such student to work on aspects of the proposed project. The project&lt;br/&gt;will enhance teaching and training at all levels (undergraduate through professional). MJS teaches an&lt;br/&gt;Earth System Science course for education majors, and GSS teaches advanced courses in Earth's Past&lt;br/&gt;Climate and Depositional Systems; both PIs regularly utilizes case examples from their own research to&lt;br/&gt;illustrate climate concepts. Furthermore, the project will enable significant cross-disciplinary training, and&lt;br/&gt;involves a mixed-gender research team of sedimentologists and geochronologists. Finally, the PIs and&lt;br/&gt;students will continue to disseminate results in high-profile journals and at national meetings.</AbstractNarration>
