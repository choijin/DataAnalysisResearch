<AbstractNarration>This award provides partial support for the purchase of a 16-capillary DNA sequencer, real-time PCR machine, gradient PCR thermal cycler, and data analysis system - all to be housed in a shared facility.  The instrumentation will be used in studies of molecular-level variation in nature, and the evolutionary implications of that variation. Several capabilities that are crucial to current evolutionary and ecological research programs will be developed, including: (1) analysis of highly polymorphic genotypes (microsatellite, SNP, AFLP, TRFLP); (2) quantitative PCR analysis of gene expression; and (3) DNA sequencing. The six major users of the instrumentation represent a diverse set of research programs in which understanding the basis of biological diversity, through the use of these molecular tools, is a principal goal.  In addition, the inclusion of a sample preparation facility and center for computational analysis of molecular data will enable many other Stony Brook research groups to address important ecological and evolutionary questions with novel forms of data.  Establishment of this central laboratory for molecular studies of adaptation and diversity will also have significant broader impacts on life sciences research and teaching at Stony Brook and in the larger community.  First, the instrumentation will substantially augment the training capabilities of our department and enable new interactions and collaborations among biologists throughout the Stony Brook community. Additionally, the laboratory will be used for undergraduate training in basic molecular biology techniques, vital to many careers in the life sciences.  This represents a novel and tangible benefit to the Stony Brook undergraduate community, which is one the most diverse in the nation.  Finally, by synergizing with the activities of the Long Island Group for Advancing Science Education (LIGASE), the proposed facility will augment outreach to local K-12 students and educators, representing a new and important means for presenting ecological and evolutionary ideas and information to the public at large.</AbstractNarration>
