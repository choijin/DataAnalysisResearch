<AbstractNarration>Project Abstract: 0405803 A Mazzucato, Pennsylvania State University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Micro-Local and Fourier-Analytical Approach to Some Non-Linear Problems in Fluid Mechanics and Elasticity  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator A. L. Mazzucato will address several questions in the&lt;br/&gt;mathematical investigation of fluid flows and elasticity using methods&lt;br/&gt;from Fourier and micro-local  analysis. Micro-local analysis seeks  to&lt;br/&gt;identify points and directions along which a solution  to partial&lt;br/&gt;differential equations  looses regularity, by localizing it in both space and frequency. Modern techniques in  Fourier analysis consist in&lt;br/&gt;decomposing a signal  by testing it against a given set of waves or&lt;br/&gt;wave-forms at different length scales, so that relevant information can be extracted accurately and efficiently. Turbulent flows, for example, &lt;br/&gt;exhibits a complex behavior at both large and small scales. The coupling between different scales is often due to the non-linearity of the underlying equations.  The investigator will concentrate on the following problems. She will study dissipation of enstrophy, the squared vorticity,  for the two-dimensional Euler equations, which model inviscid fluid flow, by considering  transport by irregular vector fields.  Understanding how&lt;br/&gt;enstrophy is dissipated is important for two-dimensional turbulence. &lt;br/&gt;She will analyze  certain  weak solutions   to the Navier-Stokes&lt;br/&gt;equations, which  describe the motion of viscous fluids, with globally&lt;br/&gt;infinite energy  by using  generalized energy inequalities. Allowing for weaker control  at infinity  could in turn lead to refined estimates on the local behavior of solutions. She will investigate existence of mild solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations by semi-group methods in polyhedral domains,  which are domains of particular interest in numerical simulations.  Finally, the investigator will continue studying the inverse problem of unique identification of  elastic properties by dynamic&lt;br/&gt;surface measurements, exploiting the covariance of the elasticity&lt;br/&gt;equations under coordinate changes. The determination of elastic&lt;br/&gt;parameters has significant applications in medical imaging.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The present project stresses the inter-disciplinary nature of the analysis of partial differential equations, which  mathematically model physical phenomena. Theoretical tools developed to discern subtle properties of these equations have  been successfully employed in real-life problems. Micro-local analysis studies how  singularities are propagated by  differential equations. Changes in material properties cause singularities to form in waves and can hence be determined when direct measurement is not possible, as in seismology, oil exploration,  and medical diagnostics.  Fourier analysis examines the content of a signal at a given frequency  or length scale. Understanding crucial aspects of turbulent flows, for&lt;br/&gt;example concentration and dissipation of energy and vorticity, at&lt;br/&gt;different scales has an impact in disciplines ranging from aerodynamics, to meteorology, to human physiology. The need for numerical simulation and design has underlined the role of complex geometries, where a refined mathematical analysis is often necessary for a qualitative understanding. &lt;br/&gt;With this project the investigator  also aims  at strengthening  her&lt;br/&gt;collaborative effort with other female researchers both in the United&lt;br/&gt;States and abroad.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
