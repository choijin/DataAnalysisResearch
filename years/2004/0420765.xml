<AbstractNarration>This award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program supports Case Western University to develop a novel, plasma-assisted liquid phase epitaxy (PLPE) system for the growth of gallium nitride and related materials.  The established methods of liquid phase epitaxy (LPE) will be combined with recently developed plasma assisted melt growth methods to provide a system for growing device-quality single crystal layers up to 5 cm in diameter.  To accomplish this end, a highly versatile PLPE growth system with a near-atmospheric pressure plasma source, temperature and temperature gradient control, and provision for linear and rotational motion will be designed and built.   Some of the advantages of Plasma Assisted Liquid Phase Epitaxy (PLPE) are: (1) they are much less expensive to build and to run than growth systems for systems; (2) higher growth rates and higher quality material; (3) simplicity and in environmental clean; (4) potential for application to other classes of semiconductor materials new possibilities for a wide variety of novel materials research. In addition, there are potential applications for important technologies such as ultraviolet and blue lasers, and high-temperature and high power electronics.  The new instrumentation will have broader impact on the nation's academic research infrastructure by providing a new technology for pioneering materials growth research. Experience has shown that the LPE process is a rapid, cost-effective technique for investigation of innovative materials research concepts, and therefore is especially well suited to the university research environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program supports Case Western University with the development a novel, plasma-assisted liquid phase epitaxy (PLPE) system for the growth of gallium nitride and related materials.
