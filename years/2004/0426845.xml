<AbstractNarration>The investigators are developing Bayesian statistical models for the          &lt;br/&gt;study of the distribution of climate system properties. The study is            &lt;br/&gt;based on output from the MIT 2DLO climate model as well as an estimation        &lt;br/&gt;of the natural climate variability from atmosphere-ocean general                &lt;br/&gt;circulation models (AOGCM). The statistical models account for all              &lt;br/&gt;uncertainties by focusing on the estimation of the main patterns of             &lt;br/&gt;natural variability. This is achieved by building prior distributions           &lt;br/&gt;for the covariance matrix from ensemble runs of AOGCMs.  Particular             &lt;br/&gt;attention is paid to the spectral decomposition of the covariance               &lt;br/&gt;matrix. In addition the statistical models are hierarchical in order to         &lt;br/&gt;consider all sources of errors in a comprehensive way. These errors             &lt;br/&gt;include the interpolation error due to the impossibility of evaluating          &lt;br/&gt;climate models in a time short enough to embed it within a Monte Carlo         &lt;br/&gt;iterative estimation method.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  The proposed research falls clearly into the ``Representing                   &lt;br/&gt;uncertainty in geosystems'' theme of the NSF Program for Collaborations         &lt;br/&gt;in Mathematical Geosciences. The main focus is to improve the estimates         &lt;br/&gt;of parameters that govern the large-scale behavior of the climate               &lt;br/&gt;system. The resulting analysis will include an assessment of the                &lt;br/&gt;uncertainty of those estimates. The research is a collaborative effort          &lt;br/&gt;between climate scientists and statisticians as it requires the use of          &lt;br/&gt;climate system models as well as analyzing climate observational                &lt;br/&gt;datasets. The broader aspect of this project is that the estimated              &lt;br/&gt;uncertainties in climate system behavior can be used for uncertainty            &lt;br/&gt;analysis of climate change projections. By enhancing the ability to             &lt;br/&gt;analyze the risks of climate change on society, this research will              &lt;br/&gt;provide valuable input to policymakers.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
