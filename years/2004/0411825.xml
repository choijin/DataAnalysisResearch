<AbstractNarration>The overall objective of the proposed research is to translate findings from the investigators' previous research on cognition and learning in biomedical engineering research (BME) laboratories into prototype designs for instructional labs. The investigators' previous research was an intensive "in vivo" study of two BME labs with the aim of understanding: 1) the nature of the representational and reasoning practices that are used in problem solving, and 2) how student apprentices learn in these labs. The investigators also used their results to inform the design and refinement of problem content, scaffolding, and facilitation for undergraduate and graduate classrooms using a problem-based learning (PBL) pedagogy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In their new research, the investigators propose to bring their studies of problem solving practices in labs together in a systematic way with their studies of student learning in order to design and implement new BME instructional labs that better approximate the learning environments and model-based reasoning practices they have found in research labs. In year 1, they will assess the modified PBL classrooms and carry out in vivo observations of two existing labs for a baseline. In year 2, they will work with BME faculty to design, pilot, and assess two instructional labs that capture the cognitive, social, and cultural aspects of practice that lead to effective learning and problem solving. In year 3, they will assess the final implementation of the instructional labs. During these three years they will continue their studies of cognition and learning in research labs, adding a new lab in the area of biorobotics in order to assess the generalizability of their findings. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
