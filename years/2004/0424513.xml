<AbstractNarration>The University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) will host a two-day Workshop for IACUC 101 Training and Research with Free-Ranging Wildlife:  IACUC Review of Projects Regulated by Multiple Agencies. This is the first workshop to be held in the United States that specifically brings together the premier IACUC educational program and the primary organizations involved in the oversight of field research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The National Science Foundation (NSF) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) support a wide range of research activities involving animals, some of which utilize non- traditional laboratory species in field studies.  These agencies require compliance with PHS Policy on the Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, which incorporates extensive science-based guidance addressing the use of traditional species in the laboratory.  However, although field research guidelines have been established by some scientific organizations, Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUCs) and principal investigators continue to have difficulty in the review and continuing review of field research protocols. The management of field research, including the issuance of permits to researchers, is under the oversight of multiple federal (e.g. UFS&amp;WS and NMFS) and state wildlife agencies. These include but are not limited to state wildlife laws, international treaties, and federal laws protecting endangered species and marine mammals. In addition to management and regulatory functions, many of these agencies also conduct field research, often in collaboration with universities. IACUCs at institutions with investigators conducting field research on their own or in collaboration with agency colleagues must ensure compliance with a myriad of rules and also conduct effective oversight of the research as required by their funding agencies.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of the co-sponsoring agencies and host institution for this workshop include:  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-To provide basic IACUC 101 training for institutions that conduct field research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-To supplement the basic IACUC 101 training by including mock IACUC scenarios that address field research issues, and including representatives from wildlife agencies as adjunct faculty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-To bring representatives from institutions that conduct field research together with the Agencies that fund or regulate such research, and Agencies that conduct research on their own or may collaborate with institutions, and provide a unique opportunity for productive interaction and discussion of respective jurisdictions, regulations, and best practices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-To provide IACUCs, investigators, veterinarians and institutional officials with an enhanced understanding of the various agencies and their respective purviews, and with increased knowledge of how they can more effectively facilitate and appropriately oversee wildlife research at their institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-To create a forum for interagency and institutional open discussion and exploration of common issues concerning the conduct of field research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merits: A workshop combining the IACUC 101 program with a one-day session addressing IACUC review of field research projects will provide the framework for future educational programs addressing the ethical review of field research. The integrity of science will benefit from enhanced educational offerings addressing animal research protections.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Clarification of ethical responsibilities and the process for reviewing field research projects will improve the ability of investigators and independent animal welfare committees to meet regulatory requirements and ensure high quality research while promoting the responsible conduct of research. Moreover, bringing together researchers, funding and regulatory agencies, and representatives of organizations responsible for establishing field research guidelines offers a unique opportunity to discuss common issues and consider a consistent process for the review and continuing review of field based animal research.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
