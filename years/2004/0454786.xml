    <AbstractNarration>Interest in crystal growth and new synthetic tools is currently very strong internationally due to a broadly based recognition of the technological importance and scientific challenges involved in the discovery and study of new materials. There is a steady influx of scientists from other disciplines who see the opportunities for performing exciting research in this area. The2005 Gordon Research Conference entitled 2005 Combinatorial &amp; High Throughput Materials will provide the venue for a major international meeting in this area. The goal of the conference is to facilitate international collaborations and information exchange across a broad spectrum of researchers with interests in developing new synthetic tools, new materials and applications. Areas to be discussed include theoretical aspects of new materials discovery, biomaterials, catalysts, electronic materials and polymers. The conference will play a key role in providing opportunities for collaborations with the community at large which is an important part of career development for the more junior participants. The NSF funds will be permit participation by graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and early career faculty, and also to support partially a few session chairs and invited speakers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;%%% &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The materials synthesis and applications community has a significant impact on technological advances of high significance to society through the development of new materials for priority materials areas in industry that include electronics and photonics, catalysis, and the design and construction of novel devices such as sensor materials. This meeting will provide students, post doctoral scholars, and early career faculty a forum that will familiarize them with job opportunities in the major industrial and academic laboratories that are becoming active in the field.</AbstractNarration>
