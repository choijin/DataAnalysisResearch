    <AbstractNarration>The proposed research will focus on &lt;br/&gt;models involving multidimensional systems &lt;br/&gt;of nonlinear partial differential equations, &lt;br/&gt;arising in elastodynamics, incompressible &lt;br/&gt;fluid flow, and electromagnetics. &lt;br/&gt;The emphasis of this work will be on existence and long time &lt;br/&gt;behavior of solutions using analytical methods which &lt;br/&gt;exploit the fundamental structure of the models, based on the null condition. &lt;br/&gt;In the area of nonlinear elastodynamics, the &lt;br/&gt;connection between the structure of the strain-energy &lt;br/&gt;relations and global well-posedness for the &lt;br/&gt;initial value problem will be studied. &lt;br/&gt;The research aims at a better understanding of &lt;br/&gt;the relationship between &lt;br/&gt;compressible and incompressible materials, &lt;br/&gt;the formation of shock waves, and the behavior &lt;br/&gt;of elastic bodies in astrophysical applications. &lt;br/&gt;The recent methods developed for elastodynamics &lt;br/&gt;will be applied to the Born-Infeld system from nonlinear &lt;br/&gt;electromagnetics and recently revived in string theory. &lt;br/&gt;The confinement of vortical motion in planar incompressible ideal fluids &lt;br/&gt;will be studied. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; According to the classical principle of determinism, the &lt;br/&gt;the evolutionary laws of a physical system together with an initial &lt;br/&gt;configuration should determine the state of the system at all future times. &lt;br/&gt;Mathematically speaking, the the laws of physics are encoded in &lt;br/&gt;a system of partial differential equations solutions of which &lt;br/&gt;should exist and depend uniquely and continuously on the initial &lt;br/&gt;configuration. Creating the mathematical framework for a given &lt;br/&gt;system and verifying its well-posedness (in the sense above) &lt;br/&gt;is thus a problem of fundamental importance. &lt;br/&gt;Much of the research in this proposal is devoted to such &lt;br/&gt;basic questions for models describing the dynamics of elastic &lt;br/&gt;materials. Material properties are expressed &lt;br/&gt;through the specification of the relation between strain and energy, &lt;br/&gt;using phenomenological arguments. However, phenomenology &lt;br/&gt;alone does not fully characterize the structure of the model. &lt;br/&gt;The desire to describe dynamics for all future times &lt;br/&gt;leads to the imposition of further structural assumptions &lt;br/&gt;which are deeply connected with the mathematical analysis of &lt;br/&gt;the problem. In this sense, mathematical analysis offers &lt;br/&gt;important guidance in the selection of the model. &lt;br/&gt;With a mathematically tractable theory in hand, &lt;br/&gt;it is possible to consider qualitative questions, such as how &lt;br/&gt;the behavior of the system varies under changes in &lt;br/&gt;material properties. In particular, the stability &lt;br/&gt;of the system as the material becomes incompressible &lt;br/&gt;will be studied. This includes rubber-like materials, &lt;br/&gt;for example. The techniques will also be adapted to &lt;br/&gt;allow for the inclusion of relativistic effects, &lt;br/&gt;necessary for astrophysical applications. &lt;br/&gt;The Born-Infeld model from nonlinear electrodynamics &lt;br/&gt;(and recently revived in the theory of strings) will &lt;br/&gt;also be investigated, since it shares similar structural &lt;br/&gt;properties.</AbstractNarration>
