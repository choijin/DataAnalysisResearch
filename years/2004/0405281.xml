<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0405281&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Haydee Herrera&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research proposal focuses on the study of the topology of&lt;br/&gt;manifolds with finite second homotopy group and the Differential&lt;br/&gt;Geometry of quaternionic- Kaehler manifolds. The emphasis of the&lt;br/&gt;project is on the determination of analytical and topological&lt;br/&gt;invariants of the manifolds, such as the signature, A-roof-genus&lt;br/&gt;and elliptic genera. Following the evidence from our previous&lt;br/&gt;research, we propose to apply the aforementioned theory to&lt;br/&gt;concrete Geometric Analysis/Differential Geometry&lt;br/&gt;problems. Furthermore, this study has applications to Algebraic&lt;br/&gt;Geometry (via twistor transform) and to Theoretical Physics,&lt;br/&gt;since the manifolds under consideration are of interest in sigma&lt;br/&gt;models and in String Theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My research interests are concerned with the study of certain&lt;br/&gt;spaces of large dimension, called quaternion-Kaehler&lt;br/&gt;manifolds. In the quest for understanding the universe,&lt;br/&gt;physicists have developed many and very sophisticated models,&lt;br/&gt;such as Relativity Theory and more recently String Theory, that&lt;br/&gt;help explain and predict phenomena observed in the Universe.  One&lt;br/&gt;of the leading physicists of our times, E. Witten, discovered&lt;br/&gt;that quaternion-Kaehler manifolds appear in the formulation of&lt;br/&gt;certain Quantum Field Theories.  My research focuses on finding&lt;br/&gt;the possible shapes and properties of quaternion- Kaehler&lt;br/&gt;manifolds.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
