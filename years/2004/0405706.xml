    <AbstractNarration>The 26 September 2003 Tokachi-oki earthquake (Mw = 8.3) in Hokkaido, Japan, caused significant soil liquefaction, ground lateral spreading, and slope failures along the eastern coast of Hokkaido. The ground accelerations exceeded 0.5 g at 100 miles from the hypocenter. The objectives of this SGER (Small Grants for Exploratory Research) project are to collect and process satellite data in order to determine the extent and magnitude of permanent ground deformations resulting from the compressibility and failure of soil deposits. It involves collaboration between researchers at the University of Southern California and the University of Texas at Austin, and will be carried out in collaboration with researchers at Kyoto University and Waseda University in Japan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The satellite data to be collected includes synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images and high-resolution optical satellite images. The collected data will be processed for (1) mapping the location and magnitude of ground deformations over large geographic areas using SAR interferometry and interpretation of optical satellite images; (2) differentiating ground deformations (lateral and vertical) induced by local soil conditions (e.g., liquefaction) and overall tectonic processes; and (3) developing a comprehensive GIS model of field observations and ground deformations. This investigation of large-scale geotechnical features will complement the field observations from the post-earthquake reconnaissance work of U.S. and Japanese investigators. The utilization of satellite data has the potential to provide unique and complementary information about large-scale ground deformations and their associated damage after earthquakes. It is expected that this research will yield novel results in geotechnical engineering that will become part of future developments and improvements in current remote sensing systems.</AbstractNarration>
