<AbstractNarration>The project is aiming at solving polynomial systems numerically by the&lt;br/&gt;homotopy continuation method. Over the years, practical evidences have been&lt;br/&gt;given that the homotopy method is efficient, reliable and much powerful in&lt;br/&gt;solving polynomial systems. Recently, modeling the sparse structure of a&lt;br/&gt;polynomial system by its Newton polytopes leads to a major computational&lt;br/&gt;breakthrough called the polyhedral homotopy method. Based on it, a source&lt;br/&gt;code HOM4PS, produced by the PI and his students, leads all the other&lt;br/&gt;existing codes for solving polynomial systems in efficiency and storage&lt;br/&gt;requirement by a great margin. Nonetheless, there are numerous models of&lt;br/&gt;large polynomial systems in application still do not have a satisfactory&lt;br/&gt;line of attack. And it has become apparent that the numerical techniques for&lt;br/&gt;following homotopy paths are far from thoroughly developed for large&lt;br/&gt;systems. The essence of the project is the advance development in all&lt;br/&gt;aspects of the solver HOM4PS based on the conduct of further research to&lt;br/&gt;greatly enlarge the scope of its applications, especially applications to&lt;br/&gt;large systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The problem of solving polynomial systems arises very frequently in various&lt;br/&gt;fields of science and engineering, such as formula construction, geometric&lt;br/&gt;intersection, inverse kinematics, robotics, power flow problems with&lt;br/&gt;PQ-specified bases, vision and the computation of equilibrium states of&lt;br/&gt;chemical reaction equations, etc. This topic has been an important research&lt;br/&gt;subjectin Europe. In the last decade, a considerable research effort&lt;br/&gt;involving seven countries and twenty universities had been directed to this&lt;br/&gt;problem in two consecutive major projects, PoSSo and FRISCO, supported by&lt;br/&gt;European Commission. As mentioned above, the code HOM4PS developed by the PI&lt;br/&gt;for this problem is far more advanced and the ultimate goal of the current&lt;br/&gt;project is a more complete high-quality block-box software which will&lt;br/&gt;incorporate the best state of the art to provide the general scientific&lt;br/&gt;community a reliable source for solving polynomial systems on a wide variety&lt;br/&gt;of advanced architectures.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
