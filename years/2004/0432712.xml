<AbstractNarration>The National Academy of Engineering (NAE) will convene a panel of engineering leaders to conduct a fast-track assessment of (1) the past and potential future impact of the U.S. engineering research enterprise on the nation's economy, quality of life, security, and global leadership, and (2) the adequacy of public and private investment to sustain U.S. preeminence in basic engineering research.  A two-decade decline in the share of federal R&amp;D investment accounted for by engineering, and the perceived erosion of basic, long-term engineering research capability in U.S. industry and federal laboratories, pose serious questions about the long-term health of U.S. engineering research.  To address these concerns, this nine-month initiative will document and evaluate recent contributions of U.S.-based engineering research to the nation's interests, assess its potential contribution to emerging national challenges and opportunities, and outline a national strategy for ensuring that the engineering research foundations of American global economic, military, scientific, and technological preeminence remain rock solid in the face of rapid, often disruptive, societal and global change.  An NAE panel will put forward findings, recommendations, and a national action plan designed to engage all major constituents of the U.S. engineering enterprise. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:  The findings of this activity will advance understanding of recent trends and future challenges for engineering research, the contributions of engineering research (basic engineering research in particular) to national goals, and the current health of the U.S. basic engineering research enterprise. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:  The project's findings and recommendations will inform public sector and private-sector decision-making regarding the scale and composition of investments in basic engineering research.  Ultimately, the results of the project and actions they engender should strengthen the U.S. engineering research enterprise and its contributions to future U.S. economic prosperity, national security, and global technological leadership. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
