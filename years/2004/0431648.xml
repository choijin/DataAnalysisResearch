    <AbstractNarration>The project is developing an integrated system with multi-levels of activities to increase the number of STEM graduates by thirty-seven students and to increase the number of students majoring in STEM fields by 30%, or 499 students. Methods include developing a Collegian Center, infusing interdisciplinary modules throughout STEM classes, creating linked classes, increasing the success rate of students in mathematics courses and providing a recruitment effort that targets underrepresented classes of students in local high schools. A study is determining the effectiveness of each of the elements of the projects and is providing feedback to improve the process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;STEM students are invited to join a vibrant, holistic and nurturing Collegian Center where they become part of a cohort of STEM scholars. Students participating in the center are demonstrating an "Evidence of Competency" by participating in activities such as completing a capstone course and presenting their work at an annual institutional student conference, leading a "Build Your Own Computer" weekend activity, engaging in summer research internships and/or completing a community based service-learning project. The scholars are being provided with a number of services that include mentoring, mentor training, and field trips to transfer institutions and industry to explore career opportunities. They are being rewarded with scholarships for academic achievement and are serving as role models to encourage other students to pursue a STEM degree program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is increasing the number of students who succeed in college level pre-calculus courses through Peer-Led Team Learning (PLTL), a model adapted from City College of New York that was developed for chemistry through NSF funding. PLTL is a mentoring model that engages teams of students in collaborative, problem solving activities that are guided by a peer leader who has successfully completed the mathematics course. A mathematics learning-center called the "pi-Shop," is providing students with individualized access to computer technology, walk-in tutoring and technology assistance, and cooperative learning activities.</AbstractNarration>
