<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0405117&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Kefeng Liu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By using localization methods we plan to intensively study&lt;br/&gt;various conjectures from string theory, in particular those&lt;br/&gt;arised from string duality. These include the most general mirror&lt;br/&gt;principle for higher genus from functorial localization, the&lt;br/&gt;Gopakumar-Vafa integrality conjecture, the relationship between&lt;br/&gt;elliptic genus and Gromov-Witten invariants, both from&lt;br/&gt;equivariant index theory. We have made significant progresses&lt;br/&gt;towards our goals, for which the functorial localization formula&lt;br/&gt;we discovered during our proof of the mirror principle is one of&lt;br/&gt;the key techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The interactions of string theory and mathematics has been one of&lt;br/&gt;the very few most active and most exciting fields in mathematics&lt;br/&gt;for the past twenty years.  String duality has created many&lt;br/&gt;amazingly beautiful mathematical conjectures. Our localization&lt;br/&gt;methods have been very successful in proving them, inlcuding the&lt;br/&gt;mirror conjecture, the Marino-Vafa conjecture, the Hori-Vafa&lt;br/&gt;conjecture and the mathematical construction of the topological&lt;br/&gt;vertex. Such interactions not only produce mathematical theories&lt;br/&gt;and results, but also give strong evidences to the physical&lt;br/&gt;theories.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
