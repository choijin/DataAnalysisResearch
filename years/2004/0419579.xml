    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate the feasibility of integrating molecular modeling with chemical process simulation in order to provide a mainstream tool for chemical process development and molecular design of custom compounds. Discontinuous molecular dynamics (DMD) simulation is combined with thermodynamic perturbation theory (TPT) to provide a basis for highly leveraged computational effort in all aspects of molecular modeling. Demonstrations would include applications for thiophenes, phosphates, and octanol/water partitioning. Extrapolations to polymers would involve characterizing PRISM parameters based on molecular simulations of oligomers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Molecular modeling represents the future of chemical product design, but its present isolation from process design creates substantial obstacles to its use as a mainstream tool for the majority of chemical engineers. The resulting product will be an option within a suite of Process Models. With this option, engineers will be able to draw the chemical structure of a newly conceived product, estimate its properties from DMD/TPT simulation, and economically evaluate the chemical process design within 24 hours. This capability will reduce dramatically the time from conception to production of new compounds and materials.</AbstractNarration>
