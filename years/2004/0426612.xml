<AbstractNarration>An international conference on Step Polymerization or Polycondensation will be held at the Virginia Tech Hotel Roanoke and Conference Center (http://www.hotelroanoke.com/) near the Roanoke Airport from 26-30 September 2004. The co-chairs are James E. McGrath (Virginia Tech), Frank W. Harris (University of Akron) and Edward E. Paschke (Amoco, retired). This is an important contemporary topic that relates to materials for new fibers, films, composites, fuel cells, biomedical devices, microelectronics, and aerospace. The proceedings will be published in the journal, High Performance Polymers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theme of "POLYCONDENSATION 2004" is primarily focused on the synthesis and reactions of high performance polymers, although additional related subjects are included. Lectures on linear, branched, special architectures, and network polymerizations will be presented.  The meeting program has an international advisory board, an industrial advisory group, and a local organizing committee. Polycondensation 2004 has already attracted a large contingent of presti gious international speakers from Europe and Asia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program begins on Sunday afternoon with a plenary lecture by Prof. Jim Economy from the University of Illinois, followed by other lectures and an opening reception. Three full days of additional invited lectures complete the program, along with an extensive poster session on Monday evening, which will permit even more individuals to present their latest research and encourage further interaction between investigators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
