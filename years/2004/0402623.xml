<AbstractNarration>HOUSTON LOUIS STOKES ALLIANCE FOR MINORITY PARTICIPATION.PHASE II &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The Houston-Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (H-LSAMP) consortium consisting of 6 &lt;br/&gt;universities, 2 community colleges, and a school district, will build upon its Phase I foundation to &lt;br/&gt;implement a realistic, comprehensive plan to:  a) recruit well-qualified minority students in STEM &lt;br/&gt;disciplines; b) enhance retention rates by focusing on individual retention issues, and; c) ensure that &lt;br/&gt;each student graduates with a clear career goal and the preparation to achieve it.  The H-LSAMP will &lt;br/&gt;maintain its management structure, its recruitment and selection process, and will continue to provide &lt;br/&gt;financial support in the form of stipends to its H-LSAMP scholars.  Scholars will earn their stipends by &lt;br/&gt;performing activities associated with their training, such as working in research laboratories.  The H-&lt;br/&gt;LSAMP will maintain its successful Collaborative Learning Community model in which scholars are &lt;br/&gt;required to attend rigorous excellence workshops associated with core courses such as calculus and &lt;br/&gt;chemistry.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Additionally, the H-LSAMP will implement processes to educate the scholars about career opportunities &lt;br/&gt;open to well-prepared graduates, and monitor and counsel them to optimize the likelihood of on-time &lt;br/&gt;graduation. Strong emphasis will be placed on encouraging students to pursue graduate degrees and &lt;br/&gt;preparing them for entry to graduate school.  To this end, the H-LSAMP will plan and execute regularly &lt;br/&gt;scheduled workshops and forums about STEM careers and graduate education, emphasizing the &lt;br/&gt;leadership opportunities open to those with doctoral degrees in these fields.  The H-LSAMP will &lt;br/&gt;respond to the need for improved communication skills by providing formal written communications &lt;br/&gt;skills training.  Concurrently, a protocol for routine monitoring and documenting student progress that &lt;br/&gt;includes periodic individual assessment and follow-up meetings with a staff member will be designed &lt;br/&gt;and employed.  The H-LSAMP will contribute to the growing body of knowledge about retention of &lt;br/&gt;undergraduate minority STEM students by using accepted research methods to determine the relative &lt;br/&gt;contributions of factors believed to be important to retention in this population.  Last, because &lt;br/&gt;information management is important to the success of programs such as the LSAMP, a state-of-the-art &lt;br/&gt;information management software program developed specifically for the H-LSAMP will be made &lt;br/&gt;available to other institutions.     &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project lies primarily in the generation of important new knowledge about &lt;br/&gt;factors that contribute to retention and success in the population of underrepresented minorities, &lt;br/&gt;primarily Hispanics and African-Americans pursuing STEM baccalaureate degrees in Texas.  One can &lt;br/&gt;reasonably expect much of this knowledge to be generalizable to Hispanics and African-Americans in &lt;br/&gt;other geographic areas of the U.S.  Once the results of an innovative student-centered plan that combines &lt;br/&gt;application of educational principles with a standardized counseling and monitoring protocol are known, &lt;br/&gt;the educational community will have a model for assessing and responding to needs of individual &lt;br/&gt;minority STEM students as they progress through their college careers.  The commitment of the H-&lt;br/&gt;LSAMP leaders, faculty, and staff is well-documented, and evidence of institutionalization of the &lt;br/&gt;program includes the commitment of physical facilities and an institutional to NSF match of &lt;br/&gt;approximately 1.5:1.     &lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this project lies in its potential to greatly increase the numbers of well-focused, &lt;br/&gt;minority graduates who graduate from our institutions inspired and prepared to pursue career goals. The &lt;br/&gt;expectation is that a high proportion will aspire to attend graduate school, swelling the ranks of the next &lt;br/&gt;generation of scientific leaders and educators.  Finally, the H-LSAMP will have the potential to enhance &lt;br/&gt;the success and impact of similar programs by making available proprietary software that facilitates the &lt;br/&gt;data collection, retrieval, analysis, and reporting required for effective, efficient operation.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
