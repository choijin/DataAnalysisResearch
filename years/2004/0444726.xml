<AbstractNarration>This project will develop a classification and monographically revise&lt;br/&gt;species and higher-level groups of a tribe of beetles distributed in&lt;br/&gt;Australia, and the Americas. Over 100 new species are expected to be&lt;br/&gt;described in these taxa. The study will combine morphological and&lt;br/&gt;molecular analysis to produce taxonomic hypotheses, generic and species&lt;br/&gt;(re)descriptions and diagnoses, full illustrations for internal/external&lt;br/&gt;features, species range maps, habitat data, identification keys for&lt;br/&gt;genera and species in both internet/CD based and traditional printed&lt;br/&gt;forms, internet accessible specimen data and genus/species web pages.&lt;br/&gt;All Australian loxandrine species will be revised and described and&lt;br/&gt;tools for identification will be provided for non-specialist. This group&lt;br/&gt;of beetles will then be available for consideration in conservation&lt;br/&gt;planning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus taxa of this study are a group of Australian Carabid beetles&lt;br/&gt;and this work will be the first major carabid clade in Australia to&lt;br/&gt;undergo cladistic analysis and modern classification. Australia is&lt;br/&gt;essential to our understanding of worldwide distribution patterns and&lt;br/&gt;these beetles are a good model taxon for such studies. In terms of&lt;br/&gt;evolutionary significance, this study will investigate reproductive&lt;br/&gt;biology and predator avoidance by chemical defense. Using the&lt;br/&gt;phylogenetic hypothesis and ecological information, the history of how&lt;br/&gt;defensive compound changes have occurred in this lineage will be brought&lt;br/&gt;to light.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This revisionary syntheses in systematics proposal for loxandrine&lt;br/&gt;carabid beetles will bring together data for specimens from major&lt;br/&gt;collections worldwide and then return to these collections sorted,&lt;br/&gt;identified and databased specimens. Distributional and life history&lt;br/&gt;data, and web-based and standard published tools for identification will&lt;br/&gt;be made available to all biologists. Monographic revision of these&lt;br/&gt;genera and the tools to identify specimens will allow non-systematist to&lt;br/&gt;identify these taxa and assess their occurrence in both ecological and&lt;br/&gt;historical terms. This will be a significant advance for a set of taxa&lt;br/&gt;presently completely unavailable for study.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project integrates graduate and undergraduate students throughout by&lt;br/&gt;training them in field studies, specimen collection, preparation, insect&lt;br/&gt;morphology, sequence acquisition, data collection and phylogenetic&lt;br/&gt;analyses. Undergraduates will gain experience working in laboratory&lt;br/&gt;facilities and museum collections and will learn basic identification&lt;br/&gt;and insect morphology. Graduate students will be fully integrated into&lt;br/&gt;museum research, specimen collection, dissection, morphological and&lt;br/&gt;sequence analyses and development and implementation of web resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
