    <AbstractNarration>PI: Andrew Bernat&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Computing Research Association (CRA)&lt;br/&gt;Title: Workshop in Support of Broadening Participation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Computing Research Association (CRA) has been awarded a Special Projects grant to organize a workshop to bring together a wide range of individuals with experience in working with groups traditionally under-represented in computing: women, African-Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans, Pacific Islanders, Alaskan Natives and persons with disabilities. The workshop participants will take a careful look at prior activities designed to encourage increased participation by individuals from these groups and will formulate suggestions for new activities that would further encourage participation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project lies in its potential for adding to the knowledge in the field of what has worked and not worked in activities designed to increase the participation and success of underrepresented groups in computing, and its potential for providing insights into new and different avenues for further increasing such participation and success. The broader impacts of the project lie with its potential for contributing ideas and concrete suggestions for increasing the numbers and success of women, underrepresented minorities and the disabled in computing.</AbstractNarration>
