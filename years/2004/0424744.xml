<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;OCE-0424744 / OCE-0424921&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deep mixed layers dominate the upper ocean where Subantarctic Mode Water (SAMW) and Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) are formed  in  the  southeastern  (SE)  Pacific  north  of  the  Subantarctic  Front  (SAF). The  cold  thick layers have low salinity and high gas content that fills almost all of the southern hemisphere and tropical  oceans  at  lower  thermocline  to  intermediate  depths.  SAMW/AAIW  formation  has  a major impact on the oceanic sink  for anthropogenic CO2, whose largest uncertainty is at intermediate depths. However, AAIW is probably the only intermediate-depth, large-scale water mass that has not been studied in  winter at its major source. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, researchers from the University of Miami Rosenstiel School of Marine &amp; Atmospheric Science and the University of California-San Diego Scripps Institute of Oceanography will study the processes responsible  for the formation of SAMW/AAIW  in  the  SE  Pacific.  Though the overall goal of the project is to characterize carbon and tracer properties in the thick SAMW/AAIW layers in the SE Pacific formation region, measurements of carbon system parameters and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) also be taken to: 1) map wintertime carbon system and CFC properties in the major SAMW/AAIW formation region; 2) compare  the  observed  wintertime  air-sea  CO2  disequilibrium  to  the  average disequilibrium terms estimated using the ?C* approach; 3) investigate the possible relationship of upper ocean features (e.g., convection, eddies, interleaving, currents) to the carbon and tracer characteristics of newly  formed deep mixed layers of SAMW/AAIW; and 4) estimate CFC ages and a local AAIW formation rate to assess the relative effects of advection versus mixing of newly formed AAIW.  The results yielded from this US and Chilean collaboration will fill  an  important  and  large  gap  in  global  ocean  observations,  both  for  physical processes that impact long-term climate change  and for processes  governing the carbon cycle. The results will be disseminated broadly to enhance scientific and technological understanding and will be available  for  use  in  models  of  processes  that  control  the  uptake  and  transport  of anthropogenic CO2 into the ocean interior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
