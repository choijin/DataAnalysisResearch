<AbstractNarration>0456439&lt;br/&gt;Scoville&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports the participation of American scientists in a U.S.-Japan joint workshop for scientists on the Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMIC) to be held in Kyoto, Japan from May 23-27, 2005.  The co-organizers are Professor Nicholas Scoville at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena and Professor Yoshiaku Taniguchi at Tohoku University in Sendai, Japan.  The major datasets associated with the COSMOS Hubble Space Telescope and Subaru surveys will be complete and the workshop will focus on the cosmic evolution science enabled by this unprecedented survey.  Scientists from Europe will also be in attendance.  This group of scientists will collaborate to analyze unprecedented, broad-spectrum datasets on the structure and evolution of the early universe. They have also scheduled sessions to specifically address public outreach initiatives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The co-organizers have complementary scientific expertise in the field.  This enables them to evaluate and attract the best science researchers to participate. The astrophysicists attending are international leaders in the field.  The workshop will bring together teams that have been analyzing different cosmological elements (e.g. dark matter, AGN and luminous galaxies) to focus on their coupled evolution.  The broad impacts of the COSMOS survey, and this workshop are enormous.  This is the most substantial survey ever done by HST (a NASA facility) and other participating facilities (Subaru and ESO-VLT) and therefore is sure to have a long-lasting impact on future cosmological research and on the public's understanding of the early universe. The workshop organizers have made a special effort to involve postdocs and graduate students as both participants and observers.  Following the meeting they have arranged for them to visit a number of research facilities.  The exchange of ideas and data with Japanese experts in the field will enable U.S. participants to advance their own work, and will set the stage for future collaborative projects.  Following the seminar the organizers plan to establish a workshop web page.  Conference proceedings will be published on this web site.        &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
