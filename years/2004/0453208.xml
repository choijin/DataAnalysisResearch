<AbstractNarration>This award supports purchase of two items of equipment: a 3D printer, and a laser cutter. A 3D printer is a device that operates much like a conventional printer, but the file sent to the printer describes a 3D object, and the printer actually produces as output a physical model of the 3D object. A laser cutter is a something like a high-tech band saw. Both will be used in four ways: (1) To support the investigators research in computational geometry, by making physical models of complex polyhedra, protein models, and origami-like folded objects; (2) To support the research of other faculty in the Sciences; (2) To support faculty research and student projects in the Smith College Engineering program; (3) To facilitate faculty and student projects in Art, Architecture, and Arts &amp; Technology. The equipment will enable new research by faculty across the College, expose many undergraduate students to this technology via senior projects, and affect K-12 students through the PI's work on using folding and unfolding to teach a variety of topics at the 6th- through 12th-grade levels.</AbstractNarration>
