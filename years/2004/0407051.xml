<AbstractNarration>AST-0407051&lt;br/&gt;Simpson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dwarf galaxies, the most common type of galaxy in the Universe, are kinematically simple systems, which makes them ideal laboratories for studying how star formation occurs on local, rather than global, scales.  This work will focus on characterizing the neutral hydrogen component of the interstellar medium in dwarf irregular galaxies, as part of a large multi-wavelength study headed by Dr Deidre Hunter of Lowell Observatory.  To understand how dwarf galaxies form stars, it is essential to determine the location, morphology, and kinematics of their gas reservoirs, relative to regions of current and past star formation.  High resolution interferometric data will be reduced, imaged, and analyzed, and used to constrain star formation models, as part of the overall project.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work is a collaboration between faculty at a minority (Hispanic) institution, and staff at a private observatory.  The researcher will extend existing involvements with graduate and undergraduate students, and present public talks, often including material related to the project.  Being actively involved in research enables a scientist to bring the excitement of discovery to the classroom and to the public.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
