<AbstractNarration>The researchers propose to analyze a large series of data sets collected for the city of Philadelphia during several years of reform efforts for its middle mathematics and science classes.  Some of the reform efforts were implemented with NSF funding, some of the schools used NSF funded mathematics curriculum (Mathematics in Context), and some of the time alternative models were implemented in the city.  The researchers propose to make some sense out of the turmoil of change in the cities policies by examining variations in the student performance changes over the period of time that the various reforms were in place.  The methods of analysis will require statistical manipulation of large data sets using multilevel models of change and growth curves to estimate the impact of each of the major reforms on student achievement growth during the middle grades.   The study will also include analysis of interviews with educational leaders of the city.  The unique aspect of this study is that the researchers have access to individual student performance data over time for each student.  They will be able to use an interrupted time series approach to compare with the multilevel growth analysis and they will also employ qualitative data collection and analysis for in-depth contextual information about systemic reform efforts in Philadelphia.  The study examines reform of schools in a large urban city in a comprehensive way.</AbstractNarration>
