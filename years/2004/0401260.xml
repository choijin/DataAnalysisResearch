<AbstractNarration>Proposal DMS-0401260&lt;br/&gt;PI: F. Michael Christ- University of California, Berkeley&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Topics in Mathematical Analysis&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research will be conducted on a broad array of problems&lt;br/&gt;in harmonic analysis, linear and nonlinear partial differential equations,&lt;br/&gt;several complex variables, Schroedinger operators,&lt;br/&gt;and ordinary differential equations.&lt;br/&gt;In harmonic analysis proper, the decay properties of multilinear oscillatory&lt;br/&gt;integral operators will be investigated, and Lebesgue space mapping properties&lt;br/&gt;of generalized Radon transforms will be analyzed in terms of underlying geometry. &lt;br/&gt;Techniques from harmonic analysis&lt;br/&gt;will be used to develop a theory of almost everywhere WKB asymptotics for solutions&lt;br/&gt;of ordinary differential equations depending on a parameter. &lt;br/&gt;In complex analysis, compactness of the d-bar Neumann problem, the&lt;br/&gt;analytic hypoellipticity of related operators, and Toeplitz operators will be investigated. &lt;br/&gt;The Cauchy problem will be studied for nonlinear evolution equations, with the aim of&lt;br/&gt;clarifying phenomena involving instablility and growth of norms of solutions. &lt;br/&gt;The spectra and generalized eigenfunctions of time-independent Schroedinger operators,&lt;br/&gt;in one and higher dimensions, will be investigated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most fundamental laws of physical science are formulated as partial differential&lt;br/&gt;equations. These equations are sometimes linear, and sometimes nonlinear, modeling&lt;br/&gt;various types of self-interaction. The nonlinear Schrodinger equation arises in&lt;br/&gt;connection with Bose-Einstein condensates, fiber optics, and assorted other physically&lt;br/&gt;different phenomena. Time-independent Schrodinger operators with long-range potentials&lt;br/&gt;model the quantum properties of disordered electrical media. &lt;br/&gt;Other sources of problems concerning differential equations are internal to mathematics,&lt;br/&gt;such as complex analysis in several variables. &lt;br/&gt;One of the most basic tools for the analysis of differential equations is harmonic&lt;br/&gt;analysis. This research will focus both on the use of harmonic analysis methods to&lt;br/&gt;further the understanding of the nature of solutions of differential equations,&lt;br/&gt;and on the development of new tools within harmonic analysis which may ultimately provide&lt;br/&gt;further insight into differential equations, as well as solving problems within harmonic&lt;br/&gt;analysis itself. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
