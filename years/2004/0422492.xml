<AbstractNarration>Through Boost (Building Opportunities for Occupations in Science and Technology),&lt;br/&gt;the college is creating 45 scholarships for academically talented, financially needy students in order to increase the number of well-educated and skilled professionals to fill high technology positions in computer science and engineering fields. The targeted two-year programs include Network Administration (AAS), Telecommunications (AAS), Civil Engineering Technology (AAS), Electronics Engineering Technology (AAS), Computer-Aided Design (AAS), and Engineering (AS).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Faculty and staff are working together across institutional departments to coordinate the project implementation and facilitate BOOST Scholar success. The project is led by a faculty teaching in Network Administration, Civil Engineering; and Math/Physics and the college's Associate Vice President for Educational Services. These leaders conduct recruitment activities, encourage students to complete the application and enrollment process, review scholarship applications, and provide mentoring and academic support for the scholars. Key personnel from Financial Aid and the College Foundation support them. Student Services personnel assist to actively recruit new students; help students explore careers in the target disciplines; design and deliver services to enable BOOST scholars to overcome academic and personal barriers; and connect students with internship, job shadowing, and mentoring opportunities within industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Dislocated workers are being referred through the Illinois Employment and Training Center. Young women in the district are being encouraged to apply for the scholarships during Totally Tech, a one-day activity held on campus to introduce nontraditional careers to young women of high school age. This project serves 180 low-income, academically talented students in the district. As a result of the project, the college anticipates a significant increase in the number of students with financial need enrolled in one of the six target disciplines and an increase in the percentage of students in the target disciplines who persist to degree completion and either obtain employment or transfer to a four-year university.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
