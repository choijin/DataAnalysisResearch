<AbstractNarration>Until World War I wealth inequality in most industrialized economies was&lt;br/&gt;high. Then, in the next half century, it collapsed. In Paris, for instance, the share of&lt;br/&gt;wealth owned by the top 1% fell by half (from 70% to 35%). Although there has been&lt;br/&gt;significant variation in wealth concentration in developed economies since the end of&lt;br/&gt;World War II, in a historical perspective we have been living in a world of diminished&lt;br/&gt;inequality. In collaboration with Thomas Piketty and Gilles Postel-Vinay, I propose&lt;br/&gt;to investigate the collapse of wealth inequality by examining estate tax records from&lt;br/&gt;Paris in the period from 1912 to 1946. To do so the PI plans to collect detailed information&lt;br/&gt;of the composition of estates for individuals who died in Paris during the years 1912,&lt;br/&gt;1922, 1927, 1932, 1937 and 1946. These years will provide access to one cross section&lt;br/&gt;before and one after each of the great shocks this era such as WWI, the Great Depression,&lt;br/&gt;and WWII).&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit of the proposed activity:&lt;br/&gt;Although there has been increasing recognition of the importance of the&lt;br/&gt;changes in inequality that occurred between 1914 and 1950, relatively little is known&lt;br/&gt;about how the process unfolded. These data will complement data sets we have&lt;br/&gt;already collected from 1807 to 1902 and will permit the compilation of homogeneous series&lt;br/&gt;on wealth concentration in Paris and France from 1807 to 1946 that complement&lt;br/&gt;published series that run from 1902 to 1984. The data offer detailed information on&lt;br/&gt;the identity of the decedents and on the nature of the wealth they left behind. This will permit a better understanding of why the very rich failed to maintain their relative&lt;br/&gt;position, and why the middle class started to accumulate assets at a much faster rate&lt;br/&gt;after rather than before WWI.&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts resulting from the proposed activity:&lt;br/&gt;Understanding the decline in inequality that occurred during the first half of&lt;br/&gt;the twentieth century is important in its own right. More recently however, a number&lt;br/&gt;of economists have become interested in the consequences of the great shocks of the&lt;br/&gt;first half of the twentieth century on institutions. For some, these set back the&lt;br/&gt;development of private financial markets in those countries where the shocks were&lt;br/&gt;worst. Yet, to understand the political economy of institutional change, it is necessary to&lt;br/&gt;know exactly what kinds of people were affected by the shocks and how that may&lt;br/&gt;have changed their preferences for one set or another of institutions. On another&lt;br/&gt;level, we suspect that older cohorts had a much more difficult time overcoming the&lt;br/&gt;adverse consequences of the shocks than did younger ones. Beyond the lost&lt;br/&gt;generations on the battlefield, WWI and WWII may also have destroyed a generation&lt;br/&gt;of savers. As such, studying the first half of the twentieth century may provide some&lt;br/&gt;important clues at to the persistent effects of very large shocks and thus be of&lt;br/&gt;relevance to present day concerns. Indeed  the impact on developing economies in Eastern Europe,Latin America, Africa and elsewhere of very large shocks that&lt;br/&gt;have had important effects on wealth accumulation can only be understood by turning to history.</AbstractNarration>
