<AbstractNarration>Earth's magnetosphere, which is a cavity formed by the interaction of the turbulent solar wind with the dipole magnetic field, is a key region of geospace involving a broad  range of interacting scales, a complex geometry and a rich variety of physical processes. The data from the ground and space based observatories have been used extensively to develop  data-derived models of the magnetosphere. The coherence  on the global scale, obtained in  terms of low dimensionality of its dynamics, and the consequent predictability of its  dynamics, has been instrumental in the development of initiatives for forecasting  space weather. The multi-scale properties, on the other hand, can not be predicted dynamically  and the methods of nonlinear dynamics and statistical physics have been combined to develop  comprehensive models that yield deterministic predictions of the global features  and  probabilistic predictions of its multi-scale aspects. The next challenge lies  in the development of the mathematical framework for these results, and requires a strong  collaborative efforts between geosciences and mathematics. The multi-scale properties  make the  fractional kinetic equations, which combines the dynamical and statistical approaches,  a natural choice as a mathematical framework for modeling the coupled solar wind - magnetosphere  system. The project will develop comprehensive models of multi-scale phenomena of the  magnetosphere by combining three approaches, viz., data derived modeling,  theory of fractional kinetics, and global MHD simulations. The combination of these three  approaches requires a close interdisciplinary collaboration of mathematicians and geoscientists,  and will be undertaken by research teams at  Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences and    University of Maryland. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will have broader impacts by providing a mathematical  framework  enabling improved forecasting of geospace disturbances. Such a framework is essential for improving the current forecasts of the  hazardous events in the near-Earth space. The geospace storms and substorms have serious impacts on modern technological systems such as communication satellites, power grids, human space flight, etc.  The improvement  of the current  capabilities for forcasting the conditions in the different regions of geospace, such as the ionosphere and the radiation belt,  is of  strategic importance to  national security.   Further, the development of mathematical framework for multiscale behavior of the geospace  will stimulate the understanding of the similar features in the atmosphere, and  potentially of the linkages between these two regions and how they are controlled by changes in  the solar activity.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
