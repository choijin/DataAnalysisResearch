<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0405729&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Anatoly S. Libgober&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal studies several topics in the topology of algebraic&lt;br/&gt;varieties and singularity theory.  The author plans to consider&lt;br/&gt;the vertex operator algebras attached to possibly singular&lt;br/&gt;algebraic varieties.  Vertex operator algebras were attached to&lt;br/&gt;non singular varieties by Malikov, Schechtman and Vaintrob and to&lt;br/&gt;orbifolds by Frenkel and Szczesny. L.Borisov and author's work on&lt;br/&gt;elliptic genera suggests that one may expect such algebras for&lt;br/&gt;varieties with Gorenstein log terminal singularities. These&lt;br/&gt;vertex operator algebras will provide new invariants of algebraic&lt;br/&gt;varieties which role should be investigated. These new algebras&lt;br/&gt;should provide further clarification of McKay correspondence&lt;br/&gt;between the group actions and singularities. The author plans to&lt;br/&gt;study new Chern class type invariants for singular varieties&lt;br/&gt;which are suggested by the joint work with L.Borisov.  Secondly,&lt;br/&gt;the author works on finding connections between the conformal&lt;br/&gt;field theory and others approaches to mirror symmetry and, as&lt;br/&gt;part of this, he plans to study the relationship between elliptic&lt;br/&gt;genera and other invariants of vertex operatror algebras attached&lt;br/&gt;to manifolds and homological mirror symmetry.  Thirdly the author&lt;br/&gt;proposes to study connection between the elliptic genera and&lt;br/&gt;isolated singularities and possible applications to Herling's&lt;br/&gt;conjecture on properties of spectra of isolated singularities.&lt;br/&gt;Final part deals with problems about the topology of the&lt;br/&gt;complements, the Alexander type invariants introduced by the&lt;br/&gt;author and the connections with the invariants introduced in&lt;br/&gt;previous parts of the proposal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Work on this project will clarify new mathematical structures&lt;br/&gt;which appeared recently in theoretical physics and in particular&lt;br/&gt;in string theory. It fits into ongoing process of restructuring&lt;br/&gt;the scope of mathematical problems and methods for their&lt;br/&gt;solutions.  The puropose of this research is to find applications&lt;br/&gt;of the new structures which emerged in theoretical physics to a&lt;br/&gt;wider range of previously unsolved problems and to expand&lt;br/&gt;connections between mathematics and physics. It will bring new&lt;br/&gt;methods into areas of mathematics such as singularity theory&lt;br/&gt;which already proved to be important link between theoretical&lt;br/&gt;mathematics and science and engineering.  Work on this project&lt;br/&gt;will help to upgrade the instructions at UIC on graduate and&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate level to the level fully representing frontiers of&lt;br/&gt;contemporary mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
