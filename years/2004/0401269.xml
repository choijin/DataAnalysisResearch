<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;0401269&lt;br/&gt;Toulouse&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All-optical functions are expected to become increasingly important in future communication networks. Recent developments in optical fibers, specifically the development of highly nonlinear silica fibers using a small size core as well as the new microstructured fibers (MF), have made the nonlinear optical fiber a top candidate for the realistic implementation of the above mentioned all-optical functionalities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project the PI will study several nonlinear optical effects in microstructured fibers and demonstrate their application to the functionalities required by an All-Optical Network. The originality and scientific merit of the proposal is that it combines a study of basic optical phenomena in microstructured fibers with the demonstration of network functionalities. Several types of microstructured fibers are being developed and studied, each geometry being designed to enhance a certain nonlinear optical property. In particular, the PI will focus on stimulated Raman scattering, which offers several advantages for applications in an all-optical network, such as wavelength conversion, ultrafast optical sampling and possibly also data regeneration. &lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will have several broader impacts.  The first one is the expansion of the knowledge base that underlies existing optical technologies.  A second one is the application of technologies that, so far, were primarily used in optical communications, to other areas such as sensing, bio or medical applications.  The new Lehigh Center for Optical Technologies will also greatly help with the dissemination of information and knowledge generated by the project and facilitate cross-fertilization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
