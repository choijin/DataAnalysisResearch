<AbstractNarration>0448840&lt;br/&gt;Lazar&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Providing a comprehensive description of all protein components in a cell present during the various stages of the cell lifecycle is currently a major challenge. The primary goals of this career development plan are to address the fundamental technological limitations that prevent fast proteomic investigations, to resolve the difficulties that impede the implementation of microfluidic devices with mass spectrometric detection, and to demonstrate the applicability of these devices for the analysis of complex biological samples. The development of microfluidic devices with mass spectrometric detection (MS) detection for the handling of a large variety of bioanalytical processes will be pursued.  Microfabrication offers process integration, high-speed analysis, multiplexing, automation, and high-throughput processing of small sample amounts. The specific objectives are: (1) to develop stand-alone microfluidic platforms that comprise the functional elements necessary to perform essential sample processing steps prior to MS detection; (2) to implement an entire bio-analytical processing scheme on the chip and to design architectures with a multiplexed configuration that enable high-throughput analysis; and (3) to demonstrate the effectiveness of the novel microfluidic platform for the proteomic characterization of complex cellular extracts.  This work should lead to the development of unique micro-analytical systems and detection strategies with broad applicability in the areas of biomedical research, medicine, agriculture, biodefense, and other areas that benefit from proteomic investigations. Additionally, the interdisciplinary training of students will occur, and the research will be integrated into the development of a new course and a textbook.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
