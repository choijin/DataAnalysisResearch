<AbstractNarration>The aim of this project is to understand how biological organisms process signals and how such&lt;br/&gt;an understanding might impinge on the future development of man-made devices.&lt;br/&gt;We normally associate computation with man-made devices, particularly the ubiquitous digital&lt;br/&gt;computer or the lesser-known analog computer. However there are computational devices much&lt;br/&gt;closer to home. All biological organisms are exposed almost continuously to a huge variety of&lt;br/&gt;environmental changes and shocks. In order to survive such changes, living organisms have&lt;br/&gt;evolved sensor proteins located on the outer surface of the organism which can detect all manner&lt;br/&gt;of environmental changes. These sensor proteins are in turn connected to so-called signaling&lt;br/&gt;networks composed of interacting proteins inside the cell. These signaling networks are&lt;br/&gt;responsible to making an appropriate decision based on all the sensory inputs. What is not well&lt;br/&gt;understood at this stage is the type of decision processing that is carried out by these networks. In&lt;br/&gt;man made devices we employ a variety of techniques from digital computers to analog devices&lt;br/&gt;to control our machines. Over the last fifty years or so, the design of sophisticated man-made&lt;br/&gt;control devices has matured to the extent that almost all devices now have some kind of control&lt;br/&gt;systems built into them. The reason why we are so good at designing artificial control systems is&lt;br/&gt;that we have a thorough grasp of the underlying theoretical principles of control. The primary&lt;br/&gt;technology that we used to build control devices is based on electronics. Walk into any book&lt;br/&gt;store and one will find books on electronic design.&lt;br/&gt;In relation to biological control systems we do not have the equivalent of an electronics design&lt;br/&gt;handbook. As a result we understand very little about how biological control systems work, how&lt;br/&gt;they carry out decisions and what the underlying principles of biological control are. Our&lt;br/&gt;approach is to evolve on digital computers, artificial biological signaling networks. Depending&lt;br/&gt;on what task the network is designed to perform, we evolve networks which will come closest to&lt;br/&gt;achieving this objective. Examples include evolving a network which can be robust to sudden&lt;br/&gt;changes in the environment, or conversely evolving networks which can quickly respond to&lt;br/&gt;environmental changes. In addition other objectives will include common signal processing&lt;br/&gt;techniques employed in electronics, for example we might evolve a network that can oscillate or&lt;br/&gt;a network that can carry out some arithmetic. By these means we will generate biological like&lt;br/&gt;networks which will have the capacity to carry out all the common electronic signal processing&lt;br/&gt;tasks. The end results will be a large library of networks. From this library we will then reverse&lt;br/&gt;engineer the networks to understand how they accomplish their evolved tasks. Finally we will&lt;br/&gt;compare these networks to real biological networks to see if we can find equivalent 'designs'.&lt;br/&gt;The ultimate goal is to write the 'electronics' design manual of biological signaling control&lt;br/&gt;networks.&lt;br/&gt;The work we propose in this application impinges on many areas of science. It combines work&lt;br/&gt;from molecular biology, computer science, control theory, evolutionary algorithms, signal&lt;br/&gt;processing and electrical circuit theory.&lt;br/&gt;The engineering sciences will benefit from this work by being able to examine examples of&lt;br/&gt;signal processing carried out at the molecular level and the biological sciences will benefit by an&lt;br/&gt;understanding of the underlying control principles of real biological networks. In addition,&lt;br/&gt;molecular based circuitry has to deal with noise (which is dealt with extensively in the&lt;br/&gt;engineering sciences), this work may have an important bearing on the implementation of&lt;br/&gt;nanotechnology based control systems.</AbstractNarration>
