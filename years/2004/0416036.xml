    <AbstractNarration>This project continues MSU's collaboration in information assurance education with Jackson State University and initiates a similar collaboration with Tuskegee University (TU and JSU are both HBCU's) though a collaborative and cooperative effort. The project supports integration of an information assurance instructional capability into the two institutions identified and strengthens the CAE/IAE program at MSU. Additionally, a partnership is in place for Forensics support with Mississippi's State Attorney General's Office, which expands with support from this grant. This project continues work to develop an IA curriculum at both JSU and TU with an expectation of JSU considering application for CAE/IAE status during academic year 2004-2005 and TU during 2005-2006. Both TU and JSU have agreed to work with MSU in developing information assurance offerings and their respective PI's have established relationships with the faculty at MSU. The partnership efforts described in this proposal are intended to be beneficial to all three parties in not only developing an IA program at two universities that currently do not have one, but also in strengthening the program at MSU by broadening its research effort, increasing minority representation in its PhD program, and by enhancing its instructional course content.</AbstractNarration>
