<AbstractNarration>This is the second stage of a project to develop tabletop laboratories with single photons for undergraduates. The aim is to enhance the teaching of quantum mechanics by exposing students to laboratory experiences that illustrate topics of quantum mechanics that are otherwise theoretical and abstract. In a previous NSF-funded program, the investigators demonstrated that experiments with single photons provide a means to understand fundamental quantum mechanical concepts. They also found that the experiments go well beyond these objectives because the experimental results underscore very fundamental issues about quantum mechanics, such as complementarity, entanglement and nonlocality. They are expanding the set of experiments that were originally planned to include experiments with entangled states. Students are developing these experiments as part of either curricular research projects (juniors and seniors) or summer research (all undergraduate levels). These experiments with single photons have the potential of becoming part of every physics department's upper-level undergraduate laboratory. The Investigators are increasing efforts to disseminate their knowledge and experience by building a prototype that can be transported to remote locations for demonstration and dissemination and by organizing workshops. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A second component of the program involves creation of a set of laboratories for an upper-level undergraduate course on quantum mechanics and testing it at Colgate University. The set of laboratory experiences illustrates topics such as the difference between probability and probability amplitude, state-vector algebra, basis change, state projection, superposition of states, and quantum interference. They are evaluating and analyzing the impact of such an experience on the learning of quantum mechanics. They are inserting a chapter on this topic, with a corresponding laboratory component, into a course on Modern Introductory Physics taught mainly to first-year students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program is providing new tools to teach quantum mechanics through both independent upper-level research projects or as part of a formal course. The new set of experiments is expected to: 1) motivate a revision in the way quantum mechanics is taught and inspire other physics program to consider introducing photon experiments into their curriculum, 2) lead to further development and enhancement of this educational tool through the generation of new experiments and their adaptation to institutional environments where affordability and simplicity are primary concerns, and 3) expose students to the principles of quantum mechanics providing better understanding of new advances in quantum information.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
