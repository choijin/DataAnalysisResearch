<AbstractNarration>Studies in Computational Complexity Theory: Project Summary&lt;br/&gt;Computational complexity theory focuses on understanding capabilities of resource bounded computations.&lt;br/&gt;Computations are broadly classi.ed as uniform computations (Turing machine based)&lt;br/&gt;and non-uniform computations (circuit based). Typical resources studied are time steps and memory&lt;br/&gt;space for uniform computations, and circuit size and depth for non-uniform computations. By&lt;br/&gt;limiting various resource requirements of computations to certain robust bounds we get complexity&lt;br/&gt;classes, which are the fundamental objects of study in complexity theory. Research in complexity&lt;br/&gt;theory broadly centers around two themes (1) proving relations, in the form of inclusions and separations,&lt;br/&gt;among various complexity classes (2) quantifying the di.culty/easiness of solving real-life&lt;br/&gt;computational problems using a computer. These two themes are interconnected by the notions&lt;br/&gt;of completeness and reductions. The overall goal of this proposal is to advance computational&lt;br/&gt;complexity theory along these two themes. The overall goal will be accomplished through three&lt;br/&gt;related objectives:&lt;br/&gt;Objective 1: Investigate interrelations among uniformity, nonuniformity, and derandomization.&lt;br/&gt;The PI will investigate a number of issues in uniform vs non-uniform computations and&lt;br/&gt;their relation to derandomization. Speci.cally, the PI will investigate uniform derandomization&lt;br/&gt;of Arthur-Merlin games, some related non-uniformity questions including uniform upper&lt;br/&gt;bounds for languages with high circuit complexity, and certain cover-based approach to resource&lt;br/&gt;bounded measure with applications to lower complexity classes and derandomization.&lt;br/&gt;Objective 2: Investigate computational problems with intermediate complexity. The PI will&lt;br/&gt;continue his investigation of problems that are intermediate between P and NP-complete such&lt;br/&gt;as Graph Isomorphism problem and some computational group-theoretic problems. A number&lt;br/&gt;of questions related to lowness properties of these problems will be investigated. E.cient&lt;br/&gt;program checkers for a host of computational group-theoretic problems will be designed.&lt;br/&gt;Objective 3: Explore the interconnections between complexity theory and computational&lt;br/&gt;learning theory. The PI will explore interconnections between complexity theory and learning&lt;br/&gt;theory. In particular, the PI will investigate learning problems such as learning DNFs and&lt;br/&gt;Boolean Circuits in the Teaching Assistant model, and the applications of learning algorithms&lt;br/&gt;to complexity theory.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The proposed research activity will have several broader impacts. Complexity&lt;br/&gt;theory indirectly impacts many areas of computer science. Thus proposed research has potential to&lt;br/&gt;scienti.cally impact these areas. Research results from this grant will be published in peer-reviewed&lt;br/&gt;journals and will be presented in international conferences, thus enabling broad dissemination of the&lt;br/&gt;the results to enhance scienti.c understanding. New courses will be created and taught along the&lt;br/&gt;theme of this project, thus integrating teaching and research. The grant will also be used for various&lt;br/&gt;human resource development activities such as supporting and mentoring graduate students, and&lt;br/&gt;inviting visitors.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Progress made in complexity theory is essential for furthering the knowledge&lt;br/&gt;of what can and cannot be solved by a computer using reasonable amount of resources. The results&lt;br/&gt;from this proposal will extend our knowledge of complexity theory in several directions. Research&lt;br/&gt;in derandomization and non-uniformity will solve some signi.cant open problems in the area and&lt;br/&gt;will contribute to better understand the role of randomness in computation. Part of the proposed&lt;br/&gt;research directly relates to important real-life problems such as Graph Isomorphism problem and&lt;br/&gt;DNF learning problem and has potential to become practically applicable. The research on program&lt;br/&gt;checkers is expected to have some practical applications.</AbstractNarration>
