<AbstractNarration>National Science Foundation&lt;br/&gt;Network Technologies and Systems (NeTS)&lt;br/&gt;CISE/CNS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Review Analysis and Recommendation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 0435328&lt;br/&gt;PI:          Suresh Singh &lt;br/&gt;Institution:          Portland State University&lt;br/&gt;Title: Strategies to Save Energy in the Internet &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal makes a case for using sleeping as a way to reduce the energy consumption of internet devices. The benefits of doing so include, reducing energy needs which will promote a more global deployment of the internet, making the internet more reliable in the presence of unreliable power supply, and enabling disaster-hit portions of the internet to continue functioning for longer periods on the available UPS power (Uninterruptable Power Supply).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The approach for reducing the energy consumption proposed here is to use packet-level information to put hardware components within switches and routers to sleep. The focus is on energy-conservation within the context of an organization's Autonomous System (AS) which provides many energy-saving opportunities. The research challenges include developing algorithms for sleeping, maintaining network-level QoS (Quality of Service) despite sleeping, and analyzing the impact of sleeping on current internet protocols.&lt;br/&gt;The methodology used to study these problems will rely on measurements, simulation, and prototyping.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The impact of this work will be to reduce the energy consumption by internet devices nationwide by between 35% - 55%.  In addition, the new technology will enable American manufacturers of internet equipment to expand their market abroad where energy costs a far more than in the US.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The expected results of this work include specific sleeping algorithms that can be directly employed in future internet devices, a prototype device that demonstrates the key concepts, and research papers published in major venues for internet related research.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
