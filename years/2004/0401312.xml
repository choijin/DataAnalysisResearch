<AbstractNarration>Steel will work on the problem of constructing canonical inner models&lt;br/&gt;for large cardinal hypotheses, and on related problems in pure descriptive&lt;br/&gt;set theory. One very well known and central problem in this area is&lt;br/&gt;whether the Proper Forcing Axiom is equiconsistent with the existence of a&lt;br/&gt;supercompact cardinal. A solution to this problem is probably still far&lt;br/&gt;off, but Steel has recently made some progress using the powerful and&lt;br/&gt;flexible ``core model induction" method. He intends to pursue and develop&lt;br/&gt;this method further, as it applies to the Proper Forcing Axiom, and in&lt;br/&gt;several other contexts as well. This program leads naturally to a number&lt;br/&gt;of questions concerning the relationship between canonical inner models&lt;br/&gt;with Woodin cardinals and the derived models of the Axiom of Determinacy&lt;br/&gt;which are associated to them. Steel has some results on this connection,&lt;br/&gt;and plans to investigate the area further.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Much of set theory is motivated by the simple question&lt;br/&gt;``What are the proper axioms for mathematics?".&lt;br/&gt;Mathematicians&lt;br/&gt;prove things for a living; what should they take as their&lt;br/&gt;common assumptions in these proofs? In the period 1905-1927, Russell,&lt;br/&gt;Zermelo, Fraenkel, and Skolem&lt;br/&gt;isolated an elegant list of basic statements about sets, expressed&lt;br/&gt;in the language of set theory, and showed that from these axioms&lt;br/&gt;one could derive all of the mathematics of the time. This system of&lt;br/&gt;axioms is now known as Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory with Choice,&lt;br/&gt;or ZFC. While there is still no hint of a mathematical statement which&lt;br/&gt;cannot be expressed in the language of set theory, we have&lt;br/&gt;discovered that  ZFC is incomplete in important ways. A&lt;br/&gt;surprising number of quite basic questions about sets in general&lt;br/&gt;are not decided by the axioms of ZFC; moreover, many of the&lt;br/&gt;more abstract questions of analysis, algebra, and topology are&lt;br/&gt;similarly left undecided. This leads to Godel's Program, first formulated&lt;br/&gt;by Kurt Godel in the late 1940's:&lt;br/&gt;Decide&lt;br/&gt;mathematically interesting questions&lt;br/&gt;which are independent of ZFC in well-justified extensions of&lt;br/&gt;ZFC. There have been great successes in this direction obtained&lt;br/&gt;by adding ``large cardinal hypotheses" to ZFC.&lt;br/&gt;Such hypotheses&lt;br/&gt;assert the existence of sets whose  cardinality, or size, is&lt;br/&gt;inaccessible from below in ever stronger senses. Possibly our deepest&lt;br/&gt;understanding of large cardinal hypotheses&lt;br/&gt;comes from the inner model program. This program attempts to&lt;br/&gt;associate to each large cardinal hypothesis H a canonical minimal&lt;br/&gt;universe of sets (or ``inner model") in which H is true. The stronger&lt;br/&gt;H is, the largere this universe must be.&lt;br/&gt;The inner models&lt;br/&gt;we have so far constructed have internal structures which&lt;br/&gt;admit a systematic, detailed analysis, a  ``fine structure theory"&lt;br/&gt;which  gives us a very good idea as to what these universes&lt;br/&gt;look like. Inner models are  crucial in several&lt;br/&gt;basic uses of large cardinal hypotheses to settle questions&lt;br/&gt;left undecided by ZFC. Steel will focus his efforts on furthering&lt;br/&gt;the inner model program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
