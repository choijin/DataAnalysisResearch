<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0400940&lt;br/&gt;Title: Research in Schroedinger operators&lt;br/&gt;PI: Dirk Hundertmark (University of Illinois)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI proposes research in three areas in the&lt;br/&gt;spectral theory of Schr"odinger operators.&lt;br/&gt;Firstly, the PI will continue work on bounds for eigenvalue moments of&lt;br/&gt;single-particle Schr"odinger operators, the Lieb-Thirring inequalities.&lt;br/&gt;Lieb-Thirring inequalities are known to be an indispensable tool in the&lt;br/&gt;spectral theory of Schr"odinger operators, especially for the study of&lt;br/&gt;macroscopic Coulomb systems. Besides their original application, they&lt;br/&gt;have proven to be useful in other fields, for example, in non-linear PDE.&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the proposal is twofold: to achieve a&lt;br/&gt;good understanding of the scalar case for small moments and low&lt;br/&gt;dimensions, and to develop a general method to lift bounds from the&lt;br/&gt;scalar case to operator-valued potentials. In this way, estimates in&lt;br/&gt;low dimension would have immediate consequences for bounds in higher&lt;br/&gt;dimensions.&lt;br/&gt;Secondly, the author plans to study Wegner estimates for the integrated&lt;br/&gt;density of states for singular random potentials. These are important&lt;br/&gt;a-priori estimates in the spectral theory of random Schr"odinger operators.&lt;br/&gt;The third problem focuses on spectral properties of a non self-adjoint&lt;br/&gt;matrix Schr"odinger operator, given by the linearization of NLS around&lt;br/&gt;solitons. In particular, the question of embedded eigenvalues will be studied.&lt;br/&gt;These results should lead to a better understanding of asymptotic completeness&lt;br/&gt;for focusing NLS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The proposed projects aim at some basic questions in&lt;br/&gt;mathematical physics, more precisely, the rigorous study of non-relativistic quantum&lt;br/&gt;mechanics. Recent results on Lieb-Thirring inequalities have revived the general&lt;br/&gt;interest in this field and have proven useful in other areas of mathematical physics.&lt;br/&gt;It is expected that they will continue to do so. One aim of this proposal is to&lt;br/&gt;find new tools to establish these kind of inequalities.&lt;br/&gt;Random Schr"odinger operators model the behaviour of electrons in disordered&lt;br/&gt;matter. It is a fact from every day life that highly disordered materials are bad&lt;br/&gt;conductors. In the last two decades, our mathematical understanding of this and&lt;br/&gt;related effects has grown rapidly. But basically all models still have some unrealistic&lt;br/&gt;assumptions. An important a priori estimate for the spectral theory of random Schr"odinger&lt;br/&gt;operators are regularity results (i.e., smoothness) for the so-called density of states.&lt;br/&gt;Despite a lot of attention from several groups working in theory of random Schr"odinger&lt;br/&gt;operators, the regularity proofs are still mainly based on the old ideas of Wegner. They&lt;br/&gt;require strong nd mainly technical assumptions, excluding most physically relevant rough&lt;br/&gt;random potentials. Except for some very special cases, singular random potentials are still&lt;br/&gt;out of reach of the existing methods. So new ideas and, in particular, a better understand&lt;br/&gt;of the underlying physical mechanism will be required, in order to be able to establish the&lt;br/&gt;regularity results for rough random potentials.&lt;br/&gt;The third problem, embedded eigenvalues for a certain class of non self-adjoint matrix&lt;br/&gt;Schr"odinger operators, is motivated by the study of the non-linear Schr"odinger equation.&lt;br/&gt;By itself it is still a problem in linear functional analysis. However, with the twist that&lt;br/&gt;very a fine and detailed knowledge of the properties of this linearized operator is needed&lt;br/&gt;in order to improve the understanding of the long-time properties of solutions of the&lt;br/&gt;non-linear Schr"odinger equation.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
