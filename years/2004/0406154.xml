<AbstractNarration>Research&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pollution of water can negatively affect the use of water for drinking, household needs, recreation, fishing, transportation and commerce.  The events of 9/11 have redefined the concept of risk and uncertainty, and water security is of national importance.  In order to prepare for catastrophic events, water utilities need to detect and minimize the risk of malicious water contamination in distributed water networks.  Integration of adequate numbers of sensors at appropriate places in water distribution networks can provide an early detection system where appropriate control measures can be taken to minimize the risk.  The focus of this project is to include estimates of risk, uncertainties in the problems of finding optimal sensor placement and quality control of water networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The problem will be posed as a two-stage mixed integer stochastic programming problem.  Customized and efficient algorithms will be developed in order to address real world problems.  The methodology will be assessed for applicability to large scale problems related to water security and its possible extension to other infrastructure security problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broad Impact&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besides the obvious importance to homeland security, the project will also benefit women as the PI plans to target them for participation in the research.  The PI is a faculty advisor for the Society of Women Engineers (SWE) and a mentor in the Women in Science and Engineering (WISE) program.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
