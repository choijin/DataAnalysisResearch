<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research activity focuses on innovative concepts and technologies in the interdisciplinary areas of&lt;br/&gt;electromagnetic theory, communication theory, and radio frequency microelectromechanical systems (RF MEMS).&lt;br/&gt;This project will enable the design, the analysis, the fabrication, and the testing of multifunctional reconfigurable&lt;br/&gt;antennas operated in conjunction with adaptive space-time processing algorithms for use in novel wireless&lt;br/&gt;communication systems. In particular, man-portable or vehicle mounted integrated adaptive multi-input multi-&lt;br/&gt;output (MIMO) microsystems used in environments with rapidly changing multipath conditions are targeted. The&lt;br/&gt;goal is to effectively exploit the theoretical gains in capacity and diversity offered by multiple reconfigurable&lt;br/&gt;antennas in order to minimize the gap between theory and practice. To accomplish this goal, the antenna array&lt;br/&gt;properties (i.e. radiation pattern, the polarization, the operation frequency, and the input impedance) and adaptive&lt;br/&gt;transmission signaling schemes are jointly optimized to adapt to the changing channel conditions. This joint&lt;br/&gt;optimization procedure requires reconfigurable antenna elements capable of changing their properties and an&lt;br/&gt;adaptive algorithm that uses the interrelationships among antenna properties, transmission signaling schemes, and&lt;br/&gt;propagation environment. Dynamic adaptation of the antenna properties is a recent UCI development representing a&lt;br/&gt;major advancement in antenna design. In parallel, algorithms that combine beamforming and space-time coding to&lt;br/&gt;use partial channel information at the transmitter have also recently been developed. The innovative technology,&lt;br/&gt;which will be used to construct the reconfigurable antenna arrays, is a novel RF MEMS fabrication technology&lt;br/&gt;developed in our group by a DARPA program. This technology is compatible with microwave laminate substrates&lt;br/&gt;allowing monolithic integration of MEMS with antenna elements on a printed circuit board. Due to its monolithic&lt;br/&gt;integration capability, MEMS becomes a physical part of the antenna geometry, which is the key in achieving high&lt;br/&gt;degree of multifunctionality and structural reconfigurability. The project is organized under the following main&lt;br/&gt;steps:&lt;br/&gt;1. Design, analyze, fabricate, and test a new class of antennas providing multifunctionality and&lt;br/&gt;reconfigurability in polarization, radiation pattern, operating frequency, and array configuration.&lt;br/&gt;2. Develop adaptive coding and signal processing schemes to take advantage of changing channel&lt;br/&gt;environments.&lt;br/&gt;3. Determine the links among antenna array properties, transmission signaling schemes (space-time coding,&lt;br/&gt;spatial multiplexing, and beamforming), and propagation environment (scattering density, disposition of&lt;br/&gt;the scatterers).&lt;br/&gt;4. Experimental investigation of the MIMO system established based on Steps 1, 2, and 3.&lt;br/&gt;5. Based on Steps 1, 2, 3, and 4 develop an adaptation algorithm through which Steps 1, 2, and 3 are&lt;br/&gt;integrated together in order to maximize the resources available in MIMO channel at all times.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:&lt;br/&gt;The multifunctional reconfigurable antenna concept in the proposed work surpasses the capabilities of and has a&lt;br/&gt;distinct difference with smart or adaptive antennas. In the literature, a smart or adaptive antenna refers to an antenna&lt;br/&gt;array of elements with no intelligence combined with signal-processing capability through which the time domain&lt;br/&gt;signals from or to the individual antenna elements are weighted and combined to optimize the radiation pattern in&lt;br/&gt;response to the signal environment. On the other hand, a reconfigurable antenna array consists of antenna elements&lt;br/&gt;each of which has some intelligence. This intelligence stems from the ability of reconfiguring the physical structure&lt;br/&gt;of individual elements through which polarization, radiation and frequency properties of the array are changed.&lt;br/&gt;Thus, the elements in the reconfigurable antenna array have the ability to intelligently process the signals in spectral&lt;br/&gt;and angular domains adding to the already present time domain processing of the system. Due to the fundamental&lt;br/&gt;difference between smart antenna array, i.e. phased array, and a reconfigurable array, the theory describing the&lt;br/&gt;behavior of the reconfigurable antenna arrays will be developed under this project. This will introduce a new section&lt;br/&gt;in the chapter of antennas and propagation in electromagnetics textbooks. There is also a need to develop the signal&lt;br/&gt;processing and communication theory that can benefit from this new class of antennas. Furthermore the integrated&lt;br/&gt;interdisciplinary research philosophy adopted throughout this project will allow the PIs to develop and offer&lt;br/&gt;interdisciplinary educational programs in the fields of electromagnetics, communications, and MEMS that will&lt;br/&gt;answer the need for the new generation of engineers (in particular among minority students) at UCI who can deal&lt;br/&gt;with and provide solutions to the emerging multifunctional micro-communication-systems.</AbstractNarration>
