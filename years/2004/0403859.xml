<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to manufacture boron nitride (BN) and boron carbon nitride (BCN) nanostructures on a large scale in high yield and with high monodispersity in size (diameter), composition, and alignment using a simple set of experimental protocols. The goal is to generate large-scale quantities of BN and BCN nanostructures by using traditional inorganic chemistry principles to rationally develop appropriate synthetic strategies. The approach is to develop (a) novel substrates to spatially constrain the reaction process and to induce monodispersity; (b) novel, tunable catalysts; and (c) readily processable boron-rich organometallic and polymer-derived precursors. Chemical vapor deposition techniques using a two-stage furnace system will employed for the manufacturing processes as these are appropriate for the rapid and high-throughput screening of the proposed catalysts, substrates and precursors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research is of high societal benefit because of the importance of BN and BCN nanostructures for the practical development of high-strength lightweight materials, field emitters, photoluminescent devices, thermally stable lubricants, and microwave and infrared-transparent materials. Moreover, these materials possess industrially useful gas storage and catalytic capabilities. Generated research results will be channeled into an existing graduate-level surface science course, that already highlights cutting edge research from the Department of Energy's Brookhaven National Laboratory scientists. Most importantly, this project will inspire the creation of an interdisciplinary joint Stony Brook - BNL Nanoscience Sunday, open to the general public, which will involve not only leading nanoscale researchers but also graduate, undergraduate, community college, and high-school participants from the local community. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
