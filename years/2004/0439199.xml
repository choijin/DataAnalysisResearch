<AbstractNarration>This project involves a combination of experimental research and numerical simulation with the objectives of understanding heteroepitaxial materials integration using oxide-supported compos-ite substrates, and of identifying novel routes for materials processing using the strain-fields of self-assembled nanostructures. The proposed work is motivated by recent results on the forma-tion of Ge quantum dot (QD) islands on ultrathin silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrates. For growth of pyramidal 'hut' islands, a previously unknown local strain relaxation process was found that involves the nanoscale stressor as well as the thin substrate, and results in a pro-nounced buckling of the Si substrate slab. This result suggests a novel route for comprehensive characterization of the incoherent c-Si/a-SiO2 interface in SOI and related composite structures. These studies strive to determine the mechanism by which this interface responds to applied stress, and the temperature-dependent kinetic parameters that govern and limit the response. &lt;br/&gt;%%%  &lt;br/&gt;The project addresses fundamental research issues in a topical area of electronic/photonic materi-als science having technological relevance. An important feature of the project is the strong em-phasis on education, and the integration of research and education. The proposed project offers outstanding research and training opportunities for students at all levels. It will involve participa-tion of undergraduates, and promote the integration of minorities, particularly female students, into science and technology. Planned outreach activities focus on networking with local middle- and high schools and aim at sparking the interest of the younger generation. &lt;br/&gt;***     &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
