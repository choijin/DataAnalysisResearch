<AbstractNarration>This project addresses etching and decomposition reaction pathways of beta-diketones on copper, aluminum oxide, NiFe, and tungsten surfaces. Etching metals with beta-diketones is relevant to metal layer removal and for wafer and chamber cleaning in the electronics industry, as well as other potential applications such as redispersion of agglomerated, inactive catalyst particles. Some of the beta-diketones are friendlier to the environment than currently used halogenated etchants. Additionally, lower temperatures and pressures than in current processes are used, which decreases migration and diffusion between microelectronics layers. Copper is used in semiconductor integrated circuits and in magnetic recording heads, and copper must be etched as well as deposited in the fabrication of these products. It has been proposed that a detrimental polymer forms when hexafluoropentanedione decomposes on copper; understanding the polymer formation mechanism is also part of this project, so that it can be avoided or minimized. The polymer structure and formation mechanism will be studied using Auger electron spectroscopy, temperature-programmed desorption spectroscopy, and reflection/absorption infrared spectroscopy to determine the polymer bonding and composition. &lt;br/&gt;%%% &lt;br/&gt;The project addresses fundamental research issues associated with electronic/photonic materials having technological relevance. Basic understanding and technological advances in etching processes are beneficial to electronics/photonics, and to the environment. The project effectively integrates research and education, and creates an opportunity for the training of graduate and undergraduate students in materials science areas where there is an established need for a highly trained workforce. Part of the students' training will be participation in a Materials Research Group (MRG), an interdisciplinary group formed to allow graduate students to present their work and to inform other professors of research going on in other departments. The PI is one of seven professors from four participating departments: Chemical Engineering, Chemistry and Biochemistry, Mechanical Engineering, and Physics and Engineering Physics. A goal of the group is to encourage collaboration between the professors. The Materials Research Group collectively works toward broad based, interdisciplinary education and training by exposing students to other disciplinary research and by providing them the opportunity to practice public speaking.&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>
