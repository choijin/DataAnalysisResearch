<AbstractNarration>Proposal 0416731&lt;br/&gt;Vascular Pattern Formation in Leaves of Arabidopsis &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks to understand the progressive building of vein networks during the development of plant leaves. A hierarchy of primary, secondary and higher order veins appears during the formation of a leaf. This provides landmarks that position other types of cells that carry out photosynthesis, gas exchange, sugar transport and other functions with an essential relationship to the vein system.  The vein pattern of a particular species is not fixed, and it can be optimized to the requirements of the environment to provide greater photosynthetic or water efficiency when needed. This project has used genetics and molecular biology to identify several dozen genes and gene products with potential roles in the vein patterning process. The current project will follow through on understanding the roles of the products of these key genes, some of which are members of biochemical pathways for signaling within or between cells (e.g., sterols). What are the targets of these signals, and what triggers them at the right time and place to form continuous files of vein cells? The project will identify the immediate triggers and targets for these signals, using the currently identified gene products to find the unknown ones, and to bootstrap along to additional partners. The scientific impact of this will be to increase the understanding of venation formation, providing potential tools for modifying the adaptation of plants to different environments or the efficiency of plant growth. The broader impact of the project is that it serves as a training vehicle for graduate students and postdoctoral scientists, and as a source of materials for the PI's teaching to undergraduate and graduate students. The PI is active in teaching biology to non-science undergraduates, many of whom have an interest in working on science policy and science &amp; society issues.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
