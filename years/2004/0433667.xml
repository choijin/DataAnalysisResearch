<AbstractNarration>Recognizing the need for more certified high school mathematics and science teachers, the University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA) launched the UTeach Program in August 2003.  Funding through the Noyce scholarship program continues and enhances this program.  The Noyce component of UTeach provides 30 undergraduate Noyce scholarships and 12 Noyce Stipends (scholarships to post-baccalaureate professionals returning for teacher certification).  The goals of the project are to (1) increase the number of mathematics and science teachers certified for middle and high school teaching, and (2) to prepare these teachers for the reality of inner-city schools through a substantive partnership with area school districts.  A central feature of UTeach is the on-going contact from the very first semester of the freshman year with classroom teaching in participating high-need public schools.  Partnering public school classroom teachers work closely with UTSA faculty and mentor UTSA students who are pursuing a career in teaching.  The classroom teachers are called UTeach Fellows to indicate the critical role they play in the preparation of future teachers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The need for improved mathematics and science education is recognized in San Antonio through a wide array of stakeholders including five four-year universities, a four-campus community college system, the business community, and public leaders inserting math and science education into the city's economic development plan.  Through UTSA's UTeach Program, partnerships are already developed to prepare teachers within a citywide context, involving multiple high-need districts, business community input in support of local driver industries, area military installations, and city officials.  These Noyce scholarships improve the range of these efforts and target the training of individuals who are willing and prepared to serve districts where the need is greatest.  Best practices will be shared with local universities and colleges.  In keeping with the mission of UTSA (a designated Hispanic Serving Institution), historically underserved groups are being aggressively recruited to serve as STEM teachers in local schools. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
