<AbstractNarration>More than a half century ago, Sir Edward Bullard conjectured that the&lt;br/&gt;motions necessary to generate the Earth's magnetic field in the&lt;br/&gt;Earth's electrically-conducting fluid core might be driven by the&lt;br/&gt;luni-solar precession. All that has been unequivocally established&lt;br/&gt;in the intervening 55 years is that precession can in principle&lt;br/&gt;supply the geodynamo with abundant power. The question of whether&lt;br/&gt;it can draw on this power is still unanswered, and this provides&lt;br/&gt;the challenging target that is the basis of the intellectual merit of this&lt;br/&gt;proposal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Much has been learned during the last decade about the structure&lt;br/&gt;and stability of precessionally-driven flows, but only when&lt;br/&gt;magnetic fields are absent. In analogy with parallel studies of&lt;br/&gt;convectively-driven system studies, it is anticipated that the character&lt;br/&gt;and strength of a precessionally-driven flow will be dramatically&lt;br/&gt;different in the presence of a "sufficiently-strong" magnetic field&lt;br/&gt;meaning, in the geophysical context, a field of strength comparable&lt;br/&gt;with that inferred for the Earth's core. The proponents to investigate this&lt;br/&gt;matter as part of a systematic study of such magnetoprecessional&lt;br/&gt;dynamos", and also to see if they provide a new example of so-called&lt;br/&gt;strong field dynamo action".&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main theoretical tool to be used in the proposed research&lt;br/&gt;is a computer code that has been under development at UCLA for&lt;br/&gt;the past 18 months. It employs the grid point based "method of&lt;br/&gt;overlapping grids". This is very suitable for rotationally&lt;br/&gt;flattened bodies of fluid such as Earth's core. The method&lt;br/&gt;has been generalized here so that it solves the&lt;br/&gt;full magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) dynamo equations in 3 dimensions.&lt;br/&gt;The code is on the verge of completion and this proposal&lt;br/&gt;mainly seeks support to parallelize it and to improve&lt;br/&gt;its efficiency so that Bullard's proposal can be thoroughly evaluated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the completed code will exceed its&lt;br/&gt;application to precession. Without major modification, precessional&lt;br/&gt;driving can be replaced by buoyant forcing, so putting the model in&lt;br/&gt;competition with other codes currently under development for&lt;br/&gt;spherical convective dynamos. Without further change it could be&lt;br/&gt;used to study dynamos operating in rotationally flattened objects&lt;br/&gt;(Saturn, galactic discs,. . . ). The investigators plan to make&lt;br/&gt;these generalizations. It would also be possible to generalize&lt;br/&gt;to tidally distorted objects such as extra-solar planets.&lt;br/&gt;Even if Bullard's speculation has to be abandoned, it will be&lt;br/&gt;easy to investigate how a convectively-driven geodynamo is&lt;br/&gt;influenced by precession.</AbstractNarration>
