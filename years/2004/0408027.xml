<AbstractNarration>This award provides support for participants in an annual two-day workshop for advanced undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows in the Southeastern United States who are interested in pursuing careers in applied mathematics or related scientific fields.  The first three meetings will be held at the College of Charleston, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and the National Institute of Aerospace, an independent not-for-profit research and graduate educational institute that functions as a strategic partner of the NASA Langley Research Center.  The University of Central Florida will provide further attendance and organizational support, and it will facilitate contact with research institutes and scientific employers in the central Florida's High-Tech Corridor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The meetings will expose students to graduate and postgraduate research activity.  Each year, two keynote speakers will be selected from among faculty, scientific laboratories, and technical companies in the southeastern region.  Most speakers, however, will be advanced graduate students and postdoctoral fellows.  Poster sessions for undergraduate and graduate research projects are also planned.  The workshops will improve networking of young applied mathematicians with industry, laboratories, and universities in the Southeastern United States, helping to create a more inclusive and diverse community of young scientists and informing them of regional opportunities in scientific research, both academic and industry based.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
