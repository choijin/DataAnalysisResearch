<AbstractNarration>Mechanical Engineering (56)  The project is adapting and implementing The Learning Factory model developed at Pennsylvania State University, the University of Washington, and the University of Puerto Rico-Mayaguez by creating an on-demand fabrication laboratory to integrate design, manufacturing, and business curriculum. The project is integrating manufacturing topics and equipment within existing core curriculum courses in fluid mechanics and dynamics, solid mechanics, materials sciences, manufacturing processes, fracture mechanics, and computer aided manufacturing, rather than creating new courses. The project is providing appropriate hands-on experiences and practical applications related to important course topics. Syllabi are being coordinated between core classes in order to provide common laboratory experiences for students when they are concurrently enrolled in two or more core courses. Assessment of the project is being coordinated through an independent evaluator who has been part of the original Learning Factory team at Pennsylvania State College.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Haas CNC Machining Center and an EDM Die-sink Machine is being purchased with matching funds provided by the Department of Mechanical Engineering and the College of Engineering. The equipment is the foundation for expanding the laboratory infrastructure, which is providing the opportunity for complementary coverage of fundamental fabrication principles; providing senior design experiences that simulate real life-product development processes including manufacturing planning, fabrication, assembly and testing of functional products; providing the resource to integrate industry-based projects within undergraduate research; expanding the opportunity to offer programs to industry through the institute's Small Business Development Center; providing accessibility for the Society of Women Engineers to engage fifth graders in annual engineering workshops; and developing outreach programs and activities for K-12 STEM students.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
