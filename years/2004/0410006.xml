<AbstractNarration>AST-0410006&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CORF plays an essential role in defending the radio frequency interests of the U.S. scientific community before national and international organizations that deal with the allocation and efficient use of the radio spectrum.  A major CORF activity centers on participation in public pleadings before the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regarding allocation and assignment of radio frequencies and other regulatory matters.  During the past 3-years, covering the previous grant period, CORF filed comments before the FCC in matters related to the revision of rules governing radio frequency applications in the National Radio Quiet zone (NRQZ), uses of various frequency bands that were transferred from the Government to the private sector when such transfer had an impact on scientific uses of the spectrum, (e.g. at 4.9 GHz or 1427-1430 MHz), revision of the rules governing ultra wide-band (UWB) systems, and other matters.  During the coming 3-year period, CORF is expected to comment on the U.S. implementation of the results of WRC-03, U.S. proposals to WRC-06, the implementation of the interference temperature concept to quantify interference, to and the impact on radio astronomy of spurious emissions from transmitters on board of satellites, among others.  CORF is also expected to continue working with the FCC on issues related to millimeter wave spectrum use and to intensify contacts with the FCC commissioners and staff, in support of science activities.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
