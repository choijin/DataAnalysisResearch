    <AbstractNarration>The expressed goals of this proposal are to conduct a series of workshops. The first series of workshops will establish and disseminate visions of good research and methodology practice that address perceived weaknesses that appear in some educational research, and provide guidelines for the improvement of future educational research efforts. The second series of workshops addresses curricular issues in the development guidelines in support a national K-16 statistics curriculum. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator is the executive director of the American Statistical Association, would establish a series of workshops to bring together members of the research statistics community and the mathematics education research community. The expressed goal is to establish and disseminate criteria for high quality quantitative research in the sub-field of mathematics education and education more generally.</AbstractNarration>
