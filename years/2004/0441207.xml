<AbstractNarration>AGEP Post-doctoral Engineering Education Researchers (AGEP PEERs) &lt;br/&gt;Under the terms of Master Agreement No. 0239565 for unsolicited proposals, the National&lt;br/&gt;Academy of Sciences requests funds to support four (4) Alliances for Graduate Education&lt;br/&gt;and the Professoriate (AGEP) alumni per year over a three-year period as post-doctoral&lt;br/&gt;fellows in further preparation for their practice of engineering education research as faculty&lt;br/&gt;members at the Nation.s leading universities. These AGEP alumni will be referred to as&lt;br/&gt;AGEP Post-doctoral Engineering Education Researchers (AGEP PEERs) and will contribute &lt;br/&gt;to the production of faculty peers of unquestioned excellence in the multiple forms of &lt;br/&gt;scholarship required for faculty for the 21st Century. The work will be performed by the&lt;br/&gt;Center for the Advancement of Scholarship on Engineering Education of the National&lt;br/&gt;Academy of Engineering. The outcomes of this effort will be&lt;br/&gt;1. Identification and placement of 12 AGEP alumni at engineering education research&lt;br/&gt;centers for 12-month post-doctoral research experiences focused on engineering&lt;br/&gt;education with expectation of resulting publication.&lt;br/&gt;2. Attendance of an annual Fellows meeting by current and former AGEP PEERs to build&lt;br/&gt;community and leverage individual experiences.&lt;br/&gt;3. Attendance of up to 3 additional professional meetings by each AGEP PEER to establish&lt;br/&gt;a presence in their professional community.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt;This effort seeks to strengthen the human infrastructure and diversity of the professoriate by&lt;br/&gt;linking AGEP alumni with premier centers of engineering education research. This effort&lt;br/&gt;complements the disciplinary expertise AGEP fellows have developed within their doctoral&lt;br/&gt;program by building their skills in the scholarship of teaching and learning. Thus, this project&lt;br/&gt;advances the integration of research and education.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts &lt;br/&gt;Successful completion of this project will contribute to the establishment of a cadre of new&lt;br/&gt;minority faculty well prepared for excellence in both research and education. Their skills will&lt;br/&gt;serve to inspire their peers as well as new generations of scholars from all groups and&lt;br/&gt;populations. Additionally, greater awareness of the rigor and applicability of education research&lt;br/&gt;by engineering faculty will contribute to more inclusive definitions of faculty scholarship and a&lt;br/&gt;beneficial modification of engineering faculty tenure and promotion systems.</AbstractNarration>
