    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0405906&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Gregory J. Galloway&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent developments in gravitational theory, both theoretical and&lt;br/&gt;empirical, have lead to an increased interest in the study of&lt;br/&gt;asymptotically anti-de Sitter and asymptotically de Sitter&lt;br/&gt;spacetimes. In this project, techniques of Lorentzian and&lt;br/&gt;Riemannian geometry will be used to attack certain problems&lt;br/&gt;pertaining to such spacetimes, as well as some problems&lt;br/&gt;concerning new developments in the theory of black holes. One of&lt;br/&gt;the specific aims of this project is to continue development of&lt;br/&gt;an approach to establishing positivity of mass for asymptotically&lt;br/&gt;hyperbolic Riemannian manifolds (with spherical conformal&lt;br/&gt;infinity) which does not require spin assumption. This approach,&lt;br/&gt;which makes use of the brane action introduced by Witten and Yau&lt;br/&gt;in their work on the AdS/CFT correspondence, may also be useful&lt;br/&gt;in settling some positive mass conjectures for asymptotically&lt;br/&gt;anti-de Sitter spacetimes with toroidal topology at infinity. The&lt;br/&gt;PI also plans to continue investigations into uniqueness and&lt;br/&gt;rigidity phenomena, and the development of singularities in&lt;br/&gt;asymptotically de Sitter spacetimes. The classical definition of&lt;br/&gt;a black hole, though mathematically elegant, is problematic in&lt;br/&gt;practice (especially for numerical studies) in that it requires&lt;br/&gt;knowing the full future evolution of spacetime all the way to&lt;br/&gt;infinity. As an alternative, Ashtekar and Krishnan have&lt;br/&gt;introduced a new, fully nonlinear and dynamical, approach to the&lt;br/&gt;study of black holes, based on the quasi-local notion of a&lt;br/&gt;dynamical horizon. Another aim of this project is to investigate&lt;br/&gt;some open problems concerning the occurence, i.e., existence,&lt;br/&gt;uniqueness and position of dynamical horizons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Modern theories of gravity are geometrical in nature. The&lt;br/&gt;gravitational field and other fields, black holes and related&lt;br/&gt;objects, may be described and analyzed using geometric methods.&lt;br/&gt;In more general terms, this project is concerned with the study&lt;br/&gt;of certain features of gravity of current scientific interest&lt;br/&gt;from this geometric point of view, utilizing the tools of&lt;br/&gt;Riemannian geometry, a mathematical theory of space, and&lt;br/&gt;Lorentzian geometry, a mathematical theory of spacetime. These&lt;br/&gt;theories provide a method for studying the relationship among&lt;br/&gt;three fundamental aspects of the spacetime universe: curvature&lt;br/&gt;(i.e., the bending of space or spacetime), topology (i.e., the&lt;br/&gt;global shape and complexity of space or spacetime) and causal&lt;br/&gt;structure (i.e., the large scale behavior of light rays and&lt;br/&gt;light cones).</AbstractNarration>
