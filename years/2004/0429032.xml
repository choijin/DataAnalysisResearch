<AbstractNarration>We propose  to study charge transport and storage in ultra-thin, oxide-nitride-oxide (ONO) &lt;br/&gt;heteroinsulator  nanostructures,  which  find  application  in  high  density,  low-power,  low  voltage, &lt;br/&gt;nonvolatile  semiconductor  memories  (NVSMs).  In  particular,  we  will  examine  a  new  type  of &lt;br/&gt;SONOS device called a NROMTM structure, which is programmed with hot electron injection and &lt;br/&gt;is able to store 2 bits of information spatially isolated over source and drain regions of the device.  &lt;br/&gt;In addition, each of these bits has the possibility of multi-level storage opening the possibility for &lt;br/&gt;ultra-high density NVSMs. The study of device physics, the technology and potential applications &lt;br/&gt;of ultra-thin oxides are also relevant to the thrust into low-power CMOS circuits so our study will &lt;br/&gt;encompass experimental nanoscaled SONOS devices fabricated with fully-depleted silicon on &lt;br/&gt;insulator (FDSOI)  CMOS  technology. Characterization  of  traps  at  the  semiconductor-insulator-&lt;br/&gt;gate interfaces and in the bulk insulator is an essential factor in predicting the performance and &lt;br/&gt;reliability of nanoscaled semiconductor devices, such as SONOS NVSMs.  Our research program &lt;br/&gt;will investigate the fundamental limitations in nanoscaled SONOS NVSMs.  &lt;br/&gt;The  intellectual  merit  of  this  proposal  resides  in  a  vision  where  future  advancements  in &lt;br/&gt;nonvolatile  semiconductor  memory  storage  will  play  a  central  role  in  nanoscaled  science  and &lt;br/&gt;engineering. Our program integrates research and education to explore high-density NVSMs with &lt;br/&gt;unique heteroinsulator structures.  The experimental and theoretical study of novel devices will &lt;br/&gt;entail the use of physics, chemistry, materials science and device electronics at the nanoscale with &lt;br/&gt;considerable opportunity to explore new frontiers through the generation of new knowledge. &lt;br/&gt;The broader aspects in our program will advance diversity in the nanoelectronics workforce &lt;br/&gt;and provide intellectual technology transfer, integration of research and education, and promotion &lt;br/&gt;of partnerships. We have excellent educational and outreach programs to increase diversity with &lt;br/&gt;opportunities  in  nanoelectronics,  especially  semiconductor  devices  .  an  important  area  to &lt;br/&gt;maintain US leadership in a global economy. This research program provides an excellent vehicle &lt;br/&gt;for student research and education, minority student outreach and partnerships with industry.</AbstractNarration>
