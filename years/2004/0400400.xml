<AbstractNarration>The U.S. National Committee for IUPsyS is sponsoring a travel grant program to partially support international travel for U.S. psychology graduate students and early career scientists participating in the scientific program of the 28th International Congress of Psychology, which will take place August 8-13, 2004, in Beijing, China.  This congress is considered the most important international meeting on psychological science.  This travel grant provides graduate students and early career scientists, many of whom do not have the institutional funding for such travel, an opportunity to present their science, learn of important new advances in an international arena, and establish contacts for future international collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;The travel grant program will be widely publicized and open to all interested U.S. graduate students and early career scientists whose research falls within the purview of the topics covered by NSF funding programs, including those in psychology, linguistics, learning, and development.  Applicants must provide an abstract of their paper or poster and a short nomination letter from their advisor or another faculty member recommending their participation.  The goal of the program is to maximize the impact of U.S. graduate student researchers and early career scholars at the meeting, as well as the impact of the meeting on those participants.  In support of this goal, the committee will balance the awards geographically and by institution.  Consideration will also be given to ensuring the representation of American science with women and minorities.  &lt;br/&gt;When ranking the applicants, the screening subcommittee will consider: 1) the potential contribution of each participant to the Congress and the return each will receive from the Congress to apply to his/her research; 2) the quality and timeliness of his or her paper or poster; 3) the need for travel grant money to assure the individual's attendance; and 4) the expected ability of the individual to increase his or her potential scientific productivity through attendance.   All successful applicants must provide a meaningful trip report within two months after the Congress.  The trip reports should feature benefits that have accrued both to the grantees and to American psychological science.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
