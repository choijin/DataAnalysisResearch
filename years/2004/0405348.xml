<AbstractNarration>     The principal investigator and his colleagues study the&lt;br/&gt;structure and function of real-world networked systems,&lt;br/&gt;particularly information, computer, and social networks.  The&lt;br/&gt;work includes an empirical component concerned with the discovery&lt;br/&gt;and analysis of network structure, including collaboration&lt;br/&gt;networks, citation networks of papers and of registered patents,&lt;br/&gt;transportation and other geographic networks, social networks,&lt;br/&gt;and computer networks of various kinds including administrator&lt;br/&gt;and server-client networks and networks of "weblogs."  Properties&lt;br/&gt;studied include correlation functions, spatial structure,&lt;br/&gt;centrality and similarity measures, and measures of assortative&lt;br/&gt;mixing and community structure.  There is also a theoretical&lt;br/&gt;component to the work, involving the development of models to aid&lt;br/&gt;in the understanding of the effects of network structure.  Of&lt;br/&gt;particular interest are generalized random graph models of&lt;br/&gt;networks, percolation models of network resilience, growth&lt;br/&gt;models, exponential random graphs, and Markov graphs.  The&lt;br/&gt;project also includes the development of new computer algorithms&lt;br/&gt;for extracting and visualizing network structure, particularly&lt;br/&gt;for the detection of community structure in networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The investigator and colleagues try to understand the form&lt;br/&gt;and behavior of networks, particularly information networks,&lt;br/&gt;computer networks, and social networks. The work has bearing on a&lt;br/&gt;number of issues of current importance.  A knowledge of the&lt;br/&gt;structure of networks of acquaintance is crucial to an&lt;br/&gt;understanding of how information, such as news, rumors, consumer&lt;br/&gt;trends, etc., spreads through society.  Similarly, networks of&lt;br/&gt;physical contact between people govern the way in which diseases&lt;br/&gt;spread and computer networks govern the spread of computer&lt;br/&gt;viruses.  A proper understanding of the nature and progress of&lt;br/&gt;infections is impossible without good network models.  The work&lt;br/&gt;described here is aimed both at determining what the structure of&lt;br/&gt;the networks in question is, and also at modeling the effect of&lt;br/&gt;that structure on possible outcomes.  As well as enhancing basic&lt;br/&gt;understanding of these problems, the results point to ways in&lt;br/&gt;which network structure or dynamics can be changed in order to&lt;br/&gt;either improve network transmission (in the case of information)&lt;br/&gt;or slow it down (in the case of epidemics).  For disease&lt;br/&gt;transmission, for instance, it may be possible to suggest&lt;br/&gt;effective targets for immunization or education campaigns to slow&lt;br/&gt;disease spread.  New data resources and analysis techniques also&lt;br/&gt;are developed that will aid future work by other researchers on&lt;br/&gt;related topics.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
