<AbstractNarration>Proposal ID:  DMS-0456571  &lt;br/&gt;Prev Awd:  0119560  &lt;br/&gt;PI:  Weidman, Scott T.    &lt;br/&gt;Institution:  National Academy of Sciences   &lt;br/&gt;Title:  COMMITTEE ON APPLIED AND THEORETICAL STATISTICS   &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;                                                              ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Committee on Applied and Theoretical Statistics (CATS) helps to illuminate promising research directions for the statistical sciences by defining and launching workshops and studies of importance to the community.  Recent activities have included broadly cross-disciplinary workshops on Statistical Analysis of Massive Streams of Data (December, 2002) and on Visualization of Uncertain Information (March, 2005).  The former of these led to a special issue of the Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics (December 2003) and to a workshop proceedings published by the National Academy Press.  Planned activities include a cross-disciplinary workshop on Statistics on Networks, planned for September 2005, and oversight of a study to establish an improved research foundation for fingerprint analysis.&lt;br/&gt;Because of its position within the National Academies, CATS is well situated to strengthen connections between the statistical sciences and other fields.  It has ready access to the leaders in all fields of science, engineering, education, and medicine.  This access gives CATS a unique capability for assembling leaders in a variety of fields, including statistics, to address technical and policy issues in a cross-disciplinary fashion.  In addition, the Committee's position within the National Academies gives it access to leaders in federal agencies and public policy, which enables CATS to identify emerging issues of national importance that require input from the statistical sciences community.   &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
