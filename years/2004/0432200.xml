<AbstractNarration>This award represents continued partial support of the 2004 Technical Activities Program of the Federal Facilities Council (FFC). The FFC is an element of the Board on Infrastructure and the Constructed Environment (BICE) of the National Research Council (NRC).  Since 1953 the FFC and its predecessor organizations have provided sponsoring agencies with a mechanism for jointly identifying and addressing mutual problems and concerns regarding facilities and infrastructure.  The 2004 program supports convening three workshops: Investment in Federal Facilities: Developing Common Approaches Across Stakeholder Agencies, Emerging Information Technologies for Facilities Design and Management, and Quality Assurance/Quality Control for Federal Facilities Projects; completing one information study on Using Performance-Based Contracts and Incentives Clauses: Federal Agencies' Experience; and conducting three forums: The Cost-effectiveness of Building Protection Strategies, Security in Leased Federal Facilities, and Experiences of Federal Facilities Management Organizations with the A-76 Process.  The 2004 program also provides administrative and technical support for the FFC oversight committee and the six standing committees; Design and Construction, Emerging Technologies, Operations and Maintenance, Organizational Performance and Management, Physical Security and Hazard Mitigation, and Project and Acquisition Management.  This includes support for up to 28 committee meetings with guest speakers, maintaining and enhancing networking activities through the FFC Web site, and participating in industry conferences and forums.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
