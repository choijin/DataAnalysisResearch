<AbstractNarration>Proposal DMS-0401048&lt;br/&gt;PI: Xiaodong Yan, Michigan State University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Regularity properties for multiple integrals and interfacial&lt;br/&gt;       coarsening for energy-driven models&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  The proposal addresses problems in three main areas.&lt;br/&gt;In part one, we are concerned with regularity property of&lt;br/&gt;minimizers of uniformly convex functionals. The objective&lt;br/&gt;is to generalize method used in previous work of Sverak and&lt;br/&gt;PI to construct counterexamples in lower target dimensions,&lt;br/&gt;as well as to understand regularity property of minimizers&lt;br/&gt;under further assumptions on the integrand. The second part&lt;br/&gt;deals with regularity property of minimizers for both&lt;br/&gt;compressible and incompressible models from nonlinear elasticity.&lt;br/&gt;The main feature here is the singular behavior of the integrand&lt;br/&gt;in the compressible case and nonlinear nonconvex constraint in&lt;br/&gt;the incompressible case. Currently there is no general method to&lt;br/&gt;deal with regularity problems for such integral. We hope that&lt;br/&gt;the simple model problems studied in this project can help to&lt;br/&gt;gain insight into more general cases. The third part addresses&lt;br/&gt;interfacial coarsening phenomenon observed in many energy-driven&lt;br/&gt;models from materials science. In particular, the aim is to provide&lt;br/&gt;rigorous analysis on the value of the coarsening exponent for different&lt;br/&gt;models. The analysis is closely related to deep and interesting issues&lt;br/&gt;in calculus of variations, e.g.gamma limit of singularly perturbed&lt;br/&gt;variational problems. The well developed tools from those areas provide a&lt;br/&gt;better vision on the last project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;   The questions to be studied are motivated both by classical theory of&lt;br/&gt;optimization and contemporary issues in nonlinear elasticity and materials&lt;br/&gt;science. An outstanding open question in continuum mechanics is to determine&lt;br/&gt;what singularities might exist in surfaces which optimize a collection of&lt;br/&gt;nonlinear constraints. Knowledge of this type can help in the design of&lt;br/&gt;exotic materials. The study of coarsening is important for both bulk and&lt;br/&gt;thin film materials. Such materials are of great practical interest. For&lt;br/&gt;example, superconducting thin film devices are presently being evaluated for&lt;br/&gt;possible use in high-performance microwave filters and other applications.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
