<AbstractNarration>The International Conference on Complementarity, Duality, and Global Optimization (CDGO-05) will be held at Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, August 15-17, 2005. A primary goal of this conference is to bring together mathematicians, engineers, and scientists from a variety of scientific disciplines who are working on complementarity, duality, and global optimization in nonlinear systems, engineering mechanics, and computational methods, with an emphasis on applications in science and engineering. The purpose of this award is to apply for a grant from NSF to partially cover the travel expenses for four invited plenary speakers, three tutorial speakers, several invited special symposium speakers/organizers, and several graduate students/post-doctors, and young researchers from both universities and industries within the United States.  Intellectual merit: Complementarity and Duality are fundamental concepts that play an important role in global optimization, large-scale computation, and multi-disciplinary research in engineering and science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This fascinating conference will provide an exciting forum for the exchange of ideas in this highly fertile and ever-expanding area.  Broader impacts: The conference proceedings will be published in two hardbound volumes by Kluwer book series of Nonconvex Optimization and Advances in Mechanics and Mathematics. It is expected that this conference will open new trends in optimization and engineering science. Furthermore, it will stimulate young faculty and students to venture into this rich domain of research.</AbstractNarration>
