<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT-0448740&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CAREER: A Multi-scale Approach to Particle Breakage in Stirred Vessels and Its&lt;br/&gt;Integration into Education&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Priscilla J. Hill&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Attrition and fragmentation of particles are of significant scientific and industrial interest. Process applications span a range of industries including the fertilizer, chemical, and pharmaceutical industries. One of the reasons that particle breakage is so important in the chemical process industries is that it alters the size and the shape of the particles. Both product quality and process operability strongly depend on particle size and shape, yet little research has been done on the affect of breakage on particle shape. The objectives of this project are to correct this deficiency by investigating the evolution of both particle size and shape in a stirred vessel, and to train future engineers to account for particle size and shape in the evaluation of solids processes. The project has two major sections: research and education.  The research program of theory, modeling, and experimentation aims to: 1) determine the effect of Ostwald ripening on breakage experiments in a saturated solution, and 2) to link a macroscale model of breakage in a stirred vessel to microscale particle fracture mechanics using mathematical models based on first principles. This model will be tested experimentally. The research and education programs are integrated by introducing new research results into the graduate and undergraduate curriculum and by having selected students actively participate in ongoing research. Specifically the education program consists of: 1) developing a new graduate elective course in particle and crystallization technology, 2) developing educational software based on the research program models, 3) engaging graduate and undergraduate students in active research, and 4) developing educational modules in particle technology for use with K-12 students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This research is expected to benefit both academia and industry. The key to designing better solids processes is quantitatively incorporating fundamental physical phenomena and properties into the design process. The proposed work would make a significant addition by providing a basis for including particle shape changes due to breakage and attrition in a design methodology. Although this research is developed for particle fragmentation and attrition in stirred vessels such as crystallizers, it has broader impact in other unit operations that have particle breakage such as crushers, fluidized beds, pumps, and mixers. It is expected that this work would lead to models of potential interest to commercial chemical process simulation companies. Not limited to chemical engineering operations, it would have applications in other industries such as minerals and food processing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: This plan provides for educational outreach to students at a wide range of educational levels: K-12, undergraduate, and graduate students. Diversity is enhanced by actively recruiting undergraduate and graduate students from underrepresented groups to participate in research activities, and by including students from underrepresented groups in the K-12 educational activities. Since deficiencies in particle technology knowledge and education harm the global competitive position of the U.S., this project contributes to society by improving the understanding and modeling of particle behavior and by educating people to better address particle technology issues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
