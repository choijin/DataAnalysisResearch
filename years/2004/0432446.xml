    <AbstractNarration>Using NSF support, the American Statistical Association (ASA) awards a travel grant to at least 11 United States participants to attend the 55th Session of the International Statistical Institute (ISI) in Sydney, Australia, from April 5 - 12, 2005. The ISI meeting includes the meetings of the Bernoulli Society, International Association for Official Statistics (IAOS), International Association for Statistical Computing (IASC), International Association of Survey Statisticians (IASS), and the International Association for Statistical Education (IASE). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The travel grant program administered by ASA is for participation in an umbrella meeting with sessions of interest for thousands of statisticians. The grant provides partial support to defray transportation costs for approximately eleven (11) individuals selected from institutions and non-profit associations. Participants will be notified of the availability of the travel grant through Amstat News, a membership publication with over 19,000 circulation and on the ASA Home Page on the Internet. Also, notices will be sent to university and college statistics and mathematics departments to encourage younger and underrepresented statisticians to apply for travel support. An ASA committee will do the review and selection of the applications. Special consideration will be given to statisticians who have recently received their doctorates and to women and minorities in order to broaden research, educational and networking opportunities.</AbstractNarration>
