<AbstractNarration>Scaffolded homework activities provide students with hints and feedback on an as-needed basis and fade that help appropriately. Structured dialogues can help students analyze a complex problem to identify an appropriate approach and then, at the end of the problem solving activity, support them in connecting the experience back to their broader understanding of chemistry. While carrying out a computational task, the scaffolding can provide hints and feedback on student errors, and fade these such that the student remains challenged but does not flounder. Assessment efforts support creating new problem types based on virtual labs to improve student learning and highlight the need for better scaffolding of student problem solving. Online systems provide help as needed and increase or fade appropriately. Activities we support span a range from practice with computational procedures up to engagement in complex authentic problem solving, with the support structures varying and depending on the demands of the level. Bridges between computational practice and a broader conceptual understanding of chemistry is promoted through dialogues that prompt students to reflect on their problem solving and what they have learned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
