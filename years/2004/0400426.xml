<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;The primary goal of the proposed research in this project is to&lt;br/&gt;develop the mathematical tools needed to prove several outstanding conjectures&lt;br/&gt;in Quantum Information Theory. The central conjecture states that&lt;br/&gt;minimal output entropy is additive for product channels, where a channel&lt;br/&gt;is the mathematical representation of a noisy quantum system. The&lt;br/&gt;mathematical setting concerns properties of&lt;br/&gt;completely positive maps on matrix algebras. Building on results and&lt;br/&gt;methods from&lt;br/&gt;earlier work, the PI expects to establish this conjecture for all&lt;br/&gt;qubit maps, and in the process develop tools that will apply to higher&lt;br/&gt;dimensional&lt;br/&gt;maps. The PI expects to produce results that are both mathematically&lt;br/&gt;interesting&lt;br/&gt;and also useful for quantum information theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quantum Information Theory is concerned with exploring the new resources that&lt;br/&gt;are available in physical systems whose behavior is wholly or partly&lt;br/&gt;governed by&lt;br/&gt;quantum effects, for example single-atom systems and single-photon states.&lt;br/&gt;Recent theoretical&lt;br/&gt;discoveries&lt;br/&gt;indicate that such systems may have extraordinary properties. One example&lt;br/&gt;is the quantum computer, which is a theoretical device capable of&lt;br/&gt;outperforming any standard computer. Another example is a protocol for&lt;br/&gt;unconditionally secure encryption, which would be achieved by encoding&lt;br/&gt;messages as quantum states. Mathematics has played an essential role in the&lt;br/&gt;development of these new ideas. The present proposal is aimed at using&lt;br/&gt;advanced mathematical techniques to explore the implications of&lt;br/&gt;using entangled quantum states in communication systems.&lt;br/&gt;A fundamental problem is to determine the&lt;br/&gt;information capacity of such a system, and thereby find the quantum analog&lt;br/&gt;of Shannon's famous expression for the capacity of a noisy channel.&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the proposed activity rests on the potential&lt;br/&gt;applications of&lt;br/&gt;quantum information theory in physics and computer science, and ultimately in&lt;br/&gt;technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
