    <AbstractNarration>Experiments in meson spectroscopy test critical aspects of the standard&lt;br/&gt;theory of the strong nuclear force. Although they only live for a short&lt;br/&gt;time before they decay, mesons provide a unique laboratory for the study&lt;br/&gt;of the strong force because they are the simplest quark configuration,&lt;br/&gt;just a one quark and one antiquark. The GlueX experiment is a major new&lt;br/&gt;initiative being undertaken at Jefferson Lab in Newport News, Virginia&lt;br/&gt;using polarized photons from the CEBAF electron accelerator to search&lt;br/&gt;for a new class of excitations known as exotic mesons. Although exotics&lt;br/&gt;were predicted based upon the standard theory over 20 years ago,&lt;br/&gt;conclusive experimental evidence for their existence has not yet been&lt;br/&gt;established. The P.I. is a member of the governing board of the GlueX&lt;br/&gt;experiment and has specific responsibility in the design and&lt;br/&gt;construction of the polarized photon source. A preliminary step towards&lt;br/&gt;the larger goals of GlueX was the Radphi experiment was constructed&lt;br/&gt;study the decays of a known meson, the phi(1020). The phi itself is not&lt;br/&gt;exotic, but some evidence pointed to the possible exotic nature of two&lt;br/&gt;other mesons at around the same mass, the a0(980) and the f0(980). &lt;br/&gt;Radiative decays of the phi to these scalars provide an important test&lt;br/&gt;of this hypothesis. The experiment collected its data during a 60-day&lt;br/&gt;run in summer 2000, and is in the final stages of data analysis. The&lt;br/&gt;P.I. is also involved in the Qweak experiment at Jefferson Lab, which&lt;br/&gt;undertakes a precise measurement of the weak charge of the proton as a&lt;br/&gt;search for physics beyond the Standard Model. In this project he has&lt;br/&gt;shared responsibility for the Compton-backscatter electron polarimeter.</AbstractNarration>
