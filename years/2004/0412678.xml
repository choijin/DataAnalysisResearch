<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;In this project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Prof. Marsha Lester of the University of Pennsylvania will investigate molecular associations and reactive intermediates that are predicted to play a role in the reactions of hydroxyl radicals with molecular partners of significance in the earth's atmosphere.  Infrared spectroscopy will be used to identify five- and six-membered cyclic complexes that are inferred to be important in the hydrogen abstraction reactions of hydroxyl radicals with nitric acid, hydrogen peroxide, and acetone.  The intermediates of the reactions between hydroxyl and nitrogen dioxide, and hydroxyl and carbon monoxide will also be investigated.  Through these studies the structure, stability, and dissociation/reaction dynamics of the hydroxyl adducts and intermediates will be examined, thereby providing new insights on the mechanisms for hydrogen atom transfer and radical association reactions in the atmosphere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Graduate and undergraduate students, including women and members of underrepresented minorities, and postdoctoral research associates will participate in this research.  They will acquire knowledge and skills in preparation for advanced studies or employment in the scientific/technological sectors of our economy.  The research findings will also be adapted for classroom use through courses developed for high school teachers, undergraduate nonscience majors, and graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
