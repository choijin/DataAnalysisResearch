<AbstractNarration>DMS 0411729&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Doron Lubinsky et al&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Georgia Tech&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Constructive Functions Tech 04&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CONSTRUCTIVE FUNCTIONS TECH-O4 will be held November 7-9, 2004 at Georgia Institute of Technology. This conference will cover all aspects of constructive function theory: from potential theory, to the theory of orthogonal polynomials and special functions, to approximation theory and to the interactions with several areas of classical, functional, and numerical analysis. It will also emphasize applications of these disciplines to data fitting, curve and surface fitting, wavelets, and signal and image processing. The conference intends to provide opportunities for cross fertilization of ideas among these areas.&lt;br/&gt;             &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Constructive function theory, potential theory, the theory of orthogonal polynomials and special functions, and approximation theory are well-established branches of analysis which have retained their vitality over many years. Their recent interactions with other fields have produced many important advances inside and outside the disciplines. For example, sophisticated applications of potential theory have permitted solutions to problems that had been open for decades. The recent Riemann-Hilbert approach by Percy Deift, Xin Zhou and others to orthogonal polynomials has produced solutions to long- standing problems related to random matrices, which in turn find applications in combinatorics and statistical physics. Very recently, there have been great advances in asymptotics of orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle with strong connection to the spectral analysis of operators. Barry Simon's 700 page monograph, to be published by the American Mathematical Society, attests to the vitality of the area.&lt;br/&gt;              &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the main objectives of the conference is to stimulate  discussion and inspire ideas among researchers, and to provide a forum for workers in the fields to meet and discuss current research. The conference will be broad-based and this will undoubtedly attract a good mix of academic, industrial, and government researchers with a strong international component (by the current count, over 90 researchers have pre-registered on the conference's web site from 26 different nations). We expect around 80 to 100 participants.&lt;br/&gt;              &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The meeting will be completely open, with opportunities for many participants to present current research. At the same time, we &lt;br/&gt;Expect the conference to serve as a means to acquaint attendees with the state-of-art in several areas of special current interest through plenary presentations by 18 leading international experts. One or two problem sessions will also be arranged in order to discuss important research directions. Lastly, an equally important objective of the organizers is to secure the participation of young researchers, especially women and minorities, and doctoral students working in constructive function theory, potential theory, the theory of orthogonal polynomials and special functions, and approximation theory and related fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
