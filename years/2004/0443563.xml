    <AbstractNarration>This is a collaborative, interdisciplinary proposal in the area of Mathematical Biology. The main goal is to develop mathematical models and numerical methods to study diffusion-mediated and stress-induced growth and adhesion of ear cartilage cells (auricular chondrocytes) in a novel environment: seeded on an artificial surface exposed to the pulsatile flow conditions. Chondrocytes are typically studied in the environments where they normally reside such as the joints in hips, intervertebral disks or the ear. It is not known how auricular chondrocytes grow, adhere or slough-off from artificial surfaces immersed a fluid. By developing mathematical models, numerical simulations and experimental procedures the investigators propose to design a cell-fluid-structure interaction algorithm that would couple chondrocytes growth with the novel environmental conditions. The proposed mathematical models are based on the study of the coupling between the three-phase flow equations describing ear cartilage growth, a probabilistic model for cell adhesion dynamics, and a numerical model for particle-fluid interaction. Experimental validation will be performed using the flow loop assembled by the investigators at the Texas Heart Institute. Results from the basic research proposed by the PIs will shed light on the feasibility of using genetically engineered auricular chondrocytes as a long-lasting biocompatible coating for vascular devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an interdisciplinary proposal combining mathematical modeling, engineering, and biology. The goal is to study the behavior of genetically engineered ear cartilage cells as linings for artificial blood vessels and stents used to repair weakened and blocked arteries. Vessel blockage and rupture are the underlying cause of most heart attacks and strokes which are the leading causes of death in America. Cartilage cells might provide a long-lasting and biocompatible surface lining which could minimize the incidence of inflammation, immune reactions, and restenosis following repair and stenting of diseased blood vessels. This collaborative study utilizes sophisticated mathematical tools, scientific computing techniques, genetic engineering, high resolution ultrasound, and cell biology methods to target the problem of treating vascular disease with a high potential impact for the national health.</AbstractNarration>
