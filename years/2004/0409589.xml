<AbstractNarration>This project (INDEPTH IV) is a continuation of previously funded projects (INDEPTH I, II, III).  The overarching goal of the INDEPTH studies is to understand the basic processes that take place in a continent-continent collision.  INDEPTH I, II, and III were joint Sino-U.S. studies to understand the formation of the Tibetan Plateau and Himalayan mountains, which together comprise Earth's type example of an active continent-continent collision zone.  Results from these studies have profoundly influenced prevalent theories of mountain building in such tectonic settings. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of INDEPTH IV is the northeastern boundary of the Tibetan Plateau.  This boundary plays a central role in a contemporary debate concerning continental plateau formation as an intracontinental response to collisional orogeny.  Recent geological studies and limited geophysical measurements in this region have been cited to argue that a) uplift is due to internal imbricate "stacking" of Asian crust while b) Asian continental lithosphere is being detached and "subducted" into the Tibetan mantle.  Such models contrast with a competing paradigm, derived primarily from observations in the southern and eastern portions of the Plateau, that attribute plateau formation to ductile flow in the deep crust.  Critical to any model of surface tectonics is the mantle dynamics beneath the plateau and adjacent regions.  Upper mantle geophysical properties beneath the northern plateau have been variously attributed to delamination triggered by instability of a thickened lithosphere, mantle lid detachment and/or asthenospheric counterflow associated with subduction of Indian continental lithosphere.  INDEPTH IV will test key elements in these hypotheses with an integrated, focused program of geophysical surveys across three key segments of the NE Plateau boundary zone.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Geophysical surveys will consist of integrated seismic reflection, refraction and densely spaced passive seismic profiles, a detailed magnetotelluric survey, and a regional broadband seismic array.  Specific features to be investigated by the surveys include:   a)  the existence and nature of proposed Moho offsets;  b) the deep geometry of major thrust faults at the plateau boundary;  c) the relationship between major thrusts and strike slip faults;  d) constraints on lower crustal flow from structural continuity of crustal markers;  e) the existence and nature of subducting Asian lithosphere; and f)  the mode of lithospheric thickening beneath the plateau foreland.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project deployed one of the first grid of broadband seismic stations across the Tibetan plateau.  This network was designed to image the crustal and upper mantle structure of the eastern half of the Tibetan plateau using a variety of  seismic tomographic imaging techniques; some of which were developed for this project.  We also combined our broadband seismic data with other experiments other grid deployments in southernmost Tibet and along the eastern edge of the plateau.  The resulting  images from the combined arrays have given us a unique look into the upper mantle structure and a three dimensional view of the underthrusting Indian Lithosphere (UICL). It appears the UICL is possibly breaking apart as it is underthrusting the Tibetan plateau and this breaking up appears to correlation with the rift zones in southern Tibet.  This also might indicate that UICL is breaking up and its pieces are sinking into the upper mantle.  This process might indicate that India and Eurasia are close to suturing themsevles together.  This project has given earth scientsits a unque look into one of the least well understood part of plate tectonics:  continent-continent collision and suturing on the planets largest and most most mature continental plateau and mountain belt (Himalayas).
