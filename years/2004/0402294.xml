<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;Proposal DMS-0402294&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Jie Qing (University of California, Santa Cruz)&lt;br/&gt;Title: Geometric PDE in conformal geometry and relativity&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Jie Qing proposes to study conformally compact Einstein manifolds. &lt;br/&gt;Conformally compact Einstein manifolds play crucial roles in the&lt;br/&gt;so-called AdS/CFT correspondence, which is a very promising theory that &lt;br/&gt;predicts certain connections between quantum gravitational theory and&lt;br/&gt;certain conformal field theory. In mathematics it has been known&lt;br/&gt;that conformally compact Einstein manifolds provide a powerful approach to&lt;br/&gt;the study of conformal geometry.  Recent development in the study of the&lt;br/&gt;scattering matrix in providing rather global, natural way to understand&lt;br/&gt;the holography principle in physics seems very fascinating and promising. &lt;br/&gt;Dr. Jie Qing is also interested in developing and study theory about&lt;br/&gt;asymptotically AdS/dS space-times. For a start, one considers static&lt;br/&gt;asymptotically AdS/dS space-times. The theory is not as well-known as the&lt;br/&gt;study of asymptotically flat space-times. But it is as significant, if not&lt;br/&gt;more, in the classic relativity and quantum gravitation theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research is to study the primary object in the&lt;br/&gt;theory of holography principles that relate quantum gravitation theory &lt;br/&gt;and some conformal field theory. It has become a part the field where &lt;br/&gt;mathematicians and physicists can interact. It is a part of&lt;br/&gt;the efforts to find a unified theory for all fundamental interactions&lt;br/&gt;including the strong and weak nuclear interactions, electromagnetism, and&lt;br/&gt;gravity. Advancements in this field will greatly improve our understanding&lt;br/&gt;of the nature in theory. The proposed research is a very important part of&lt;br/&gt;the undergraduate and graduate education programs in the department of&lt;br/&gt;mathematics at University of California, Santa Cruz. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
