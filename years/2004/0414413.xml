<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;The focus of this research involves the development of synthetic methods for the production of molecular hosts.  The analysis of the hosts will be carried out on two levels.  First, they will be studied to gauge the potential for cleaving protecting groups due to cavity shape and the position of functionality within the host compounds.  Second, the properties of internally functionalized molecular capsules will be studied.  The capsules, formed in water via self-assembly, possess the potential for encapsulating molecules such as steroids in a primarily dry environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. Bruce C. Gibb in the Department of Chemistry at the University of New Orleans.  Dr. Gibb will focus his work for the short term on developing methodology for the synthesis of molecular hosts that possess functionality built into highly concave binding pockets.  These readily available hosts will be examined for the ability to cleave common protecting groups.   The project will have broader impact as an excellent venue for the training of graduate students, especially those from underrepresented minority groups. Further, the research could have an impact on the pharmaceutical industry.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
