<AbstractNarration>This project, constructing an advanced security detection system portal that integrates many individual functions of current systems, focuses on the physical security aspects integrating a variety of detection mechanisms, such as chemical and biological sensors. The work supports research in fundamental areas related to security detection, monitoring, prototyping, prevention, and recovery. Investigating fundamental research issues in security detection, the project involves prototyping a walk-through security portal that uses a variety of sensors (visible, infrared and millimeter wave images, metal and air detection data) along with X-ray baggage scanning information and other information about the individual to determine the threat level. The analysis of the fusion of all such data from heterogeneous devices is expected to yield more accurate assessment than any one of more sensors analyzed individually. The equipment supports research and development of advanced detection systems for secured entry through the use of multiple, network-integrated sensors. The approach encompasses several interdisciplinary research areas including &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Smart sensors, &lt;br/&gt;Wireless sensor and data networks, &lt;br/&gt;Sensor fusion, &lt;br/&gt;Pervasive computing,&lt;br/&gt;Image processing, and&lt;br/&gt;Databases and data mining.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research in smart sensors improves the ability to distribute sensors in a secured-entry portal and develop techniques for sensing at a distance (e.g., gases and materials). Image sensors (visible, infrared and millimeter wave) support research in image processing and concealed weapon detection. Biometric sensors and RFID tag technologies also provide a rich source of information for controlling access to high security areas. Micromechanical systems (MEMS) research develops wireless microsensors for detection of toxins. Sensor networking and fusion coupled with database research develop new methods for collecting, exchanging, processing, and understanding large amounts of real-time sensory information. Higher-level data integration and data mining research contribute new techniques for learning and assessing threat levels, and more efficient personnel and baggage screening. This instrumentation complements current research on Pervasively Secure Infrastructures (PSI) by integrating secure-entry capabilities into a more general approach to securing an environment, such as mass transit and shopping malls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:  The instrumentation provides resources for the Institute for Research In Security (IRIS). This institute facilitates multidisciplinary, collaborative research to improve the ability to maintain secure and usable environments. IRIS collaborates with several public safety and law enforcement agencies in developing and deploying leading-edge technologies in existing and future environments. The work will be disseminated through open houses, public demonstrations, publications, multi-disciplinary course and the web-site. Public demonstrations will target K-12 students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The funds requested include the equipment listed below and associated expenses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MEMS Wireless Sensor Networking Testbed, Millivision Vela125 Scanning Booth, &lt;br/&gt;PowerView Stereoscopic PIV systems, Smith Detection X-Ray Baggage scanner, etc.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
