    <AbstractNarration>Corporate executives comprise a small but important part of the labor market. As the&lt;br/&gt;main decision makers in public corporations, top officers have been responsible for a large&lt;br/&gt;fraction of assets in the economy ever since the separation of ownership from control at the turn&lt;br/&gt;of the century. Although finance and labor economists have analyzed the market for managerial&lt;br/&gt;personnel extensively during the past 20 years, far less is known about the evolution of the&lt;br/&gt;market during earlier times. This project fills in the gap by constructing the first consistent panel&lt;br/&gt;dataset on executive compensation to extend from the 1930s to the present. These data are&lt;br/&gt;essential for understanding the evolution of managerial pay and the rise of professional managers&lt;br/&gt;over the course of the twentieth century.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merits&lt;br/&gt;Although recent changes in executive compensation are well documented, an&lt;br/&gt;understanding of longer run trends has been hampered by a lack of consistent data. Previous&lt;br/&gt;researchers have studied managerial pay for short periods of time, but variation in methodologies&lt;br/&gt;across studies prohibits using these data to construct consistent trends over a long horizon. This&lt;br/&gt;project solves this problem by collecting data on executive compensation from historical&lt;br/&gt;corporate reports. Due to requirements imposed by the Securities and Exchange Commission,&lt;br/&gt;these documents have provided annual information on the compensation of top officers in&lt;br/&gt;publicly traded firms ever since the late 1930s. Because the reporting requirements have not&lt;br/&gt;changed significantly over time, these data will allow for different components of executive pay&lt;br/&gt;to be measured consistently for most of the twentieth century.&lt;br/&gt; Obtaining consistent estimates of both the level and components of managerial pay will&lt;br/&gt;contribute a significant new insight into how the market for corporate executives has changed&lt;br/&gt;over time. Furthermore, this project will be the first to provide consistent estimates of how the&lt;br/&gt;relationship between pay and firm performance has changed over time, thereby improving our&lt;br/&gt;understanding of the optimality of contracts and their effects on the long-run performance of the&lt;br/&gt;economy. Finally, this project will shed light on the interaction between tax policy and trends in&lt;br/&gt;income inequality during the past 70 years. By studying how top officers have been able to shift&lt;br/&gt;income out of taxable forms during different tax regimes, this project will advance the current&lt;br/&gt;knowledge on the behavioral responses to taxation from top income earners.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;Historical data on executive compensation are necessary to address numerous questions&lt;br/&gt;that span a wide range of subjects including the market for managers, organizations, contract&lt;br/&gt;theory, corporate finance, and tax policy. Because these topics exceed the scope of the proposed&lt;br/&gt;research agenda, the data will be of interest to many other social scientists. Once this project is&lt;br/&gt;complete the dataset will be made available to the public, providing other researchers with an&lt;br/&gt;opportunity to expand their own work.&lt;br/&gt;This project also has several important implications for public policy. An improved&lt;br/&gt;understanding of how high-income earners respond to tax rates can inform the discussion on&lt;br/&gt;optimal tax policy, tax revenues, and income redistribution. Corporate executives have always&lt;br/&gt;been among the top 1% of the income distribution. Thus, understanding the response of these&lt;br/&gt;high income individuals to changes in tax rates is critical for determining whether changes in tax&lt;br/&gt;policy will have the intended consequences. Moreover, a study on the long-run trends in&lt;br/&gt;executive pay adds an important historical perspective to the unprecedented levels of income&lt;br/&gt;inequality between executives and workers that have been experienced during the past decade.&lt;br/&gt;The effects of past policies on the absolute and relative levels of pay should be an important&lt;br/&gt;consideration in the current debate concerning the recent excesses in executive compensation.</AbstractNarration>
