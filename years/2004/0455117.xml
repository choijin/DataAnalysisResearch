<AbstractNarration>Stereochemical composition exerts strong and sometimes surprising effects on the &lt;br/&gt;dynamic and static properties of polymers, as illustrated by the dependence of the miscibility of a &lt;br/&gt;polypropylene melt on the stereochemical composition of the chains. This subtle effect has been &lt;br/&gt;captured and explained by the PI in prior simulations performed with support from NSF. The PI &lt;br/&gt;and Co-PI will now address the influence of stereochemical composition in two other important &lt;br/&gt;areas: The nanoscale objects spontaneously formed by dendronized polymers with a backbone &lt;br/&gt;that raises tacticity as an issue, and the detailed analysis of melt dynamics when the molecular &lt;br/&gt;weight and monomer unit are held constant, and stereochemical composition is the only variable. &lt;br/&gt;The proposed simulations of dendronized polymers, using a new bridging method developed by &lt;br/&gt;the PI, will identify procedures that control the stabilities of nanoscale objects, search for new &lt;br/&gt;objects not yet realized (but potentially realizable) in the laboratory, and determine the approach &lt;br/&gt;that should be taken if bends are required at specific positions in nanoscale rods. In the dynamic &lt;br/&gt;study, the Co-PI will examine polypropylene melts by various nmr techniques that provide the &lt;br/&gt;translational diffusion coefficient and also characterize the local mobility. This information will &lt;br/&gt;be used by the PI for a critical test of the fundamental basis for the dynamic Monte Carlo method &lt;br/&gt;in the study of polymer dynamics. This critical test avoids using the molecular weight as a &lt;br/&gt;variable, and instead focuses on the changes in mobility with alterations in the stereochemical &lt;br/&gt;composition of polypropylene chains. This part of the project will benefit from collaboration &lt;br/&gt;with Prof. Theodorou (National Technical University, Athens), who will provide mobility data &lt;br/&gt;from classical Molecular Dynamics simulations of the same systems that are studied by dynamic &lt;br/&gt;Monte Carlo methods by the PI and nmr by the Co-PI. The intellectual merit of this research is &lt;br/&gt;the development of new methods for understanding and predicting the structures of sophisticated &lt;br/&gt;dendronized polymers that promise to be important in newly emerging nanotechnologies, and &lt;br/&gt;providing a critical assessment for a popular simulation technique, dynamic Monte Carlo, that is &lt;br/&gt;somewhat controversial because it purports to provide dynamic information without explicitly &lt;br/&gt;taking account of the momenta of the components of the system. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The project has several broader impacts. It contributes to fundamental knowledge by a &lt;br/&gt;critical assessment of the basis for the dynamic Monte Carlo method and by creating a new &lt;br/&gt;approach to the development and control of nanoscale objects based on polymers. The insights &lt;br/&gt;gained from the project are used by the PI and Co-PI in their formal and informal instruction of &lt;br/&gt;young scientists (undergraduates, graduate students, postdocs, visiting scientists) in the &lt;br/&gt;classroom and in their research groups. The PI also uses this knowledge in continuing education &lt;br/&gt;of professionals in industry, through his direction of the ACS short course on Molecular &lt;br/&gt;Modeling of Polymers. His students and postdocs assist in this short course, thereby gaining &lt;br/&gt;valuable insights from the industrial participants, and assisting in the education of the &lt;br/&gt;participants by sharing their learning experience in the use of simulations to understand and &lt;br/&gt;predict the properties of polymers. The PI will endeavor to expand on his successful record of &lt;br/&gt;assisting in the placement of underrepresented groups in the professorial ranks by employing &lt;br/&gt;outstanding young scientists from such groups in the project.</AbstractNarration>
