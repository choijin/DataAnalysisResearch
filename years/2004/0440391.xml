<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to develop an integrated field and modeling study as a basis for a better understanding of how multiphase computational fluid dynamics modeling can be used to understand features of pyroclastic deposits. These types of deposits are the dominant expression of eruptive activity in the geological record, but existing field-based, qualitative techniques cannot reveal the full time-dependence of pyroclastic activity. This new model will implement a truly multiphase approach that is applicable over the entire range of solid volume fraction, from dilute to dense. This allows for one to consider all stages of the eruption simultaneously, and importantly, to address the mechanics of the formation of pyroclastic deposits. It is planned to focus on poorly understood pyroclastic flows that move over water.  The field area is the well-mapped Kos Plateau Tuff (KPT), Greece that offers the opportunity to better understand both over-land and over-water eruption transport processes by comparison from a single eruptive episode. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of the project will improve knowledge among volcanologists of the interplay of dynamic processes in explosive eruptions and will contribute directly to the ability to understand the reach and magnitude of some volcanic hazards. In terms of societal benefits, results deriving from this study will be of immediate interest to volcanic hazards planners. As part of the project, we will train students with a wide range of backgrounds, and expose them to an international research experience with collaborators in Pisa, Italy and Geneva, Switzerland.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
