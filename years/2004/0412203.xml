<AbstractNarration>The investigators will develop robust, accurate, and cost-effective&lt;br/&gt;methods for simulating the dynamics of suspensions of flexible fibers&lt;br/&gt;in a Stokesian fluid.  Flexible fibers make up the&lt;br/&gt;micro-structure of suspensions that show strongly non-Newtonian bulk&lt;br/&gt;behavior, such as elasticity, shear-thinning, and normal stresses&lt;br/&gt;differences in shear flows.  By taking a nonstandard approach to this&lt;br/&gt;problem, and designing a numerical algorithm based on a nonlocal&lt;br/&gt;slender-body approximation to hydrodynamical interactions, it is&lt;br/&gt;possible to simulate problems not feasible with standard methods.  As&lt;br/&gt;this numerical method has a firm mathematical foundation, method&lt;br/&gt;design can be approached as a numerical analysis problem, carefully&lt;br/&gt;treating issues of accuracy and stability in algorithm design.&lt;br/&gt;Technical obstacles to be addressed are the accurate inclusion of&lt;br/&gt;lubrication forces when filaments approach each other, and the&lt;br/&gt;development and application of fast summation strategies for&lt;br/&gt;evalluating filament-filament interactions.  The investigators will&lt;br/&gt;also develop especially efficient methods for the special case of&lt;br/&gt;rigid filaments.  They will apply these methods to a set of current&lt;br/&gt;theoretical issues, such as the development of normal stress&lt;br/&gt;differences in flexible fiber suspensions, the effect on fluid mixing&lt;br/&gt;of storing and releasing elastic stress in the fluidic microstructure,&lt;br/&gt;and the large-scale dynamics of rod-like self-locomoting elements (as&lt;br/&gt;arises in modeling bacterial baths)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dynamics of microscopic flexible fibers immersed in a fluid are&lt;br/&gt;essential to understanding many current problems arising in biology,&lt;br/&gt;engineering, and physics.  Examples range from manufacturing processes&lt;br/&gt;in the pulp and paper industries to new proposed methods for mixing&lt;br/&gt;fluids in small devices to the locomotion of micro-organisms.  These&lt;br/&gt;are all complicated systems whose dynamics are not well understood, in&lt;br/&gt;part because the large-scale dynamics of the flow can depend on the&lt;br/&gt;detailed nonlinear dynamics of the microscopic fibers.  To help&lt;br/&gt;increase our understanding of such problems, the investigators are&lt;br/&gt;developing efficient and accurate methods for numerically simulating&lt;br/&gt;the dynamics of such systems with many interacting fibers.  They will&lt;br/&gt;apply these methods to a set of current applications, drawn from the&lt;br/&gt;basic physics of fluids, engineering, and biology.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
