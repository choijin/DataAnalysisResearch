<AbstractNarration>Chemistry (12) Problem based experiments utilizing High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and Capillary Electrophoresis (CE) are being implemented in the Whittier College chemistry department curriculum in courses ranging from organic chemistry and quantitative analysis to biochemistry, instrumental analysis, and our capstone course, the integrated laboratory.  In these experiments, students are provided with an appropriate amount of background information and then given a particular problem to solve.  They are expected to develop an experimental design, collect and interpret data, and troubleshoot their procedures as necessary.  In the highest-level course, the integrated laboratory, students are expected to be more self sufficient and independent.  Here they develop a project starting with the conception and background research of the problem to be solved and then implement a self designed project.  In these multi-week experiments, students are gaining experience with key separations techniques, HPLC and CE, which are so important to many areas of chemistry.  These laboratory experiments are helping students get a better sense of the scientific method, developing their research and problem solving skills, and improving their conceptual understanding of separations methods and applications.</AbstractNarration>
