<AbstractNarration>One of the most fundamental and longstanding questions in the neurosciences is how behavior patterns influence brain organization.  This is the classic "Nature versus Nurture" question in relation to adult and developing brains.  What facets of brain organization are genetically determined, and alternatively how much can be influenced by behavior?  As with other longstanding questions in the field, major advances can be made by examining new and favorable model systems (e.g. we owe much of our understanding of action potential conduction to the giant squid preparation, and much of our understanding of auditory localization to barn owls).  The star-nosed mole, a new exceptional model system for examining the relationship between brain maps and behavior will be used.  Star-nosed moles have the most well-developed sense of touch of any investigated mammal, and this provides unparalleled advantages for these investigations.   Our lab has discovered 3 separate and anatomically visible cortical maps in their brains that are closely correlated in size with patterns of star-nosed mole behavior.  How does this correlation develop?  Our studies strongly suggest that behavior is actively shaping the brain maps in this species and this in turn makes star-nosed moles an ideal model system for examining how brain maps in mammals are modified by experience.  Because star-nosed mole cortical organization shares so many features in common with mammals and primates in general, results from these investigations can provide critical new insights into general principles of brain plasticity.  Alternatively, if star-nosed moles have unique mechanisms for allowing adult brain plasticity, these mechanisms are equally important to our understanding of brain function.  We will begin these investigations by testing two alternative hypotheses.  The first is that behavior patterns are responsible for shaping the brain maps in moles.  The second is that the organization of brain maps is fixed during development and unaffected by behavior.  This question will be investigated by altering the development of the star at early stages or in adults, and then tracking the effect of the resulting new behavior patterns on star-nosed mole brain modules.  Cortical development and organization will be investigated with a combination of anatomical and electrophysiological studies in conjunction with precisely quantified behavioral observations.  Results from these studies wiill be of interest to a broad range of investigators, illustrating several general principles. In additional, this project will involve field and laboratory work for undegraduates, graduate, and post-graduate trainees providing a uniques rangeof educatinal opportunities. The published results will be discussed in scientific venues, as well as lectures to the general public and K-12 students, and  as part of Vanderbilt's "Research Explorers" program and the Minority Access Research Centers Program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
