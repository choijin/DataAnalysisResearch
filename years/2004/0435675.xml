<AbstractNarration>This project will examine the workplace accommodation needs of K-12 and postsecondary science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) educators with disabilities. Workplace accommodations have typically been examined on a case-by-case basis. While there are numerous examples of successful and effective solutions that meet the needs of individual employees, there has been little effort to aggregate these case studies to examine trends, understand what works and for whom, and develop more universally applicable accommodations. This project will build on the resources of CATEA's Rehabilitation Engineering Research Center (RERC) on Workplace Accommodations and Southeast Disability and Business Technical&lt;br/&gt;Assistance Center (SE DBTAC) to investigate the strategies and technologies that might help a person with a disability enter STEM education, return to work after acquiring a disability, or to counter the difficulties in performing work tasks due to aging. This project will use surveys and focus groups to research the accommodation needs of K-12 and postsecondary STEM educators who have a disability, and address assistive technology that will fill these needs. Project staff will then use this information to develop fact sheets, policy briefs, and a web course to assist educators and school administration, and to provide recommendations for future product development that addresses common workplace accommodation needs. The project will make&lt;br/&gt;use of organizations such as NSTA, AAAS, and ACS to recruit educators with disabilities and disseminate the results. The availability of effective accommodations not only allows students with disabilities to pursue&lt;br/&gt;careers within STEM education, but accommodations for educators may also prove to be effective with their students with disabilities.</AbstractNarration>
