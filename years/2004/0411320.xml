<AbstractNarration>UTEP is increasing the success rates of undergraduate engineering students by adapting methods from the New Mexico State University. The methods address multiple intelligences and are&lt;br/&gt;implemented in a peer facilitator environment. The project integrates hands on demonstrations, computer simulations, and other learning aids into a collaborative undergraduate engineering classroom to produce deeper understanding of the basics of engineering. Expectations include higher pass rates and better longitudinal performance as compared to historic data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Consider for example, the scenario in which a group of students studying dynamics are shown a vibratory feeder in which screws seem to magically walk themselves up a ramp into a predetermined location where they are picked up by a robot. The phenomenon is a simple application of stick/slip friction. The students experiment with the device to discover how it works, use a simulation to determine the effect of changing parameters, then design a new vibratory input to move the screws as quickly as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Formative assessment measures are being used to direct the curriculum development. Summative assessments are being used to test the efficacy of the interventions in both the short and long term.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
