<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to fabricate and evaluate a novel device structure demonstrating charge transfer produced by a surface acoustic wave within a film of the organic semiconductor pentacene. To obtain charge transfer, a high-value electric field is needed. In conventional charge transfer devices, a piezoelectric semiconductor is used. Since pentacene is not piezoelectric, the pentacene film will be deposited upon a highly piezoelectric Bi12GeO20 substrate. In order to overcome the poor carrier mobility of pentacene, the acoustic wave will be concentrated using waveguiding by the pentacene film itself. This will require developing beam-compression and waveguiding techniques to focus the acoustic beam to around three acoustic wavelengths of aperture. Within this reduced program, sophisticated numerical device modelling and a detailed examination of varying the charge-detection electrode geometry will not be undertaken. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit and broader impact of this work is that the devices proposed are novel and will pave the way for developing further sophisticated filters, sensors, and other signal-processing devices. The work will promote teaching and learning through support for a graduate PhD student, as well as also supporting undergraduate courses in microelectronics and signal-processing. The program will also enable the PI to participate in the undergraduate Research Assistant program in this University, and to offer undergraduate Senior design projects and Freshmen Mentoring projects. Additional undergraduate involvement will be requested through the NSF REU program. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
