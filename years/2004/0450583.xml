    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II research project involves an innovative gas sensor (DiskFET) based on a commercially available hard drive mechanism, proprietary polymers for sensing, and a modified Field Effect Transistor (FET). The device as envisioned is small, handheld, lightweight, low power, and applicable to a diverse range of chemical sensing fields. The DiskFET operates by applying an electric field between a polymer coated rotating disk and stationary FET, which is "floating" a fixed distance above the disk surface, the field strength will be affected by the interactions of the analyte with the polymer coating on the disk. This change in field strength is measured by the FET. By combining the signal responses of all of these relatively non-specific sensors, a "fingerprint" for the analyte is constructed. Using Artificial Neural Network analysis, the concentration and identity of the analyte can be recognized based on a database of the sensor response characteristics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Personal safety and air quality monitoring is on the rise. More and more workers are becoming conscious of the dangers of their work environments and are demanding adequate monitoring technologies as evidenced by the long-term, steady increase in chemical detector sales. This device will be used for the detection of chemicals such as Ammonia and VOC's with detection limits below current OSHA accepted levels.</AbstractNarration>
