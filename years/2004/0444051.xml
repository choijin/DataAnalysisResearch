<AbstractNarration>In recent years, revolutionary progress has occurred in the scientific understanding and technological applications of materials that derive their functionality from nanometer-sized particles and/or ultrathin films of one or a few atomic monolayers.  One can now engineer materials at the atomic level and study the structure and dynamics of individual particles with nanometer resolution microscopies.  These exciting experimental and technological developments are matched by novel computational algorithms and computer architectures that make it possible to numerically study dynamic effects in theoretical models of such materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:  This award will support theoretical and computational research to further develop novel simulation algorithms for hysteresis and thermally driven magnetization reversal in models of nanoscale ferromagnets.  The research will improve the understanding of dynamical phenomena in real nanoscale ferromagnetic materials at nonzero temperature over a large range of time scales.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:  Improved basic understanding of the dynamics of magnetization switching and hysteresis in real nanoscale magnetic materials will result.  This will clarify the relations between materials structure and dynamics and, at the same time, data integrity and read/write speed in future ultra-high density magnetic recording media and magnetic random access memories.  Students at all levels will be involved with this project.&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;In recent years, revolutionary progress has occurred in the scientific understanding and technological applications of materials that derive their functionality from nanometer-sized particles and/or ultrathin films of one or a few atomic monolayers.
