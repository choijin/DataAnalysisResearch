<AbstractNarration>This award, supported by the Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS) Office of Multidisciplinary Activities, will provide funds for a workshop to address support for theory throughout the MPS Directorate.  The MPS Directorate includes the Divisions of Astronomical Sciences, Chemistry, Materials Research, Mathematical Sciences, and Physics.  The workshop is being held at the request of the MPS Advisory Committee (MPSAC).  The workshop will survey some of the exciting theoretical science being pursued in MPS and identify challenges and opportunities for the MPS support of theory in the 21st century.  The workshop will also survey the various funding modalities for theory, as well as education and workforce issues.  In coordination with MPS, the workshop is being organized by a Steering Committee (SC) comprised of members of the MPSAC plus additional ad hoc members to provide balance.   The SC will be responsible for writing a report summarizing the findings of the workshop including recommendations.  The report will be presented to the MPSAC for its consideration. &lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;This award, supported by the Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS) Office of Multidisciplinary Activities, will provide funds for a workshop to address support for theory throughout the MPS Directorate.
