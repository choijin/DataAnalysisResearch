    <AbstractNarration>Proposal DMS-0400526&lt;br/&gt;PI: Israel-Michael Sigal, University of Notre Dame&lt;br/&gt; Project title: Quantum and Classical Evolution&lt;br/&gt; Project abstract:&lt;br/&gt; In this project the PI addresses problems of long-time and asymptotic&lt;br/&gt;evolution in quantum and classical field theories. More specifically, he&lt;br/&gt;aims to&lt;br/&gt;(A) Determine the resonance structure of and construct the scattering theory&lt;br/&gt;for systems of non-relativistic particles such as atoms and molecules&lt;br/&gt;interacting with the quantized electromagnetic field;&lt;br/&gt;(B) Construct scattering theory and the theory of periodic/quasiperiodic&lt;br/&gt;motion of solitons (or solitaty wave solutions) for the nonlinear&lt;br/&gt;Schroedinger equation with an external&lt;br/&gt;potential;&lt;br/&gt;(C) Construct theory of tunneling for solitons in the nonlinear Schroedinger&lt;br/&gt;equation with an external potential and in the (second) quantized version of&lt;br/&gt;this equation.&lt;br/&gt; Mathematically, these problems deal with linear partial differential&lt;br/&gt;equations in an infinite number of variables (A) and with nonlinear partial&lt;br/&gt;differential equations with interplay between the nonlinearity and geometry&lt;br/&gt;of the external potentials (B) as well as with the problems bridging both&lt;br/&gt;frameworks (C).&lt;br/&gt; The problems above originate in our trying to describe some&lt;br/&gt;basic physical phenomena such as emission and absorption of radiation by&lt;br/&gt;quantum, non-relativistic systems (e.g., atoms and molecules) and dynamics&lt;br/&gt;of Bose-Einstein condensates. They also play an important role in&lt;br/&gt;technological applications, e.g. optical communication. It is hoped that the&lt;br/&gt;results the research to be undertaken will provide conceptual and unifying&lt;br/&gt;underpinning to a&lt;br/&gt;more quantative (phenomenological, numerical and&lt;br/&gt;experimental) physical treatment.&lt;br/&gt; In selecting the research projects above the PI was guided by their&lt;br/&gt;importance, possibility of the emergence of new mathematics and by the&lt;br/&gt;availability of tools and ideas to start probing them. These projects will&lt;br/&gt;also provide fertile ground for excellent&lt;br/&gt;entry problems for graduate students, postdocs and beginning faculty whom&lt;br/&gt;the PI will supervise and mentor.</AbstractNarration>
