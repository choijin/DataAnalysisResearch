<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Microorganisms account for the vast majority of the world's biomass, and their diversity surpasses that of all other organisms.  They play a central role in many aspects of the Earth's natural history, including the regeneration of nutrients, the breakdown of pollutants and the formation of minerals.   Despite their numerical dominance and central ecological importance, microbial biodiversity remains poorly understood.  This is due in part to the disciplinary boundaries that tend to separate microbiologists involved in microbial diversity studies from ecologists involved in the general study of biodiversity. A symposium has been organized that will bridge this separation.  This symposium has been included in the program for the Ecological Society of America (ESA) Annual Meeting (August 1-6, 2004) in Portland, Oregon. The annual ESA meeting is the largest and most significant meeting of ecologists.  Our symposium, entitled "Is Microbial Ecology Fundamentally Different? New Insights into Patterns and Controls of Microbial Diversity," will break new ground by facilitating interdisciplinary research involving microbiologists and ecologists. A major goal of the symposium is to integrate the work of microbiologists with the latest trends in ecological theory and practice (until now, developed largely through the study of macro-organisms).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Among the most critical challenges facing humanity are the conservation, restoration and wise management of the Earth's diverse living resources.  To meet these challenges, society requires basic information concerning how these resources are generated and maintained. Characterizing patterns in the diversity of life is a critical first step toward providing this understanding.  Documenting patterns in microbial diversity is especially critical given the ecological importance of microbes and our relative ignorance regarding their diversity.  The proposed symposium will provide a unique venue for exchanging information regarding patterns in microbial diversity, and for promoting collaborative research, nationally and internationally, between microbial and general ecologists regarding microbial diversity patterns.  The program will serve as a platform to promote women and early-career researchers as leaders in this emerging area, as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
