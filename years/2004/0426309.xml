<AbstractNarration>The American Geophysical Union (AGU) will support participation by around 95 young U.S. students and scientists in six Assemblies of eight Associations of the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics (IUGG) in 2004 and 2005.  These Assemblies are those of the: International Association of Volcanology and Chemistry of the Earth's Interior (IAVCEI), 14-19 November 2004, Pucon, Chile; International Association of Hydrological Sciences (IAHS), 4-9 April 2005, Foz de Iguassu, Brazil; International Association of Geomagnetism and Aeronomy (IAGA), 18-29 July 2005, Toulouse, France; International Association of Meteorology and Atmospheric Sciences (IAMAS), 2-11 August 2005, Beijing, China; (the Joint Assembly of the) International Association of Geodesy (IAG); the International Association for the Physical Sciences of the Oceans (IAPSO) and the International Association for Biological Oceanography (IABO), 22-26 August 2005, Cairns, Australia; and International Association of Seismology and Physics of the Earth's Interior (IASPEI), 2-8 October 2005, Santiago, Chile.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;These Assemblies will provide extraordinary opportunities for the next generation of geophysical scientists from the United States to meet and interact with scientists from throughout the world.  Young scientists from the 76 IUGG member nations and from some non-member countries will exchange observations and ideas and to plan future cooperative efforts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The AGU will announce widely in the U.S. scientific community the opportunity for young U.S. scientists to apply for these travel grants.  The grants will be restricted to U.S. citizens and foreign citizens who are permanent resident scientists working at U.S. institutions, but membership in AGU will not be required.  Prior to receiving their grants, all successful applicants will designate in writing that they accept the travel funds, that they will attend the entire meeting, that they will travel by a U.S.-flag carrier in accordance with appropriate USG policies and regulations, that they will provide receipts for all claimed expenses, and that they will provide to the AGU a written report of their participation in the Assembly.  The AGU will analyze these reports and make such analyses available as appropriate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
