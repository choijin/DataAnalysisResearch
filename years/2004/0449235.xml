<AbstractNarration>This proposal focuses on two different aspects of modern atomic and optical physics. The research part is directed toward studying the exciting phenomena resulting from the interaction of a macroscopic number of quantum systems (atoms) with an ultra short and ultraintense laser pulse, in particular the extremely non-linear processes that lead to the generation of attosecond pulses. This will be accomplished through the development of an ab-initio, non-adiabatic&lt;br/&gt;theoretical model for the interaction of atoms in the gas phase with ultrashort laser pulses. This "numerical non-linear medium" (NNLM) will allow for the complete simulation of the most advanced short pulse laser experiments from first principles. This will involve the simultaneous solution of both the time-dependent Schroedinger equation (TDSE) and the Maxwell wave equation in real time, and will require large scale computations. All of the calculations envisioned are directly relevant to ongoing collaborations between the PI and three experimental groups at the forefront of strong field physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The education part is directed at the enhancement of secondary education teacher preparation via the development of a concept and inquiry based course on atomic and optical physics specifically directed toward physics majors with a secondary education concentration, which will meet objectives correlated with the National Science Education Standards. The course delivery will be based on emerging research in learning and model the type of standards-based teaching and learning that is currently expected of classroom teachers.  At Louisiana State University there is currently an urgent need to develop rigorous, content-based physics courses for secondary education teachers to better qualify them for teaching physics in grades 6-12. The proposed course will thus directly aid the physics teacher preparation and qualification in the state of Louisiana.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
