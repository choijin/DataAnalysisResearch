<AbstractNarration>     Using computational modeling, the investigator studies the&lt;br/&gt;spatiotemporal dynamics of intracellular calcium influx, diffusion&lt;br/&gt;and buffering in a synaptic terminal.  The particular phenomenon&lt;br/&gt;explored by the investigator is the short-term facilitation of&lt;br/&gt;synaptic response, that is, the transient increase in synaptic&lt;br/&gt;strength elicited with just a few action potentials, and decaying&lt;br/&gt;on time scales of tens to hundreds of milliseconds.  Facilitation&lt;br/&gt;is observed in a wide variety of systems, and must play an&lt;br/&gt;important role in neural dynamics and information processing. &lt;br/&gt;Although facilitation is known to depend on the presynaptic&lt;br/&gt;accumulation of residual calcium, its precise mechanisms are still&lt;br/&gt;under debate.  The investigator focuses on the role of endogenous&lt;br/&gt;calcium buffers in several different mechanisms previously&lt;br/&gt;proposed to explain facilitation.  Among such mechanisms is buffer&lt;br/&gt;saturation, recently shown experimentally to underlie facilitation&lt;br/&gt;at certain central synapses, and a facilitation model relying on&lt;br/&gt;both free and bound residual calcium.  The study concentrates on&lt;br/&gt;two model systems that have been widely used to explore the&lt;br/&gt;mechanisms of synaptic transmission: the crayfish neuromuscular&lt;br/&gt;junction and the auditory calyx of Held synapse.  The abundance of&lt;br/&gt;experimental data obtained at these synapses allows detailed&lt;br/&gt;modeling of the calcium-secretion coupling.  One of the main goals&lt;br/&gt;of this study is to explore how variations in endogenous buffering&lt;br/&gt;characteristics affect the spatiotemporal calcium concentration&lt;br/&gt;profile during trains of action potentials.  This in turn helps in&lt;br/&gt;elucidating the mechanisms of facilitation and in ascertaining the&lt;br/&gt;role of calcium buffers in these and other synapses.  Another&lt;br/&gt;objective of this work is to estimate the properties of endogenous&lt;br/&gt;buffers at the crayfish NMJ and at the calyx of Held.  A modeling&lt;br/&gt;approach is indispensable in this respect: apart from the over-all&lt;br/&gt;buffering capacity, the specific buffering properties are&lt;br/&gt;inaccessible to direct measurement at most synapses. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The investigator applies computational tools to the study of&lt;br/&gt;a fundamental biological process, that of the movement of calcium&lt;br/&gt;ions inside a cell.  It is known that calcium regulates a vast&lt;br/&gt;number of crucial biological events, such as gene transcription,&lt;br/&gt;muscle contraction, immune system response, and many others.  In&lt;br/&gt;order to understand how a single element can regulate such a&lt;br/&gt;diverse set of biological reactions, it is necessary to know in&lt;br/&gt;detail how calcium concentration is controlled inside a cell. &lt;br/&gt;This is particularly important for a better understanding of&lt;br/&gt;synaptic transmission, which is at the center of the&lt;br/&gt;investigator's work.  In synaptic transmission, the entry of&lt;br/&gt;calcium into the synapse causes the release of a neurotransmitter&lt;br/&gt;chemical, binding of which to the receptors of the neighboring&lt;br/&gt;neuron allows the electric activity to be transmitted from one&lt;br/&gt;cell to the next.  This is the fundamental process of&lt;br/&gt;communication between neurons in the nervous system.  It is&lt;br/&gt;interesting that the strength of the synaptic connection between&lt;br/&gt;two neurons does not remain the same, but is constantly changing. &lt;br/&gt;The investigator explores how the accumulation of calcium causes&lt;br/&gt;some synapses to temporarily increase (facilitate) their strength. &lt;br/&gt;Along with other forms of synaptic change (termed synaptic&lt;br/&gt;plasticity), such facilitation must play an important role in the&lt;br/&gt;functioning of the nervous system.  Apart from the immediate goal&lt;br/&gt;of further elucidating the synaptic transmission mechanisms, this&lt;br/&gt;study of intracellular calcium dynamics helps to shed light on&lt;br/&gt;other important biological processes that are also controlled by&lt;br/&gt;calcium.  Finally, this work contributes to the widening of the&lt;br/&gt;use of computational methods in biosciences, which is necessary in&lt;br/&gt;order to maintain the current rapid progress in biology. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
