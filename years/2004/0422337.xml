<AbstractNarration>Student success in computer science, engineering, and mathematics is commonly dependent on several factors. Over the years, the college's experience with both native and non-native student populations indicates that there are three particularly prevalent hurdles that the students face: adequate financial resources, adequate mathematics and science preparation, and academic focus. In addition, Native American students often face very significant acculturation issues. Addressing these issues in a student's academic life result in increased retention and overall academic success. The program is designed to address these factors through scholarships, early academic intervention and tutoring, and professional exposure. A significant infrastructure at the college has been successfully operating for decades that help Native American students adapt to the traditional college environment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The project is infusing seven academic support and retention components with existing student support services to create a seamless system of academic support for CSEMS scholars.  The objectives are designed to support the goals of the NSF CSEMS program. The project enhances the national workforce by increasing the number of Native American students capable and qualified to enter the high tech workforce.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objective 1: Increase matriculation, graduation, and retention rates of CSEMS academic disciplines by 5% each year of the project. &lt;br/&gt;Objective 2: Provide up to 29 scholarships per year to financially needy, academically talented students who meet the academic criteria and show a strong potential to be a successful CSEMS graduate. &lt;br/&gt;Objective 3: Provide academic support services that enhance the ability for CSEMS scholars to be more successful in degree achievement. &lt;br/&gt;Objective 4: Strengthen partnerships between the college and industry partners throughout the Four Corners Region. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The College is located within 150 miles of 25 Indian Reservations and continues to honor its historic commitment to Native Americans by offering tuition scholarships to Native Americans of all tribes who meet admission requirements.  Native Americans comprised 17% of the College's 4,347 enrolled students and represents about 100 tribes. Diversifying the High Tech Workforce through Increased Minority Participation project helps fill the need nationally and regionally for minorities in math and science fields.  It also serves a model for other institutions of higher education who work with minority populations.    &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
