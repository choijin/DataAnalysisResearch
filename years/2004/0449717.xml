<AbstractNarration>The research aspect of this CAREER project concerns the application of&lt;br/&gt;stochastic modeling and asymptotic techniques toward two problems in&lt;br/&gt;microbiology which can be cast within the framework of stochastic&lt;br/&gt;motion in random environments. First, a stochastic model will be&lt;br/&gt;developed to represent how water molecules interact with the surface&lt;br/&gt;of a protein.  Water plays a crucial role in the functioning of&lt;br/&gt;proteins, and must be accounted for in molecular dynamics simulations&lt;br/&gt;which attempt to predict the dynamics of a protein molecule.  The&lt;br/&gt;detailed inclusion of water molecules in such simulations is however&lt;br/&gt;very costly and limits the practical scope of these simulations.  The&lt;br/&gt;stochastic model for the water-protein interaction to be&lt;br/&gt;developed in the research is intended to&lt;br/&gt;provide a more efficient representation of the effects of water and&lt;br/&gt;thereby accelerate protein dynamics calculations.  It will consist of&lt;br/&gt;a lattice model parameterization of the chemistry and geometry of the&lt;br/&gt;protein surface and a generalized diffusion process for the water&lt;br/&gt;molecules moving in a potential induced by the surface lattice model.&lt;br/&gt;A second component of the proposed research is an extension of the&lt;br/&gt;analytical and computational methodology for modeling molecular motors&lt;br/&gt;to include more physical realism.  Asymptotic and stochastic&lt;br/&gt;techniques will be employed to characterize molecular motors operating&lt;br/&gt;in multiple dimensions and/or with multiple degrees of freedom, and to&lt;br/&gt;incorporate random modulations in the force potentials.  The Immersed&lt;br/&gt;Boundary computational method, recently extended to include thermal&lt;br/&gt;fluctuations, will be used to simulate molecular motor processes in a&lt;br/&gt;way which incorporates in a natural way osmotic effects and the&lt;br/&gt;dynamics of the fluid medium.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More broadly, this CAREER project comprises a research program and&lt;br/&gt;course developments at the undergraduate and graduate levels which&lt;br/&gt;will apply the principal investigator's prior experience in turbulence&lt;br/&gt;modeling to new problems in microbiology, and provide more systematic&lt;br/&gt;opportunities to communicate knowledge and problem-solving&lt;br/&gt;approaches to undergraduate and graduate students.  The research&lt;br/&gt;objective pertaining to the interaction between protein and water&lt;br/&gt;molecules has the potential for providing a significant speedup in&lt;br/&gt;simulations of protein dynamics by reducing the cost of modeling the&lt;br/&gt;effects of the water.  Accelerated protein dynamic simulations would&lt;br/&gt;expedite both our basic understanding of protein dynamics and the&lt;br/&gt;technological development of drugs and devices designed to interact&lt;br/&gt;with proteins.  Analytical and computational research on molecular&lt;br/&gt;motors will aim to improve the physical understanding of how&lt;br/&gt;biological cells move and transport material within themselves.  The&lt;br/&gt;broader impacts of the project include the interdisciplinary training&lt;br/&gt;of graduate students in mathematical and computational modeling in&lt;br/&gt;microbiology, the introduction of new graduate courses on stochastic&lt;br/&gt;modeling, the renovation of an undergraduate course on probability&lt;br/&gt;theory  to incorporate modern research&lt;br/&gt;efforts and issues as contexts for the learning of mathematical&lt;br/&gt;techniques, material to be posted on the World Wide Web to disseminate&lt;br/&gt;these pedagogical applications, and broader opportunities for&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate students to gain experience in mathematical modeling.</AbstractNarration>
