    <AbstractNarration>Current wireless data networks, such as 802.11b/g/a (Wi-Fi) which are&lt;br/&gt;based on single antenna transmission are inefficient in terms of&lt;br/&gt;the number of users (capacity) that can be supported in a given area. &lt;br/&gt;It is well known that multiple antenna elements (arrays) can be combined with&lt;br/&gt;beamforming and space-time coding to greatly enhance the capacity of&lt;br/&gt;cellular networks. However, the use of antenna arrays to enhance &lt;br/&gt;capacity in Ad hoc networks (i.e. when a base station is not available)&lt;br/&gt;is not well understood. The development of new beamforming &lt;br/&gt;and space-time coding techniques that exploit antenna arrays in Ad hoc &lt;br/&gt;networks will greatly increase the number of users and data rates that &lt;br/&gt;can be supported in future Wi-Fi and Wi-Max type applications, and &lt;br/&gt;reduce dependence on cellular and optical backbone infrastructures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project specifically develops and analyzes a class of &lt;br/&gt;distributed array processing algorithms for increasing Ad hoc wireless &lt;br/&gt;network capacity based on iterative minimum mean-square error &lt;br/&gt;(IMMSE) beamforming. In IMMSE, the transmit beamformer at each &lt;br/&gt;node is set to the conjugate of the conventional MMSE receive beamformer &lt;br/&gt;computed using a training sequence. IMMSE is then studied using &lt;br/&gt;noncooperative game theory in order to obtain convergence and efficiency &lt;br/&gt;results. The IMMSE algorithm is extended to space-time coding to &lt;br/&gt;yield approximate solutions to maximizing decoupled Shannon &lt;br/&gt;capacities of Ad hoc networks. These IMMSE-Deflation (IMMSE-D)&lt;br/&gt;algorithms attempt to balance desired link capacity with a tax on&lt;br/&gt;interference to other links, and hence may offer better network&lt;br/&gt;throughput than greedy capacity-maximization algorithms. Overall&lt;br/&gt;network throughput is evaluated by embedding the IMMSE and IMMSE-D&lt;br/&gt;algorithms in a network simulation software package.</AbstractNarration>
