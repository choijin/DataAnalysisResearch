<AbstractNarration>This proposal  aims  to develop  highly  programmable  and efficient .bottom-up. methods  for &lt;br/&gt;constructing nanoelectronic circuits, using DNA nanoarchitectures as scaffolds and sequence &lt;br/&gt;specific molecular lithography as a tool to combinatorially organize metallic and semiconducting &lt;br/&gt;nanowires  into  rationally  designed  ensembles  with  potential  applications  of  self-assembling &lt;br/&gt;functional nanoelectronic devices. Designer DNA nanoscaffolds are emerging as the material of &lt;br/&gt;choice for creating sophisticated nanopatterns with the potential capability to pattern nano-scale &lt;br/&gt;objects with addressability, but their successful integration with functional nanomaterials requires &lt;br/&gt;interdisciplinary studies. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit of proposed research: &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The  programmed  and  efficient  self-assembly  of  rationally  defined  nanoelectronic  circuit &lt;br/&gt;patterns  is  presently  one  of  the  outstanding  challenges  in  nanotechnology.  The main research &lt;br/&gt;objective  of  this  collaborative  project  is  to  demonstrate  that  self-assembly  of  addressable &lt;br/&gt;molecular  lithographic  template  can  be  achieved  using  DNA  based  self-assembly.  A  team  has &lt;br/&gt;been assembled whose collective expertise can comprehensively address the most pressing issues &lt;br/&gt;in developing DNA nano-architectures as spatially addressable  templates  for metallic and &lt;br/&gt;semiconducting  nanowire  ensembles. Two  main  goals  will  be  achieved  through  this  proposed &lt;br/&gt;research:  1) Design and demonstrate self-assembly  of DNA nanostructures  to form patterned &lt;br/&gt;lattices containing sequence specific template for DNA based molecular lithography.  2) Bridge &lt;br/&gt;the gap between researches in DNA based molecular lithography and DNA self-assembly to &lt;br/&gt;develop  combinatorial  methods  for  highly  programmable  nanoelectronic  circuit  .bottom-up. &lt;br/&gt;assembly.   &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader impact of proposed research: &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this project include potentially significant influence on the production &lt;br/&gt;of  future  integrated  circuits  and  microprocessors.  Additional  impact  will  occur  in  educating &lt;br/&gt;students  about  the  various  aspects  of  constructing  nanoelectronic  systems.  Efforts  will  be &lt;br/&gt;continued in recruiting underrepresented students including minorities and women and train them &lt;br/&gt;in DNA based nanotechnology. Undergraduate and high school students will also be recruited to &lt;br/&gt;this  project.  Distribution  of  our  results  will  occur  through  various  scientific  publications, &lt;br/&gt;interactions with industrial partners, and through Duke University.s Center for Nano-science and &lt;br/&gt;Materials.  A  cohesive  set  of  courses  that  address  the  important  aspects  of  nanoscale computer &lt;br/&gt;device research will be designed. This includes topics in DNA Nanotechnology, Nanoelectronic &lt;br/&gt;Devices and Architectures. &lt;br/&gt;As another important educational component, a .DNA-based nanotechnology web site. aimed &lt;br/&gt;at  a  general  public  audience  will  be  designed. The PI  and  co-PI.s  access  to  talented  computer &lt;br/&gt;science students enable us to implement such a web site with a user-friendly interface. The impact &lt;br/&gt;of DNA nanotechnology can be brought to its full potential by integrating the proposed research &lt;br/&gt;with a complementary training and knowledge transfer program. A Web-based channel will help &lt;br/&gt;promote DNA nanotechnology in the public domain.  &lt;br/&gt;This proposal falls into the following EMT theme: advance the fundamental capabilities of &lt;br/&gt;computer  and  information  sciences  and  engineering  by  incorporating  insights  from  nanoscale &lt;br/&gt;science and engineering.</AbstractNarration>
