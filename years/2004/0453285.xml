<AbstractNarration>Bradley University in Peoria, IL, is recruiting six undergraduate students to participate in a 10-week intensive summer research program in ecology. Students will be exposed to molecular, physiological, organismal, community and ecosystem approaches. Although students will be responsible for a particular project in support of the common goal, they will also work collaboratively with other REU students and faculty mentors.  REU participants will be expected to submit a final report in journal format and to present their results at an in-house research symposium held at the conclusion of the summer.  In addition to undergrads, K-12 educators and local minority high school students will also be involved in research and other program activities. Students will be immersed in a culture that (1) integrates research and educational activities throughout and beyond the classroom, (2) fosters and supports multi-investigator, multi-institutional, cross-disciplinary collaborations, (3) introduces students to the broader scientific community through multiple university collaborations and research at multi-investigator research sites and (4) shows the highest commitment to supporting faculty-student research.  Selection criteria for REU participants include (1) a minimum grade point average of 3.0 and the successful completion of two years of Biology and one year of Chemistry; (2) letters of recommendation; (3) a statement of research interests; and (4) a statement of career goals.  Applicants not meeting the stated criteria will also be considered on a case-by-case basis. Minority students are encouraged to apply.
