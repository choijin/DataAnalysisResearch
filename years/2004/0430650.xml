<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to study the approximability measures and the design of heuristics for NP-hard optimiza-&lt;br/&gt;tion problems. This endeavor will result in the development of techniques that enable a deeper understanding&lt;br/&gt;of the principles that underlie the design of approximation algorithms for NP-hard problems. An approxima-&lt;br/&gt;tion algorithm is a polynomial time algorithm that produces solutions provably \close" to optimal.&lt;br/&gt;Many of the problems we study are graph theoretic. Graphs are powerful tools that can be employed to&lt;br/&gt;model objects, as well as the relationships between them. Indeed, many distinct optimization problems can be&lt;br/&gt;cast in graph theoretic terms. Specifically, graph theory provides an excellent way to model problems related&lt;br/&gt;to areas such as transportation, network design/routing, facility location, and cluster analysis. This powerful&lt;br/&gt;framework allows us to both develop and illustrate the power of different algorithmic tools. In addition to&lt;br/&gt;graph problems, we also study some fundamental scheduling, data management and broadcasting problems.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: An increased understanding of techniques to develop and apply approximation algo-&lt;br/&gt;rithms will have a significant impact on both research and practice. As we are well aware, NP complete&lt;br/&gt;problems are abundant in many scientific and engineering disciplines, any technique that effectively copes&lt;br/&gt;with this diffculty will have a significant impact on the design of heuristics.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The broader scientific goals are to both further the field of algorithms in terms of our&lt;br/&gt;understanding of what problems can be solved efficiently and what problems cannot. In addition, we explore&lt;br/&gt;applications of these algorithms in other areas such as networking, GRID computing, parallel computing etc.&lt;br/&gt;The project will train two full time PhD students in conducting research both in Universities and through&lt;br/&gt;internships during the summer at National Labs and Industrial Research Centers.</AbstractNarration>
