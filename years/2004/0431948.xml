<AbstractNarration>The School of Engineering &amp; Applied Science at Washington University in St. Louis has a new Program in Aerospace Engineering leading to a B.S. degree. This major was created based on student demand and strong endorsement from the Boeing, their principal aerospace employer. This planning grant has four objectives for modernizing their aerospace engineering curriculum: (1) Teach aerospace design  through hands-on design/build/fly projects; (2)  Integrate  these  design  projects  into  the  classroom at all grade levels; (3)  Integrate research into undergraduate-focused design projects; and (4) Improve the recruitment and retention of underrepresented  groups in aerospace engineering: An essential part of the improvement in curriculum is an improvement in the diversity of the student body. A student-built project is a natural showcase for outreach events and recruiting visits, which should be intentionally used to attract pre-college students from underrepresented groups. In addition, retention of students will be improved through the program's improved connection with faculty and mentoring opportunities across grade levels. At present, these four objectives are informally implemented for spacecraft design; students in aerospace, mechanical, electrical and computer engineering are developing a 30-kg nanosatellite through coursework and volunteer project work. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The goal of this planning grant is to define a process for an integrated hands-on project oriented curriculum for both the aircraft and spacecraft design tracks. These tracks will be available not only to aerospace engineering students but to students from other disciplines as well. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The reformed curriculum will enhance the critical thinking &amp; communication skills, provide cross-disciplinary exposure, encourage teamwork, mentoring and participation of minorities, and improve employment opportunities. It will provide a model for curriculum reform at other institutions. The state of Missouri has a four-university consortium in Aerospace Research &amp; Education, with Boeing as an industrial partner, which is also very interested in this modernization effort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
