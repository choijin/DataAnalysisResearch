<AbstractNarration> &lt;br/&gt;We propose a three-phase plan to gather and document novel thinking about the role of &lt;br/&gt;community in determining and supporting effective mathematics and science education in &lt;br/&gt;indigenous communities. We will convene an eclectic international group of innovators who &lt;br/&gt;have developed deep sensibilities about the social ideals, values, and behavioral standards that &lt;br/&gt;have shaped local approaches to successful schooling in mathematics and science. Each member &lt;br/&gt;will have a depth of experience thinking .outside the box. and creating successful innovations &lt;br/&gt;that make a meaningful difference in real communities. This shared experience of striving to &lt;br/&gt;develop solutions (against the odds) forms a common thread that we believe will help &lt;br/&gt;participants interweave their perspectives and intentions as a group.with a focus on articulating &lt;br/&gt;a set of truly transformative ideas about how community involvement in indigenous education &lt;br/&gt;can help all children learn mathematics and science. &lt;br/&gt;In Phase I, a small but representative international Working Group of primarily &lt;br/&gt;indigenous mathematics and science educators and researchers will convene in a five-day long &lt;br/&gt;institute. Deliberations will center on the role of community in determining and supporting &lt;br/&gt;education by navigating tensions among traditional/western mathematics and &lt;br/&gt;science/knowledge/approaches, culturally responsive curriculum, teacher preparation/cultural &lt;br/&gt;orientation, language revitalization and language maintenance, the indigenous research agenda, &lt;br/&gt;alternative assessment models, and technical assistance/support structures. Participants will &lt;br/&gt;report on their own work and come together for in-depth discussions in smaller work groups &lt;br/&gt;around specified sub-themes. By the end of the meeting, the Working Group will develop an &lt;br/&gt;agenda and plan of action that will guide future activities.  &lt;br/&gt;In Phase II, a nominated council of up to four individuals from the Working Group, will &lt;br/&gt;attend selected national meetings in mathematics, science, and indigenous education, and via a &lt;br/&gt;series of interactive workshops, panels, and/or individual presentations, introduce the Working &lt;br/&gt;Group.s vision and agenda, and elicit contributions from educators and community members &lt;br/&gt;similarly engaged in community-driven education.  &lt;br/&gt;In Phase III, two members of the Working Group will attend the triennial World &lt;br/&gt;Indigenous People.s conference, which hosts peoples from around the world who are committed &lt;br/&gt;to achieving reform and transformation of education. Working Group participants will offer &lt;br/&gt;workshops at this conference and seek counsel and input from this further extended group &lt;br/&gt;involved in like-minded efforts. A web-based interactive community will remain in place during &lt;br/&gt;all phases of the work to facilitate ready connection and communication. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: A growing group of knowledgeable mathematics and science educators and &lt;br/&gt;others who will continue to work toward defining indigenous ways of knowing and educational &lt;br/&gt;philosophies, inspire growing dialogues in uses of indigenous knowledge in schooling, and &lt;br/&gt;stimulate increased integration of indigenous knowledge in educational curriculum.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broad Impacts: Learnings will contribute to the emerging international body of scholarly work &lt;br/&gt;that delineates ways in which local cultural context fosters academic success in mathematics and &lt;br/&gt;science for all students. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
