<AbstractNarration>The main focus of this proposal is the conjugacy problem in braid groups,&lt;br/&gt;and ultimately in Garside and Artin groups and also in surface mapping&lt;br/&gt;class groups.   To begin, we propose to investigate the interface between&lt;br/&gt;two known approaches to the conjugacy problem in the braid groups: (a) the&lt;br/&gt;combinatorial solution that originated with the work of Frank Garside in&lt;br/&gt;1968; and (b) the dynamic approach which was first studied by Jakob&lt;br/&gt;Nielsen in 1932 and later given new meaning, in 1982, by William Thurston.&lt;br/&gt;We note that (a) gives a definitive test for when two braids are&lt;br/&gt;conjugate, whereas (b) gives less than that. On the other hand (a) is&lt;br/&gt;exponential in both word length and braid index, whereas (b) suggests the&lt;br/&gt;possible existence of a polynomial solution.  The moment seems to be ripe&lt;br/&gt;for an investigation which combines aspects of both. The new work of&lt;br/&gt;Gebhardt on (a) shows that the `Super Summit Set', a complete class&lt;br/&gt;invariant, can be replaced by the smaller `Ultra Summit Set'  (USS). Our&lt;br/&gt;hope is to use the known dynamic classification to study the USS. We will&lt;br/&gt;begin with a study of reducing curves for reducible braids, and go on to&lt;br/&gt;study finite order (FO) and pseudo-Anosov (PA) braids.   We conjecture&lt;br/&gt;that for braids in the USS the reducing curves can be chosen to be round&lt;br/&gt;circles which meet a line containing the punctures in 2 points.  We&lt;br/&gt;conjecture further that PA braids have `rigid powers whose combinatorics&lt;br/&gt;is particularly simple.  Looking at the braid group as a special case of&lt;br/&gt;mapping class groups, one then expects further that the associated train&lt;br/&gt;tracks will be special and interesting.  If all this goes well, there will&lt;br/&gt;be further problems to investigate, including related combinatorics in&lt;br/&gt;more general mapping class groups, and related dynamics in more general&lt;br/&gt;Garside and Artin groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In recent years there has been great interest in certain codes, in `Public&lt;br/&gt;Key Cryptography, which are based upon the use of braid groups.  The&lt;br/&gt;underlying idea has been that the so-called `word problem in the braid&lt;br/&gt;groups is known to have a solution which is fast. That is, the time&lt;br/&gt;required to check whether two words represent the same element in the&lt;br/&gt;braid group is known to be polynomial as a function of word length L and&lt;br/&gt;braid index N. On the other hand, the conjugacy problem, which is more&lt;br/&gt;difficult, has been thought to be fundamentally exponential in L and N.&lt;br/&gt;Like most such problems in complexity theory (e.g. the factorization of&lt;br/&gt;numbers into primes) the possibility always exists that a particular&lt;br/&gt;problem which was thought to be exponential will turn out to be polynomial&lt;br/&gt;if a more ingenious solution can be found.  The PI has been a leading&lt;br/&gt;expert in the study of braid groups for many years. She now proposes to&lt;br/&gt;investigate the conjugacy problem in the braid groups from a new point of&lt;br/&gt;view which she hopes will show it to be polynomial, like the word problem,&lt;br/&gt;in both L and N.  The underlying idea is to look at two very different&lt;br/&gt;approaches to the conjugacy problem, one based on `combinatorics and the&lt;br/&gt;other on `dynamics, and to apply ideas from the second approach to&lt;br/&gt;simplify the first.  If successful, this research would have implications&lt;br/&gt;in Public Key Cryptography as regards the security of codes based upon&lt;br/&gt;braid groups. It should also have many applications in mathematics because&lt;br/&gt;of the central role played by the braid groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
