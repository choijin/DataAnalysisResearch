<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Diamond-based electrodes are an exciting, recent development that promises major advantages over present electrode sensor technologies used in biomedical research. The main research objective of this project is to develop conductive, surface-functionalized at the nano-scale, diamond-based materials as superior electrodes for neurological sensing and stimulation. The novelty is that diamond provides a unique opportunity to integrate stimulation and sensing in the same device. This research is the basis of the PI's long-term efforts in engineering of bio-electrochemical materials. It will also be one of several focus areas incorporated into the proposed educational program: a research-oriented CENTER (Chemical ENgineering of Tomorrow - Experience Research) program benefiting both undergraduate and graduate students. Through the CENTER program, undergraduates will be exposed to a set of research-oriented courses and lab modules; select graduate students will teach the course blocks as mentored teaching experiences, providing them with professional development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit of Proposed Activities. (1) Diamond-based electrodes will provide real-time neurological sensing capability, with greatly improved sensitivity, selectivity and stability, as well as an expanded potential range of operation over present materials. These advantages will be demonstrated through in vitro sensing of dopamine and adenosine. (2) The well-defined surface chemistry of diamond permits functionalization to likely provide specific chemical interactions that can discriminate between bioanalytes. (3) The highly stable response of diamond should also provide advantage for measurement of action potentials. (4) Diamond electrodes may expand neural stimulation capabilities by avoiding water hydrolysis that leads to tissue damage and by providing long-term stability. These capabilities, if achieved, will be applicable to a broad variety of neurological systems.  (5) Through use of diamond-based sensors, much may be learned of the role of dopamine as a modulatory neurotransmitter in the neural circuitry that controls feeding behaviors in the Aplysia Californica (sea slug). Lastly, (6) the ability to detect adenosine in vitro in real-time is novel and will help elucidate its role in modulating the neurons responsible for the initiation of respiratory rhythm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of Proposed Activities. Research impacts: (1) The proposed project should provide the basis of a whole class of robust, diamond-based devices for neurological applications, which could be extended into broader areas of biomedical research. (2) Nano-Functionalized diamond surfaces may provide application in a variety of areas including catalysis. (3) Diamond's higher sensitivity may provide researchers with a tool to monitor natural neurodynamic behaviors instead of those amplified by electrical stimulation. (4) Diamond's capability for long-term continuous monitoring of dopamine could eventually lead to development of implantable dopamine sensors for patients with these illnesses. (5) Novel, realtime measurement of adenosine levels in vitro could provide many future directions in understanding adenosine modulatory mechanisms. (6) The ability to simultaneously measure dopamine and adenosine could provide insight into their coupled roles in Parkinson's disease. (7) Superior, stable diamond-based neural stimulation devices may lead to development of robust neural prostheses. Lastly, (8) Diamond in an integrated sensing and stimulation device would be capable of both manipulating specific neural activity and monitoring the effects on other neurons in space and in real-time, providing a versatile, implantable neural control device.  Educational Impacts: (1) The CENTER program will strengthen the integration of research and teaching in the PI's laboratory and the chemical engineering department. (2) This mentored teaching experience could provide a cornerstone for a graduate professional development program at Case, to use as a model at other universities. (3) The program will generate a stronger pool of future new faculty who will be better teachers and better oriented about faculty life. Finally, (4) through the CENTER program, undergraduates should be better prepared for research or industrial careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
