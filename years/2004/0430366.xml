<AbstractNarration>OUTLIER IDENTIFICATION AND HANDLING IN COMPUTATIONAL GEOMETRY&lt;br/&gt;PROBLEMS&lt;br/&gt;Computational geometry problems arise in all areas of science and engineering, in contexts&lt;br/&gt;such as computer vision, machine learning, data mining, classification, data compression,&lt;br/&gt;geographic information systems, clustering, and facility location. Advances in computational&lt;br/&gt;geometry can yield advances in robotics, genomics, and proteomics, to mention three areas&lt;br/&gt;of pressing interest.&lt;br/&gt;Increasing concern in computational geometry problems is being devoted to outliers,&lt;br/&gt;points in the input data whose removal can yield significant improvements in attainable&lt;br/&gt;optimal values of objective functions. Recent treatments giving attention to outliers involve&lt;br/&gt;quite appealing methods with good results, but these have been ad hoc solutions, specific to&lt;br/&gt;particular problem contexts and entailing restrictive assumptions. It would be desirable to&lt;br/&gt;derive such approaches in a systematic manner from general principles and guidelines, and&lt;br/&gt;to evaluate and compare outlier procedures on such a basis. To date, however, no systematic&lt;br/&gt;approach for handling outliers in computational geometry problems has been set forth, nor&lt;br/&gt;has there been advanced a set of specific criteria to be satisfied by outlier procedures.&lt;br/&gt;Through interdisciplinary collaboration between a computer scientist and a statistical&lt;br/&gt;scientist, this project will develop an outlier identification and handling approach as a new&lt;br/&gt;and versatile tool in computational geometry. Structures of a general nature for effective&lt;br/&gt;outlier identifiers will be formulated. Criteria to be satisfied and desirable qualitative features&lt;br/&gt;will be formulated. Issues such as robustness of outlier identifiers will be addressed. Efficient&lt;br/&gt;computing algorithms will be developed. Significant restrictions on current approaches will&lt;br/&gt;be relaxed.&lt;br/&gt;The project will focus on outlier handling in shape fitting and dimension reduction prob-&lt;br/&gt;lems. A leading tool will be depth functions, an emerging methodology in nonparametric&lt;br/&gt;multivariate data analysis that is useful for description of distributions and data sets and in-&lt;br/&gt;herently supports characterization of outlyingness for points in a data input. As a byproduct,&lt;br/&gt;the project will obtain advances in depth function methods as well.&lt;br/&gt;One proposer has been developing efficient algorithms in computational geometry, the&lt;br/&gt;other developing depth and outlier methods in multivariate data analysis. One proposer co-&lt;br/&gt;organized, and both proposers participated in, the recent NSF-sponsored Workshop on Data&lt;br/&gt;Depth: Robust Multivariate Analysis, Computational Geometry and Applications (DIMACS,&lt;br/&gt;2003), which fostered the collaboration for this research project.&lt;br/&gt;The leading intellectual merit of this project is to advance the foundations of computer&lt;br/&gt;science by providing a general and fundamental method that replaces ad hoc approaches to&lt;br/&gt;outlier handling. Also, the findings will advance the field of statistical science in the area of&lt;br/&gt;nonparametric multivariate data analysis.&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the project include strengthening of the interface between computer&lt;br/&gt;science and statistical science and involvement of graduate and undergraduate students&lt;br/&gt;within a team approach as part of their academic experience. Through its wide applica-&lt;br/&gt;bility the findings of this project will have immediate and central relevance to many areas&lt;br/&gt;of science, engineering and government. The PIs will maintain a web site on which project&lt;br/&gt;results are made known and available to the public at large.</AbstractNarration>
