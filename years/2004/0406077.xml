<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0406077&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Motohico Mulase&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project is aimed at generalizing one of the recent&lt;br/&gt;developments in the area of Gromov-Witten theory of compact&lt;br/&gt;Riemann surfaces to the case of non-orientable surfaces. In the&lt;br/&gt;area of complex and symplectic geometry, integrable systems, and&lt;br/&gt;mathematical physics, amazing new developments have been achieved&lt;br/&gt;in recent years. At the time of their discovery in 1985,&lt;br/&gt;Donaldson invariants of differentiable four manifolds, Jones&lt;br/&gt;polynomials of knots and links, and Gromov's idea of pseudo-&lt;br/&gt;holomorphic curves were considered as independent entities.&lt;br/&gt;Since the time of Atiyah's provocative lecture in 1988, their&lt;br/&gt;hidden inter-relations have been emerged. Through the work of&lt;br/&gt;many mathematicians and physicists, a clearer picture of the&lt;br/&gt;connection of these theories is revealed. Most recently, more&lt;br/&gt;direct relations have been discovered, through calculation of the&lt;br/&gt;generating function of these invariants and their association&lt;br/&gt;with integrable systems and representation theory. Among them is&lt;br/&gt;the work of Okounkov and Pandharipande, who determined the&lt;br/&gt;Gromov-Witten invariants of an arbitrary compact Riemann surface&lt;br/&gt;as the target space. Their fundamental results include a proof of&lt;br/&gt;the conjectured Virasoro constraints, identification of the&lt;br/&gt;generating function of the invariants of the Riemann sphere as a&lt;br/&gt;solution to the two-dimensional Toda lattice equations through&lt;br/&gt;Fermionic Fock representation, and a new proof of the&lt;br/&gt;Witten-Kontsevich theory of intersection of cohomology classes on&lt;br/&gt;the moduli space of Riemann surfaces. We propose to establish&lt;br/&gt;Gromov-Witten theory of real algebraic curves without boundary,&lt;br/&gt;and obtain the counterpart of the above theorems for the case of&lt;br/&gt;non-orientable surfaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The topological and geometric structures of various kinds of&lt;br/&gt;spaces have attracted intensive research in mathematics and&lt;br/&gt;mathematical physics for many decades. Poincare's idea on&lt;br/&gt;homology and homotopy theories have proven to be useful&lt;br/&gt;throughout the 20th century. The applications of these theories&lt;br/&gt;are seen in physics, chemistry, and understanding the dynamical&lt;br/&gt;properties of DNA.  Only toward the end of the previous century&lt;br/&gt;mathematics has encountered a true generalization of the ideas of&lt;br/&gt;Poincare, applicable to the particularly interesting spaces&lt;br/&gt;(called symplectic manifolds) that appear naturally in any kinds&lt;br/&gt;of mechanics and dynamics. The new invariants, known as the&lt;br/&gt;Gromov-Witten invariants of symplectic spaces, have shown&lt;br/&gt;extremely mysterious connections to almost all areas of&lt;br/&gt;mathematics. Mathematicians feel quite happily that they&lt;br/&gt;understand the homology and homotopy theories very well. Compared&lt;br/&gt;to that level, our current understanding of the Gromov-Witten&lt;br/&gt;theory is at the best very limited, and the whole subject is&lt;br/&gt;still filled with mysteries. We believe that to have a deeper&lt;br/&gt;understanding of the theory, we should generalize it further and&lt;br/&gt;include the consideration of new cases never done before.  The&lt;br/&gt;proposed project is aimed at discovering a generalization of the&lt;br/&gt;theory in a particular context, using non-orientable surfaces.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
