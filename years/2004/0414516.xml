    <AbstractNarration>This application requests partial funding to support the Laser Interactions with Materials conference to be held August 1 to 6, 2004 at Proctor Academy in Andover New Hampshire. The primary goal of this conference is to bring together investigators from diverse disciplines studying a wide variety of materials systems to share their approaches and progress in unraveling basic mechanisms and applications that arise from laser/material interactions. Such a multidisciplinary conference is ideal for the isolated, informal atmosphere typical of Gordon Conferences, known for facilitating crosstalk and synthesizing novel viewpoints across wide ranging interests. The conference will consist of nine formal sessions, each consisting of 3 oral presentations with an introduction by a leading scientist in the area, and two evening poster sessions. Invited speakers have been selected on the basis of their relevant expertise while emphasizing a program with gender balance, minority representation, and participation of young investigators that show promise as future scientific leaders. Topics of high current interest which will be covered include applications to laser processing, applications to nanotechnology, optoelectronics, and future electronics systems; life sciences and medicine; and applications of ultrafast lasers to further our understanding surface phenomena. This unique mix of topics illustrates the rich diversity of interest in the laser-materials community. In addition, informal workshops will be held on new developments in education of scientists and engineers and on the latest trends in research and development funding.</AbstractNarration>
