    <AbstractNarration>DMS-0405084&lt;br/&gt;Title: Blow-up problems in geometric heat equations&lt;br/&gt;PI: Sigurd Angnent, University of Wisconsin (Madison)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI intends to study the singularities of solutions to nonlinear&lt;br/&gt;heat equations which occur in differential geometry. The PI is&lt;br/&gt;particularly interested in giving precise quantitative descriptions of&lt;br/&gt;these singularities. Such descriptions must generally be given in&lt;br/&gt;terms of so-called "matched asymptotic expansions." Methods for&lt;br/&gt;computing such expansions are known in applied mathematics, but there&lt;br/&gt;is a shortage of techniques for proving the validity of the computed&lt;br/&gt;expansions (when they actuallly are valid).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI has in the past given rigorous asymptotic descriptions for a&lt;br/&gt;number of nonlinear heat flows (curve shortening, mean curvature&lt;br/&gt;flow). In the current proposal the PI mentions a number of new&lt;br/&gt;problems which he would like to study. These new problems are on one&lt;br/&gt;hand similar to the previously studied problems, but on the other hand&lt;br/&gt;the old methods don't seem directly applicable. In addition, much of&lt;br/&gt;the previous work was in a sense "one-dimensional" in that symmetry&lt;br/&gt;assumptions were used to simplify the situation. In the next few years&lt;br/&gt;the PI would like to address less symmetric problems, to see if the&lt;br/&gt;matched asymptotic expansions can also be obtained in truly higher&lt;br/&gt;dimensional settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Apart from his interest in pure mathematics, the PI is also involved&lt;br/&gt;in a collaboration with biomedical engineers, in which mathematical&lt;br/&gt;problems related to differential geometry and PDE in Medical Imaging&lt;br/&gt;are addressed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact: Due to his interest in medical imaging, the PI serves&lt;br/&gt;as a resource for biomedical engineers (both his collaborators who are&lt;br/&gt;off campus, and the medical engineering faculty &amp; grad students on the&lt;br/&gt;UW Madison campus). Knowledge of newer applications of differential&lt;br/&gt;geometry in medical imaging and computer vision enhances the PI's&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate classes (e.g. the planned creation of an advanced&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate course on mathematical methods of medical imaging) and&lt;br/&gt;in the long run inspires new problems in pure mathematics.</AbstractNarration>
