    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit- Ceratopsians are among the best known of dinosaur clades due to their&lt;br/&gt;relative abundance, and the remarkable diversity of cranial synapomorphies such as horns&lt;br/&gt;and frills that diagnose more derived members of the clade. Gigantism is a trend in&lt;br/&gt;ceratopsian evolution that is accompanied by the evolution of progressively more&lt;br/&gt;complex feeding mechanisms and cranial display diversity. Heterochrony, and in&lt;br/&gt;particular peramorphosis have been proposed as major influences in ceratopsian&lt;br/&gt;evolution to explain the evolution towards large size and late ontogenetic genesis of the&lt;br/&gt;display in advanced forms. Likewise, the apparent hierarchical complexity of the feeding&lt;br/&gt;apparatus suggests an evolution of character integration through both ontogeny and&lt;br/&gt;phylogeny. All of these evolutionary hypotheses require detailed knowledge of both the&lt;br/&gt;development and phylogeny of ceratopsian dinosaurs, but so far age estimates have been&lt;br/&gt;poorly constrained and non-quantified and rigorous reliance on detailed phylogenies&lt;br/&gt;limited.&lt;br/&gt;In this study, an innovative approach to developmentally staging fossils based on&lt;br/&gt;histological sectioning and Developmental Mass extrapolation is combined with novel&lt;br/&gt;tree-based methods toward studying heterochrony and integration using a well-&lt;br/&gt;established phylogeny of Ceratopsia. Based on well-sampled growth series of seven&lt;br/&gt;-backbone taxa representing the diversity of the clade, and a detailed phylogeny of&lt;br/&gt;ceratopsians, we will examine whether there are correlated shifts in developmental timing&lt;br/&gt;of synapomorphies (heterochrony) relative to growth strategies, and also if blocks of&lt;br/&gt;characters represent integrated modules that fulfill criteria for being phylogenetically and&lt;br/&gt;ontogenetically constrained. These quantitative studies will allow us to evaluate previous&lt;br/&gt;hypotheses on the role heterochrony and integration have played in ceratopsian evolution.&lt;br/&gt;By providing a quantified understanding of when in ontogeny synapomorpies are&lt;br/&gt;expressed this research will help to resolve several taxonomic quandaries related to the&lt;br/&gt;validity of species based on juvenile holotypes and provide a more accurate&lt;br/&gt;understanding of ceratopsian diversity.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: This research represents a new integrative exploration of evolutionary&lt;br/&gt;processes in a well-known group of dinosaurs. The novel methods and the results of this&lt;br/&gt;research promise to be widely applicable to fields as diverse as population biology,&lt;br/&gt;developmental biology, macroevolution and evo-devo, and will be disseminated through&lt;br/&gt;peer -reviewed journals, presentations at professional meetings and professional web-&lt;br/&gt;sites. Two graduate and two undergraduate students will be trained through this project,&lt;br/&gt;and aspects of the research will be incorporated into university courses taught by both&lt;br/&gt;PIs. Both PIs are involved with developing exhibits for natural history museum, and&lt;br/&gt;parts of this research will be incorporated into two ongoing exhibit projects, and&lt;br/&gt;associated educational web-sites and programming. Given the media interest in dinosaur&lt;br/&gt;research, many opportunities to disseminate results of this work to the public will no&lt;br/&gt;doubt arise.</AbstractNarration>
