    <AbstractNarration>Conference on Complex Analysis, Differential Geometry, and Partial Differential Equations&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a week-long conference on the many aspects of&lt;br/&gt;complex analysis, differential geometry, and partial&lt;br/&gt;differential equations centered around the theme of&lt;br/&gt;canonical metrics in geometry. Of particular importance&lt;br/&gt;are recent developments such as multiplier ideal sheaves,&lt;br/&gt;Bergman kernels and asymptotic stability in geometric&lt;br/&gt;invariant theory, Hamiltonian dynamics and complex Monge-Ampere&lt;br/&gt;equations, geometric heat flows, and energy functionals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Canonical metrics involve typically a non-linear system&lt;br/&gt;of partial differential equations, where the unknown is a&lt;br/&gt;tensor. They arise from geometry and topology, but they&lt;br/&gt;are also closely to basic equations from theoretical&lt;br/&gt;physics such as Yang-Mills equations and Einstein's&lt;br/&gt;equations in general relativity. They are usually very&lt;br/&gt;difficult to solve, but there has been recently an influx&lt;br/&gt;of new ideas from many different directions. This conference&lt;br/&gt;will help cross-fertilization of ideas between the leading&lt;br/&gt;experts, and introduce a new generation of young students&lt;br/&gt;and postdoctoral researchers to problems and methods in the&lt;br/&gt;area.</AbstractNarration>
