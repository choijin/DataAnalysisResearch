<AbstractNarration>Geology (42); Anthropology (81) This project is implementing hands-on, problem based, geophysical learning in both new and existing undergraduate laboratory and research courses.   The new courses facilitated by this project are an intensive four-week geoarchaeological field course during the January Interim term, and eight-week student research experiences conducted in the summer.  In both the new and existing courses, collaborative problem-based geological and geoarchaeological investigations are being conducted using magnetic, resistivity, and electromagnetic (ground penetrating radar) surveys.  This incorporation of current geophysical methods and theory in real-world, hands-on learning experiences is an adaptation of two previously successful NSF supported projects, one at the University of Akron, in Ohio and the other at the Summer of Applied Geophysical Experience (SAGE) conducted annually in New Mexico.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of this project lies in its ability to make geophysical learning experiences attractive and valuable for undergraduates, and through bringing multiple geophysical survey techniques to bear on the same geological or archaeological situation, facilitating comparative and holistic investigation and collaboration.  The broader impacts of this project include reaching a cross-disciplinary audience, and its focus on investigations of significant local interest.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
