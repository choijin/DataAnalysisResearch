<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for the conduct of the annual National Science Foundation Design, Service and Manufacturing Research Conference. This conference brings together researchers in all program areas within the Division of Design, Manufacture and Industrial Innovation (DMII), and researchers from related programs in the Divisions of Engineering Education and Centers (EEC), Electrical and Communication Systems (ECS), Civil and Mechanical Structures (CMS), Information and Intelligent Systems (IIS), Materials Research (DMR), International Programs (INT), and Social, Behavioral, and Economic Research (SBE), specifically the Innovation and Organizational Change Program (IOC). Grantees will present their research in poster sessions and attend sessions covering topics that extend beyond their immediate area of research. Ongoing research in manufacturing related research activities are presented by the grantees from the Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT), Mexico, and grantees from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) and the National Research Council (NRC), Canada. The conference seeks to ensure that the individual researchers supported by NSF are informed about the ongoing activities of their colleagues, eliminate duplication of efforts and foster a higher degree of cooperation among researchers.  In addition, the conference allows all Principal Investigators to meet each other and to meet with their respective NSF Program Officers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of the conference are: (1) to broaden the outlook of all participants; (2) promote transfer of ideas and technology from one area of research to another; (3) to allow those working in a related area of research to get to know their peers so as to avoid duplication of research and to encourage cooperation, and (4) to allow personal contacts from the collective research community, the NSF, CONACyT, NSERC, and NRC program staff to discuss manufacturing research in detail, clarifying issues and  problems in ongoing projects.</AbstractNarration>
