<AbstractNarration>Project Summary&lt;br/&gt;The proposal seeks NSF support for twelve controls and signal processing researchers&lt;br/&gt;and teachers from the U.S.A. to attend a joint Balkan/USA/EC/Japan workshop on&lt;br/&gt;research and education in control and signal processing. Similar proposals have been&lt;br/&gt;submitted to the EC and Japan to support attendance by members of those communities.&lt;br/&gt;Approximately three-dozen attendees from the Balkans are expected.&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of having a delegation of twelve Americans participate in such a&lt;br/&gt;workshop is in the opportunities to learn from the other participants and in the&lt;br/&gt;opportunities to teach them. There will be many attendees who are outstanding in their&lt;br/&gt;specialties. Because of the recent troubles in the Balkans, many of their excellent&lt;br/&gt;researchers have been isolated from the rest of the research community. This will be an&lt;br/&gt;opportunity for us to learn of their work and for them to catch up with what we have been&lt;br/&gt;doing.&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of such a joint workshop are large. First, the Balkan countries have&lt;br/&gt;been a source of many outstanding researchers in the past. The workshop will help bring&lt;br/&gt;younger researchers and students from the Balkans into the broader international research&lt;br/&gt;community. Second, the meeting itself will help foster further collaboration between the&lt;br/&gt;participants, their institutions, and their countries. Lastly, such meetings generally&lt;br/&gt;contribute to broader understanding among people and nations.</AbstractNarration>
