    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0405385&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Jianguo Cao&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Cao plans to continue his research on the geometric&lt;br/&gt;analysis of semi-hyperbolic spaces with a particular emphasis on&lt;br/&gt;non-positively curved manifolds of rank one. Among all compact&lt;br/&gt;non-positively curved manifolds of rank one, the principal&lt;br/&gt;investigator plans to continue his study of the higher&lt;br/&gt;dimensional generalized graph-manifolds. He would like to&lt;br/&gt;investigate relations among Gromov's minimal volume gap&lt;br/&gt;conjecture, F-structure theory and semi-rigidity for&lt;br/&gt;non-positively curved manifolds. Using the F-structure theory&lt;br/&gt;developed by Cheeger and Gromov, the hopes to show that if a&lt;br/&gt;manifold M admits a metric of non-positive sectional curvature,&lt;br/&gt;then either M has non-vanishing minimal volume or M is a&lt;br/&gt;generalized graph-manifold with zero minimal volume.&lt;br/&gt;Furthermore, the principal investigator intends to verify that,&lt;br/&gt;if M is a compact non-positively curved manifold, which admits an&lt;br/&gt;F-structure, then M indeed is a generalized&lt;br/&gt;graph-manifold. Together with Cheeger and Rong, the principal&lt;br/&gt;investigator recently discovered that, if a compact manifold M of&lt;br/&gt;non-positive sectional curvature is homotopy equivalent to a&lt;br/&gt;compact manifold with an F-structure, then M must have a local&lt;br/&gt;metric splitting structure with nontrivial local tori&lt;br/&gt;factors. The principal investigator would like to continue his&lt;br/&gt;joint research project with Cheeger and Rong in this&lt;br/&gt;direction. In cooperation with Dr. Croke, the principal&lt;br/&gt;investigator also plans to continue his study of rigidity of the&lt;br/&gt;geodesic flow and marked length-spectrum for manifolds of&lt;br/&gt;non-positive sectional curvature. He would like to show that, if&lt;br/&gt;a pair of compact generalized graph-manifolds of non-positive&lt;br/&gt;sectional curvature have the same marked length-spectrum, then&lt;br/&gt;they must be isometric. In addition, the PI would like to&lt;br/&gt;continue his study of positive harmonic functions on manifolds of&lt;br/&gt;rank one and Martin boundary. His research on the sign of the&lt;br/&gt;Euler number of any compact Kaehler a-spherical manifold will&lt;br/&gt;also be continued.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on the study of global geometric shape of&lt;br/&gt;non-positively curved spaces. The examples of non-positively&lt;br/&gt;curved spaces include flat tires and surfaces with more than two&lt;br/&gt;holes, such as pretzels. There are also examples of higher&lt;br/&gt;dimensional non-positively curved spaces. Our universe can be&lt;br/&gt;viewed a 3-dimensional space of zero curvature. Dr. Cao is trying&lt;br/&gt;to investigate diameter, volume, spectrum and other geometric&lt;br/&gt;data of those spaces. Cao has also been interested in the study&lt;br/&gt;of the shortest closed curves on non-positively curved spaces. He&lt;br/&gt;has already shown that two such surfaces with possible cusps are&lt;br/&gt;isometric if and only if the data of lengths of all shortest&lt;br/&gt;closed curves on the two surfaces are identical. The data of&lt;br/&gt;lengths of all shortest closed curves on a closed surface M is&lt;br/&gt;called the marked length spectrum of the space M. The study of&lt;br/&gt;marked length spectrum on spaces with boundaries has a number of&lt;br/&gt;applications in modern industry and geological sciences. The&lt;br/&gt;proposed problems involve various aspects of Riemannian geometry&lt;br/&gt;and Kaehler geometry. The techniques developed in the proposed&lt;br/&gt;research will have close connections with other fields in&lt;br/&gt;mathematics, including topology, partial differential equations,&lt;br/&gt;several complex variables and dynamical systems. The solutions to&lt;br/&gt;the proposed problems will advance all these intricately related&lt;br/&gt;fields and open up a vast unexplored area. The proposed study of&lt;br/&gt;the marked length-spectrum and the geodesic flow has close&lt;br/&gt;connections with other branches of sciences including&lt;br/&gt;geosciences.</AbstractNarration>
