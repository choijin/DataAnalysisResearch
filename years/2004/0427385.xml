<AbstractNarration>In   wireless communication systems, users with heterogeneous information content such as data, voice, and multimedia constrain  the network by having different reliability requirements. In this project a framework which can provide heterogeneous reliability guarantees for the users is considered.&lt;br/&gt;This adds a completely new dimension to the trade-off of performance in a wireless network, and is unique to multiterminal communication systems. It is as if the network has some amount of reliability that can be allocated among the users. This is a very  general concept and can be applied  in any multiterminal&lt;br/&gt;communication problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is accomplished by defining individual probabilities of errors for the users in the network. Hence for a fixed vector of rates of the users, a system can provide a trade-off of reliabilities among the users. &lt;br/&gt;This  set of achievable reliabilities is referred to as the multiuser reliability profile of a multiuser network. This profile is a function of the vector of transmission rates inside the capacity region.&lt;br/&gt;For a wireless system employing multiple antennas, this profile is referred to as multiuser diversity gain&lt;br/&gt;profile. Further, these guarantees are directly manifested in the physical layer and can be translated into QoS guarantees in the higher layers in the network architecture. This is a marked shift from conventional approaches that relegate this task to the higher network layers. Hence in a heterogeneous wireless networks,&lt;br/&gt;heterogeneous QoS guarantees can be more efficiently realized using the techniques considered in this project. This project is expected to have a significant impact on the design of the next generation of wireless networks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
