<AbstractNarration>0436347&lt;br/&gt;Grau&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a three-year collaborative research project between Professor Gordon Grau of the University of Hawaii and Professor Takashi Aoki of the Tokyo University of Marine Science and Technology in Japan.  They will be undertaking a study on interactions among the environment in relation to the neuroendocrine and immune systems in fish.  Reproduction, development, growth, immune function and environmental adaptation are regulated to an important extent through the orderly release of hormones by the neuroendocrine system that, in turn, integrates information from the genetic code, internal milieu and the environment.  It is clear that the neuroendocrine and immune systems are inseparable tied in teleost fish, as in all animals, to the regulation of a complex array of metabolic, physiological and developmental activities, as well as providing for protection against infection and disease.  It is of both fundamental and practical importance that we develop a thorough knowledge of the manner in which the environment, and the immune and neuroendocrine systems interact in the regulation of growth, reproduction and disease resistance of fish.  The researchers will specifically focus on the roles of growth hormone and prolactin in the fish immune system and also on the role of cortisol in stress and the immune response.  The goals of the proposal are to  l) integrate areas of scientific expertise that are typically distinct and separate from one another in the study of the endocrinology and immunology of fish;  2) foster personal and professional relationships extending beyond the proposed work;  and 3) develop new methods and concepts in endocrinology/immunology by exposing young scientists and students to a unique mixture o knowledge and training not available in a single laboratory.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project brings together the efforts of two laboratories that have complementary expertise and research capabilities.  The project has the potential to develop a new, shared way of addressing questions of fundamental value to our nation's nutritional and economic well-being that are best answered by an approach that integrates disciplines which have operated until now in virtual isolation.  Through the exchange of ideas and technology, this project will broaden our base of basic knowledge and promote international understanding and cooperation.  The project includes the participation of both postdocs and graduate students. Results of the research will be disseminated at scientific meetings and in scientific journals.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
