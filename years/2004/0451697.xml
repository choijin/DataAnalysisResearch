<AbstractNarration>Professor Jacqueline Gervay-Hague of the University of California-Davis is supported by the Chemistry Division to support approximately 20 people at an October 2004 workshop entitled Molecular Basis of Life Processes.  The workshop has three objectives:  (1) science drivers, framed as grand challenge questions, for the Molecular Basis of Life Processes (MBLP); (2) ways to mentor CAREER applicants on constructing the education section of their proposals;  (3) views on opportunities associated with mid-range instrumentation.  Professor Gervay-Hague is assisted in the organization of the workshop by  Professor Jeffery Saven  of the University of Pennsylvania and Dr. Michelle Buchanan, director of Oak Ridge National Laboratory's Chemical Sciences Division.  ORNL is the location for the workshop.  Discussants are a diverse group of former and current CAREER awardees having research programs at the chemistry/biology interface.  Several observers from funding agencies as well as from the European council of chemical society presidents, CERC3, will also attend.  The workshop report will be widely disseminated for additional community comment.  The inclusion of objectives (2) and (3) in the workshop is responsive to recommendations by the 2004 NSF-CHE Committee of Visitors that the views of the community be sought.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
