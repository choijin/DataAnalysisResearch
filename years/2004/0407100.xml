    <AbstractNarration>Funding is requested to help offset travel expenses for undergraduate and graduate&lt;br/&gt;students attending the 24th Annual Crown Gall Conference. This conference will take place&lt;br/&gt;November 22-23, 2003 at Cornell University, and will be attended by approximately 75&lt;br/&gt;national and international scientists that study Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Of these,&lt;br/&gt;approximately half will be students working in US labs, who will be the sole beneficiaries&lt;br/&gt;of financial assistance from NSF. Several of these students study at undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;colleges, and their advisors do not have adequate funding for travel of this sort.&lt;br/&gt;Studies of A. tumefaciens continue to provide an ongoing intellectual feast. This&lt;br/&gt;organism is one of the best developed model pathogens available. It provided the first&lt;br/&gt;model for translocation of macromolecules from pathogen to host, a phenomenon that is now&lt;br/&gt;known to be quite widespread. The A. tumefaciens transfer system continues to be the best&lt;br/&gt;characterized member of its family. This bacterium provided the first model for the&lt;br/&gt;detection of host-released diffusible chemical signals, and this system continues to lead&lt;br/&gt;the way in host detection. This organism has also provided an excellent model for the&lt;br/&gt;phenomenon of cell-cell communication, a phenomenon sometimes referred to as quorum&lt;br/&gt;sensing. Students of A. tumefaciens will continue to provide leadership in fundamental&lt;br/&gt;aspects of host-microbe interactions. This conference therefore focuses on an important&lt;br/&gt;model patho-system.&lt;br/&gt;These studies also impact the scientific infrastructure in many ways. One area has to do&lt;br/&gt;with the creation of transgenic plants. Although A. tumefaciens is routinely used to&lt;br/&gt;introduce transgenes into many species of plants, there is a great deal of room for&lt;br/&gt;improvement, particularly in transformation of monocots, the introduction of extremely&lt;br/&gt;long T-DNAs, in the regeneration of plants from transformed cells, and in the removal of&lt;br/&gt;antibiotic resistance markers from transgenic crops. The fundamental studies presenting&lt;br/&gt;in this conference will surely impact upon plant molecular genetics and agriculture.&lt;br/&gt;A. tumefaciens also provides an excellent model for learning how to do good science. The&lt;br/&gt;organism is readily culturable and readily manipulated genetically. Therefore, this&lt;br/&gt;organism and its hosts provide many opportunities for learning how to do highly&lt;br/&gt;controlled, reproducible, hypothesis-based experiments. In short, students of A.&lt;br/&gt;tumefaciens learn how to be good scientists, and will carry these skills with them&lt;br/&gt;throughout their scientific careers.</AbstractNarration>
