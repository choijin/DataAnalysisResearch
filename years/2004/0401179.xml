<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;Proposal DMS-0401179&lt;br/&gt;PI: Arshak Petrosyan, Purdue University&lt;br/&gt;Title: Certain aspects of free boundary problems&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of this proposal is to study certain free boundary problems&lt;br/&gt;with the lack of "classical" properties such as the uniform&lt;br/&gt;ellipticity (parabolicity) or the nonnegativity of&lt;br/&gt;the solutions. More specifically, the PI proposes to study the&lt;br/&gt;following questions that will help to understand the essence of the&lt;br/&gt;new difficulties and the possible ways of their resolution:&lt;br/&gt;1) the continuity of the derivatives in the obstacle problem for the&lt;br/&gt;sub-Laplacian in the  Heisenberg group; 2) the classification of&lt;br/&gt;homogeneous global solutions of the obstacle problem for the&lt;br/&gt;p-Laplacian in the plane; 3) uniform convergence of the level sets&lt;br/&gt;in a degenerate phase-transition model; 4) smoothness of the free&lt;br/&gt;boundary in a degenerate Bernoulli-type problem in the plane; and 5)&lt;br/&gt;one-phase obstacle and Stefan type problems with no sign restrictions&lt;br/&gt;on solutions. Some of the problems can be attacked by using recently&lt;br/&gt;developed methods, while a revitalization of some older methods might&lt;br/&gt;prove successful in other cases. Partial results as well as&lt;br/&gt;empirical evidence (in some cases) are provided to support the expected&lt;br/&gt;and conjectured results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Free boundaries are apriori unknown sets, coming up in solutions of&lt;br/&gt;partial differential equations and variational problems. Typical&lt;br/&gt;examples are the interfaces and moving boundaries in problems on phase&lt;br/&gt;transitions and fluid mechanics. Main questions of interest are the&lt;br/&gt;regularity (smoothness) of free boundaries and their structure. Thanks&lt;br/&gt;to the contributions by many mathematicians the theory of free&lt;br/&gt;boundaries has developed over the last decades to a very deep and&lt;br/&gt;beautiful part of mathematics. However, in a number of free&lt;br/&gt;boundary problems that arise in applications, ranging from geometry&lt;br/&gt;and optimal control to robotics and superconductivity, certain&lt;br/&gt;traditional assumptions may break down. The aim of this&lt;br/&gt;proposal is to understand which results could be carried over from the&lt;br/&gt;classical theory of free boundaries to the case of those problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
