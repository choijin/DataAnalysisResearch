<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0413651 &lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Sylvain Cappell&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research conference will bring together workers and students&lt;br/&gt;in three key and currently active geometrical areas: singular&lt;br/&gt;varieties, submanifolds and knotting, and stratified&lt;br/&gt;spaces. These three areas of topology have historically enjoyed&lt;br/&gt;vigorous and productive scientific interactions, spurring&lt;br/&gt;important innovations through sharing ideas.  Moreover,&lt;br/&gt;developments and problems in these subjects in topology are&lt;br/&gt;connected to parallel questions in other branches of geometry,&lt;br/&gt;analysis and algebraic geometry, where there are foundational&lt;br/&gt;questions concerning extending "classical" methods from smooth&lt;br/&gt;(nonsingular) settings to more general ones in which&lt;br/&gt;singularities can arise. Exciting recent developments to be&lt;br/&gt;discussed at this meeting include investigations on how&lt;br/&gt;singularities of embeddings and immersions in four-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;manifolds are shedding new light on basic questions concerning&lt;br/&gt;classification and structure of four dimensional manifolds; and&lt;br/&gt;how such questions also interact with new approaches to deep&lt;br/&gt;invariants of knots and links in three dimensional manifolds and&lt;br/&gt;their cobordisms. Also to be discussed are various theories of&lt;br/&gt;characteristic clases for singular varieties and foundational&lt;br/&gt;questions concerning their definitions, calculational methods,&lt;br/&gt;and applications, e.g., to current developments in transformation&lt;br/&gt;groups and to geometrical combinatorics of polytopes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research conference on important, current geometrical&lt;br/&gt;approaches to topology will bring together researchers and&lt;br/&gt;students who are investigating some mathemtically basic,&lt;br/&gt;ubiquitous and related topological phenomena from several&lt;br/&gt;different perspectives. These involve spaces, called varieties,&lt;br/&gt;that can have variable geometry at different points. Such&lt;br/&gt;variations in geometry, called singularities, can be analyzed&lt;br/&gt;using mathematical theories of knots and links (in many&lt;br/&gt;dimnensions); to elucidate this, such varieties are decomposed&lt;br/&gt;into strata. Because the natural spaces that arise in many&lt;br/&gt;research problems in both mathematics and theoretical physics&lt;br/&gt;display such singularities, investigations of such varieties, of&lt;br/&gt;their strata and their singularities, and of related questions&lt;br/&gt;about knots and links are needed.  Recent and exciting&lt;br/&gt;developments to be analyzed include relations of such questions&lt;br/&gt;to four dimensional geometry, to the symmetries and invariants of&lt;br/&gt;such spaces, and to applications to problems in enumeration and&lt;br/&gt;combinatorics that arise in a very wide range of scientific&lt;br/&gt;problems.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
