<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding to support student and postdoc travel to participate in the 2005 Quantum Information Science Gordon Conference.  The conference is being held during the period between 27 February and 4 March 2005 and will sponsor a broad program that touches upon a wide breadth of  research activities related to the fundamental understanding of quantum information as well as potential experimental realizations of quantum logic systems.  Students will participate through presentation of posters and through formal and informal interactions with leading scientists across the spectrum of disciplines that contribute to the study of quantum information.</AbstractNarration>
