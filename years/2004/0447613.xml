<AbstractNarration>With the recent advances in theory, technology and applications of&lt;br/&gt;wireless communications a vision of the next generation wireless&lt;br/&gt;systems arises to be that of communicating arbitrarily correlated&lt;br/&gt;data, in arbitrarily structured networks, in challenging physical&lt;br/&gt;layer conditions, using wireless devices that are more flexible in&lt;br/&gt;terms of their transmitting/receiving capabilities and in terms of the&lt;br/&gt;boundaries between the layers of their protocol stack. The goal of&lt;br/&gt;this research is to develop a comprehensive information theoretic&lt;br/&gt;framework for determining the ultimate capacity limits of such&lt;br/&gt;networks and for developing efficient coding, transmission, reception&lt;br/&gt;and decoding schemes to be used in such networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research is structured into four heavily interrelated parts:&lt;br/&gt;network, data, tools, and channel. This research investigates the&lt;br/&gt;capacity regions and capacity achieving transmit/receive&lt;br/&gt;coding/decoding schemes of basic network structures that are building&lt;br/&gt;blocks of general ad-hoc multi-hop wireless networks, with an emphasis&lt;br/&gt;on the interference channel. This research develops principles of&lt;br/&gt;communicating correlated and common data. Specifically, the&lt;br/&gt;investigator determines the optimum coding and transmission schemes&lt;br/&gt;for correlated/common data and also studies the trade-offs between&lt;br/&gt;performance and complexity; in particular, the loss in performance&lt;br/&gt;when the source-channel separation principle is enforced. This&lt;br/&gt;research develops new tools and integrates and jointly optimizes some&lt;br/&gt;of the existing tools; the emphasis is on the joint optimization of&lt;br/&gt;user cooperation and power control. This research integrates the&lt;br/&gt;fading nature of the wireless communication channel into all of the&lt;br/&gt;problem formulations. The existence of fading in the channel can be&lt;br/&gt;both challenging and fortuitous, more the latter, if it is carefully&lt;br/&gt;exploited to the advantage of the network capacity. The investigator&lt;br/&gt;incorporates the existence of the channel fading into the capacity&lt;br/&gt;evaluations (hence, ergodic and outage capacities), into coding and&lt;br/&gt;transmission schemes for common/correlated data, and also into the&lt;br/&gt;development of the tools.&lt;br/&gt;------------------&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
