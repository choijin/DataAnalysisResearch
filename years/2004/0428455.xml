<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:  CTS-0428455&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Maria M. Santore&lt;br/&gt;Institution:  University of Massachusetts Amherst&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title:  Patchy Sensor Surfaces for Selective Dynamic Adhesion of Micron and Submicron Objects &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Merit:  This program will develop the science for robust field-ready sensors for particles with &lt;br/&gt;sizes from 50 nm to 5 um, applicable to the detection of bacteria, spores, viruses, inorganic fines, &lt;br/&gt;and chemically-sensitive scavenging particles from aqueous and airborne environments.   &lt;br/&gt;Focusing on reversible dynamic adhesion as these objects flow over detector surfaces that &lt;br/&gt;spontaneously recover after a .detection event., the program targets a new sensing concept that &lt;br/&gt;will screen and discriminate classes of biological cells or inorganic particles based on their &lt;br/&gt;surfaces. This class-level selectivity will not require steps that lyze cells, extract proteins or &lt;br/&gt;genetic material, or conduct molecular recognition. Multiple applications are therefore targeted. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;At the heart of this new sensing technology lies a heterogeneous or patterned surface which is &lt;br/&gt;robust to pH, temperature, and other environmental factors, and which selectively adheres target &lt;br/&gt;particles while rejecting those outside target ranges in size or surface character (mean density or &lt;br/&gt;nanoscale distribution of surface charge, nano-meter scale patches of hydrophobic and &lt;br/&gt;hydrophilic chemistries, scale of roughness and other aspects of surface topography, and even &lt;br/&gt;specific peptide sequences).  The sensor surfaces present nanometer-scale patches of different &lt;br/&gt;sizes and chemistries, and micron-scale hydrodynamic features that generate a landscape of &lt;br/&gt;competing colloidal and hydrodynamic forces to discriminate approaching colloidal particles &lt;br/&gt;based on their dynamic signature, including reversible adhesion, rolling, skipping, and arrest. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The proposed collaboration between Santore, Coughlin, and Davis spans the disciplines of &lt;br/&gt;polymer interfaces, synthetic chemistry, and fluid mechanics. Through combined experiment and &lt;br/&gt;modeling, the team will develop design rules for collector surface patterns, robust detector &lt;br/&gt;chemistry, and operating strategies that manipulate concentration, ionic strength, and flow rates.  &lt;br/&gt;With model particles capturing the essential features of spores, bacteria, viruses, resins, and &lt;br/&gt;minerals, the program will probe adhesion and detachment rates on patterned collector surfaces &lt;br/&gt;with systematic variations in the scale and chemistry of surface features.  Surface features will be &lt;br/&gt;designed with particular colloidal forces (electrostatic, Van der Waals, hydrophobic, and &lt;br/&gt;polymer mechanical) and hydrodynamic fields in mind, exploiting the versatility of block &lt;br/&gt;copolymer architectures, and flow fields engineered to manipulate particle-surface encounters. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts.  The new sensing technology will benefit society not only in terms of &lt;br/&gt;homeland security, but also in terms of public welfare: The sensing principles employ active &lt;br/&gt;surfaces which could be produced at modest cost, and designs which can operate unattended and &lt;br/&gt;automatically, in chemical processes and public buildings such as hospitals and schools, and &lt;br/&gt;ultimately the home.  The program, while rooted in the interdisciplinary fields of nanochemistry &lt;br/&gt;and colloid science, impacts the fields of polymer surface chemistry, biophysics, and pattern &lt;br/&gt;recognition, and will initiate a surface fingerprinting database of single cell organisms.  Graduate &lt;br/&gt;students will carry forward the bulk of the fundamental science while a liaison program will &lt;br/&gt;benefit engineering, chemistry, and physics undergraduates via a hybrid industrial / university &lt;br/&gt;research experience.  Undergraduates will spend a summer in industry on a project with science &lt;br/&gt;parallel to that in the Santore / Davis/ and Coughlin labs, returning to UMass to conduct a related &lt;br/&gt;research project during the academic year.  Integrated teaching and research will be &lt;br/&gt;accomplished with a special topics course on smart interfaces, and with guest lectures in key &lt;br/&gt;courses in the undergraduate curriculum of two UMass colleges.  The program will target &lt;br/&gt;underrepresented groups by recruiting students from local colleges who take courses at UMass. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
