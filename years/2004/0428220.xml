<AbstractNarration>0428220&lt;br/&gt;Shinar&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this proposal is to develop novel photoluminescence &lt;br/&gt;(PL)-based sensors that are fully structurally integrated: The light &lt;br/&gt;source, the sensing element, and the photodetector (PD) and associated &lt;br/&gt;filter, are fabricated on transparent substrates and attached &lt;br/&gt;back-to-back. The resulting sensors could therefore be extremely &lt;br/&gt;compact, robust, selective, fast, autonomous, consume little power, and &lt;br/&gt;inexpensive. The proposal focuses on sensing oxygen, a key tool in &lt;br/&gt;medical, environmental, (bio)chemical, and food monitoring, and Bacillus &lt;br/&gt;anthracis toxin (anthrax).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit. The central concept is the novel total &lt;br/&gt;structural integration of the foregoing components. The light source is &lt;br/&gt;an array of organic light-emitting device (OLED) pixels. The sensing &lt;br/&gt;elements include porous films with an embedded dye, surface immobilized &lt;br/&gt;species whose PL is selectively analyte-sensitive, or microfluidic &lt;br/&gt;channels/wells with recognition elements in solution. The PD and filter &lt;br/&gt;are multilayer thin films of hydrogenated nanocrystalline Si, SiGe, &lt;br/&gt;and/or SiC. The geometry will be "back detection," i.e., the OLED and PD &lt;br/&gt;pixels are fabricated on the same side of the substrate. The array of &lt;br/&gt;long-pass filters and PD pixels is fabricated first, followed by the &lt;br/&gt;OLEDs in the gaps between the PD pixels. The sensing element is &lt;br/&gt;fabricated on a separate substrate and attached to the OLED/PD &lt;br/&gt;substrate. In the complete device, the electronic circuitry (including &lt;br/&gt;instruction receiver and data transmitter), readout, and battery will be &lt;br/&gt;positioned "behind" the PD. Hence the whole device would be ~2.5"x5"x1", &lt;br/&gt;far more compact and less costly than any sensors currently available. &lt;br/&gt;The work results in a new platform for PL-based sensors, which can be &lt;br/&gt;further developed to multianalyte sensor microarrays. Innovative &lt;br/&gt;elements are (i) the complete integration of all the sensor components, &lt;br/&gt;and (ii) the development of sensing elements utilizing microfluidic &lt;br/&gt;architectures and films/surfaces tailored for specific recognition &lt;br/&gt;molecules, which will enhance the sensitivity and shorten the response &lt;br/&gt;time. Moreover, the OLEDs will be operated in a pulsed mode, which will &lt;br/&gt;increase their lifetime and generate negligible heat, which is crucial &lt;br/&gt;for heat-sensitive recognition elements and agents. Oxygen will be &lt;br/&gt;monitored via the PL lifetime, thus eliminating the need for frequent &lt;br/&gt;calibration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Different approaches will be evaluated to generate robust sensors for &lt;br/&gt;real-world applications. The oxygen sensor will be based on the &lt;br/&gt;dynamical quenching of the PL of oxygen-sensitive dyes, initially with a &lt;br/&gt;green OLED and Pt octaethyl porphyrin (PtOEP) dye. We will compare the &lt;br/&gt;sensors with dyes embedded in solid films with dyes solutions. The &lt;br/&gt;anthrax sensor will be based on the cleavage of certain peptides by &lt;br/&gt;anthrax lethal factor. Labeled peptides will be synthesized at the &lt;br/&gt;Protein Facility of Iowa State University (ISU), with a Forster &lt;br/&gt;resonance energy transfer donor and acceptor on either side of the &lt;br/&gt;cleavage site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts. The sensors for the two aforementioned agents will &lt;br/&gt;be ideal for a broad range of applications in areas such as homeland &lt;br/&gt;security, medical, environmental, biological, food/brewing, and &lt;br/&gt;health/safety. Beyond these impacts, the devices define a new sensor &lt;br/&gt;platform for chemical and biological agents, which could lead to &lt;br/&gt;extremely compact and inexpensive multianalyte sensor microarrays. The &lt;br/&gt;proposed work will serve as a basis for the development of this &lt;br/&gt;platform. It will also expand the basic knowledge in &lt;br/&gt;embedding/immobilizing recognition elements, sensor design, and sensor &lt;br/&gt;engineering. It will also have a broad educational impact, promoting the &lt;br/&gt;growth of the interdisciplinary biophysics program at ISU and training &lt;br/&gt;students in condensed matter physics, electrical engineering, &lt;br/&gt;biophysics, chemistry, and molecular biology. It will be integrated with &lt;br/&gt;teaching by developing new experimental course modules for graduate &lt;br/&gt;students. Significant participation of undergraduates, including &lt;br/&gt;minorities and women, is planned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
