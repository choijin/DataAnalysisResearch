<AbstractNarration>Is it possible for adults to learn a second language as well as a native speaker? Can they learn both vocabulary and grammar equally well? How does the way adults learn second languages differ from how children learn language? Do adults learn second languages differently in different situations, such as in a classroom or a foreign country? Previous research from cognitive neuroscience (that is, the integration of neuroscience and cognitive psychology) suggests that adults learn second language differently than children, but that adults may be capable of achieving high levels of proficiency with sufficient practice. Research by applied linguists has established that the learning situation can affect at least how quickly an adult is able to learn a second language.&lt;br/&gt;With support from the National Science Foundation, Dr. Michael Ullman and Kara Morgan-Short, M.A.T., will use some innovative methods drawing from these two related fields of research in order to further explore such phenomena. The project will examine which brain systems are involved when adults learn second languages, if these brain systems are similar to or different from the brain systems that children use, and if they are affected by explicit or implicit learning situations (that is, taught directly or picked up unconsciously). The research has broad impacts, including implications for second language teaching. The research is expected to benefit government, academic, and private institutions that are concerned with successfully training adults to become highly proficient in a second language, a vital need given today's international socio-political situation. This project will take place in the context of Ms. Morgan-Short's dissertation studies and will provide interdisciplinary educational opportunities for students who participate in conducting research. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
