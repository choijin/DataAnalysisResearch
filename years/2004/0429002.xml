<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;The Directorate for Engineering at the National Science Foundation has established a strong focus for&lt;br/&gt;study concerning future investments in Cyberinfrastructure that may be made by the Foundation. Inside of&lt;br/&gt;the Engineering Directorate, the Cyberinfrastructure Working Group has completed a portfolio assessment&lt;br/&gt;of research and education awards, and is now arranging for a series of workshops that explore the&lt;br/&gt;opportunities for supporting the development of a national Cyberinfrastructure, and for leveraging these&lt;br/&gt;investments and partnering with the academic, government and industry sectors. While the first two&lt;br/&gt;workshops organized and held at the NSF in Arlington in June 5-6, 2003 and January 13-14, 2004 took a&lt;br/&gt;very broad, i.e. horizontal, look at the Cyberinfrastructure initiative to scope out the critical issues that&lt;br/&gt;need to be addressed during the development of Cyberinfrastructure, this third workshop is poised to&lt;br/&gt;follow some of the leads generated by the earlier workshops and to concentrate on the need to develop a&lt;br/&gt;strategy that permits and entices the involvement of the entire engineering community, by identifying key&lt;br/&gt;challenges in cyberengineering/cyberinfrastructre research.&lt;br/&gt;In order to facilitate the organization of the 3 rd Workshop, NSF has invited 7 individuals from the&lt;br/&gt;engineering community to serve on the organizing committee, OC. These are&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Massoud Amin, U. of Minnesota, Twin Cities (ECS rep.)&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Shirley Dyke, Washington University (CMS rep.)&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Jim Rawlings, University of Wisconsin (CTS rep.)&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Ming Lin, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill (DMII rep.)&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Ulrich Neumann, University of Southern California (EEC rep.)&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Michael Piasecki, Drexel University (BES rep. &amp; proposal lead)&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Bill Spencer, U. of Illinois, Urbana Champaign (CMS rep.)&lt;br/&gt;Deliverables&lt;br/&gt;Each of the workshop breakout groups will be asked to summarize the findings of their respective task.&lt;br/&gt;These findings, together with the Personal Points of Views, PPVs, and the 3 page research idea&lt;br/&gt;submissions of the selected presenters will be compiled into a final workshop report by the OC that will be&lt;br/&gt;submitted to NSF. More specifically the deliverables will contain:&lt;br/&gt;Report of the Workshop as a reference material for the ENG community&lt;br/&gt;Development of material for posting on the website&lt;br/&gt;A set of recommendations for developing Divisional level workshops sessions&lt;br/&gt;A camera ready copy for the printing of the proceedings.&lt;br/&gt;To this end, the OC will establish a NSF Engineering Cyberinfrastructure Workshop III website (to be&lt;br/&gt;hosted on one of the servers in Dr. Piasecki's computer lab) that will announce the workshop, post&lt;br/&gt;relevant information concerning the workshop schedule and agenda including the participant list, and&lt;br/&gt;provide information for hotels, travel, and directions to the Drexel campus in general and the meeting&lt;br/&gt;venues in particular. In addition to the site hosting the final workshop report, it will also be used to post the&lt;br/&gt;presentations as well as position statements or personal point of views (PPVs) from each attendee that&lt;br/&gt;should be submitted prior to the start of the workshop.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this workshop lies in its scope, i.e. the attempt to identify research opportunities in&lt;br/&gt;cyberengineering and cyberinfrastructure development. Recognition of the opportunity to conduct&lt;br/&gt;cyberengineering/cyberinfrastructure research is very much linked to the necessity to achieve a broad&lt;br/&gt;acceptance in the engineering communities, i.e. the willingness of these communities to embrace a&lt;br/&gt;concept that is open to all and not restricted to a few domain experts that have a high developed interest&lt;br/&gt;in making use of cross-disciplinary ideas involving computer science and engineering. This workshop is&lt;br/&gt;also focused on identifying idlow hanging fruitsly that can be harvested by many in the community without&lt;br/&gt;having to become cyberinfrastructure experts, i.e. having to crosswalk into the computer science domain.&lt;br/&gt;The presentation of research ideas and development drivers should provide a good overview what are the&lt;br/&gt;key areas of cross-cutting cyberinfrastructure that is important to the engineering communities, and what&lt;br/&gt;the scope of the initiative is. This must be understood as a precursor to entice the community to further&lt;br/&gt;educate itself and attempt to embrace these new concepts.</AbstractNarration>
