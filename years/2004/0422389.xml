<AbstractNarration>The purpose of this scholarship program is to assist academically talented, low-income-family undergraduate students majoring in mathematics, computer science or dual degree engineering to complete their baccalaureate degrees and make a successful transition from college to work or graduate education. This program is improving the retention and professional development of students and strengthening the partnership with the employment sector. This four-year program supports 16 students a year. Scholarships are linked to   existing academic advising and other student support.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Students must be sophomores, juniors or seniors, enrolled full time and have a minimum GPA of 2.75. Eligible students are invited to submit a letter of application, which must contain evidence of interest and motivation, a description of career and graduate school interests, and  an explanation of how the NSF scholarship would help them complete their degree. Scholars are required to remain eligible each semester and to meet regularly with their academic or faculty advisors.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;An orientation meeting is held at the beginning of each academic year to acquaint scholars with each other and the many academic and career-related services that are available to them.  The scholars participate in a mentoring program, field trips, tutoring, faculty-mentored-research, resume writing and interviewing skills workshops, job fairs and other project activities specifically designed to increase their productivity. Expected outcomes are improved retention, increased GPA for participants, and better preparation for the job market or graduate school.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Two types of evaluations are being conducted: 1) a formative evaluation designed to provide constructive feedback for the improvement of the program, and 2) a summative evaluation designed to assess the overall success of the program. A student tracking system is being implemented to monitor the academic progress and graduation rates of the NSF scholars, plus a similar, matched group of students who are not scholars. A variety of data collection methods, such as focus groups, interviews, and surveys, are being used. Students continue to be tracked one year after graduation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
