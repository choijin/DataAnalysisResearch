<AbstractNarration>A large segment of the economic literature is concerned with the study&lt;br/&gt;of allocations that arise when markets are not well functioning. The&lt;br/&gt;defining characteristics of this literature are its focus on&lt;br/&gt;informational and spatial frictions and the desire to make them explicit&lt;br/&gt;by assuming that economic interactions occur in small coalitions. The&lt;br/&gt;traditional modeling tool is that of a matching framework. A limitation&lt;br/&gt;of this literature is that the treatment of matching--as a&lt;br/&gt;technology--is mostly  descriptive and hazily formalized. These&lt;br/&gt;shortcomings contribute to blur the precise connection between the&lt;br/&gt;constraints imposed by the matching technology, the environmental&lt;br/&gt;frictions, and the possible allocations. The proposed research will&lt;br/&gt;develop a fully integrated mathematical approach to matching mechanisms&lt;br/&gt;by formalizing and studying the  following: (i) the mechanics of&lt;br/&gt;matching in bi- and multi-lateral settings (deterministic and&lt;br/&gt;stochastic); (ii) the links between matching and trade frictions,&lt;br/&gt;providing exact mappings between technologies and&lt;br/&gt;informational constraints; (iii) the allocative implications of&lt;br/&gt;different matching mechanisms in general monetary and non-monetary&lt;br/&gt;economies. A clear understanding of these connections will advance the&lt;br/&gt;formulation of sophisticated economic models based on markets with&lt;br/&gt;impaired functioning &lt;br/&gt;and promises to clarify the implications of policy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A major concern of economics is how scarce resources are allocated when&lt;br/&gt;markets are not well functioning. Market frictions often involve&lt;br/&gt;scarcity of information or geographical separation or inadequate&lt;br/&gt;institutions. In general, the economic literature makes these frictions&lt;br/&gt;explicit by modeling trade as occurring in small groups--often pairwise&lt;br/&gt;matches. The resulting matching frameworks are used to answer basic&lt;br/&gt;questions in a variety of settings;&lt;br/&gt;from economic governance to unemployment and from business cycles to&lt;br/&gt;monetary policy. A shortcoming of these frameworks is that the modeling&lt;br/&gt;of matching technologies is mostly descriptive and superficially&lt;br/&gt;formalized. This blurs the exact link between the obstacles faced by&lt;br/&gt;participants in the market place and the trades they can execute. The&lt;br/&gt;proposed research will develop a theoretical foundation for this class&lt;br/&gt;of models. It will formalize the&lt;br/&gt;mechanics of how different trading frameworks can facilitate (or&lt;br/&gt;obstacle) the exchange of information and other economic resources. It&lt;br/&gt;will precisely chart the link between the frictions impinging on the&lt;br/&gt;trading process and the possible allocations. This will advance our&lt;br/&gt;understanding of how to construct sophisticated economic models whose&lt;br/&gt;central trait is markets with impaired functioning. The results will&lt;br/&gt;have applications to other disciplines, such as biology (spread of&lt;br/&gt;diseases), sociology (formation of social groups), and engineering&lt;br/&gt;(network communication).&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
