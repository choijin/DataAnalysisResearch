    <AbstractNarration>Spectral imaging is an emerging technology that offers great promise for target identification (ID), terrain classification, gas detection, and similar applications. Most of the work in this area has been done in the traditional portions of the EM spectrum used for reconnaissance, the visible and infrared. The UV portion of the spectrum is typically discounted because of the decreasing light levels at short wavelengths. There is, however, sufficient light from 0.3-0.4 microns to conduct spectral measurements and imaging, and enhanced sensitivity to gases and other materials. There are downsides to this spectral range: scattering is a significant problem, and spatial resolution is degraded. This effort would move laboratory instrumentation for UV spectral imaging for gas detection into the field to test real situation data acquisition and quantify the level of noise in the signal. In addition, a laboratory test of UV spectral imaging of materials will be undertaken. There are strong theoretical grounds for believing this will be a new, useful technology for emerging materials detection. The use of UV photographs as image data will also be explored using new chips. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In combination with the field test, the alternative chip technology offers an opportunity to create a calibrated system that could be used for real-time imaging detection of noxious gas plumes using a portable sensor. Applications include smoke stacks and volcanic plumes. Part of the field test will be coordinated through the University of Hawaii, Manoa.</AbstractNarration>
