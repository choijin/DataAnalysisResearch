    <AbstractNarration>North Dakota State University has been awarded funds for the Virtual Conferences on Genomics and Bioinformatics. The objectives of these conferences are to advance genomic and bioinformatic science, by increasing the understanding and integration of post-genomic data, by illuminating the functional roles of genes through sequence homology and DNA microarray data analysis, and by facilitating discussion of the limitations of current genomic and bioinformatic tools and potential solutions to these limitations. Because they are free and broadcast around the world, the conferences transcend geographic and economic factors limiting researchers across the globe. The audio-video streaming versions of the conferences are retained on a server for replay by anyone from anywhere at anytime. In addition the conferences have a peer reviewed paper session and a Proceedings of the Virtual Conference on Genomics and Bioinformatics series.</AbstractNarration>
