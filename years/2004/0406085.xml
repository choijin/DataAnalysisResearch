<AbstractNarration>Pricipal Investigators: David Van Dyk and Xiao-Li Meng&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Institutions: UC Riverside and Harvard University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Collaborative Research: Highly Structured Models and Statistical &lt;br/&gt;Computation in High-Energy Astrophysics&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The California-Harvard Astrostatistics Collaboration aims to design&lt;br/&gt;and implement fully model-based methods of statistical inference to&lt;br/&gt;solve outstanding data analytic problems in high-energy&lt;br/&gt;astrophysics. The Collaboration's methods explicitly model the&lt;br/&gt;complexities of both astronomical sources and the data generation&lt;br/&gt;mechanisms inherent in new high-tech instruments and fully utilize the&lt;br/&gt;resulting highly structured models in learning about the underlying&lt;br/&gt;astronomical and physical processes. Using these models requires&lt;br/&gt;sophisticated scientific computation, advanced methods for statistical&lt;br/&gt;inference, and careful model checking procedures. The PIs of the&lt;br/&gt;Collaboration (van Dyk and Meng) both have substantial research&lt;br/&gt;experience in developing the methods that the Collaboration is&lt;br/&gt;extending, employing, and publicizing: inferential and efficient&lt;br/&gt;computational methods under highly-structured models that involve&lt;br/&gt;multiple levels of latent variables and incomplete data.  Such models&lt;br/&gt;are ideally suited to account for the many physical and instrumental&lt;br/&gt;filters that compose the data generation mechanism in high-energy&lt;br/&gt;astrophysics. The five consultants on the project (Chiang, Connors,&lt;br/&gt;Kashyap, Karovska, and Siemiginowska) all have expertise on the&lt;br/&gt;instrumentation and science of high-energy astrophysics, and, all have&lt;br/&gt;collaborated with statisticians in efforts to develop appropriate&lt;br/&gt;methods to address scientific questions. There are two primary impacts&lt;br/&gt;of this project: the impact of the development of more reliable&lt;br/&gt;statistical methods on scientific findings in astronomy and the impact&lt;br/&gt;of the new statistical inference and computation methods in a wide&lt;br/&gt;range of scientific fields. As the Collaboration develops methods and&lt;br/&gt;distributes free software for specific inferential tasks, it also&lt;br/&gt;educates the astronomical community as to the benefit of careful use&lt;br/&gt;of sophisticated statistical methods. (The Collaboration organizes one&lt;br/&gt;or two special sessions at meetings of the American Astronomical&lt;br/&gt;Society each year.) It is expected that a fundamental impact of the&lt;br/&gt;proposed research will be a more general acceptance and more prevalent&lt;br/&gt;use of appropriate methods among astronomers. Second, the&lt;br/&gt;Collaboration is an example of a new mode of statistical&lt;br/&gt;inference. Rather than using off-the-shelf models and methods, it is&lt;br/&gt;becoming ever more feasible to develop application specific models&lt;br/&gt;that are designed to account for the particular complexities of a&lt;br/&gt;problem at hand.  The Collaboration develops inferential and&lt;br/&gt;computational methods for handling such multi-level models. As&lt;br/&gt;application specific multi-level models become more prevalent, these&lt;br/&gt;methods will have application throughout the natural, social, and&lt;br/&gt;engineering sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In recent years, there has been an explosion of new data in&lt;br/&gt;observational high-energy astrophysics. Recently launched or&lt;br/&gt;soon-to-be launched space-based telescopes that are designed to detect&lt;br/&gt;and map ultra-violet, X-ray, and gamma-ray electromagnetic emission&lt;br/&gt;are opening a whole new window to study the cosmos. Because the&lt;br/&gt;production of high-energy electromagnetic emission requires&lt;br/&gt;temperatures of millions of degrees and is an indication of the&lt;br/&gt;release of vast quantities of stored energy, these instruments give a&lt;br/&gt;completely new perspective on the hot and turbulent regions of the&lt;br/&gt;universe. The new instrumentation allows for very high resolution&lt;br/&gt;imaging, spectral analysis, and time series analysis. The Chandra&lt;br/&gt;X-ray Observatory, for example, produces images at least thirty times&lt;br/&gt;sharper than any previous X-ray telescope.  The complexity of the&lt;br/&gt;instruments, the complexity of the astronomical sources, and the&lt;br/&gt;complexity of the scientific questions leads to a subtle inference&lt;br/&gt;problem that requires sophisticated statistical tools. For example,&lt;br/&gt;data are subject to non-uniform censoring, errors in measurement, and&lt;br/&gt;background contamination. Astronomical sources exhibit complex and&lt;br/&gt;irregular spatial structure. Scientists wish to draw conclusions as to&lt;br/&gt;the physical environment and structure of the source, the processes&lt;br/&gt;and laws which govern the birth and death of planets, stars, and&lt;br/&gt;galaxies, and ultimately the structure and evolution of the&lt;br/&gt;universe. Nonetheless little effort has been made to bring the&lt;br/&gt;strength of modern statistical methods to bare on these problems. The&lt;br/&gt;California-Harvard Astrostatistics Collaboration develops statistical&lt;br/&gt;methods, computational techniques, and freely available software to&lt;br/&gt;address outstanding inferential problems in high-energy astrophysics.&lt;br/&gt;The methods developed are an example of a new mode of statistical&lt;br/&gt;inference: Rather than using off-the-shelf methods, it is becoming&lt;br/&gt;ever more feasible to develop methods that are application specific&lt;br/&gt;and are designed to account for the particular complexities of a&lt;br/&gt;problem at hand. The inferential and computational methods designed by&lt;br/&gt;the Collaboration for handling such multi-level models have&lt;br/&gt;application throughout the natural, social, and engineering sciences.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
