    <AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological Informatics for FY 2005. The fellowship supports research and training at the postdoctoral level at the intersection of biology and the informational, computational, mathematical, and statistical sciences. The goal of the fellowship is to provide training to a young scientist in preparation for a career in biological informatics in which research and education will be integrated. There is an increasing need for training in biological informatics at all occupational levels, and it is expected that Fellows trained through these fellowships will play important roles in training the future workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled "A comparative genomic investigation of population-level forces governing the evolution of selfish DNA transposable elements." This research combines the comparative method of evolutionary biology with informatics and sequence databases developed from model plant systems in order to investigate the evolutionary dynamics of DNA transposable elements (sometimes called "selfish genes" or "genetic parasites"). Transposable elements constitute the largest classes of identifiable sequences in many genomes and are important agents of genetic variation. The dynamics of Miniature Inverted Repeat Transposable Elements (MITEs) among 18 closely related species of the plant genus Mimulus are being analyzed. Mimulus has been a model system for studies of plant ecology and population biology for over 50 years because their populations are particularly notable for being evolutionarily labile in mating system. This study focuses on the effects of host mating system on the evolutionary dynamics of genomic MITEs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fellowship provides training in computer and sequence-based research methods, as well as the opportunity to develop insight into applying bioinformatic resources to studies of diverse species. These objectives are being met by a combination of intensive computer based research, directed readings, participation in a training course at Cold Spring Harbor Labs, and attendance at scientific meetings. In addition to mentoring students at Duke University, the Fellow participates in the Educational Outreach Program in the Durham Public School System.</AbstractNarration>
