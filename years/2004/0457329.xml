<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;Neutron Stars as Probes for the Structure of Dense Nuclear Matter&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fridolin Weber, San Diego State University, San Diego, California&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Neutron stars contain matter in one of the densest forms found in the&lt;br/&gt;Universe (a thimble full of such matter would have a mass of one&lt;br/&gt;billion tons) which, together with the unprecedented progress in&lt;br/&gt;observational astronomy, makes such stars superb astrophysical&lt;br/&gt;laboratories for a broad range of fascinating physical studies. These&lt;br/&gt;include the exploration of nuclear processes in an environment&lt;br/&gt;extremely rich of electrons and neutrons, and the formation of new&lt;br/&gt;states of matter in the cores of such objects, like a plasma of quarks&lt;br/&gt;and gluons which is being sought at the most powerful terrestrial&lt;br/&gt;particle colliders. This NSF supported research project aims at&lt;br/&gt;exploring such processes from observed neutron star data. It is&lt;br/&gt;divided into two major activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first activity deals with X-ray neutron stars accreting matter&lt;br/&gt;from companions. Such neutron stars accrete typically many millions&lt;br/&gt;of tons of matter per second, which hit the stellar surface at a&lt;br/&gt;significant fraction of the speed of light. This leads to&lt;br/&gt;thermonuclear reactions on the stellar surface whose ashes gravitate&lt;br/&gt;gradually inward, causing significant changes (e.g. nuclear fusion&lt;br/&gt;reactions) in the star's crust. The major goal of this activity is to&lt;br/&gt;explore the impact of these thermonuclear reactions on the thermal&lt;br/&gt;evolution of accreting neutron stars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second activity concerns our understanding of the fundamental&lt;br/&gt;physics realized in the ultra-dense core of neutron stars, where&lt;br/&gt;neutrons and protons might be broken up into their quark constituents,&lt;br/&gt;creating a new state of matter known as quark matter. If quark matter&lt;br/&gt;exists in the cores of neutron stars, it will be a color&lt;br/&gt;superconductor whose condensation pattern is very complex. It has also&lt;br/&gt;been theorized that neutron stars could in fact be quark stars,&lt;br/&gt;objects made entirely of quark matter. In the framework of this&lt;br/&gt;activity, research on potential astrophysical signatures signaling the&lt;br/&gt;existence of quark matter in "neutron" stars will be carried out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These research activities are crucial to obtain the full physics&lt;br/&gt;potential of the investments that are made in astrophysical detectors,&lt;br/&gt;at Jefferson Lab, the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), as well&lt;br/&gt;as new investments that are recommended for the Rare Isotope&lt;br/&gt;Accelerator (RIA).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers and students involved in this project will develop&lt;br/&gt;multi-media lectures on how stars work and present them to middle&lt;br/&gt;and high school students and teachers in the San Diego area.</AbstractNarration>
