<AbstractNarration>We propose a comprehensive experimental study of spin-dependent processes in both organic spintronics and optoelectronic devices. The field of spintronics is currently being developed as a new form of electronics focusing on the electron spin with potential advantages such as nonvolatility, increased speed and integration densities, and lower power consumption.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: Advanced spintronics devices require the integration of spintronics and semiconductor technology. Therefore the search for new semiconductor materials suitable for injecting and transferring spin-polarized carriers is of paramount importance. Spin-injection into organic semiconductors can be more efficient than into inorganic semiconductors. In addition many organic compounds are known to have very long spin-relaxation times for both negative and positive carriers with obvious advantages for spintronics. One of our early goals is the demonstration of an organic semiconductor spin-valve. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is well known that under operation of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) high densities of spin singlet and triplet excitons, and spin-1/2 charge carriers are present that show a wealth of spin-dependent recombination and quenching reactions between them. These spin-dependent processes are not yet sufficiently understood. Spin-dependent recombination processes determine the maximum efficiency in OLEDs, whereas quenching processes determine the achievable brightness. We use innovative device-spectroscopic methods to study spin-dependent recombination and quenching processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact: We propose outreach activities designed to create interest in science amongst the youth and minorities. The PI joins other faculty to set up a van that allows one to take experiments "on the road".&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work is highly interdisciplinary in nature and therefore ensures well-rounded training of students for both research oriented and industry careers. An existing, modern microfabrication facility, that is currently unused, will be revitalized and an electron-beam lithography facility is in preparation as part of a proposed effort.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
