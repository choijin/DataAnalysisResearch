<AbstractNarration>Two knots are defined to be concordant if the connected sum of one with &lt;br/&gt;the mirror of the other is slice: that is, if the connected sum bounds &lt;br/&gt;an embedded disk in the four-ball.  The set of equivalence classes &lt;br/&gt;forms what is called the concordance group of knots, first studied in &lt;br/&gt;the early 1960s.   It is known that this group is countable, abelian, &lt;br/&gt;and that it maps onto Levine's algebraic concordance group, which is &lt;br/&gt;isomorphic to an infinite direct sum of cyclic groups of infinite order &lt;br/&gt;and of order 2 and 4.  The kernel of this map is infinitely generated.  &lt;br/&gt;A main goal of the proposal is the continued study of the concordance &lt;br/&gt;group and relationships between three-dimensional properties of knots, &lt;br/&gt;such as symmetry and genus, and their properties in the concordance &lt;br/&gt;group.  Specific topics include understanding the algebraic structure &lt;br/&gt;of the kernel of Levine's map (in particular the part of the kernel &lt;br/&gt;generated by knots of Alexander polynomial one), torsion in the &lt;br/&gt;concordance group, and the splitting of Levine's homomorphism.  To &lt;br/&gt;pursue this study the principal investigator will develop and apply &lt;br/&gt;methods coming from the theory of Heegaard Floer homology as defined by &lt;br/&gt;Oszvath and Szabo.  Other topics of study under the proposal relate to &lt;br/&gt;the interplay between the fundamental groups of 4-manifolds and their &lt;br/&gt;topological structure: for instance, a continued investigation of the &lt;br/&gt;Hausmann-Weinberger invariant of a group, the minimal Euler &lt;br/&gt;characteristic of a closed 4-manifold having that group as its &lt;br/&gt;fundamental group, and its generalizations, will be pursued.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this proposal is the study of knots.  From a &lt;br/&gt;three-dimensional perspective, questions about knots have been studied &lt;br/&gt;for over a hundred years.  More recently it has been recognized that &lt;br/&gt;the structure of a four-dimensional space, a four-manifold, is &lt;br/&gt;connected to properties of classical knots that can be associated to &lt;br/&gt;that four-manifold.  A main focus of this proposal is  the study of &lt;br/&gt;those properties of knots that are of relevant to four-dimensional &lt;br/&gt;topology; many of these properties are encapsulated in something called &lt;br/&gt;the concordance group of knots.  Questions regarding this concordance &lt;br/&gt;group offer test cases and motivation for the further development of &lt;br/&gt;techniques from general four-manifold theory.  In addition, the study &lt;br/&gt;of concordance brings to the fore new and fascinating questions in the &lt;br/&gt;realm of classical three-dimensional knot theory, relating for instance &lt;br/&gt;to questions of knot symmetry and genus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
