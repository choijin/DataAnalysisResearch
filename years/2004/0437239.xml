<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to reconcile two methods for modeling change in&lt;br/&gt;social networks over time: a class of statistical models and intelligent agent&lt;br/&gt;models. The research contrasts the properties of these two approaches,&lt;br/&gt;exploring what qualitative dynamic behaviors in social networks are captured&lt;br/&gt;usefully and interpretably by each. The primary tools are latent variable&lt;br/&gt;representations and dynamical systems analysis. The result is a framework that&lt;br/&gt;characterizes the strengths and limitations of the two classes of models in&lt;br/&gt;multiple settings, and provides feedback that stimulates refinement of&lt;br/&gt;existing theories for social networks and development of new theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Social network theory has produced a wealth of paradigms to describe the&lt;br/&gt;nature and evolution of groups of people who interact, possibly in subgroups,&lt;br/&gt;with one another. Settings in which social network theory has been applied&lt;br/&gt;range from friend to corporations to political blocs to religious groups.&lt;br/&gt;Counterterrorism is one application of particular current importance, in which&lt;br/&gt;the notion that the network might have latent (unobservable) characteristics&lt;br/&gt;that are important to its evolution over time is especially germane.&lt;br/&gt;Currently, however, there is not good understanding of strengths and&lt;br/&gt;limitations of different models for the dynamics of social networks.&lt;br/&gt;The researchers on this project, drawn from the social sciences,&lt;br/&gt;statistics and applied mathematics, are constructing a conceptual and&lt;br/&gt;operational framework that allows the principled comparison of different&lt;br/&gt;models in multiple contexts. In addition to advances in theory and&lt;br/&gt;methodology, the framework enables social sciences researchers and other&lt;br/&gt;analysts to choose a model whose dynamic properties are most appropriate to&lt;br/&gt;each application.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
