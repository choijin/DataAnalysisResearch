<AbstractNarration>The primary goal of this research effort is to improve the effectiveness of skill transfer, rehabilitation, and collaboration via haptic devices. To do so, the PI will formulate requirements for shared control between humans and robots in haptic systems designed for training, rehabilitation, and collaboration.  An experimental test-bed comprised of two commercial haptic devices with force sensing capabilities will be employed throughout the project.  The PI will study two shared control system architectures for skill transfer.  In the first, the human acts as the novice or patient, and the robot serves as the expert.  Control schemes for the expert system (the haptic device) will be designed and analyzed theoretically and experimentally.  The second phase of the research effort will explore human-robot-human interfaces.  Here, the PI will focus on expert-novice and therapist-patient teams, with a robotic system acting as the mediator between the two.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this research and education plan is that human factors and control system design will be used to develop effective human-robot systems for skill transfer and rehabilitation.  A set of fundamental human-robot interaction issues will be addressed theoretically and experimentally: (1) the design of system architectures for effective skill transfer between humans and robots, (2) skill transfer between human-human teams as a model for human-robot interaction, and (3) the design and implementation of control algorithms that promote efficient skill transfer by effectively controlling feedback to each member of the system.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this work are improved health care through more efficient and effective robot assisted rehabilitation practices, enhanced skill training for defense and surgical applications, and improved understanding of human-robot interactions for skill transfer.  Specific education goals are to create innovative laboratory modules using haptic devices to enhance student learning of important engineering concepts, reinvigorate an introductory robotics course to include hands-on experiments with haptics and robotics, and high school outreach that includes internships, days-on-campus, and demonstrations using haptics to encourage students to pursue careers in science and engineering.  Each of these educational goals ties closely to the PI's existing NSF support for curriculum enhancement, and further supports her commitment to combining research and education into a cohesive and integrated career plan&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our research findings have focused on advances along three topic threads: measurements of skill performance and perception; motor adaptation and motor control; and skill training in virtual environments.  Measurements of Skill Performance &amp; Perception  There are great challenges to assess human performance in motor control tasks used for training and skill acquisition. In a series of studies, we determined strong correlations between skill performance and physical quantities measured during human motor tasks for rehabilitation, skill acquisition and retention, and training. We showed that typical robotic measures, which were derived from the measurements taken from the sensors mounted on the hardware, can predict conventional performance metrics formulated from the long term evaluation protocols. In one case, we showed that these robotic measures were related to the clinical measures of a long term stroke rehabilitation protocol determined by an expert physical therapist, and in another case, we related the performance of a rhythmic task to the derivatives of robotic measures in order to design robust and efficient training and assistance schemes. In addition, we developed a complex dynamic task with the intention of analyzing human performance to show that the proposed robotic measures are task independent and are reliable measures in number of other applications.  Studies were also completed in order to determine robotic measures for robotic-assisted surgery and updating training protocols to include haptic feedback. Finally, we measured a human's perceptual sensitivity to robotic measures in order to determine internal limitations of training schemes used by human users. We suggest that the perceptual limitations must be considered for designing effective human based training scheme.     Motor Adaptation and Motor Control  We tested the effects of various visual error augmentation methods on the speed and amount of motor adaptation to a rotational visual distortion environment using an experiments involving 16 subjects. We also showed that subjects relied on magnitude amplification cues for adaptation to new target frequencies in a excitation at resonant frequency task. Finally, we explored the sources of intermittency in slow human movements and experimentally tested the smooth movement model in the literature in two separate studies.     Skill Training in Virtual Environments  Virtual environments (VEs) with haptic feedback not only provide a safe and versatile practice medium for many manual control tasks, but the addition of haptic guidance to VEs promises to improve efficacy of manual skill training. Our findings in this domain are summarized in five projects that focus on two scenarios of skill transfer. In one scenario, the human acts as the novice or patient while the robot serves as the expert. Control schemes for the expert system (the haptic device) have been designed and analyzed theoretically and experimentally.

In another scenario, we explored human-robot-human interfaces facilitating expert-novice and therapist-patient teams, with a robotic system acting as the mediator between the two.
