<AbstractNarration>Our eyes are never at rest.Even when e are .xating upon a visual target,small involuntary eye&lt;br/&gt;movements continuously perturb the projection of the image on the retina.A substantial body of&lt;br/&gt;recent evidence indicates that these .xational eye movements are an important component of the&lt;br/&gt;ay visual information is acquired and represented in the brain.Neurophysiological studies with&lt;br/&gt;monkeys have sho n that small eye movements strongly a .ect the responses of neurons in the visual&lt;br/&gt;system.In the research of a previous NSF award (EIA-0130851),e have shown that fixational&lt;br/&gt;instability is crucial for identifying stimuli presented for the brief durations that occur during&lt;br/&gt;natural viewing (Rucci and Desbordes,2003),and improves the efficiency of visual representations&lt;br/&gt;in models of the lateral geniculate nucleus and primary visual cortex (Rucci and Casile,2003b,&lt;br/&gt;2004).Furthermore,reproduction of human eye movements in a robotic system has sho n that&lt;br/&gt;.xational instability may provide reliable information of distance (Santini and Rucci,2003).&lt;br/&gt;Building on our previous results and those of recent neurophysiological studies,this proposal&lt;br/&gt;continues part of the research of NSF a ard EIA-0130851.It describes a program of research that&lt;br/&gt;focuses on extracting and integrating multiple depth cues to develop a reliable 3D representation&lt;br/&gt;of the visual scene.This project follows an interdisciplinary approach that integrates computer&lt;br/&gt;modeling of the visual cortex with robotic experiments and measurements of eye movements in&lt;br/&gt;human subjects.The long-term goal of this research is to develop machine vision systems that,by&lt;br/&gt;emulating the computational principles of the brain,achieve high levels of robustness and e .ciency.&lt;br/&gt;The specific aims of this project are to:&lt;br/&gt;1.Develop a model of the monkey primary visual cortex in which,following recent neurophysi-&lt;br/&gt;ological .ndings,distinct populations of neurons respond during di .erent phases of small eye&lt;br/&gt;movements.&lt;br/&gt;2.(a)Analyze the information of relative distance transmitted by di .erent neuronal populations&lt;br/&gt;when the model is coupled with a robotic oculomotor orkstation that replicates human eye&lt;br/&gt;movements;and (b)integrate depth information provided by di .erent cues into a coherent&lt;br/&gt;3D representation of the visual scene.&lt;br/&gt;3.Investigate the self-organization of the model by means of learning,so that the extraction&lt;br/&gt;and integration of depth information is autonomously tuned to the physical and motor char-&lt;br/&gt;acteristics of the system.&lt;br/&gt;In this research,the eye movements of human observers will be measured by a high-resolution&lt;br/&gt;eye-tracker,and then accurately replicated by a robotic system (a head/eye system with t o mo-&lt;br/&gt;bile cameras)that e have speci .cally designed to reproduce the visual inputs to the eyes during&lt;br/&gt;oculomotor behavior.Visual images acquired in this ay will be applied as input to computational&lt;br/&gt;models of neurons in the striate cortex of primates.Intellectual merit: This project establishes&lt;br/&gt;a direct linkbet een human and machine vision studies.By focusing on the computational mecha-&lt;br/&gt;nisms by which eye movements a .ect visual processing,it has the potential of providing new insights&lt;br/&gt;on the brain as ell as opening the ay to the development of new algorithms in machine vision.&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact: The interdisciplinary nature of this research o .ers new opportunities for train-&lt;br/&gt;ing students.By collaborating with the PI,students in the Department of Cognitive and Neural&lt;br/&gt;Systems at Boston University,a department ith an important focus on computational modeling&lt;br/&gt;of the brain,will have an opportunity to combine their theoretical orkwith the development of&lt;br/&gt;machine vision systems.</AbstractNarration>
