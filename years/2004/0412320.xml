<AbstractNarration>The object of the proposed research is to characterize and understand the behavior, especially the&lt;br/&gt;dynamics (molecular motion), of thin-film polymers on solid surfaces. Characterization of the&lt;br/&gt;properties of the polymers is crucial to an understanding of how various devices work. Ultimately,&lt;br/&gt;the properties of devices containing polymers can be improved if the behavior and their roles are&lt;br/&gt;understood. These determinations become even more crucial as the size of the devices, and hence the&lt;br/&gt;thickness of the polymer films, becomes smaller. The properties of the very-thin polymer films will&lt;br/&gt;be studied with a variety of techniques including, mainly, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy&lt;br/&gt;(NMR), and also modulated differential scanning calorimetry (MDSC), Fourier-transform infra-red&lt;br/&gt;spectroscopy (FTIR), and other techniques. The chemical/spectroscopic results will be correlated,&lt;br/&gt;when possible, to physical property studies, such as the measurement of adhesion strength in thin&lt;br/&gt;films.                                                                                                                                                                          &lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the proposed research is based on the understanding of the very complex&lt;br/&gt;phenomena in polymer thin films. Their dynamics are difficult to quantify with many of the&lt;br/&gt;techniques that are applied to chemical systems because of the thinness and opacity of the surface&lt;br/&gt;systems. The use of these complementary techniques will give unprecedented detail to the&lt;br/&gt;characterization of the dynamics of adsorbed polymers, especially through the use of twodimensional&lt;br/&gt;exchange deuterium NMR of adsorbed polymers. The segmental dynamics of the&lt;br/&gt;polymer chains will be interpreted in terms of distributions of correlation times and the results of the&lt;br/&gt;distributions will be used to determine the state of the polymer films.                                                                  &lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this research lies in the impact of the research itself on the technology,&lt;br/&gt;education and training of students, and the transfer of this knowledge to the scientific community&lt;br/&gt;and the public. The work to be performed will aid device makers in designing better systems for&lt;br/&gt;advanced applications that include thin polymer films. These applications are in electronic materials,&lt;br/&gt;sensors, particle stabilization, and composites fields, to name just a few. Knowledge of how material&lt;br/&gt;properties, such as adhesion, vary as a function of thickness allows the prediction and, indeed,&lt;br/&gt;avoidance of failure of these devices. The students educated through this research will be exposed to&lt;br/&gt;a wide variety of experiences, often from synthesis through the measurement of mechanical&lt;br/&gt;properties. They will develop an invaluable interdisciplinary background that will assist in making&lt;br/&gt;them more effective employees in complex technological fields. The scientific community and&lt;br/&gt;public at-large will also benefit through the activities of the PI in professional societies focused on&lt;br/&gt;improving and disseminating knowledge. This includes strong components of public outreach. In&lt;br/&gt;addition, the PI's scientific activities will enhance his own outreach to the community through&lt;br/&gt;involvement in and service to the important field of education.</AbstractNarration>
