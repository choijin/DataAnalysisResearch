    <AbstractNarration>This project is a collaboration between experimental petrologists at &lt;br/&gt;U. Minnesota and analytical geochemists at Arizona State to address &lt;br/&gt;two of the chief goals of the CSEDI initiative: (1) to understand &lt;br/&gt;the Earth's deep water cycle and (2) to understand the influence of &lt;br/&gt;H2O on melting, phase transitions, and physical properties of the &lt;br/&gt;mantle. Experiments to determine the H2O storage capacity of &lt;br/&gt;peridotite under upper mantle, transition zone, and lower mantle &lt;br/&gt;conditions will be performed using high temperature high pressure &lt;br/&gt;devices at the University of Minnesota. The storage capacity is the &lt;br/&gt;maximum H2O that can be retained in solid peridotite at a given &lt;br/&gt;temperature and pressure. Storage capacities constrain possible &lt;br/&gt;regions of H2O-rich mantle reservoirs and possible loci of hydrous &lt;br/&gt;melting. Owing to the large effect of H2O on mantle properties such &lt;br/&gt;as creep strength, elasticity, and conductivity, they also provide &lt;br/&gt;critical constraints on mantle dynamics. Experimental products will &lt;br/&gt;be analyzed at Arizona State for trace quantities of H2O using &lt;br/&gt;newly-developed low-blank secondary ion mass spectrometry techniques. &lt;br/&gt;Four related experimental problems will be addressed: (1) To &lt;br/&gt;investigate recent indications that the upper mantle has a larger &lt;br/&gt;storage capacity than previously appreciated, experiments at 3-13 &lt;br/&gt;Gigapascals will determine peridotite H2O storage capacities. (2) To &lt;br/&gt;determine the influence of H2O on deep melting beneath oceanic ridges &lt;br/&gt;and oceanic islands and the consequences for dehydration of the upper &lt;br/&gt;mantle, mineral/melt H2O partitioning will be determined at 3-8 GPa. &lt;br/&gt;(3) To better understand transport of H2O across the 410 km &lt;br/&gt;discontinuity, including the effect of H2O on melting and phase &lt;br/&gt;transitions, inter-mineral partitioning of H2O and the storage &lt;br/&gt;capacity will be determined at 13-15 GPa over a range of &lt;br/&gt;temperatures. (4) To help resolve controversy about the storage &lt;br/&gt;capacity of the lower mantle, experiments will be performed at 22-25 &lt;br/&gt;GPa, pressures relevant to in the region of the 670 km discontinuity.</AbstractNarration>
