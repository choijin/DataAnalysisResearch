<AbstractNarration>This research targets a suite of tools (called "3D Sketchpad")&lt;br/&gt;for creating interactive 3D illustrations. Example applications&lt;br/&gt;include a teacher explaining physics, an archaeologist recreating&lt;br/&gt;a model of an ancient village, a high school student producing an&lt;br/&gt;eye-catching animation, and a physician explaining a diagnosis to&lt;br/&gt;a patient. The key innovation is to support 3D modeling by&lt;br/&gt;drawing. The resulting content looks like the user's drawing, but&lt;br/&gt;is 3D in the sense that the viewpoint can be moved interactively.&lt;br/&gt;The long-range impact of this research is fourfold. First, tools&lt;br/&gt;that let ordinary people create 3D content will dramatically&lt;br/&gt;expand the applications of 3D graphics. Second, expert users will&lt;br/&gt;design content that they would not have undertaken with current&lt;br/&gt;tools because it would be too difficult or time-consuming. Third,&lt;br/&gt;these tools support 3D content that is aesthetically closer to&lt;br/&gt;traditional illustration than is currently possible. Finally,&lt;br/&gt;this technology will propagate synergistically with the growth of&lt;br/&gt;pen-based computing. Tools for creating 3D drawings will&lt;br/&gt;ultimately be commonplace on tablet PCs, palm devices, and even&lt;br/&gt;cell phones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A key challenge is to develop new shape representations and&lt;br/&gt;associated operations that support a drawing-based interface. The&lt;br/&gt;researchers are developing a new representation, called a&lt;br/&gt;"layered mesh", consisting of a multiresolution mesh that is&lt;br/&gt;built up incrementally in layers. Each new layer responds&lt;br/&gt;dynamically to changes in the previous layers. Layered meshes&lt;br/&gt;support the addition of new structures (e.g. limbs of a human&lt;br/&gt;figure) and surface details (bumps or bulges) at any&lt;br/&gt;resolution. They produce piecewise-smooth manifold surfaces of&lt;br/&gt;arbitrary topology.  Additional challenges include the&lt;br/&gt;development of new non-photorealistic rendering algorithms, new&lt;br/&gt;interaction techniques based on gestural input, new methods for&lt;br/&gt;generating animation via sketched input, and pattern synthesis&lt;br/&gt;tools whereby new shape features, stroke patterns, and motions&lt;br/&gt;can all be generated from provided examples.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
