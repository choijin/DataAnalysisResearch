<AbstractNarration>Prop ID:    DMS-0449204   &lt;br/&gt;P I:     Kou, Samuel  &lt;br/&gt;Organization:   Harvard University &lt;br/&gt;Program:  Career 2005&lt;br/&gt;Title:    CAREER: Stochastic Modeling and Inference in Biophysics  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;                                  Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Advances of experimental and computing technology have profoundly &lt;br/&gt;changed the field of biophysics. On the experimental side, recent developments &lt;br/&gt;in nanotechnology have allowed scientists to follow biological processes on &lt;br/&gt;single-molecule basis, providing scientists with powerful means of studying many &lt;br/&gt;biophysical processes that were inaccessible just a decade ago. This new &lt;br/&gt;frontier also raises significant statistical challenges. It calls upon an &lt;br/&gt;urgent need for stochastic modeling, because many classical models derived &lt;br/&gt;from oversimplified assumption are no longer valid for single-molecule &lt;br/&gt;experiments. Parallel to the experimental progress, the rapid advance of &lt;br/&gt;computing resources and Monte Carlo methods also offers great potential &lt;br/&gt;for biophysical studies, because in most biophysical experiments inference&lt;br/&gt;on the underlying stochastic dynamics is complicated by latent processes, &lt;br/&gt;and many biophysical problems are computing intensive. The proposal &lt;br/&gt;consists of three projects: (A)  Constructing stochastic models that account &lt;br/&gt;for the subdiffusion phenomenon in single-molecule biophysics, where the &lt;br/&gt;goal is to provide models that are not only physically meaningful, but&lt;br/&gt;also capable of explaining the subdiffusion phenomenon that eludes classical &lt;br/&gt;diffusion models. (B) Developing data augmentation tools to handle latent &lt;br/&gt;processes in biophysical experiments, where the goal is to use the data &lt;br/&gt;augmentation techniques to augment the hidden processes so as to &lt;br/&gt;efficiently infer from the experimental data the biophysical properties &lt;br/&gt;of interest. (C) Developing more efficient Monte Carlo method for computing&lt;br/&gt;intensive biophysics problems, where the goal is to construct new Monte &lt;br/&gt;Carlo methods capable of sampling complicated distributions, and apply the &lt;br/&gt;new method to study the HP protein folding problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Technology advances have profoundly changed the society and science&lt;br/&gt;in the recent decades. The field of biophysics benefits from these &lt;br/&gt;advances in particular, as the technology advances have allowed scientists &lt;br/&gt;to study many biological processes that were inaccessible just a decade &lt;br/&gt;ago. These advances also raise significant challenges for statistics, &lt;br/&gt;because the unprecedented amount of data brought by the new technology &lt;br/&gt;requires critical statistical analysis. While the United States leads the &lt;br/&gt;world in both statistics and biophysics research, future prominence depends&lt;br/&gt;on innovations in both fields and the interdisciplinary collaborations &lt;br/&gt;between them. The research in this proposal aims at developing new &lt;br/&gt;statistical models and inference tools that can be directly applied to &lt;br/&gt;biophysics studies and will lead to new insight about the physics of complex&lt;br/&gt;biological processes. The development of statistics and biophysics not only&lt;br/&gt;presents many interdisciplinary research opportunities, but also attracts &lt;br/&gt;many bright students in mathematical, biological and physical sciences. &lt;br/&gt;The proposed research is integrated with the principal investigator's &lt;br/&gt;educational activities at both the graduate and undergraduate level.&lt;br/&gt;It seeks to meet high academic standards, while providing graduate &lt;br/&gt;training that will prepare students for interdisciplinary research careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
