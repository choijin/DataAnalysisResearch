<AbstractNarration>     The investigator constructs mathematical models for bacterial&lt;br/&gt;propulsion and pattern formation.  Attention is restricted mostly&lt;br/&gt;to two classes of bacteria: myxobacteria and mollicutes.  This work&lt;br/&gt;is performed in collaboration or correspondence with experimental&lt;br/&gt;laboratories engaged in studies of these organisms.  The models are&lt;br/&gt;primarily directed towards understanding and explaining their&lt;br/&gt;experimental observations.  The specific goals of this project are to&lt;br/&gt;model (i) the gliding mechanisms of Myxobacteria and Mollicutes, (ii)&lt;br/&gt;the swimming mechanisms of E. coli and Synechococcus, and (iii)&lt;br/&gt;aggregation and fruiting body formation in Myxobacteria.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The investigator develops mathematical and computational models&lt;br/&gt;of different mechanisms by which bacteria move.  Bacteria use&lt;br/&gt;many different mechanisms to move about on surfaces and through&lt;br/&gt;fluids.  The term "gliding" is used to describe the motion of&lt;br/&gt;bacteria on surfaces when there is no visible means of&lt;br/&gt;propulsion.  The investigator studies the molecular and cellular&lt;br/&gt;mechanisms that underlie this mysterious form of locomotion. &lt;br/&gt;Many bacteria swim, driven by rotating "propellors" called&lt;br/&gt;flagella.  However, the motor mechanism that turns this propellor&lt;br/&gt;has not been worked out, and is a focus of this project.  The&lt;br/&gt;photosynthetic bacterium, Synechococcus, lives in the oceans, and&lt;br/&gt;constitutes the most abundant organism on the planet.  How it&lt;br/&gt;swims is a longstanding mystery, for it has no visible propulsive&lt;br/&gt;organelle on its surface.  The investigator and his colleagues&lt;br/&gt;suggest and model a mechanism for how this bacterium swims.  The&lt;br/&gt;broader impact of these studies grows from the insights they&lt;br/&gt;provide into the propulsion, development, and mechanochemistry of&lt;br/&gt;bacteria, many of which are important pathogens of great medical&lt;br/&gt;interest.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

This is another collaboration, this time between evolutionary biologists and theorists investigating the evolution of the patterns on sea shells. The work was based on an earlier model that demonstrated that sea shell patterns are generated by the secretion of pigment under control of the animal's nervous system. This study, therefore, is the first to document the evolution of a nervous system.           Last Modified: 10/26/2011       Submitted by: George F Oster]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
