<AbstractNarration>The control of oxidative free radical coupling/polymerization chemistry in plants was a decisive adaptation of such organisms in order to access a land-based habitat.  In so doing, these diverse plant forms elaborated new biochemistries to generate a plethora of phenylpropanoid (acetate) natural products with important roles, e.g. in plant defense and later with applications in human health (including as antiviral, anticancer and bactericidal agents).  These metabolic pathways also gave the structurally complex biopolymers, the lignins, which largely determine woody textural properties, and the suberins (in cork tissue) that enabled plants to survive in desiccating environments.  This contrasts with other organismal types (e.g. with mammals), where radical chemistry is not as well controlled, e.g. in humans, where this lack of control can lead to more rapid aging and increased susceptibility to various diseases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will investigate the basis of how such radical coupling/polymerization chemistries are actually controlled in plants, and how they evolved, as well as building upon discovery of dirigent proteins.  The latter represents the first example of a protein controlling radical-radical coupling, and thus the research to be undertaken will determine the nature of the key features on the protein involved in radical binding, stabilization and ultimately its product formation.  The technologies that will be used in this study are those of electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography and site-directed mutagenesis, i.e. procedures, which will enable identification of the key features in dirigent proteins that control such radical chemistries, as well as those in related polyphenol oxidase and regiospecific coupling enzymes.  This, in turn, will make it possible to establish how nature actually makes such diverse and complex natural products; this can be anticipated to be of immense value in many different undertakings, such as controlled radical polymerization processes leading to new materials, in nanotechnology, in medicine, and in the study of protein evolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of NSF support is in the ability to encourage and nurture young scientists (particularly from underrepresented and underserved groups) at the undergraduate, graduate, postdoctoral, visiting scientist and high school teacher levels in developing their careers.  The latter mechanism gives an excellent avenue for introducing the latest technological insights and advances into schools.  In addition to the scientific benefits described above, these investigators are involved in a number of other outreach activities including the Washington State University (WSU) Plant Biochemistry Summer Course, the annual WSU Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Workshop; and general talks to high school students and the general public, for example on the pros and cons of genetically modified foods and the diversity of dietary phytochemicals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual merit: Plants that are widely used as sources of food, fiber and specialty chemicals are often protected against opportunistic pathogens (bacteria/fungi etc.) through formation of key plant natural products with roles in plant defense.  Other plant metabolites have a critical role in generating woody tissues, from which both our forests and indeed all of our crops depend.   Several seminal discoveries were made in this study as regards formation of various key plant natural products involved in those processes, i.e. to the important phenolic lignans, lignins, and allyl/propenyl phenols.  This was made possible initially through discovery of the first example of how the biochemistries of unstable phenoxy free radicals are actually controlled in planta, this involving a dirigent protein (DP) (Latin dirigere; to guide or align) which captures unstable radical intermediates, with these being bound, orientated and processed, to give the 8&ndash;8' linked lignan (+)-pinoresinol.  The latter, once formed, then serves as a central intermediate to important plant defense lignans, such as podophyllotoxin (Figure 1) and plicatic acid.  In addition, a DP preferentially engendering formation of the corresponding (&ndash;)-enantiomer was also discovered, this providing further insight into how these molecules are generated.  This opens up a completely new area in plant biochemistry.   A second major discovery is that of how various plants produce molecules, such as the phenols eugenol and chavicol, these largely been responsible for the desirable properties of several of our important spices, such as in cloves (Figure 2), basil (Figure 3), etc.  Over millennia, such substances became essential for helping stabilize foodstuffs against decay and improving the flavor/fragrance of these foods.  In our studies, the long sought-after enzyme involved, chavicol/eugenol synthase, as well as its regio-specific isoform, was discovered and the corresponding genes have been obtained.  The third major finding in our study is how plants actually form phenylalanine, where we discovered a multigene family involved in the last step of its formation, i.e. the arogenate dehydratase family.  We have since established that several of these genes play a pivotal role in carbon allocation to primary metabolism affording proteins, whereas other members are involved in woody tissue (lignin) formation.  This, in turn,  provides us with new avenues to probe how woody plants can be made more amenable for processing for bioenergy/petrochemical replacement purposes.  Broader impacts:  We provide a nurturing environment to encourage interested high school, undergraduate and graduate students, high school teachers, researchers at many different levels, members of the general public, with opportunities through internships to explore/hone their interests and capabilities in science as a career.  During the duration of the award, three high school teachers became up-to-date, through NSF supported summer Research Experience for Teachers (RET) internships, to enhance their high school biotechnology programs and offerings: In particular, new areas of emphasis including transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics have been added to their training program.  Our approach is also very attractive to high school students, through NSF-supported internships (Research Assistantships for High School Students, RAHSS) for young high school students to help nurture/foster their evolving interests in scientific career paths.  Since 2008, 5 high school students (sophomore, 4 females, one male, one Hispanic) have undergone this training.  Of these promising new scientists, one is enrolled at Evergreen College (WA), another is at Smith College, one is a Regents Scholar at Washington State University, and the other two are finishing high school with interests in applying to institutions such as Harvey Mudd College, California Institute of Technology, and Massachusetts Institute of ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
