    <AbstractNarration>The purpose of this proposal is to establish standards and rubrics for assessing robotics competitions in the middle and high school grades. Robotics competitions are growing in popularity as a method for infusing science, engineering, and technology in hands-on activities that engage students in design and development. However, curricular materials for this field have not been developed. Through the inclusion of experts and practitioners in robotics and technology, this project will produce a document entitled "Robotics Assessment and Instructional Explanation Report" that will be available to developers and practitioners of this educational tool.</AbstractNarration>
