<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;Proposal DMS-0406504&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Applications of potential theory to geometric analysis.&lt;br/&gt;PI: Denis A. Labutin, University of California, Santa Barbara&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is dedicated to investigation of main elliptic&lt;br/&gt;partial differential  equations arising in&lt;br/&gt;Riemannian geometry, namely equations with the Monge-Ampere operator,&lt;br/&gt;Laplacian, and conformal Laplacian. The central question for the project&lt;br/&gt;is the analysis of the singular sets arising in geometric problems.&lt;br/&gt;It is  proposed to approach several problems  using ideas&lt;br/&gt;from nonlinear potential theory. Let us describe the problems.&lt;br/&gt;The singular Yamabe problem originates in the work of&lt;br/&gt;Loewner and Nirenberg, and Schoen and&lt;br/&gt;Yau. It consists of finding conformal deformation of the&lt;br/&gt;metric in a domain of a Riemannian manifold (unit sphere is the model &lt;br/&gt;case)&lt;br/&gt;to a complete metric with  a constant scalar curvature.&lt;br/&gt;The question is how to describe the domains for which it is possible.&lt;br/&gt;In the case of the conformal deformation to the constant negative&lt;br/&gt;scalar curvature in the unit sphere   it was recently solved by PI.&lt;br/&gt;The answer is that it is possible if and only if  the complement&lt;br/&gt;is not thin in the potential theory sense. This means that the&lt;br/&gt;Wiener-type test with  a certain capacity holds at any point of&lt;br/&gt;the complement. In the case of the conformal deformation to the zero &lt;br/&gt;scalar curvature&lt;br/&gt;there is a strong evidence that the criterion will be  the polarity of&lt;br/&gt;of the complement with respect to another capacity.&lt;br/&gt;PI intends to verify it. Can one extend the results&lt;br/&gt;from the sphere  to general closed manifolds?&lt;br/&gt;Under what additional assumptions?&lt;br/&gt;Can potential theory  ideas contribute&lt;br/&gt;to the deformation to positive scalar curvature?&lt;br/&gt;Another  group of questions is related to the&lt;br/&gt;Liouville theorems on negatively curved&lt;br/&gt;Cartan-Hadamard manifolds.  The  main  problem is easy to state. Does &lt;br/&gt;any such  manifold&lt;br/&gt;of dimension greater than  three with uniform  upper negative sectional &lt;br/&gt;curvature bound&lt;br/&gt;support a nontrivial bounded harmonic function?&lt;br/&gt;PI believes that potential theory ideas&lt;br/&gt;can contribute to better understanding&lt;br/&gt;of this question.  The solvability of the Dirichlet problem&lt;br/&gt;at infinity  (and hence the failure of the Liouville theorem)&lt;br/&gt;for strongly negatively curved Cartan-Hadamard manifolds&lt;br/&gt;was established in the works by&lt;br/&gt;Sullivan, Anderson, Schoen, and Ancona.&lt;br/&gt;There are certain similarities with the Dirichlet problem&lt;br/&gt;in irregular domains in&lt;br/&gt;the flat space, where&lt;br/&gt;potential theory ideas are proved to be useful.&lt;br/&gt;Validity of Liouville theorems in a domain&lt;br/&gt;is  known to be equivalent to the polarity of&lt;br/&gt;the complement with respect to the classical&lt;br/&gt;electrostatic  capacity. Can one establish a similar relation for&lt;br/&gt;the manifolds?  Is curvature the adequate&lt;br/&gt;characteristic of the metric for such problems?&lt;br/&gt;Results of Grigoryan and Saloff-Coste&lt;br/&gt;show, that for a different but related question of the validity of&lt;br/&gt;Harnack inequality, the correct language is the Riemannian volume growth&lt;br/&gt;and local Poincare-type  inequalities rather than the nonnegative &lt;br/&gt;curvature.&lt;br/&gt;It is certain that the new methods will have to be developed for&lt;br/&gt;Liouville theorems. The main goal of the project is investigation of&lt;br/&gt;the described problems  using the techniques which have not been &lt;br/&gt;applied to such problems&lt;br/&gt;before.  These are the techniques of nonlinear potential theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The area of interaction between nonlinear partial differential equations&lt;br/&gt;and geometry is undergoing a strong development. However, the current &lt;br/&gt;research&lt;br/&gt;is not primarily aimed at the questions proposed in the project. The  &lt;br/&gt;project&lt;br/&gt;is focused on the application of the methods from&lt;br/&gt;technically difficult area of nonlinear partial differential equations,&lt;br/&gt;namely nonlinear potential theory, to several concrete problems about&lt;br/&gt;singularities arising in Riemannian geometry. Previously these  methods &lt;br/&gt;were not&lt;br/&gt;systematically applied and developed in such context. More complete  &lt;br/&gt;understanding of&lt;br/&gt;potential theoretic methods in geometric analysis will be  of great &lt;br/&gt;help in&lt;br/&gt;detailing the way to better understanding of singularities in geometric &lt;br/&gt;problems.&lt;br/&gt;Better understanding of singularites of geometric objects leads in its &lt;br/&gt;turn to&lt;br/&gt;progress in problems from theoretical physics, topology and other areas &lt;br/&gt;of mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
