<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;Proposal DMS-0400702&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Qualitatitve studies of parabolic partial differential equations&lt;br/&gt;PI: Peter Polacik, University of Minnesota (Twin Cities)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The abstract follows:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will develop along the following central themes: symmetry &lt;br/&gt;properties of positive solutions of parabolic PDEs, principal Floquet &lt;br/&gt;bundles and exponential separation, large time behavior of solutions of &lt;br/&gt;parabolic PDEs and the dynamics of quasilinear competition-diffusion &lt;br/&gt;systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Symmetry  (radial or reflectional) plays an important role in &lt;br/&gt;qualitative analysis of solutions of PDEs.  By now, a fairly general &lt;br/&gt;understanding of symmetry of positive solutions has been achieved for &lt;br/&gt;second order elliptic equations on both bounded and unbounded domains, &lt;br/&gt;and for parabolic equations on bounded domains. For nonautonomous &lt;br/&gt;parabolic equations on unbounded domains the symmetry problem has not &lt;br/&gt;been addressed so far.  This problem is more intriguing; standard &lt;br/&gt;methods used in earlier symmetry results do not give desired &lt;br/&gt;conclusions. Exponential separation, associated with the principal &lt;br/&gt;Floquet bundle of linearized parabolic equations, is among new &lt;br/&gt;techniques  that can facilitate the analysis. The principal Floquet &lt;br/&gt;bundle is an interesting topic in its own right. It is a natural &lt;br/&gt;extension of the concept of principal eigenfunction of elliptic &lt;br/&gt;operators to nonautonomous parabolic operators which has already proved &lt;br/&gt;very useful in the study  of nonlinear equations. Both its basic &lt;br/&gt;properties and applications are to be further investigated. A better &lt;br/&gt;understanding is needed to make this tool applicable to problems on &lt;br/&gt;unbounded domains, however, ideas related to this concept have already &lt;br/&gt;triggered progress in the symmetry problem.  The next topic, large-time &lt;br/&gt;behavior, includes  in particular a basic question on the semilinear &lt;br/&gt;heat equation, as to whether all bounded solutions on multidimensional &lt;br/&gt;domains converge to an equilibrium. This has been already been answered &lt;br/&gt;(negatively) for spatially inhomogeneous equations.  For homogeneous &lt;br/&gt;equations, this long standing open problem will require new ideas. &lt;br/&gt;Competition-diffusion systems that are to be considered in the project &lt;br/&gt;have their origins in ecology. Bifurcations of steady states, their &lt;br/&gt;stability  and as complete as possible an understanding of global &lt;br/&gt;dynamics is expected to shed light on coexistence of species (of &lt;br/&gt;phenotypes) with different dispersal rates. While a large class of &lt;br/&gt;semilinear systems has already been successfully treated, more realistic &lt;br/&gt;quasilinear systems call for a new approach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In less technical terms, the  project can be characterized as &lt;br/&gt;qualitative or geometric analysis  of solutions of  nonlinear evoution &lt;br/&gt;equations, such as  reaction-diffusion equations. As a rule, such  &lt;br/&gt;nonlinear equations can "never be solved". Letting aside exact solutions &lt;br/&gt;which are very rarely available, approximate methods, even with the &lt;br/&gt;presently available computation power, can seldom provide answers to &lt;br/&gt;questions of global nature, for example, questions on the behavior of &lt;br/&gt;solutions on infinite time intervals or collective behavior of solutions &lt;br/&gt;(structural stability). Yet, for the internal development of the theory &lt;br/&gt;of PDEs as well as for improvement of their modeling relevance in other &lt;br/&gt;sciences, such questions are important to ask and answer. For this &lt;br/&gt;purpose, many  methods of qualitative analysis of nonlinear PDEs have &lt;br/&gt;been developed, mainly in the last 2-3 decades. The present project &lt;br/&gt;relies on these methods, combining classical PDE techniques with &lt;br/&gt;dynamical systems ideas, and, at the same time, attempts at development &lt;br/&gt;of new techniques. Among  main objectives of the project is the &lt;br/&gt;description of the large time behavior of the solutions. Spatial &lt;br/&gt;profiles (symmetries) and temporal behavior (asymptotic periodicity, &lt;br/&gt;stabilization to equilibria) will both be examined.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
