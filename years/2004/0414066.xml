    <AbstractNarration>The focus of this research involves the development of rational chemical methods for the synthesis of carbon nanotubes. The resulting single walled nanotubes, SWNTs, will be closed on one end and open on the other, with predefined, uniform diameter, pitch, cap structure and rim structure. The project builds on and extends methods already developed in Professor Scott's laboratory for the chemical synthesis of fullerene-C60 and of numerous open geodesic polyarenes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. Lawrence T. Scott in the Department of Chemistry at Boston College. Professor Scott will focus on developing rational methodology for the synthesis of carbon nanotubes. Single walled nanotubes are expected to have an impact on nanotechnology as ultra thin, super strong, lightweight nanowires with metal-like electrical conductivity. The project also presents an excellent venue for the training of women and underrepresented minority students.</AbstractNarration>
