<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;0441530&lt;br/&gt;Harrold, Mary&lt;br/&gt;GA Tech Res Corp&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Taulbee Survey reports disappointing statistics on the number of women and minority com-&lt;br/&gt;puter science Ph.D. recipients during the 1990s. Only 15% of all Ph.D. recipients were women, only&lt;br/&gt;2% were black, and only 2% were Hispanic. In an effort to improve the representation of women&lt;br/&gt;and minorities in computer science, as the organizing committee of the 2004 ACM SIGSOFT Con-&lt;br/&gt;ference on the Foundations of Software Engineering (FSE-12), we are developing a plan to help&lt;br/&gt;increase the participation of faculty from institutions with a large minority and/or female student&lt;br/&gt;enrollment. We will target institutions that have large populations of women, African Americans or&lt;br/&gt;Hispanics. Since the conference will take place in California, we expect to be able to attract faculty&lt;br/&gt;that teach Hispanic students. Our plan is to invite faculty actively involved with the education of&lt;br/&gt;women and minorities to attend FSE-12 tutorials and conference. As part of our tutorial series,&lt;br/&gt;we will provide tutorials for the selected faculty to help them in their teaching. They also will be&lt;br/&gt;invited to the conference to stimlate their interests in software engineering and thus their students'&lt;br/&gt;interests. To help support our effort, we request NSF funding to provide travel and registration&lt;br/&gt;grants for these participants, who may not otherwise have sufficient institutional funding to attend.</AbstractNarration>
