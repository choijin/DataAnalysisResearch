<AbstractNarration>The investigator considers a physical system representing a porous&lt;br/&gt;medium, such as a groundwater aquifer or a petroleum reservoir.  The&lt;br/&gt;movement of, e.g., a contaminant or oil over several kilometers is&lt;br/&gt;strongly influenced by the properties of the intervening rock.  What&lt;br/&gt;appears to us to be bulk fluid flow is actually a complex process of&lt;br/&gt;fluid flowing through high and low permeability regions.  To simulate&lt;br/&gt;the flow, one generally uses a coarse computational grid.  In subgrid&lt;br/&gt;upscaling, one incorporates fine-scale processes within the coarse&lt;br/&gt;grid cells through a local and easily computed subgrid technique.  The&lt;br/&gt;projects objective is to obtain provably improved accuracy and&lt;br/&gt;computational efficiency.  Moreover, since this technique provides a&lt;br/&gt;good and easily computed approximation to the fine-scale movement of&lt;br/&gt;the fluids, the technique will be adapted so that the full fine-scale&lt;br/&gt;problem itself can be solved in significantly less time. &lt;br/&gt;One post-doc, two graduate students, and one undergraduate student&lt;br/&gt;will be involved in the research, and educated in the&lt;br/&gt;interdisciplinary environment.  The work will be disseminated at&lt;br/&gt;interdisciplinary meetings and in the mathematics, groundwater, and&lt;br/&gt;reservoir simulation literature to maximize its impact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The contamination of groundwater is one of the most serious&lt;br/&gt;environmental problems facing the nation.  Improvements to the&lt;br/&gt;predictive capabilities of groundwater simulations in heterogeneous&lt;br/&gt;formations would have a wide-ranging impact.  The engineering of&lt;br/&gt;petroleum and natural gas production uses heavily subsurface&lt;br/&gt;simulation technologies as well.  The subgrid upscaling method has&lt;br/&gt;shown great promise, and this proposal will further its development&lt;br/&gt;while promoting important educational and societal objectives.</AbstractNarration>
