<AbstractNarration>The aim of this joint partnership proposal submitted by the School of Education at the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor in collaboration with Detroit Public Schools is to extend the study of the impact of a standards-based curriculum on student statewide standardized test achievement.  Over the past five years, researchers working with curriculum specialists in Detroit Public schools, developed five curricular projects based on the Benchmarks for Science Literacy (AAAS, 1993) and the National Research Council Science Standards.  The projects take 8-10 weeks to complete and are highly specialized in principles and methods.  The project draws on materials that are highly usable to teachers and students, and are supported by technology and ongoing professional development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Data collected by cohorts over the last five years of implementation at grades 6, 7 and 8 show significant increases in student achievement (using student participation in one unit as a baseline).  On both pre- and post-test curriculum-specific assessments and the Michigan Educational Assessment Program tests gains were evident as determined via quasi-experimental comparisons among students who did or did not participate in the curricular projects.  The results were even higher for at-risk African-American boys who participated in the project-based programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Building on the initial results from the 5-year study, the researchers propose to continue this investigation focusing on the long-term and longitudinal impact of standards-based curriculum on state test scores.  In addition to improving student achievement in Detroit Public Schools, the results have the potential for impacting STEM education nationally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
