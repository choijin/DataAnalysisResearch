<AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Microbial biology for FY2004.  The fellowship supports training and research on the basic biology of protozoan, microalgal, fungal, archaeal, bacterial and viral species that are not generally considered to be model organisms. Further, it provides opportunities for recent doctoral recipients to obtain additional training in microbial biology, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of established scientists, and to broaden their scientific horizons beyond the research experiences during the undergraduate and graduate training.  These fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including foreign locations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research and training plan is entitled "Microbial Diversity and Nitrogen Cycling in Stream Sediments of the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica." Algal communities of the McMurdo Dry Valleys greatly impact the biogeochemical cycling of nutrients in streams entering the permanently frozen lake ecosystems.  These communities remain freeze-dried for most of the year and within 20 minutes of receiving water are active communities affecting water quality of the system.  Understanding the diversity and metabolic capabilities of the algal mats and associated microbial communities will provide a better understanding of processes in this extreme polar desert.  Presently very little is known about the genetic diversity of these mats and stream sediments. A detailed study of the hyporheic zones will be conducted to assess the interactions between nitrogen species and microbial communities, using various techniques, including 16s rRNA and molecular enzyme analysis.  This research anticipates identifying novel organisms that may be important for water and wastewater treatment of nitrate-containing waters in cold temperature regions.  This project will also provide more information on the microbial diversity of cold environments, which may be important to the field of exobiology.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
