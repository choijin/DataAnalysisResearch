    <AbstractNarration>Rhythmic processes exhibiting 24 hour periodicity under constant conditions are observed in organisms spanning all major kingdoms of life. These circadian rhythms control a diverse array of physiological processes and are responsive to environmental stimuli such as light and temperature. Understanding the molecular mechanisms operating during circadian time keeping in diverse organisms is important for identifying common themes and characterizing unique features. The goal of this proposal is to determine the role of a unique protein, ELF4, in the progression of the circadian clock in Arabidopsis. Given the myriad of processes under clock control, ranging from development to biochemistry, physiology, and reproduction, developing a mechanistic understanding of how the clock regulates such a diversity of plant biology will certainly have implications in both general biology and in agriculture. Research on the circadian clock also provides a unique opportunity to integrate molecular research with whole plant physiology. In addition to its Broader Impacts on basic and applied science, the research will have an important training function and will serve as the vehicle for training graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. Underrepresented minority involvement will also be sought.</AbstractNarration>
