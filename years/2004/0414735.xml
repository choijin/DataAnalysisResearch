<AbstractNarration>At National Institute of Standards and Technology's Center for Neutron Research (NCNR) scientists and engineers from around the U.S. use neutrons to probe the sub-microscopic structures and molecular motions that determine the properties of materials ranging from concrete to cell membranes.  One of the principal techniques used is small-angle neutron scattering (SANS), which specifically probes materials microstructure in the range from 1 nm to 500 nm.  In response to increasing demand from university researchers for SANS measurements, the NCNR, through its NSF sponsored Center for High Resolution Neutron Scattering (CHRNS), has undertaken to renovate a 20-year-old, medium resolution 8-m long SANS instrument, and to make 50 % of the beam time on the refurbished instrument available through its user program.  In addition, another 20 % of the beam time on the 10-m SANS would be set aside specifically for graduate student training and early stage thesis research.  This allocation of beam time represents a novel approach to enhancing the educational benefit of a national user facility and to developing the next generation of researchers knowledgeable and skilled in neutron scattering techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The National Institute of Standards and Technology's Center for Neutron Research (NCNR) currently operates two 30-m long small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) instruments that, in terms of neutron flux, measurement range, versatility and ease of use, are the best in North America and competitive with the best such instruments in the world.  In response to the sustained demand for SANS measurements, the NCNR, through its NSF sponsored Center for High Resolution Neutron Scattering (CHRNS), has undertaken to renovate a 20-year-old, medium resolution 8-m long SANS instrument, and to make 50 % of the beam time on the refurbished instrument available through its user program.  The modernized instrument would have a working length of 10 meters and a measurement range that would satisfy the requirements of roughly one-half to two-thirds of SANS user experiments.  In addition, another 20 % of the beam time on the 10-m SANS would be set aside specifically for graduate student training and early stage thesis research.  This allocation of beam time represents a novel approach to enhancing the educational benefit of a national user facility and to developing the next generation of researchers knowledgeable and skilled in neutron scattering techniques.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
