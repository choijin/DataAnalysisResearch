<AbstractNarration>The United States, for the first time in 20 years, will host microbiologists from around the world for the congresses of the International Union of Microbiological Societies (IUMS), an organization that promotes microbiological research worldwide. The IUMS consists of three divisions that span three major disciplines in microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, and virology.  The unifying theme of the congresses is  "Microbes in a Changing World".   The meetings will take place in San Francisco, California from July 23-28, 2005 &lt;http://www.iums2005.org&gt;. Topics include the molecular and cellular biology of microorganisms, microbial ecology and evolution, host-pathogen interactions, emerging diseases, biodefense and invasive species.  This award will support 15 small grants to  U.S. graduate students and postdoctoral researchers to attend and participate in the congresses.  The National Academy of Sciences' U.S. National Committee for the IUMS will organize the evaluation and dissemeniaton of the travel grants. Special attention will be paid to the inclusion of grantees from traditionally underrepresented groups. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is vital to the interests of global security that the internationalization of science is encouraged, especially since science is a productive forum for peaceful interaction among peoples of various cultures and beliefs.  The international congresses provide young investigators with a unique educational experience that has a lasting impact on their research careers, including possibilities for international collaboration. The meeting provides a forum for scientists to meet potential collaborators and foreign colleagues working in the same and related fields, leading to working relationships and lifelong scientific interactions. Young investigators gain the opportunity to listen to distinguished international scientists discuss the most current research across the breadth of microbiology and to interact with them in an informal setting. The international congresses also provide young scientists with different perspectives on research being done internationally, including in developing countries, and the impact of microbiological research worldwide. The resulting scientific interactions promote international cooperation and exchange, leading to scientific advances that would be difficult to achieve in isolation.</AbstractNarration>
