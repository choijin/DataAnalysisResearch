<AbstractNarration>A  central  question  in  political  science  is  the  nature  of  representation.  The  literature  has  long recognized that the representation of local and national interests is often contradictory. Furthermore, it has long  been  recognized  that  electoral  systems, the  formal  rules  that  govern  the  process  of  voting  and assigning legislative seats, are crucial to affecting the balance between local and national representation in  democracies.  The  primary  purpose  of  this  project  is  to  advance  knowledge  of  how  the  "intraparty dimension" of electoral systems affects representation. The intraparty dimension concerns rules that affect the  ways  in  which  legislators  and  legislative  candidates  relate  to  their  party  organization,  and  to constituents. To date, most literature on electoral systems has focused on the interparty dimension, i.e. the &lt;br/&gt;translation of votes into seats for parties. This project focuses on the intraparty dimension by collecting, coding,  and  analyzing  data  at  the  level  of  the  individual  legislator/candidate,  both  in  the  form  of biographical data (birthplace, political experience, occupation, etc.) and votes obtained by candidates and their ranks on party lists (where relevant, as in proportional-representation systems). Thus, the intellectual merit  of  the  proposed  research  is  to develop  theory  and  data  applicable  to  the  intraparty  dimension  of legislative representation. &lt;br/&gt;A  principal  way  in  which  electoral  systems  affect  the  local  vs.  national  balance  is  through  the incentives  given  by  the  rules  for  legislators  and  legislative  candidates  to  cultivate  a  "personal  vote," typically defined as that part of the vote that is based on a candidate's personal characteristics, experience, and service to constituents, rather than his or her party affiliation. Whereas parties are the primary vehicles for  the  representation  of  broad  interests,  including  national  issues,  candidates  often  articulate  their personal  votes  through  a  focus  on  more  local  or  otherwise  parochial  concerns.  Preliminary  results  of related  research  by  the  PI  have  shown  that  variations  in  electoral  systems  on  the  intraparty  dimension affect  the  attributes  of  legislators  under  proportional-representation  (PR)  elections.  For  instance,  the higher the degree of intraparty competition, the more likely legislators are: (1) to be native to the district they represent, and (2) to have electoral experience prior to entering the legislature.  &lt;br/&gt;This investigation builds on these preliminary findings by (1) collecting additional data on &lt;br/&gt;the countries for which the PI has undertaken preliminary research, (2) extending the data collection on legislators to additional countries, including both proportional and nonproportional electoral systems, and (3)  collecting,  coding,  and  analyzing  data  at  the  intraparty  level, including  votes  for  candidates  in systems that entail intraparty competition, and ranks on party lists for PR systems, on a wide range of democracies. &lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the proposed research are of at least three forms. First, the project will result  in  an  extensive  data  set  on  legislators  and  intraparty  voting  and  list  ranks,  which  will  be  made available to other scholars and the general public for academic, research, and noncommercial purposes. Second, it will contribute to the professional development of graduate students, through employment as graduate student researchers. Third, extending political science research on the intraparty dimension will improve  knowledge  about  the  impacts  of  electoral  reforms  that  are  being  contemplated  in  many countries, both  established  and  transitional  democracies, or  may  be  contemplated  in  the  future.  The United States is among the countries in which there is increasing interest in the effects of electoral systems on the intraparty dimension. There is ongoing experimentation at the local level with alternative electoral rules,  often  as  a  result  of Voting Rights  or  reapportionment  controversies.  At  present,  the  discipline  of political  science  has  limited  practical  advice  to  offer  regarding  the  effects  of  electoral  systems  on  the intraparty dimension. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
