    <AbstractNarration>The PIs are organizing the 4th Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Conference on Telomeres and Telomerase. The telomere field is a highly diverse and dynamic area, representing a wide variety of research interests (cancer, aging, cell cycle, meiosis, recombination, replication, etc.), as well as a large number of different organisms (mammals, fungi, protozoa, plants). This meeting provides opportunities for members of this diverse community to present and discuss recent research results. The previous three Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory meetings on Telomeres and Telomerase, brought together this diverse group of researchers and resulted in vigorous discussion and synergistic interactions stimulated by the presentation of a very large body of unpublished data. Previous conferences have provided a good balance of students, post-doctoral fellows, junior and senior researchers, with an informal atmosphere that contributes greatly to interactions between younger and older scientists. All speakers are chosen from submitted abstracts, which maximizes the opportunity for new researchers and young investigators to present their most recent unpublished work. Poster sessions and plenary talks provide additional outlets for presentation of new findings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To further encourage the participation of junior scientists, the organizers are requesting funding to help defray the costs of travel, room and board, and registration for junior scientists. Special consideration will be given to graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, junior faculty, women and minority scientists. Funds will be awarded to participants based on need and submitted abstracts.</AbstractNarration>
