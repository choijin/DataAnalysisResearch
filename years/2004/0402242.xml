    <AbstractNarration>Partners in this ATE/NSF project are developing a plan for a Center of Excellence for Welding Education to serve two-year colleges and other educational institutions. The project is building ways to support the needs of a $34.1B industry that reports shortages of competently trained welding technicians. Plans are being developed on how the center can research, prepare, and disseminate all levels of curriculum, provide faculty training to certified levels and standards, and disseminate both curriculum and training from basic through advanced welding applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Building upon previous related NSF funded projects, the project is preparing to adopt, adapt, and devise curriculum to meet both the general and highly sophisticated welding needs of the nation's industry. Primarily serving two-year associate degree granting institutions, the project is also developing articulated curriculum for the secondary and postsecondary bachelor degree institutions to provide seamless movement of students from high school to community college to university known as 2+2+2 models. The project plans to disseminate curriculum and provide training support for its use. Planning for the Center and its management structure, curriculum development, training, and dissemination functions includes two and four-year colleges experienced in welding education and the extensive network of education and industrial affiliates of the American Welding Society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Evolving and improved instructional methodology and technological advances in the field of welding require a focused effort to assure that high impact educational practices are understood and utilized. Combining the knowledge, expertise, and resources of Lorain County Community College, Moraine Valley Community College, The Ohio State University, and the American Welding Society (its network of college affiliates and contacts in industry and government), the partners are well-positioned to conduct the planning, development, and implementation activities. While making available curriculum and faculty training necessary to provide skilled workers, highly trained technicians, and welding engineers for the nation's manufacturers, the planning team is also moving relevant research in workforce needs and advanced technology to the education setting. The partners are positioned to bring their leadership, skills and knowledge to a coordinated effort to address and improve welding education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The field of welding is evolving as with all other manufacturing technologies and requires the flow of information from education to industry and from industry to education. From basic gas welding to the joining of heat sensitive materials in a clean room, the field is dynamic. The national shortage of welding technicians, and the old image of the field of welding, creates great concern within American industry, causing many to seek workers from outside the country or to move their operations. A great deal can be done to attract new and diverse students with improved curriculum and better-trained faculty. This planning grant focuses on welding education through a coordinated program of educational enhancements, industry leadership and the dissemination of high quality educational materials.</AbstractNarration>
