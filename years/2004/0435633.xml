<AbstractNarration>SES-0435633&lt;br/&gt;Kenneth Rasinski&lt;br/&gt;National Opinion Research Center&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On March 11th, 2004 Islamic terrorists exploded multiple bombs on four Spanish trains killing 191 people.  The attached occurred just before the parliamentary elections and seemed to have a profound effect on them.   In this Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) the PI will conduct a survey in Spain to gauge the public's attitudes about the March 11, 2004 train bombings in Madrid.  The PI will complete a national random digit dialing (RDD) survey of the population of Spain.  The survey seeks to answer four major questions: (1) how did people learn about the events and how did they use mass and interpersonal communications in its aftermath?  (2) what specific reactions did people have in direct response to the events?  (3) what was the general psychological response of the people in Spain, and (4) how were attitudes, beliefs, values, and political behavior affected by the events.  Results will be compared to the 2001 National Tragedy Study conducted by the National Opinion Research Center (NORC), and through an over-sampling of residence of Madrid, results will be analyzed relative to proximity to the event. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study has  broader impacts in that it could potentially help us better understand the impact of terrorist violence on the various demographic groups in society and the role that proximity plays in the level of stress experienced after traumatic events  These findings could contribute to the development of more effective social support systems and treatment for persons experiencing post-traumatic stress syndrome. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
