<AbstractNarration>Since the rise of personal computers with bitmapped displays in the 1970's and 1980's, the model of one display or monitor per computer has been the dominant paradigm for desktop computing.  The PI argues that this constraint has strongly influenced the visual interfaces built for software applications and how people have interacted with computers, and in many cases has limited productivity and innovation.  As LCD monitors that require far less desk space have become more popular and less expensive, the use of multiple monitors per computer is becoming more common.  In order for computers with large pixel-spaces to be of most benefit, however, new interaction methods and space management operations are needed.  Furthermore, large pixel-space computers will enable new forms of software systems (e.g., the extra screen area will be available for new styles of peripheral awareness tools that allow people to monitor important information in their work and personal lives).  Consequently, personal computers will become information control centers that facilitate data-intensive tasks and analysis activities.  To implement this vision, the PI will explore research in three related areas.  First, he will study existing practices in window and space management, particularly how current methods do or do not succeed on multiple monitor machines, and he will develop new space management operations more specifically focused on easing navigation and task management when the display area is so large that standard direct manipulation techniques become slow and limiting.  Second, the PI will examine whether the increased screen area is beneficial for and will lead to new capabilities in multi-window, information-rich software systems such as Integrated Development Environments and Information Visualization systems.  Third, the PI will explore how the extra screen real estate can be used to provide the user with peripheral awareness of important information such as the progress of work projects, communications from colleagues or friends, and current news and events, while not being disruptive distractions.  All of these research threads will combine to build an understanding of the capabilities and potential benefits, the strengths and weaknesses, of multi-monitor and large pixel-space computers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  If large pixel-space computers do become commonplace, people will need easier and better methods for managing the screen space and the tasks being performed there.  Even relatively modest improvements in space and window management can provide huge cumulative benefits, because computers are so pervasive in society.  Concretely identifying the advantages of machines like this, if the advantages do exist, can serve to inform people who are considering a change to a multi-monitor machine and are seeking to understand the benefits that can result.  This research has the potential to develop new and fundamentally different ways of managing tasks and interacting with user interfaces for everyone, so that they become more productive.  Furthermore, the project will create new forms of information visualization and peripheral awareness systems that will help transform personal computers into information control centers.</AbstractNarration>
