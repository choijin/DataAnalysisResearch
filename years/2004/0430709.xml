<AbstractNarration>Abtract&lt;br/&gt;Multicast networks have been proposed in the last years as a new technique for information routing&lt;br/&gt;and sharing. This new technology has an increasing number of applications in diverse fields, ranging&lt;br/&gt;from financial data distribution to video-conferencing, automatic software updates and groupware.&lt;br/&gt;In multicast networks, the objective is to send information from a source to multiple users with a&lt;br/&gt;single send operation. This approach allows one to save bandwidth, since data can be shared across&lt;br/&gt;network links. Multicast network applications often require the solution of diffcult combinatorial&lt;br/&gt;optimization problems. Most of these problems are NP-hard, which makes them very unlikely to&lt;br/&gt;be solved exactly in polynomial time. Therefore, specialized algorithms must be developed that&lt;br/&gt;give reasonable good solutions for the instances found in practice. The intrinsic complexity of these&lt;br/&gt;problems has been a technological barrier for the wide deployment of multicast services.&lt;br/&gt;We propose to design and study algorithms for some of the most important combinatorial&lt;br/&gt;problems occurring in the area of multicast networks. One of the problems in this area asks for&lt;br/&gt;the determination of an optimum route to be followed by packages in a multicast group. This&lt;br/&gt;is known as the multicast routing problem (MRP). A large number of heuristic algorithms have&lt;br/&gt;being proposed in the last years to solve the MRP, which is of great interest for network engineers.&lt;br/&gt;However, most of these heuristics do not give any guarantee of optimality and frequently are not able&lt;br/&gt;to find the global optimum for the problem. A second problem of great practical importance is that&lt;br/&gt;of finding the minimum number of cache nodes required to send multicast data when capacities are&lt;br/&gt;considered in the network links. This is also called the streaming cache placement problem (SCPP).&lt;br/&gt;The SCPP has been only recently studied, and it presents many opportunities for economy in the&lt;br/&gt;development of new multicast systems.&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this project is to study these and related problems occurring in multicast routing.&lt;br/&gt;Our goal is to find practical methods that can be used to implement efficiently the technologies&lt;br/&gt;involved with multicast applications. The development of fast algorithms for solving these problems&lt;br/&gt;represents an important step in allowing full scale implementations of multicast systems.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit of the Proposed Activities. Multicast problems are among the most&lt;br/&gt;difficult in the area of networks from the theoretical point of view. This happens since such problems&lt;br/&gt;encompass the construction of solutions involving a large number of nodes, interacting in a very&lt;br/&gt;complicated way. New concepts appearing in this area are, for example, the interplay of diverse&lt;br/&gt;source and destination nodes to achieve a common objective in a network structure. Our knowledge&lt;br/&gt;in multicast networks will have applications in other areas of network algorithmic research.&lt;br/&gt;The techniques proposed to solve the problems discussed above will involve mathematical programming,&lt;br/&gt;approximation algorithms, metaheuristics for combinatorial optimization, large scale&lt;br/&gt;computing, and parallel and distributed computing. These techniques are among the specialities of&lt;br/&gt;the PI and his research group.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact. The techniques developed in the context of this project will have broad impact&lt;br/&gt;in industrial practices for multicast network systems. A deep understanding of the algorithmic&lt;br/&gt;issues related to such applications will foster the development of better protocols, new routing implementations and improved end-user software. Beyond this, theoretical advances in this area will&lt;br/&gt;have natural applications in other network problems, such as routing and transportation systems.&lt;br/&gt;1</AbstractNarration>
