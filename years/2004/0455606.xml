<AbstractNarration>About 35% of Earth's land surface is covered with snow for varying lengths of time each year.  It is often assumed that biological activity mostly ceases in the winter, however recent research at the Alpine Microbial Observatory (AMO) shows that novel soil microorganisms are active under snow where they contribute significantly to greenhouse gas fluxes to the atmosphere.  Work at the AMO is focused on identifying never-before cultured microbes and discovering ways to grow them in the laboratory so that they can be studied using modern physiological and genomic methods.  Such studies will help the researchers at the AMO discover new forms of life and to understand how they perform important biological functions (e.g. nutrient cycling and gas production) under extremely cold conditions.  In addition, an interactive, Internet database will be further developed to explore the evolutionary relationships, distribution and functioning of novel microbes in alpine environments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will help researchers to understand how colder regions of the earth function as part of the biosphere and how they will respond to future climate change.  Such work can only be accomplished via interdisciplinary research, involving researchers with expertise in microbiology, biogeochemistry, evolutionary biology, and bioinformatics.  In addition, the research could lead to the discovery of useful products such as antibiotics and industrial enzymes that function at cold temperatures.  The development of a web-based public access system expands the educational and out-reach value of the research and will allow scientists and the public to use the knowledge generated at the AMO.  This research also will promote training through its support of two undergraduate students, two graduate students and two post-doctoral fellows. PI Schmidt will participate in the Summer Multicultural Access to Research Training program at CU Boulder and co-PI Martin will work with the Boulder School District mentoring program to provide AMO research projects for secondary school students.</AbstractNarration>
