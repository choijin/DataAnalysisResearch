    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop the technology for manufacturing nano-structured polymer coatings that will prevent aquatic biofouling of submerged man-made surfaces in an environmentally safe way. The unique cellular structure of the nano-domained coatings proposed will not only combine all the most desirable properties of the existing anti-biofouling coatings but will also provide for complete or at least significantly reduced pollution by effective binding (through a combination of strong chemical complexation forces and physical steric hindrance) of selected repellants for the fouling nuisance organisms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program will focus on the coatings for ship/boat hulls used in both marine and fresh water environments. These unique nano-structured coatings are also expected to have a very broad impact and large commercial effects in a variety of other water-based industries, ranging from shipping, fishing, tourism and defense, to production of energy in hydroelectric plants, protection of shorelines, production of potable water by desalination of sea water or from biofoulant-infested fresh-water sources, etc.</AbstractNarration>
