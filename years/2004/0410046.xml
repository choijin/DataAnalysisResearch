<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;Contacts between the earthquake engineering communities in the United States and Turkey&lt;br/&gt;have intensified since the 1999 Kocaeli and Duzce earthquakes that led to damage and&lt;br/&gt;failure of numerous structures in Turkey. Many bridges were affect by these earthquakes.&lt;br/&gt;The US engineers and researchers have been working with their Turkish counterparts to&lt;br/&gt;maximize the lessons learned from these earthquakes because these lessons would benefit&lt;br/&gt;both countries. A joint US-Turkey workshop is proposed with the following objectives: (1)&lt;br/&gt;To provide a forum to enhance communication between engineers and scientists involved in&lt;br/&gt;earthquake engineering of bridges in the United States and Turkey, (2) To exchange&lt;br/&gt;information about recent lessons learned in each country in seismic retrofit of bridges&lt;br/&gt;and health monitoring techniques to aid in post-earthquake investigations, (3) To develop&lt;br/&gt;areas of common needs and interest in bridge seismic retrofit and health monitoring, (4)&lt;br/&gt;To develop a list of priorities for future joint US-Turkey research in seismic retrofit&lt;br/&gt;and post-disaster evaluation methods for bridges, and (5) To identify sources of funding&lt;br/&gt;for joint research in both countries. Relative to previous US-Turkey workshops, the&lt;br/&gt;proposed program will have the new dimension of post-disaster evaluation of bridges.&lt;br/&gt;Approximately 18 to 20 US delegates will be selected for participation, some with full and&lt;br/&gt;others with partial support from this project. The delegates will be from federal and&lt;br/&gt;state transportation agencies, NSF, the private sector, and the academia. A steering&lt;br/&gt;committee will be formed to help select the members and develop the workshop program. The&lt;br/&gt;workshop is tentatively scheduled for August 2004 in Ankara.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed workshop will provide an opportunity for close exchange of ideas and lessons&lt;br/&gt;that have been learned in the US and Turkey in seismic retrofit and post-earthquake&lt;br/&gt;evaluation of bridges. Both countries will benefit from the workshop as information is&lt;br/&gt;discussed in detail in the course of the four-day workshop. Seismic retrofit and&lt;br/&gt;post-disaster evaluation of bridges are still emerging. Both areas encompass a great deal&lt;br/&gt;of technical and non-technical issues. Learning the perspectives of engineers and&lt;br/&gt;researchers from other earthquake-prone countries that face problems similar to those of&lt;br/&gt;the US will enrich the knowledge of the scientific and design community in the US.&lt;br/&gt;Furthermore, the new potential collaborative research could involve undergraduate and&lt;br/&gt;graduate students in the US. These students will be trained in earthquake engineering&lt;br/&gt;research and design and will be exposed to international views and perspectives. The&lt;br/&gt;training of skilled individual with understanding of international issues will enhance the&lt;br/&gt;manpower in the US scientific work force and will improve the labor pool for more advanced&lt;br/&gt;design and research work in the global market.</AbstractNarration>
