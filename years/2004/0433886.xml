<AbstractNarration>Abiotic Mobilization of Arsenic in Bangladesh Groundwater Aquifers?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Millions of people consuming groundwater in Bangladesh and other affected South Asian&lt;br/&gt;countries are exposed to As levels that are predicted to cause death and disease in the coming&lt;br/&gt;decades. The sequence of steps that leads to elevated groundwater As concentrations in these&lt;br/&gt;regions remains poorly understood, despite intense efforts by scientists throughout the world&lt;br/&gt;over the past several years. This is a serious problem because major policy decisions hinge on&lt;br/&gt;accurate prediction of the impact of groundwater pumping for irrigation on groundwater As&lt;br/&gt;concentrations. We propose here to explore with a series of simple incubation experiments a&lt;br/&gt;new mechanism for As accumulation in groundwater that could have important implications for&lt;br/&gt;the response of shallow Bangladesh aquifers to irrigation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the basis of spatial patterns of local recharge constrained by 3H-3He dating and&lt;br/&gt;groundwater As profiles established at four sites in Bangladesh, we propose that weathering of&lt;br/&gt;primary minerals is the rate-limiting step of As mobilization in shallow aquifers. The available&lt;br/&gt;data suggest that As release by this process is of similar magnitude across a wide range of&lt;br/&gt;environments, relatively insensitive to redox conditions, and therefore possibly entirely abiotic in&lt;br/&gt;nature. The implication is that the distribution of As is determined primarily by spatial variations&lt;br/&gt;in the rate of flushing of shallow aquifers by local recharge. This is a direct challenge to the&lt;br/&gt;widely-held view that the distribution of As in groundwater is controlled primarily by&lt;br/&gt;microbially-mediated reductive dissolution of Fe oxyhydroxides.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The available field data indicate a relatively consistent rate of As release of ~20 ug/L per&lt;br/&gt;year for a wide range of settings. A flux of this magnitude should therefore be detectable&lt;br/&gt;directly by isolating freshly collected aquifer material and sampling the groundwater&lt;br/&gt;periodically. In this pilot-study, we propose to conduct such incubations anaerobically for 18&lt;br/&gt;months with aquifer material from 4 depth intervals at a well-documented location. The role of&lt;br/&gt;microorganisms in As mobilization will be tested by additions of an antibiotic and acetate,&lt;br/&gt;respectively. Aquifer material from one depth interval will be subjected to additional treatments&lt;br/&gt;such as aerobic incubation and replacement of in situ groundwater with low-As groundwater or&lt;br/&gt;pond water. In addition to As concentrations, the major cations Na, Mg, K, and Ca will be&lt;br/&gt;monitored as indicators of chemical weathering. Redox-sensitive solutes such as Fe, Mn, and S&lt;br/&gt;will also be measured.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results from these simple experiments could lead to a radical change in our&lt;br/&gt;understanding of the acquisition of solutes by groundwater in the case of a troublesome&lt;br/&gt;constituent such as As (NSF Criterion 1). The new understanding derived from this work could&lt;br/&gt;influence policies that affect the lives and health of millions of people in South Asia (NSF&lt;br/&gt;Criterion 2). If our new explanation for As accumulation holds, continued irrigation might&lt;br/&gt;actually reduce As concentrations in shallow aquifers over time. This contrasts with the recent&lt;br/&gt;attribution of elevated As levels in Bangladesh groundwater to irrigation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
