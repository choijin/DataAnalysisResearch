<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DMS: 0400879&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ch Thiele&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;'Multilinear and Nonlinear Harmonic Analysis'&lt;br/&gt;:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scientific purpose of this project is to study&lt;br/&gt;three interrelated subjects in harmonic analysis:&lt;br/&gt;1) Wave packet analysis. Initiated by the proof of&lt;br/&gt;boundedness of the bilinear Hilbert transform, this type&lt;br/&gt;of analysis has been studied intensely and has led to&lt;br/&gt;a series of results on multilinear operators and maximal&lt;br/&gt;operators. 2) Arithmetic number theory, in particular&lt;br/&gt;the study of arithmetic progressions, sum - and difference sets&lt;br/&gt;etc. The link between arithmetic number theory and the&lt;br/&gt;type of analysis discussed above has recently be reinforced&lt;br/&gt;be several results on multilinear operators.  Arithmetic number&lt;br/&gt;theory is also related to other problems in harmonic analysis&lt;br/&gt;such as the famous Kakeya problem.&lt;br/&gt;3) Nonlinear Fourier analysis or scattering theory. Via&lt;br/&gt;multilinear expansions of nonlinear operators in scattering&lt;br/&gt;theory, the latter is linked to multilinear operators.&lt;br/&gt;While the algebraic aspects of scattering theory in one&lt;br/&gt;dimension have been widely studied over the past thirty years,&lt;br/&gt;a number of basic analytic questions remain open and will&lt;br/&gt;be studied in this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wave packet analysis is a discipline in mathematics&lt;br/&gt;that can readily be explained to anyone familiar with&lt;br/&gt;musical scores. A musical score is the decoding of a&lt;br/&gt;complicated musical composition into its most elementary&lt;br/&gt;parts, the notes, each described by duration, pitch, and volume.&lt;br/&gt;Wave packet analysis is the mathematical analogue of this,&lt;br/&gt;which can be used to decode a large variety of mathematical&lt;br/&gt;data into its elementary pieces, each described by the analogue of duration, pitch,&lt;br/&gt;and volume.  This type of analysis has had a tremendous impact&lt;br/&gt;on the way computers deal with large sets of data coming from&lt;br/&gt;acoustic signals, images, radar,  internet and other telecommunication,&lt;br/&gt;etc. This project studies basic mathematical questions associated to wave packet analysis, fundamental research that is likely to&lt;br/&gt;improve our understanding not only of the types of processes&lt;br/&gt;described above, but also of many different applications within&lt;br/&gt;Mathematics as well. This project will also help to maintain an&lt;br/&gt;active research group in harmonic analysis at UCLA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
