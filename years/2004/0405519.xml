    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0405519&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Igor Krichever&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main objective of the present project is further development&lt;br/&gt;of the algebro-geometric theory of soliton equations aimed at the&lt;br/&gt;integration of non-linear equations, models of solid state&lt;br/&gt;physics, and models of quantum field theories. The immediate goal&lt;br/&gt;is to develop a theory of zero-curvature and Lax equations on&lt;br/&gt;variable algebraic curves, which can be instrumental in&lt;br/&gt;construction of new integrable models and in the investigations&lt;br/&gt;of geometry of moduli spaces of holomorphic vector bundles.&lt;br/&gt;Particular attention will be paid to the Hamiltonian theory of&lt;br/&gt;the discrete isomonodromy equations and the B\"acklund&lt;br/&gt;transformations. Efforts will be devoted to functional equations&lt;br/&gt;for the Baker-Akhiezer functions and their application to the&lt;br/&gt;geometry of the Abelian varieties. Particular attention will be&lt;br/&gt;paid to the characterization problem of the Prim varieties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Classical algebraic geometry, inseparably connected with the&lt;br/&gt;names of Abel, Riemann, Weierstrass, Poincare, Clebsch, Jacobi&lt;br/&gt;and other outstanding mathematicians of the XIX-th century has&lt;br/&gt;been mainly an analytical theory. In the last century it was&lt;br/&gt;enriched by the methods and ideas of topology, commutative&lt;br/&gt;algebra and has the authority of one of the most fundamental&lt;br/&gt;mathematical disciplines. The traditional eclectism (in the best&lt;br/&gt;sense of the word) of algebraic geometry has always been a source&lt;br/&gt;of its numerous applications to other branches of&lt;br/&gt;mathematics. The role of algebraic geometry as ``an applied&lt;br/&gt;science" has grown immensely in the last 20-25 years, when its&lt;br/&gt;new applications to the problems of non-linear equations and&lt;br/&gt;quantum field theory were found. The discovery of solitons in the&lt;br/&gt;seventies of the previous century has changed once and forever&lt;br/&gt;the role which integrable systems play in the development of&lt;br/&gt;mathematics and physics. The soliton theory is applicable to&lt;br/&gt;equations which possess the property of remarkable&lt;br/&gt;universality. They arise in the description of the most diverse&lt;br/&gt;phenomena in plasma physics, the theory of elementary particles,&lt;br/&gt;the theory of superconductivity and in non-linear optics. This&lt;br/&gt;ubiquity of integrable systems together with the beautiful&lt;br/&gt;structures that underlie them has led to ever-growing interest in&lt;br/&gt;this area. Geometry and algebraic geometry, functional equations&lt;br/&gt;and special functions, Lie algebras and groups all come together&lt;br/&gt;in the modern theory of integrable systems. This unique&lt;br/&gt;combination of seemingly unrelated branches of mathematics and&lt;br/&gt;physics provides an opportunity to create new interdisciplinary&lt;br/&gt;education models.</AbstractNarration>
