<AbstractNarration>Bad weather can severely limit the usefulness of computer vision in&lt;br/&gt;the outdoors. The algorithms (segmentation, tracking, recognition,&lt;br/&gt;etc.) used in today's vision systems are not equipped to handle the&lt;br/&gt;adverse effects of weather. For outdoor vision systems to perform well&lt;br/&gt;in all conditions, they must explicitly account for the diverse&lt;br/&gt;effects of weather.  The visual effects produced by different weather&lt;br/&gt;conditions can be broadly classified into two categories: steady (fog,&lt;br/&gt;mist and haze) and dynamic (rain, hail and snow).  This research&lt;br/&gt;project is devoted to the modeling and analysis of dynamic weather&lt;br/&gt;effects.  The first stage of the study is to develop compact and yet&lt;br/&gt;descriptive photometric and geometric models of raindrops and&lt;br/&gt;snowflakes. These models will be used to develop advanced models for&lt;br/&gt;the dynamical and statistical properties of rain and snow.  Using&lt;br/&gt;these models, efficient and robust algorithms will be developed for&lt;br/&gt;detecting and removing rain and snow from videos.  The proposed models&lt;br/&gt;will also be used to develop algorithms for fast and realistic&lt;br/&gt;rendering of rain and snow. In addition, the developed models will be&lt;br/&gt;used to design and implement real-time rain and snow gauges based on&lt;br/&gt;video cameras. Such gauges will be very inexpensive compared to ones&lt;br/&gt;currently used in meteorological sciences, and yet will provide high&lt;br/&gt;accuracy in the estimation of weather parameters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of the proposed research are anticipated to have a broad&lt;br/&gt;and tangible impact on both research and education. From the&lt;br/&gt;perspective of research, the results are expected to impact the&lt;br/&gt;robustness of outdoor vision systems and the realism that computer&lt;br/&gt;graphics can achieve. The models, algorithms and databases developed&lt;br/&gt;during the project will be broadly disseminated in a timely&lt;br/&gt;fashion. With regards to education, the PI is currently developing a&lt;br/&gt;course titled ``Computer Vision through the Atmosphere,'' and the&lt;br/&gt;results of this investigation will contribute significantly to the&lt;br/&gt;content of the course.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
