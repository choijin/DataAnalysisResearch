<AbstractNarration>In its broader outlines, this research program aims at the development,&lt;br/&gt;analysis and computer implementation of numerical methods designed to&lt;br/&gt;approximate the solutions of some partial differential equations that have&lt;br/&gt;important applications in the fields of engineering and physics. Indeed,&lt;br/&gt;elliptic equations, the Navier-Stokes equations and nonlinear wave&lt;br/&gt;equations despite having been cultivated for decades, still offer fertile&lt;br/&gt;ground for further exploration, for there are still a plethora of&lt;br/&gt;unanswered questions and a pressing need for more efficient and faster&lt;br/&gt;algorithms. The discontinuous Galerkin method will constitute the core methodology of&lt;br/&gt;this effort. While going back to 1973, major interest did not focus on it&lt;br/&gt;until the nineties. Today it constitutes one of the most active areas&lt;br/&gt;within finite elements if not the whole range of methods for the numerical&lt;br/&gt;treatment of partial differential equations. It has not been as&lt;br/&gt;extensively explored as the standard Galerkin version, yet what is known&lt;br/&gt;so far offers a tantalizing glimpse of its potential. The project will&lt;br/&gt;involve various areas at the cutting edge of numerical analysis and&lt;br/&gt;scientific computing, in particular, the development of convergent and&lt;br/&gt;efficient adaptive methods designed to reduce the run time of the&lt;br/&gt;algorithms by finding optimal or quasi-optimal meshes. These adaptive&lt;br/&gt;methods will require continuing the work on the development of sharp&lt;br/&gt;a-posteriori error estimators designed to identify regions where the&lt;br/&gt;solution is varying rapidly. Major efforts will be directed towards&lt;br/&gt;pursuing a recently identified strategy for reducing the number of&lt;br/&gt;iterations that current adaptive algorithms require in achieving a&lt;br/&gt;prescribed level of accuracy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scientific computing is recognized as crucial to the advancement of&lt;br/&gt;science. As such, the development of state of the art algorithms and codes&lt;br/&gt;is important for the progress of technology. Specifically, improved&lt;br/&gt;adaptive codes resulting from this project will have impact on a wide&lt;br/&gt;range of problems and applications involving fluid flow phenomena, the&lt;br/&gt;elucidation of extremely fast chemical reactions by femtosecond lasers,&lt;br/&gt;and numerical simulations of supernova explosions. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
