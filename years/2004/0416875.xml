<AbstractNarration>Like animals, plants have stem cells that are critical for their growth and development. Plant stem cells are found at the growing shoot tips (called meristems) and in developing flowers, and they provide cells for the formation of new organs such as leaves and petals.  The main research objective is to understand the molecular mechanisms that control stem cell activity in shoots and flowers, and thus specify overall plant architecture.  This research project continues studies of two genes from the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana that help determine the number of stem cells that are made by shoots and flowers.  Genetic, molecular and biochemical techniques will be used to analyze the biological functions of these two ULTRAPETALA (ULT) genes.  The identity of other genes that are controlled by the ULT genes, information about factors that work together with the two genes, and a more thorough understanding of the roles played by the ULT genes in maintaining shoot and flower stem cell activity are the expected results of this research.  Another important component of this project is to integrate research and education in a laboratory environment.  Through this project postdoctoral scholars and UC Berkeley graduate students will receive training in modern scientific theory and practice.  Undergraduates and local high school students will obtain their first exposure to research by assisting with the project, and will be supervised by the postdoctoral scholars and graduate students to provide valuable training and mentoring experience.  These studies of plant stem cell activity are important to understand how plants are able to continuously grow for many years, and will provide a basis for optimizing plant architecture in economically important crop species.</AbstractNarration>
