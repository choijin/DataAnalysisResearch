<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project focuses on filling a gap in distance/distributed learning courseware: facilitating collaborative learning.  Web-based learning tools, in particular Learning Management Systems (LMS), have yet to effectively marshal the benefits of team collaboration, namely, deeper levels of knowledge creation.  While this finding is continually reinforced in research, new tools to develop these relationships have not been forthcoming.  A new type of tool is needed, and the Team Development Toolbox (TDT) will be this new type of resource.  Team Craft, Inc. is collaborating with The University of Texas to develop the TDT as a commercially viable suite of web-based software tools that are integrated into a LMS to support team formation and relationship building among students participating in asynchronous distance learning in science and similar courses in higher education.  The TDT will be accessible through a school's web-based learning platform using a standard web browser and Internet connection.  Among the deliverables in Phase I, the project will produce detailed product specifications, a rapid application prototype and related software evaluation model, and a white paper describing key factors contributing to successful distance learning and how the Team Development Toolbox will aim to promote this success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Effective teamwork is one of the most valuable resources for developing successful learners.  Teamwork is most effective when team members are aware of, have access to, and commit to using effective processes.  These processes promote good decisions and timely action.  Specifically, the Toolbox proffered will foster positive relationships to support effective team process.  Toolbox will contain a combination of new tools and extant tools, some having existed previously as a paper resource, others as isolated software.  These tools have not heretofore been integrated into one resource and promoted on major on-line learning platforms.  The Team Development Toolbox will enable students, otherwise isolated by distance, to initiate collaboration with supportive processes that instruct and draw-out best practices.  It will help thus make the advantages of team learning accessible to students who do not have an ability to meet in face-to face interactions, including students with disabilities.  The facilitation of learning experience that are truly shared among a community of learners will mean that learning from a distance can take its place as comparable in a positive way to many traditional classroom formats.  The development team will disseminate non-proprietary research resulting from this grant through the resources of the Learning Technology Center at the University of Texas at Austin. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
