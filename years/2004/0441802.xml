    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Conference on Ethics and Changing Energy Markets will assemble leading ethicists, economists, engineers and energy industry decision makers at the University of Notre Dame on October 28 and 29, 2004. The program will address the interplay of ethical, market and regulatory issues which arise in the shift from regulated to competitive markets in the electric and gas utility industries. Several crises in the industry which resulted at least in part from ethical lapses of market participants have demonstrated the need for public discussion of these issues, and improved education of members of the industry from engineers to CEOs. Panel discussions at the conference will focus on identification and resolution of ethical questions using specific case studies, and will draw on the expertise of both energy industry members and business and engineering ethicists. Participants will gain insight into the complexities and subtleties of ethically balancing shareholder profit with public good in the restructured market, and it is hoped they will share this enrichment in their workplaces and educational institutions. The conference will be widely advertised to the public, academic institutions and the industry, and proceedings will be published shortly after the meeting.&lt;br/&gt;This award has been funded by the Thermal Transport and Thermal Processing Program of the Chemical and Transport Systems Division and by the Office of the Assistant Director of Engineering.</AbstractNarration>
