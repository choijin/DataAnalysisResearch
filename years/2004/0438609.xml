<AbstractNarration>This award is to Clemson University to support the activity described below for 36 months.  The proposal was submitted in response to the Partnerships for Innovation Program Solicitation (NSF-04556).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Partners&lt;br/&gt;The partners include Clemson University (Lead Institution), Medical University of South Carolina, Medical College of Georgia, Benedict College, Tri-County Technical College, Greenville Technical College, South Carolina Governor's School for Science and Mathematics, Anderson School Diistrict, Department of Commerce, Food and Drug Administration, Cryovac/Sealed Air, Selee Corporation, Drake Dental Laboratory, Polymed, Greenville Chamber of Commerce, South Carolina Science Coalition, South Carolina Dental Association, Upstate Alliance, and Carolina Crescent Coalition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary objective is to create, nurture, and sustain a biomaterials cluster in the state of South Carolina, anchored by Clemson University. The partnership will include: 1) education institutions (public schools, 2-&lt;br/&gt;year technical colleges, 4-year degree colleges, and doctoral-degree-granting institutions); 2) governmental&lt;br/&gt;agencies (both at the state and federal level); 3) large, medium, and small industries of the state and the&lt;br/&gt;region; and 4) non-profit organizations (including business-related coalitions and local chapters of national&lt;br/&gt;professional societies). The activities include: 1) catalyze innovation; 2) build human capital; 3) synergize innovation and capitalization of opportunities of intrinsic merit. At the core of this proposal are state-of-the-art scientific and technological innovations. To capitalize on these innovations, two pilot projects with high commercial value will be run in conjunction with industrial partners and a federal regulating agency. The idea is to leverage the strength of each constituent member and bring about intellectual and project development. One of the projects will be to utilize Surface Modificationla technology to coat artificial materials to make them bio-compatible. The second project will use microwaves processing of metals and ceramics for dental applications. This project will attempt to minimize the processing time for prosthodontic devices so that visits to dental offices are minimized.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Potential Economic Impact&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The activity will catalyze entrepreneurial development, with local non-profit business coalitions. They will conduct workshop and networking events to foster the growth of small businesses, which are the fastest-growing segment of the economy and work with the Greenville Chamber of Commerce and the State Department of Commerce to woo larger industries to South Carolina. According to the U.S. Census Bureau projections, the population of the 55- to 75-year-olds in this country is expected to grow by 75% to 74.6 million people within the next 20 years. This population will use some kind of implant in hips, knees, teeth, maxillofacial reconstruction, and other applications. These implants require substantial uses of biomaterials. Industries involving biomaterials and related devices are growing in the region and only continued innovation can sustain growth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the project lies in the development of a biotech economic cluster based on university research and partnerships with industry and government. The effort will include forming and fostering small businesses to commercialize the innovations, attracting large business to the region, and educating/training workers for the new biotech/biomedical companies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the activity concentrate providing biomedical materials for the growing need for prosthetic implants for the aging population in the US. In addition a diverse workforce will be educated and trained for this growing industry.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
