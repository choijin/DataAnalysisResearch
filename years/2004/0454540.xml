<AbstractNarration>***NON-TECHNICAL***&lt;br/&gt;In the vast majority of metals and semiconductors, such as copper and silicon, the behavior of electrons is well understood and is described by theories developed decades ago. The same is true for electronic devices, such as the transistor, built using such materials. The focus of this individual investigator research will be on materials where a change of composition or magnetic field leads to so-called "quantum phase transitions" between metallic, semiconducting and superconducting behavior. In the vicinity of such transitions, and also in molecular wires where the current flows in one dimension, new electron states arise. In order to gain insight into these new electron states the frequency dependent electrical conductivity will be measured in the microwave and millimeter wave range of the optical spectrum. Electronic devices having potentially new principles of operation and characteristics will also be fabricated using the same materials. The research will involve graduate and undergraduate students, who will be trained in both electronics and optics techniques.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;***TECHNICAL***&lt;br/&gt;This individual investigator research will focus on the behavior of electrons under circumstances where the change of composition or magnetic field leads to a quantum phase transition. The low energy electrodynamics of the disorder driven metal-insulator transition and the magnetic field driven superconductor-insulator transition will be investigated through the measurement of the low energy optical response in the dc to the millimeter wave spectral range. The frequency dependent optical conductivity will be evaluated and analyzed in terms of scaling relations. The unusual metallic state in molecular nanowires will be also investigated using the same experimental tools. Electronic devices will be fabricated using the same materials. A search for evidence of novel collective electron states will be undertaken through the examination of the device characteristics. Both graduate and undergraduate students will be involved in research and technique development in the spectral range of electromagnetic spectrum that has significant application potential.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
