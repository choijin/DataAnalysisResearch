<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;Title: Nonlinear Diffusion Equations and Free boundary problems&lt;br/&gt;PI: Panagiota Daskalopoulos, Columbia University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project   concerns  with the  study of nonlinear elliptic and  parabolic &lt;br/&gt;equations  and free-boundary problems, in connection with  more complex  problems of &lt;br/&gt;differential geometry,includingthe Gauss curvature flow, the Ricci flow and the Weyl&lt;br/&gt;Problem withnonnegative Gaussian curvature and with physical applications such as &lt;br/&gt;thin liquidfilm dynamics and flame propagation.The first part of the project  will &lt;br/&gt;study  thegeometry and regularity of  free-boundary problems arising from the degeneracy of&lt;br/&gt;quasilinear and fully-nonlinear geometric  flows,such as the  Gauss curvature  flow  with&lt;br/&gt;flat sides or more general curvature flows including  the Harmonic flow.&lt;br/&gt;The understanding of such models of  equations  and free-boundary problems&lt;br/&gt;may have significant geometric and even topological applications.&lt;br/&gt;A different  new  line of research will study the regularity of solutions&lt;br/&gt;ofdegenerate  Monge-Ampere equations  and related elliptic&lt;br/&gt;free-boundary problems. Its main goal is to develop new techniques to&lt;br/&gt;establish the optimal regularity  in fully-nonlinear&lt;br/&gt;degenerate elliptic equations.  The proposed work  is also  motivated by&lt;br/&gt;the well known  Weyl problem with nonnegative Gaussian curvature.&lt;br/&gt;The aim of  the third part of the  project  is to study the connection&lt;br/&gt;between the geometry and  the  regularity  as well as  the  formation of&lt;br/&gt;singularities  in  Stefan type free-boundary problems including also  the&lt;br/&gt;Hele-Shaw flow  and free-boundary problem in  flame propagation. The use&lt;br/&gt;of  the geometric aspects of the problems is crucial in the proposed&lt;br/&gt;approach. The last part of the proposed activity   will study  the asymptotic&lt;br/&gt;behavior of solutions  of variousmodels of  singular diffusion.  In particular, &lt;br/&gt;it  will deal  with the type II blow up behavior of   maximal solutions of the two &lt;br/&gt;dimensionalRicci Flow. These solutions  correspond  to complete Riemannian conformal&lt;br/&gt;metrics  on a non-compact surface.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This  project links  a wide range of active fields of mathematics,  in&lt;br/&gt;particular  nonlinear partial differential equations, geometry and&lt;br/&gt;classical analysis.The proposed research activity  on the geometry and regularity of&lt;br/&gt;degenerate nonlinear parabolic equations and free-boundary problems may&lt;br/&gt;result to  significant geometric and even topological applications. The&lt;br/&gt;proposed research activity  on Stefan type free-boundary problems is&lt;br/&gt;closely relatedto various important physical models,  including  the propagation of the&lt;br/&gt;premixed equi-diffusional flames in the limit of high activation energy.&lt;br/&gt;The models of singular diffusion which will be studied&lt;br/&gt;in this project   arise  in various&lt;br/&gt;physical  applications such as  population dynamics, the kinetic theory of&lt;br/&gt;gases and thin liquid film dynamics.&lt;br/&gt;Students and postdocs will be trained as part of this project. &lt;br/&gt; Special emphasis will be given to the&lt;br/&gt;encouragement of talented femaleundergraduate students, graduate students and postdocs&lt;br/&gt;to pursue a successfulcareer in mathematics or related sciences.   New courses linking  &lt;br/&gt;PartialDifferential Equations and Geometric Analysis  for graduate students will be designed&lt;br/&gt;and implemented.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
