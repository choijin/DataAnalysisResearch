<AbstractNarration>Project Abstract&lt;br/&gt;proposal: 0406430&lt;br/&gt;PI: Jane-Ling Wang&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;   Functional Regression Analysis of Sparse Longitudinal Data&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent advances in modern technology have facilitated the collection of&lt;br/&gt;repeated measurements over a period of time on the same subject. Such data&lt;br/&gt;are common in nearly all fields including the biological, medical, neural,&lt;br/&gt;physical and social sciences, but are termed differently, with&lt;br/&gt;"longitudinal data" being the preferred term in health and social sciences&lt;br/&gt;and "functional data" being the preferred term in engineering and physical&lt;br/&gt;sciences. Statistical approaches to analyze such data are also&lt;br/&gt;intrinsically different in the longitudinal and functional data research&lt;br/&gt;communities. Parametric approaches such as GEE and GLMM are&lt;br/&gt;predominantly used methods to analyze longitudinal data, while&lt;br/&gt;nonparametric approaches play the analogous role for functional&lt;br/&gt;data.  Due to the limitations of each approach, semiparametric models&lt;br/&gt;combining longitudinal and functional data analysis methods emerge as a&lt;br/&gt;promising alternative, which can bring out and combine the best aspects of&lt;br/&gt;the two approaches. Longitudinal or functional data are intrinsically&lt;br/&gt;complex owing to irregularity of observational times, dependence of&lt;br/&gt;observations within subjects, sparsity and size of the data.  They pose&lt;br/&gt;challenges both on the computational and theoretical fronts.  This&lt;br/&gt;proposal aims at bringing together methodology from various areas in&lt;br/&gt;statistics, including nonparametric smoothing, multivariate statistics,&lt;br/&gt;random and mixed effects models, dimension reduction and robustness, to&lt;br/&gt;address several challenging issues and to provide flexible modeling and&lt;br/&gt;efficient implementation for longitudinal/functional data.  The proposed&lt;br/&gt;methods range from extension of traditional linear models to new&lt;br/&gt;semiparametric and nonparametric models, and focus particularly on&lt;br/&gt;handling sparse longitudinal data with or without measurement error.  A&lt;br/&gt;new version of functional principal components (PCA) analysis was&lt;br/&gt;developed recently by the PI and collaborators, where the functional&lt;br/&gt;principal component scores are framed as conditional expectations. This&lt;br/&gt;extends the applicability of functional PCA to typical situations in&lt;br/&gt;longitudinal data analysis, where only few repeated measurements are&lt;br/&gt;available per subject. This approach is known as Principal Components&lt;br/&gt;Analysis through Conditional Expectation (PACE) for longitudinal data.&lt;br/&gt;With PACE serving as the backbone, the proposal includes three projects:&lt;br/&gt;(1) Modeling covariate effects, (2) Semi-parametric dimension reduction&lt;br/&gt;approaches, and (3) Robust covariance estimation and functional PCA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to new methodology, statistical theory will be a major focus&lt;br/&gt;to establish formal inference procedures. So far, theoretical results&lt;br/&gt;for functional data are scattered and this proposal aims to fill the gaps.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research is motivated by ongoing interdisciplinary research&lt;br/&gt;collaborations of the PI with biologists and physicians.  The new&lt;br/&gt;approaches are applied to data generated from these ongoing and future&lt;br/&gt;collaborations.  The proposed research helps to better understand the&lt;br/&gt;relationship between reproductive activity and longevity and will&lt;br/&gt;contribute to the growing fields of aging research and biodemography. As&lt;br/&gt;the procedures developed will be applicable to general longitudinal or&lt;br/&gt;functional data from other disciplines, they will provide much needed&lt;br/&gt;modern statistical tools to analyze such data, which in turn will&lt;br/&gt;facilitate the advancement of many scientific fields.  Moreover, with the&lt;br/&gt;fast rising trend towards the collection of such large and complex data&lt;br/&gt;sets, there is a shortage of Ph.D. statisticians trained to handle such&lt;br/&gt;data. The research assistantship provides a training&lt;br/&gt;opportunity to address this need. The PI is engaged in&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate research training, and continues this activity in&lt;br/&gt;addition to the dissemination of the new research findings through&lt;br/&gt;teaching, training, and the web.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
