<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0405578&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Christopher Bishop&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI, Christopher Bishop, will study the geometric properties&lt;br/&gt;of conformal and quasiconformal mappings, focusing on the&lt;br/&gt;interactions between conformal structures, hyperbolic geometry,&lt;br/&gt;low dimensional topology and numerical analysis.  For example,&lt;br/&gt;Moore's theorem states that if we take a certain collection of&lt;br/&gt;sets on the 2-sphere and topologically collapse them to points&lt;br/&gt;then we obtain a new topological sphere.  The PI will investigate&lt;br/&gt;when the quotient map can be conformal and will consider a number&lt;br/&gt;of concrete problems from this general perspective, including&lt;br/&gt;conformal welding, characterizations of John domains, Koebe's&lt;br/&gt;conjecture, construction of Kleinian groups and other dynamical&lt;br/&gt;objects.  The PI will continue his earlier work on the geometry&lt;br/&gt;of Kleinian limit sets and the behavior of the dimension as we&lt;br/&gt;deform the limit set.  The PI will also continue his work on the&lt;br/&gt;connections between computational geometry, hyperbolic geometry&lt;br/&gt;and conformal mappings, and seek new algorithms which compute the&lt;br/&gt;Riemann mapping quickly and with rigorous error estimates.  In&lt;br/&gt;particular he will investigate computing conformal maps using the&lt;br/&gt;medial axis (an object from computational geometry) which is&lt;br/&gt;closely linked to 3-dimensional hyperbolic geometry via convex&lt;br/&gt;hulls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conformal mappings are important both for their central role in&lt;br/&gt;numerous mathematical problems (complex analysis, dynamical&lt;br/&gt;systems,...) and in various applications (fluid flow, brain&lt;br/&gt;mapping, statistical physics, numerical analysis of differential&lt;br/&gt;equations,...), so we must have a good theoretical understanding&lt;br/&gt;of these maps and good methods for computing them in&lt;br/&gt;practice. The proposal deepens our theoretical understanding of&lt;br/&gt;conformal maps by investigating new connections with other parts&lt;br/&gt;of mathematics and computer science (point set topology,&lt;br/&gt;3-dimensional hyperbolic geometry, Voronoi diagrams) and seeks to&lt;br/&gt;use these connections to invent new algorithms for computing&lt;br/&gt;conformal maps.  For example, the medial axis is a widely studied&lt;br/&gt;object in computer science (it is a description of the shape on&lt;br/&gt;an object which has numerous applications in pattern recognition,&lt;br/&gt;robotic motion, biology,...). The PI discovered it can also be&lt;br/&gt;used to give a rough but fast approximation to conformal maps.&lt;br/&gt;The PI will seek to improve this method, giving better algorithms&lt;br/&gt;for conformal maps and also developing a better understanding of&lt;br/&gt;the medial axis which will impact its other applications (for&lt;br/&gt;example, the medial axis can change drastically when the object&lt;br/&gt;being described changes only a little; this is a serious&lt;br/&gt;computational problem which can be addressed by thinking of the&lt;br/&gt;medial axis as an object in hyperbolic geometry instead of the&lt;br/&gt;usual Euclidean geometry). The connection between the medial axis&lt;br/&gt;and conformal maps may also lead to new ideas for studying&lt;br/&gt;applications in three dimensions (where conformal mappings do not&lt;br/&gt;exist, but maps based on the medial axis still do). Three&lt;br/&gt;dimensional problems are the most important for applications, but&lt;br/&gt;our understanding lags far behind the two dimensional case, so&lt;br/&gt;new two dimensional ideas which generalize to higher dimensions&lt;br/&gt;are important.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
