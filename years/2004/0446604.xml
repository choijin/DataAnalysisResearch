<AbstractNarration>Preconditioners comprise a range of techniques for transforming a system of&lt;br/&gt;linear equations Ax=b into a related system that is somehow ``better''.  For&lt;br/&gt;example, a solver may take less time to compute the solution to the new system,&lt;br/&gt;it may compute a more accurate solution, or it may do both.  Although a good&lt;br/&gt;preconditioner can be critical to computing an accurate solution efficiently,&lt;br/&gt;choosing a good preconditioner from the many that are available can be&lt;br/&gt;difficult.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is the development of tools to help users choose from&lt;br/&gt;large families of preconditioners one that is likely to be well-suited to their&lt;br/&gt;particular application; the initial focus will be on preconditioners that are&lt;br/&gt;based on reordering the rows and/or columns of a matrix, and those that compute&lt;br/&gt;an incomplete factorization of the matrix.  In the process of developing these&lt;br/&gt;tools, the PI, undergraduate researchers, and other collaborators will work on&lt;br/&gt;developing better heuristics, improving theoretical knowledge about specific&lt;br/&gt;preconditioners, creating an extensible framework for evaluating different&lt;br/&gt;preconditioners, and making the results of extensive experimentation available&lt;br/&gt;in a user-friendly form.  All work will help lead to a better understanding of&lt;br/&gt;the performance of specific preconditioners on sparse systems from specific&lt;br/&gt;applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a professor at a liberal arts college, the PI's primary plans for broader&lt;br/&gt;impact include: supervising undergraduate and postbaccalaureate research,&lt;br/&gt;seeking opportunities for students to present their work outside of the local&lt;br/&gt;community and more generally preparing them for graduate work; outreach to&lt;br/&gt;groups traditionally underrepresented in computer science through mentoring and&lt;br/&gt;the formation of support networks; and the development, refinement, and&lt;br/&gt;dissemination of courses that emphasize the role of mathematics in computer&lt;br/&gt;science, as well as of courses that give a basic understanding of computing to&lt;br/&gt;students who are not computer science majors but whose education will&lt;br/&gt;nevertheless be enhanced by such knowledge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
