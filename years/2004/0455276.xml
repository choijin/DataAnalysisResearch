<AbstractNarration>In a previous NSF project (OCE 0084265) the investigators discovered a distinct (d) halophilic (H) Bdellovibrionaceae (Bd) genotype that appears to be exclusive to the Chesapeake Bay estuary. This is the first time a distinct population of Bd that appears to be restricted to a particular ecosystem has been reported. Although some ocean isolates were found in the Bay, it appears that the unique Bay genotype is a distinct strain that has adapted to the estuarine environment.  The current project will follow-up on this finding by addressing the following questions:  1) are the unique genotypes recovered from the Chesapeake Bay exclusive to that body or are they common to other estuaries along the Atlantic coast; 2) do Bay genotypes occur primarily in the Bay proper or in the smaller more protected sub estuaries of the Bay; 3) do the bacteria in the Chesapeake Bay and its sub estuaries and other estuaries select for the unique Bd genotypes; 4) can other distinct genotypes of Bd be detected in the Bay using non-culture methods?  The investigators will address these questions by conducting a spatial and temporal sampling program, examining predation patterns by Bd on bacteria, and using molecular methods to examine genotypes of Bd forms.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this activity are that it will integrate the research into education and, in particular, will seek to broaden the participation of underrepresented groups. During the three years of the project the investigators expect to train no less than 15 students and teachers. Based on previous experience more than half will be members of underrepresented groups. The research project will involve the use of basic microbiology and state of the art molecular techniques sequencing, cloning, amplification using PCR and quantification using real time PCR and will provide valuable training in modern microbial techniques to participating students and teachers.  These activities will expose and encourage more individuals to pursue careers in sciences and thereby contribute to meeting the nations need for a highly trained technical workforce.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
