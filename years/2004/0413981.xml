    <AbstractNarration>A central goal of population biology is to understand how variation within populations originates and is maintained. This project will test the hypothesis that susceptibility to fungal infections varies among individual amphibians and their eggs. Dr. Reid Harris will investigate the role of beneficial bacteria on the skin in protecting individuals and their egg masses from fungal disease. Many species of bacteria produce antifungal compounds, as do at least three species of bacteria that live on the skin of salamanders. One goal of the research is to determine whether individuals with the beneficial bacteria transmit the antifungal compounds to their eggs and therefore have higher nesting success. Methods will include field sampling, experiments in large indoor amphibian habitats, culturing of bacteria and fungi, and identification of microorganisms with DNA sequencing techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Amphibians are an important part of many ecosystems, yet many amphibian populations have declined or gone extinct and others are at risk. This project will provide information that will help in ongoing conservation efforts of frog and salamander populations. For example, one recommendation may be to inoculate populations at risk from pathogenic fungi with beneficial antifungal bacteria. The research will also teach undergraduates how to conduct scientific projects, thus preparing them for graduate and professional schools. Underrepresented groups in science will be encouraged to participate.</AbstractNarration>
