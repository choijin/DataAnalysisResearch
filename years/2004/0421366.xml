<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;In this Major Research Instrumentation Program (MRI) proposal, the University of Texas-Pan American (UTPA) is requesting funding to acquire a high field magnet system. Acquisition of this system will advance the understanding of novel molecular materials and improve educational opportunities for Hispanic students at UTPA. Molecular materials are of intense worldwide interest, initiating a renaissance in the field of magnetism and transport studies. These systems have been considered by many to be the materials of the future due to their wide range of properties and the relative ease to tailor those abilities. The intellectual merit of this work includes understanding the underlying crystal structural relationship to observed electronic and magnetic properties in three classes of molecular conductors with potential for device construction and development of basic science. This work will collectively merge aspects of material science at UTPA while integrating and training students.  The broader impact of this project includes: 1.) enhanced cooperation between scientists and engineers at UTPA and other institutions without such capabilities 2.) promotion of graduate and undergraduate education of Hispanic students interested in material science, and 3.) the development of instructional strategies for scientists and engineers teaching in a predominantly Hispanic institution. The high magnetic field system will allow for long-term usage beyond the lifetime of the grant and its automated software allows for relative ease of student integration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this Major Research Instrumentation Program (MRI) proposal, the University of Texas-Pan American (UTPA) is requesting funding to acquire a 17 Tesla superconducting magnet system with vapor helium recovery capabilities and a SQUID insert. A number of high field techniques, including torque and SQUID magnetometry, AMRO, quantum oscillatory phenomena such as De Haas-van Alphen and Shubnikov-de Haas effects, will be employed using the requested magnet system to systematically probe the electrical transport and magnetic properties (including pressure and temperature dependence). Three classes of molecular systems will be investigated; this includes organic charge transfer salts (CTS), low dimensional molecular magnets (MM), and nanoporous metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). Two systems, CTS and MOFs are currently being produced at UTPA, whereas the MM systems are being synthesized at Eastern Washington University. This proposal provides the infrastructure necessary to investigate the underlying crystal structural relationship to observed electronic and magnetic properties in molecular systems. Acquisition of this system will allow for the advancement of the understanding of magnetic and transport behavior in novel molecular materials and significant improves the educational and training opportunities for Hispanic students at UTPA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
