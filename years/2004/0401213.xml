<AbstractNarration>Analysis and Modeling of Diffuse Ultrasonic Signals&lt;br/&gt;for Structural Health Monitoring&lt;br/&gt;The use of permanently mounted sensors to monitor the health of critical structures such as airplanes,&lt;br/&gt;bridges and buildings is quickly becoming a reality as sensors for measuring such physical quantities as&lt;br/&gt;temperature, moisture and strain become smaller and more robust. However, these devices are limited&lt;br/&gt;to point, or local, measurements and thus do not truly interrogate the volumetric state of the structure.&lt;br/&gt;Sparse arrays of permanently mounted ultrasonic sensors, acting as both sources and receivers, can send&lt;br/&gt;ultrasonic energy throughout the entire structural volume and thus have the potential to detect critical&lt;br/&gt;changes. Before this goal can become a reality, revolutionary advances must be made in the analysis&lt;br/&gt;and processing of the received ultrasonic signals so that structural changes that may lead to catastrophic&lt;br/&gt;failure can be reliably detected with an acceptably low false alarm rate. A significant complication is&lt;br/&gt;that benign environmental effects such as changes in temperature and surface conditions can cause&lt;br/&gt;larger changes in the ultrasonic signals than actual flaws.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The research proposed here is a combination of experiments and waveform&lt;br/&gt;modeling, and considers the development and verification of signal processing, classification and data&lt;br/&gt;fusion methods based upon quantitative changes in the ultrasonic signals. The testing mode considered&lt;br/&gt;is that of diffuse ultrasonic waves whereby a point-like impulsive excitation is used to generate multi-modal&lt;br/&gt;elastic waves that fill the structure with sound. Ultrasonic diffuse wave theory models the rate&lt;br/&gt;of energy decay but does not predict the details of the complex time domain signals. The proposed&lt;br/&gt;research will combine time-dependent analysis of coherence with feature extraction, classification&lt;br/&gt;methods, signal modeling and simulation, and data fusion to tackle the challenging problem of detecting&lt;br/&gt;and characterizing damage. One inherent problem in using classification methods such as neural&lt;br/&gt;networks for this application is the need to have a large set of signals from a wide variety of flaws; this&lt;br/&gt;is not practical for structures outside the laboratory. A key aspect of the proposed research is to&lt;br/&gt;develop methods for perturbing the baseline signal from the undamaged structure in order to emulate a&lt;br/&gt;wide variety of structural and environmental changes.&lt;br/&gt;Four tasks are defined as follows:&lt;br/&gt;1. Signal Processing and Classification Methods. Development of quantitative differential methods to&lt;br/&gt;determine if signal changes are due to structural or environmental effects, and to characterize&lt;br/&gt;structural changes as to location, severity, type, etc.&lt;br/&gt;2. Modeling and Simulation of Diffuse Ultrasonic Signals. Modeling of diffuse ultrasonic signals, and&lt;br/&gt;simulation of environmental and structural changes.&lt;br/&gt;3. Transducer Placement and Data Fusion. Analysis of optimum transducer organization and&lt;br/&gt;placement, and fusing of data from multiple transducers.&lt;br/&gt;4. Design and Implementation of Experimental Measurements. Ultrasonic diffuse wave&lt;br/&gt;measurements using metallic, composite and cement-based structures.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: This multidisciplinary research program will lead to effective use of ultrasonic&lt;br/&gt;sensors for continuously monitoring the health of critical structures, which will enable appropriate&lt;br/&gt;action to take place prior to catastrophic failure. Furthermore, the methodologies developed will have&lt;br/&gt;broad application to other disciplines such as sonar, radar and biomedical signal processing. A key part&lt;br/&gt;of the educational impact is the participation of undergraduates as well as graduate students, and a&lt;br/&gt;concerted effort will be made to recruit women and underrepresented minorities. Also proposed is the&lt;br/&gt;development of a graduate course in ultrasonic wave propagation and signal processing that will&lt;br/&gt;combine the fundamentals of acoustic and elastic wave propagation with signal processing methods as&lt;br/&gt;applied to ultrasonics. This research program will also complement other efforts at Georgia Tech,&lt;br/&gt;effectively creating a critical mass of research in ultrasonics for structural health monitoring.</AbstractNarration>
