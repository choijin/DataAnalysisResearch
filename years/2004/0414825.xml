    <AbstractNarration>18th Annual Workshop on Automorphic Forms and Related Topics&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant will support the "18th Annual Workshop on Automorphic&lt;br/&gt;Forms and Related Topics." The workshop has become internationally&lt;br/&gt;recognized, for both the high quality of its research talks and&lt;br/&gt;the supportive environment it provides for junior researchers.&lt;br/&gt;Participants will give presentations covering all areas related to&lt;br/&gt;automorphic forms, including Maass wave forms, elliptic curves, Siegel&lt;br/&gt;and Jacobi modular forms, special values of L-functions, random&lt;br/&gt;matrices, quadratic forms, computation and applications of modular&lt;br/&gt;forms, etc. As in the past, this sharing of knowledge will be of&lt;br/&gt;significant benefit to the participants, as well as to the wider&lt;br/&gt;mathematical community. It will also provide participants with the&lt;br/&gt;opportunity to establish new collaborations and strengthen their&lt;br/&gt;existing collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to cutting-edge research presentations, this workshop will&lt;br/&gt;feature discussion sessions, facilitated by experts, on the following&lt;br/&gt;topics: Encouraging and retaining women and other underrepresented&lt;br/&gt;groups in the number theory community; Applying for grants and funding&lt;br/&gt;opportunities. Experts will contribute their own successful&lt;br/&gt;experiences, aimed at engaging the participants in each of these&lt;br/&gt;important topics. These discussion sessions will result in a written&lt;br/&gt;report, to be posted on the American Institute for Mathematics (AIM)&lt;br/&gt;website as a living document. This will provide a lasting benefit to&lt;br/&gt;participants, as well as to their future students and colleagues.</AbstractNarration>
