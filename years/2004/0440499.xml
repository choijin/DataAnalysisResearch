<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merits: The Ohio State University (OSU) GK-12 projects builds on a Track 1 project which successfully paired science fellows with elementary school teachers to improve science education since 1999. Academically talented graduate students in the sciences collaborate with 3rd through 5th grade teachers at Columbus Public Schools to develop hands-on, inquiry based science lessons to cover all areas of the elementary science curriculum. Reported Ohio Proficiency Test scores show dramatic improvements in the passing rates in science among the elementary school children involved and teachers participating in the program are showing great progress in their science content knowledge and their ability to teach inquiry-based science lessons.&lt;br/&gt;With strong support from the University and Columbus Public Schools (CPS), this proposal outlines the plans for continuation of the project, cooperation with the successfully operating Wonders of Our World, W.O.W. science outreach program, and institutionalization of these efforts at OSU. New fellows and teachers are chosen through competitive application processes to ensure that the best graduate students are paired with teachers who are committed to improving their ability to teach science. The fellow- teacher teams are paired based on optimal match between the fellow's available time and the teacher's time frame allocated for science.  OSU GK-12 efforts are interwoven with the CPS Urban Systemic Program, while, trained USP science specialists (4th grade teachers) help to coordinate the GK-12 efforts and share professional development workshop efforts. Fellows continue to collaborate with elementary school teachers and the PI and Co-PIs begin to develop plans for a graduate level course that will be a part of the OSU curriculum starting the sixth year (one year after NSF support). A GK-12 class will be developed that will contain the optimized structure of the fellow-teacher teams working in the classrooms with professional development workshops for the teacher interwoven in the program throughout the year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of the Project: This OSU program is substantially enhancing the graduate education at OSU, having a large impact on elementary school teachers in inner-city schools and advancing science skills of the elementary school children. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is receiving partial support from the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
