<AbstractNarration>This project strengthens connections among science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines in order to create a more productive environment for STEM students and faculty. Interdisciplinary Lively Application Projects (ILAPs) are used to assist STEM undergraduates in benefiting from these connections. The concept of ILAPs was developed by a consortium of 12 colleges and universities led by the United States Military Academy through a National Sciences Foundation funded project, Project INTERMATH.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has three primary goals. The first goal develops and implements ILAPs for use in both the mathematics courses and the science/engineering courses. The second goal fosters interaction among STEM faculty, in part, by direct participation in ILAPs formation and use. The third goal coordinates curricula across the STEM disciplines, primarily with the development of web-based, portable Mathematics Modules. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merits of the project are as follows: (i) Students take a degree of ownership in their curriculum by publishing select group ILAP results at the project web site. (ii) The mathematical core programs for the ILAPs are available at the project web site as independent Mathematics Modules, thereby increasing their versatility. Each ILAP has web links to these course-independent extractable Mathematics Modules. (iii) STEM curricula and use of technology/computer software is coordinated. (iv) Team-teaching and student-centered learning in computer classrooms, science/engineering laboratories, and standard classrooms emphasize the interdependence of the disciplines and foster faculty interactions. (v) A mathematics faculty member sits in science and engineering courses, reporting to the mathematics faculty their observations with respect to what mathematics STEM students need in order to ensure success in science and engineering. (vi) Faculty colloquia providing ILAP and educational feedback and an interdisciplinary partnership of STEM faculty members are developed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The contributing engineering and natural science departments from The University of Tulsa include the Departments of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Electrical Engineering, Geosciences, Mathematical and Computer Sciences, Mechanical Engineering, and Physics and Engineering Physics. The project duration is three years, during which information is disseminated in international publications, at national STEM association meetings and at two regional STEM society workshops&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the project: (i) Provide a formal assessment of the effectiveness of ILAPs in learning; (ii) Promote the use of ILAPs among similar institutions; and (iii) Encourage the coordination of STEM curricula. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
