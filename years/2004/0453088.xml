<AbstractNarration>From early childhood throughout early adulthood, individuals are under &lt;br/&gt;the supervision of parents, caregivers, teachers, advisors, and other &lt;br/&gt;experts. Typically, supervisors can influence, at least to some extent, &lt;br/&gt;the learning activities of young people. A basic trade-off emerges in &lt;br/&gt;the learning environments, such that a supervisor may wish to prevent &lt;br/&gt;the learner from making costly mistakes, but in doing so hinder the &lt;br/&gt;learning process. This research project develops a family of formal &lt;br/&gt;theoretical models of supervised learning, and analyzes their &lt;br/&gt;predictions. Within these models, key features of successful adult &lt;br/&gt;supervision identified in the child development literature may be &lt;br/&gt;understood as the result of the parent's optimizing behavior. Similarly, &lt;br/&gt;the analysis can shed light on the widely documented variability in &lt;br/&gt;parenting practices across different human societies, as well as across &lt;br/&gt;animal species. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding the role of adults as experts supporting children's &lt;br/&gt;learning activities is a long-standing objective in developmental &lt;br/&gt;psychology, and the focus of a sizable experimental and empirical &lt;br/&gt;literature. The theoretical approach pursued in this project complements &lt;br/&gt;the mainly experimental and empirical approaches adopted in the child &lt;br/&gt;development literature. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
