<AbstractNarration>Simulation from complex systems, such as proteins, neural networks, and&lt;br/&gt;spin-glasses, is one of the most challenging problems in scientific&lt;br/&gt;computation. The energy landscape of these systems can be characterized&lt;br/&gt;by a multitude of local energy minima separated by high energy &lt;br/&gt;barriers. In simulation from these systems, the conventional Markov&lt;br/&gt;chain Monte Carlo algorithms, such as the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm&lt;br/&gt;and the Gibbs sampler, tend to get trapped in one of local energy&lt;br/&gt;minima indefinitely, rendering the simulation ineffective.&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this research is to develop an effective Monte Carlo&lt;br/&gt;algorithm for simulation from complex systems, and to apply the new&lt;br/&gt;algorithm to some computational problems in statistics and&lt;br/&gt;bioinformatics, including molecular structure prediction, phylogeny&lt;br/&gt;estimation, neural network training, combinatorial optimization,&lt;br/&gt;optimal design,  highest posterior density (HPD) interval construction,&lt;br/&gt;model selection, and others. The preliminary results show that the&lt;br/&gt;contour Monte Carlo algorithm, which is proposed in this research,&lt;br/&gt;will potentially  play a leading role in stochastic optimization in&lt;br/&gt;place of other algorithms, such as simulated annealing and genetic&lt;br/&gt;algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this research algorithms are developed that are potentially useful &lt;br/&gt;in many fields such as biology, engineering, and the social sciences. &lt;br/&gt;These algorithms are powerful in identifying best solutions to &lt;br/&gt;optimization problems in applied sciences. Students, researchers, and &lt;br/&gt;users of statistics, such as computational biologists and computer &lt;br/&gt;scientists, will benefit from this research. &lt;br/&gt;   &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
