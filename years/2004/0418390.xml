<AbstractNarration>Information theory is the science of quantifying, encoding, and&lt;br/&gt;extracting information.  The research proposed in this career&lt;br/&gt;development plan consists of work designed to strengthen the&lt;br/&gt;theoretical foundations and empirical applicability of computational&lt;br/&gt;learning through the development of a rigorous, information-theoretic&lt;br/&gt;framework for investigating this discipline.  Specifically, an&lt;br/&gt;information-theoretic framework, based on communication theory, is&lt;br/&gt;proposed for investigating the probably approximately correct (PAC)&lt;br/&gt;model of machine learning.  This framework is shown to be robust and&lt;br/&gt;extensible; new learning algorithms, general measures of performance,&lt;br/&gt;and analysis techniques are all proposed and demonstrated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to providing a means for strengthening the theoretical&lt;br/&gt;foundations of computational learning, this framework also provides a&lt;br/&gt;mechanism for developing and rigorously analyzing new learning&lt;br/&gt;algorithms.  New algorithms for hypothesis boosting, document&lt;br/&gt;classification, document filtering, and meta-search are all proposed.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed applications work has both theoretical and experimental&lt;br/&gt;components: all new algorithms are to be analyzed, implemented and&lt;br/&gt;tested using benchmark data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Teaching and education are an integral part of this career development&lt;br/&gt;plan.  Both graduate and undergraduate students are introduced to&lt;br/&gt;topical research, both theoretical and applied, through the projects&lt;br/&gt;proposed. New courses on learning and information retrieval,&lt;br/&gt;accessible to both graduate and undergraduate students, are also&lt;br/&gt;proposed.</AbstractNarration>
