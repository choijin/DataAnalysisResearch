    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a new class of in-fiber chiral polarizers based upon chiral fiber gratings. A double helix variation of the effective refractive index will be formed by twisting fibers with a noncircular core as they pass through a miniature oven. These chiral fiber polarizers will be created from specially prepared glass performs in a low-cost, versatile, continuous process, which will not require coherent irradiation of photosensitive glass commonly used to produce fiber Bragg gratings. Chiral polarizers are true fiber devices and do not require any substrates, bulk components, or rigid package. Their pitch profile will be engineered to minimize insertion loss for the passing polarization and maximize the extinction of the orthogonal polarization over a broad spectral range. The design will implement a multi-core optical fiber to match the low numerical aperture of standard fiber with the numerical aperture of the chiral polarizer at its input and output while maintaining a high numerical aperture in the polarizing zone. Chiral polarizers will have broad application in single polarization transmission, polarization mode dispersion compensation, and test and measurement instrumentation. Polarizers are also key elements in sensors relying on optical interference such as gyroscopes and current sensors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Polarization and frequency selective chiral fibers have applications ranging from telecommunications to sensing. The use of external modulators for high bandwidth fiber telecommunication requires that the incident wave be linearly polarized. This necessitates use of a polarizer since laser sources used in telecommunications generally have random polarization. Further, any use of polarization maintaining fiber requires that polarized light be launched into the fiber. Polarizers are also key components in polarization mode dispersion compensation systems. Since chiral polarizers may be fabricated from refractory or radiation resistive glasses and involve only mechanical deformation of glass they may function in harsh environments with high levels of radiation, high temperature, or corrosive chemicals. The fabrication techniques developed for chiral fiber polarizers will spur the development of other devices based on chiral fiber gratings. These devices, ranging from sensors and filters to in-fiber lasers will become building blocks for a new platform for passive and active in-fiber devices. The understanding of glass behavior under extreme shear stress will push the frontier of glass forming technology and stimulate new applications. Understanding polarization-selective light scattering within the nonresonant band will open the way for new devices based upon microstructured fibers.</AbstractNarration>
