<AbstractNarration>0448357&lt;br/&gt;WANG&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to advance the state of the art in the area of fault-recovery in analog circuits and thus to provide cost-effective methods for designing and implementing mixed-signal IC's with self-testing and self-repairing capabilities. The proposed research is based on the utilization of reconfigurable mixed-signal hardware. It achieves self-testing and self-repairing design goals by developing novel techniques of: (1) exploiting circuit reconfigurability to perform analog on-line self-testing; (2) repairing faulty analog circuits through partial reconfiguration in both analog and digital domains. The project outcome is a comprehensive methodology to implement self-testing and self-repairing mixed-signal circuits. A fully programmable mixed-signal hardware platform will be also implemented to demonstrate the developed methodology and techniques. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mixed-signal IC's with self-testing and self-repairing capabilities will significantly enhance the reliability of systems working in harsh environments without easy access for maintenance. Such IC's, however, are not currently widely available, primarily because of the limited progress in the area of analog fault-recovery techniques. This research will address this daunting challenge and provide a viable technology to implement more reliable circuits for military, space, and certain commercial applications. It will also positively impact the development of intelligent micro-systems. The project involves a thorough educational plan, which aims to enhance education in VLSI and prepare the students for life-long learning. The PI's Department has an excellent tradition in attracting and graduating minority students. Minority students, therefore, are expected to benefit from this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
