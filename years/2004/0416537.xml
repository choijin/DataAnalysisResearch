<AbstractNarration>Iron-sulfur clusters are one of the most ubiquitous redox co-factors in biology. Throughout evolution, iron-sulfur clusters have become integral part of diverse physiological processes such as energy conversion, sugar metabolism, nitrogen fixation, heme and biotin biosynthesis, DNA synthesis and DNA repair, and regulation of gene expression. At least six proteins (IscS, IscU, IscA, HscB, HscA and Ferredoxin) encoded by a gene cluster iscSUA-hscBA-fdx have been identified as essential for the general biogenesis of iron-sulfur clusters in bacteria. The homologs of the six proteins have also been found in eukaryotic organisms, indicating that the iron-sulfur cluster assembly mechanism is highly conserved. It has been shown that IscS, a cysteine desulfurase, provides sulfur for iron-sulfur clusters, and that IscU is a scaffold for the IscS-mediated assembly of iron-sulfur clusters and eventually transfers iron-sulfur clusters to target proteins. However, the iron donor for iron-sulfur clusters largely remains elusive. This project aims to test a hypothesis that the primary function of IscA is to recruit intracellular iron and deliver iron for the assembly of iron-sulfur clusters in IscU, and that the IscA-mediated iron transfer to IscU is coordinated through the protein-protein interactions. The research has two specific aims: 1) To define the iron binding properties of IscA by combining the biochemical, biophysical and X-ray crystallographic approaches to identify the amino acid residues that are important for the iron binding and to determine the redox properties of the iron center. 2) To investigate the mechanism of iron transfer from IscA to the iron-sulfur clusters in IscU by exploring the protein-protein interactions of IscA with IscU and IscS. The results will provide fundamental knowledge on the general biogenesis of iron-sulfur clusters, a process that is conserved from bacteria to humans. In addition, understanding iron delivery for the biogenesis of iron-sulfur clusters will offer the molecular details on how intracellular iron may be utilized in other biological processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The project is expected to attract and retain high quality graduate and undergraduate students. The students will not only learn the multidisciplinary methodology to conduct the proposed research, but also develop the attitude crucial to their future career in academia or industries through vigorous research activities. Special efforts will be taken to recruit highly motivated minority and woman graduate students to the research group. The research projects will further be integrated into the biochemistry courses that the PI and Co-PI have been teaching at their institution, and should greatly benefit the institutional biochemistry curricula.</AbstractNarration>
