<AbstractNarration> &lt;br/&gt;Tsunamis can be generated directly by seismic impact. However, in some seismic events tsunamis have &lt;br/&gt;been  observed  to  be  triggered  by  the  massive  failure  of  the  sea  floor  in  the  form  of  giant  submarine &lt;br/&gt;landslides. According to the National Geophysical Data Center and World Data Center for Solid Earth &lt;br/&gt;Geophysics  as  well  as  Intergovernmental  Oceanographic  Commission,  in  the  Pacific  Ocean  alone,  65 &lt;br/&gt;tsunami events attributed to submarine landslide caused a total number of 14,661 deaths. &lt;br/&gt; Our ultimate  long-term  goal  is  to  develop  a  fundamental  understanding  of  the  mechanism  of &lt;br/&gt;tsunamigenic landslides and subsequent tsunami generation, propagation, and run-up, which would allow &lt;br/&gt;for improved assessment and possible mitigation of the landslide and tsunami hazard. Unfortunately, the &lt;br/&gt;field data from real world observations are limited to very few cases, while the most important part of this &lt;br/&gt;data  related  to  the  tsunami  generation  stage  is  almost  completely  missing.  The  goal  of  the  proposed &lt;br/&gt;research  is  to  compensate  for  this  lack  of  data  by  the  physical  modeling  of  3-dimensional  tsunami &lt;br/&gt;evolution using a novel landslide tsunami generator which will complement the existing NEES tsunami &lt;br/&gt;facilities. Towards this goal, the following subset of objectives will be achieved in the proposed research: &lt;br/&gt;Objective 1. Model Similitude: The governing model similitude, defining the design parameters for the &lt;br/&gt;proposed landslide tsunami generator, will be determined using dimensional analysis.  &lt;br/&gt;Objective 2. A Novel Landslide Tsunami Generator:  The  proposed  novel  computer  controlled &lt;br/&gt;pneumatic  landslide  acceleration  mechanism,  will  enable  individual  control  of  the  dynamic  landslide &lt;br/&gt;parameters such as landslide location, geometry and acceleration. &lt;br/&gt;Objective  3. Landslide Parameters: To design of the experimental program we propose to determine &lt;br/&gt;the  geometries  and  velocities  of  tsunamigenic  landslides  from  the  case  histories. However,  in  order  to &lt;br/&gt;cover the whole range of possible parameter combinations we are planning to use the novel analytical and &lt;br/&gt;numerical models of the shear-band propagation mechanisms of tsunamigenic landslides. &lt;br/&gt;Objective 4. Experimental Program: In the proposed experiments we shall measure the characteristics &lt;br/&gt;of the subaqueous landslide motion and the near-field tsunami generation, propagation and run-up in three &lt;br/&gt;dimensions. In addition the resulting landslide deposits will be mapped and their thickness recorded.  &lt;br/&gt;Objective  5.  Validation  of  the  Proposed  Mechanisms:  The  measured  landslide  and  tsunami &lt;br/&gt;characteristics  will  be  compared  to  the  existing  real  world  observations  providing  a  validation  for &lt;br/&gt;physical, analytical and numerical models used in this research. This will justify the use of these models &lt;br/&gt;in the development of fundamental understanding of the coupled landslide and tsunami mechanisms and &lt;br/&gt;allow us to develop recommendations for the future experimental and theoretical research. &lt;br/&gt;Expected  Intellectual  Merit  of  the  Research:  The  proposed  research  will  advance  knowledge  and &lt;br/&gt;understanding of landslide generated tsunamis . one of the most devastating natural hazards. Originality &lt;br/&gt;of  the  proposed  work  is  based  on  its  interdisciplinary  nature,  which  combines  experimental  and &lt;br/&gt;theoretical  Fluid,  Soil  and  Fracture Mechanics  approaches.  The  project  is  a  joint  effort  between  three &lt;br/&gt;Georgia Tech faculty members who combine expertise in fluid mechanics, physical modeling and tsunami &lt;br/&gt;hazards, soil mechanics and geotechnical engineering, rock and fracture mechanics. &lt;br/&gt;Expected  Broader  Impact  of  the  Research: Understanding of landslide and tsunami mechanisms has &lt;br/&gt;broad implications not only to engineering but also to human endeavors. It will enhance both assessment &lt;br/&gt;and mitigation of tsunami and landslide hazards. The novel landslide generator developed in this research &lt;br/&gt;will  complement  existing  NEES  tsunami  facilities  both  in  the  present  and  future  studies.  The  funds &lt;br/&gt;provided from this proposal will be used to educate and support two graduate students. The results of this &lt;br/&gt;research will be incorporated into existing undergraduate and graduate level courses, and a new graduate &lt;br/&gt;course on Natural Hazards will be jointly developed by PIs. The results will be disseminated to a broad &lt;br/&gt;scientific  and  engineering  audience  through  publications  in  high-impact  professional  journals  and  via &lt;br/&gt;presentations  at  national  and  international meetings. K12 audience  will  be  reached  by  popular  lectures &lt;br/&gt;and  Internet  postings  emphasizing  the  important  role  of  Civil  Engineering  profession  in  mitigation  of &lt;br/&gt;natural hazards.</AbstractNarration>
