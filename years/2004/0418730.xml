<AbstractNarration>The intellectual merit of this proposal lies in the development of a more complete understanding of the&lt;br/&gt;processes that cause fractionation of 30Si and 28Si during soil development. Herein, measurements are&lt;br/&gt;presented that demonstrate interpretable patterns of change as unweathered minerals derived from basalt&lt;br/&gt;and granite are transformed during weathering. During the early stages of weathering d30Si values of soil&lt;br/&gt;solids decrease whereas the d30Si values of soil solution increase relative to the parent material.&lt;br/&gt;Eventually, secondary minerals begin to weather releasing Si that has lower d30Si that parent material and&lt;br/&gt;therefore the d30Si signatures of soil solution and leaching water decreases. Globally, the results are in&lt;br/&gt;agreement with predictions based on the d30Si values of igneous rocks, large rivers and ocean water, but&lt;br/&gt;they raise fundamental questions regarding the fate of Si isotopes as minerals weather, secondary&lt;br/&gt;minerals are formed, and dissolved Si is leached. The d30Si signatures of the reactants and products of&lt;br/&gt;weathering should be the most effective tracer of Si, but more needs to be understood about the behavior&lt;br/&gt;of Si isotopes in different aspects of this complex system.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will develop a more comprehensive and quantitative understanding of the&lt;br/&gt;processes that produce Si isotopic fractionations during weathering and soil formation. It will combine&lt;br/&gt;systematic field- and laboratory-based experiments and measurement of the changes in Si-isotope&lt;br/&gt;composition in solid and aqueous phases in order to isolate the reactions that are most strongly&lt;br/&gt;responsible for driving changes in d30Si values. The experiments target the following processes in which&lt;br/&gt;Si participates: 1) dissolution of primary and secondary minerals, 2) precipitation of secondary minerals,&lt;br/&gt;3) the combined impact of near-simultaneous dissolution and precipitation reactions, and 4) the integrated&lt;br/&gt;aspects of weathering, leaching and clay synthesis. The first 3 of these experiments will be in-lab benchtop&lt;br/&gt;experiments; and the fourth will utilize two ongoing experiments at the US Geological Survey, one&lt;br/&gt;utilizing leaching columns, the other a well-monitored soil chronosequence. The first 3 experiments&lt;br/&gt;simplify soil processes to insure maximum interpretability whereas the column and field experiments&lt;br/&gt;measure the integrated results of complex soil forming processes. The chronosequence is in arkosic parent&lt;br/&gt;material, and thus will add a useful dimension to an existing database on silicon isotopic changes&lt;br/&gt;associated with progressive weathering in the Hawaiian basaltic chronosequence.&lt;br/&gt;Chemical weathering unlocks elements from the lithosphere allowing them to participate in dynamic&lt;br/&gt;biogeochemical reactions in terrestrial and ultimately marine systems. Silicon is the second most&lt;br/&gt;abundant element in the Earth's crust and the dominant solute in rivers that drain continents supplying at&lt;br/&gt;least 80% of the dissolved Si entering oceans. The broader impact of this proposal lies in the importance&lt;br/&gt;of capturing the power of Si isotopes as a tracer for silicate weathering, and the subsequent participation&lt;br/&gt;of Si in Earth surface and ecosystem processes. Silicate weathering is critical for buffering acid rain, for&lt;br/&gt;long-term regulation of atmospheric CO2, and is the ultimate source of dissolved Si in natural waters.&lt;br/&gt;Silicon's abundance, chemical reactivity, and the variation in the structural stability of its host minerals&lt;br/&gt;ensure that it persists in soils even as its loss supports downstream ecosystems and as it accumulates in&lt;br/&gt;sedimentary deposits. The proposed research will augment understanding of the global Si cycle, and&lt;br/&gt;specifically the weathering-controlled transfer of Si from continents to oceans.</AbstractNarration>
