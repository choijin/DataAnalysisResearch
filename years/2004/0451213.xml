<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;0451213&lt;br/&gt;(Fu-Kuo Chang, Stanford University)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is to organize and hold an International Workshop on Structural Health Monitoring at Stanford University, Sept. 12-14, 2005.  Structural health monitoring is an emerging technology, which combines advanced sensing technology with knowledge of material/structural response and damage characteristics to monitor the integrity of structures, in real time, while in service for sustaining their reliability and performance, minimizing catastrophe and human loss in addition to the reduction of maintenance cost.  It is, therefore, particularly important for civil infrastructures such as public transportation systems, buildings, highways, tunnels, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of the Workshop are to review the progress of the current rapid development in the technologies related to the field, identify key and emerging issues in research and development, and promote exchanges and cross-fertilization across diverse disciplines: such as sensors, sensor systems, networking, computing, data mining, diagnostics, prognostics, signal processing, and multifunctional materials. The workshop will also address issues involved in practical application for civil infrastructures, ground/air/space transportation vehicles, and marine structures, etc.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Distinguished individuals from industry, academe, and government will be invited to deliver keynote lectures and presentations.  Product and technology demonstrations will also be exhibited.   The workshop will conclude with panel discussions on key issues and concerns identified during the workshop. The workshop will produce volumes of proceedings of the technical presentations. A technical committee consisting of key personnel from government, industry, and academe will be formed to guide the future development in the field.  The committee will be responsible for developing appropriate guidelines and recommendations for government agencies and industry to promote structural health monitoring technologies.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
