<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OCE-0452563&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The chemical identity and dynamics of dissolved biopolymeric material is a standing question in oceanography. However, due to a prior dearth of techniques to study dissolved biopolymers, we are only beginning to understand the source, composition and reactivity at the molecular level. In this research, scientists from the Institute of Systems Biology will develop innovative tools (biosensors) for biopolymer research using high throughput proteomics and antibody display technology.  Rather than solely examining single amino acids after hydrolysis, which erases the chemical-history of the proteins and the link between biology and ocean chemistry, the application of proteomics to characterize the secretory proteome of two model phytoplankton species will advance our understanding of the composition and reactivity of these compounds at the molecular level.  Because secretory proteomes are thought to be conservative, knowledge of the proteome for these two ecologically important species should aid in the characterization of other phytoplankton secretory proteomes. High affinity biosensors (monoclonal antibodies from phage) that recognize and bind to specific molecular moieties will allow the identification and quantification of chemical species at low concentrations in complex heterogeneous samples.  Ultimately this technology will allow in situ tracking of phytoplankton proteins, their biosynthesis, transformation, and degradation in unconcentrated seawater.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In terms of broader impacts, combining the direct monitoring of proteins released by phytoplankton and cyanobacteria and tracking of phytoplankton and cyanobacterial proteins with monoclonal probes should allow the linking of biological production and consumption to ocean chemistry through understanding the dynamics and turnover of proteins released by phytoplankton and cyanobacteria into the overall dissolved organic matter pool. Furthermore, this will lead to improved knowledge of their role in global carbon cycling and will greatly advance our knowledge of marine geochemistry and marine ecology. Undergraduate students will be exposed to these new techniques as part of this study.  The PIs will play active roles in local and regional school district science educational initiatives.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
