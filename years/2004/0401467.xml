<AbstractNarration>This Mathematical and Physical Sciences Distinguished International Postdoctoral Research Fellowship award supports research on plasticity, fracture and stress corrosion in glasses. The PI has just received her Ph.D., which involved massively parallel molecular dynamics simulations of crack-front dynamics in amorphous silicon. She will conduct research at Saclay, France and collaborate with the University of Paris XI. The research involves: (1) multiscale simulation of plasticity in glasses using finite element and molecular dynamics techniques, and (2) atomic force microscopy experiments on stress-corrosion fracture in glasses and algorithm design for the analysis of mechanical damage in the experiments. Apart from broader impacts on the education of a member of an underrepresented group and providing valuable experiences for a globally competitive workforce, the research itself has potential impact on the problem of long-term storage and processing of nuclear waste. &lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;This Mathematical and Physical Sciences Distinguished International Postdoctoral Research Fellowship award supports research on plasticity, fracture and stress corrosion in glasses.
