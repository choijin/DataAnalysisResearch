<AbstractNarration>Title: 20-hydroxyecdysone suppression of juvenile hormone action&lt;br/&gt;PI: Subba Reddy Palli&lt;br/&gt;Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;Ecdysteroids and juvenile hormone (JH) are major hormones that regulate various developmental events during an insect's life cycle.  The diverse biological effects of ecdysteroids are mediated by ecdysone receptor (EcR) and its heterodimeric partner, ultraspiracle (USP).  The molecular mechanisms of JH action are not well understood.  The biological effects of JH and ecdysteroids suggest a cross talk between these two hormones.  JH response elements (JHRE) identified in the promoter region of JH- and 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E)-responsive JH esterase (jhe) gene and ecdysone receptor (EcR) deficient Drosophila melanogaster cell line (L57) were used to develop a robust system.  In L57 cells, a reporter gene placed under the control of JHRE is induced by JH, and the JH-induced expression is suppressed by 20E in a dose- and time-dependent manner.  The nuclear proteins isolated from L57 cells specifically bound to JHRE and this binding was prevented by pretreatment of nuclear proteins with 20E.  This 20E suppression of JH-induced gene expression is mediated through EcR.  Preliminary studies showed that EcR does not directly bind to JHRE containing promoter.  Ligand binding but not DNA binding of EcR is required for 20E suppression of JH action.  These results suggest that the EcR suppresses JH-induced gene expression though a "nonclassical" mode of action, i.e., without binding to ecdysone response elements directly.  This is the first example of a system where a nonclassical action for EcR is suggested.  This system will be used to study the mechanisms involved in the nonclassical action of EcR and its cross talk with the components of JH signal transduction cascade.  The two specific objectives of this proposal are (1) to study the mechanism for 20E suppression of JH response and (2) to identify and characterize proteins that are important in cross talk between 20E and JH.  Mutations to select amino acids in the ligand binding domain of D. melanogaster EcR will be used to verify nonclassical action of EcR.  RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated silencing of usp, Drosophila hormone receptors 38 and 78, and Seven-up genes will be employed to study their role in 20E suppression of JH response.  A yeast two-hybrid assay will be used to identify proteins that interact with EcR.  The EcR-interacting proteins will be characterized through (i) RNAi-mediated silencing of their expression in L57 cells, (ii) pull down and two-hybrid assays, (iii) studies on expression of RNA in D. melanogaster tissues and (iv) analysis of JH and 20E response in D. melanogaster mutants for genes coding for the identified proteins.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Hormonal regulation of male accessory gland secretion of Acps (accessory gland proteins) was studied in the red flour beetle, <em>Tribolium castaneum</em>. Whole genome sequence, custom icroarrays and RNA interference (RNAi) were employed. Knock-down in the expression of genes involved in JH biosynthesis and action but not ecdysteroid biosynthesis and action in male insects caused a reduction in the progeny produced by females mated to these RNAi males. These data suggest that JH but not ecdysteroids play key roles in male reproduction. Thus, the regulation of <em>T. castaneum</em> male reproduction, specifically the production of Acps in male accessory glands provides an ideal model system to study JH action without interference from ecdysteroids. Genome-wide screening identified 59 putative Acps in <em>T. castaneum</em>. Probable functions of only 26 out of these 59 Acps could be predicted by InterProScan. RNAi was used to study the function of Acps. The products from the proposed research will help in designing environmentally-friendly pest management tools and gene switches for the regulation of transgenes in humans and plants. These studies contributed significant information to several scientific fields. The biochemical classes of seminal-fluid proteins have been conserved among insects, animals and humans. Functional characterization provided a rapid way of determining the reproductive role of conserved classes of seminal-fluid proteins.
