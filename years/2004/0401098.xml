<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to use combinatorial methods&lt;br/&gt;to solve problems in the field of matrix representations&lt;br/&gt;of groups and algebras, and, conversely, to use representation&lt;br/&gt;theory to produce new results in enumerative combinatorics.&lt;br/&gt;A main focus of each project is to construct and understand&lt;br/&gt;irreducible representations and characters. The algebraic&lt;br/&gt;structures under investigation include  symmetric groups and&lt;br/&gt;Weyl groups, the finite general linear group and other finite&lt;br/&gt;Chevalley groups, partition algebras, and Hecke algebras.&lt;br/&gt;These structures often come as pairs acting on vector spaces&lt;br/&gt;and commuting with each other; for example the symmetric group&lt;br/&gt;and the partition algebra commute with each other on tensor&lt;br/&gt;space and a  Chevalley group and its Hecke algebra commute on&lt;br/&gt;a flag variety. This duality allows us to bring known information&lt;br/&gt;from one of the algebraic structures to bear on the study of&lt;br/&gt;its partner.   The combinatorial structures used here include&lt;br/&gt;symmetric functions, partitions, tableaux, integer matrices,&lt;br/&gt;and graphs.  This project will engage undergraduate students&lt;br/&gt;in all aspects of the research. Algebraic combinatorics is an&lt;br/&gt;ideal way to introduce young mathematicians and scientists to&lt;br/&gt;research, because it uses accessible combinatorial objects,&lt;br/&gt;which can be created, analyzed, and manipulated by students&lt;br/&gt;who do not have of a large amount of advanced training. At the&lt;br/&gt;same time, these objects enhance the fundamental understanding&lt;br/&gt;of important constructs from algebra, geometry, and topology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The algebraic objects under investigation in this project&lt;br/&gt;represent  various kinds of symmetry. These include symmetries&lt;br/&gt;of physical objects --- such as molecules, crystals, knots, or&lt;br/&gt;tensegrities --- and symmetries of complicated systems, such as&lt;br/&gt;physical models of energy transfer, large sets of ranked data,&lt;br/&gt;or symmetry in the organization of digital image data.&lt;br/&gt;Representation theory ``represents" these symmetries using&lt;br/&gt;matrices (rectangular arrays of numbers ).  In a given problem,&lt;br/&gt;there are usually a large number of these matrices and they also&lt;br/&gt;are usually large in dimension (size).  A major goal of&lt;br/&gt;combinatorial representation theory is to find ways to&lt;br/&gt;simultaneously decompose these large matrices into their&lt;br/&gt;constituent building blocks and then to analyze the building&lt;br/&gt;blocks using concrete structures which can be manipulated by&lt;br/&gt;hand and by computer. This is analogous to understanding a&lt;br/&gt;complicated molecule by decomposing it into the various atoms&lt;br/&gt;that make it up and then carefully analyzing those atoms.&lt;br/&gt;Since the early 20th century, representation theory has held&lt;br/&gt;a prominent role in theoretical mathematics. Furthermore, it&lt;br/&gt;has had an enormous impact on physical chemistry, particle&lt;br/&gt;physics, and knot theory.  In recent years, the areas of&lt;br/&gt;application of representation theory have grown to include&lt;br/&gt;data analysis, digital image processing, coding theory, and&lt;br/&gt;engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
