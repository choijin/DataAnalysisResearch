<AbstractNarration>Billings&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The overall objective of this work is to develop a thorough&lt;br/&gt;understanding of emergent dynamics in epidemiological models as a practical&lt;br/&gt;way to prevent disease outbreaks.  Theproject has four parts: 1) developing&lt;br/&gt;new, detailed models, with the advantage of analysis by dynamical systems;&lt;br/&gt;2) incorporating time-dependent parameters that more accurately capture&lt;br/&gt;climate variability and other nonstationary behavior; 3) adding stochastic&lt;br/&gt;perturbations to analyze emergent dynamics; and 4) controlling the system.&lt;br/&gt;These problems are studied using theory from dynamical systems, topology,&lt;br/&gt;numerical analysis, asymptotics, and stochastic perturbations.  In this&lt;br/&gt;study, the investigator includes noise, time-dependent parameters, and&lt;br/&gt;spatial networks, which are known to combine to produce unexpected&lt;br/&gt;complexity in systems, or emergent dynamics.  In particular, the&lt;br/&gt;investigator builds on recent work developing the Galerkin Transport&lt;br/&gt;Matrix, which allows a rigorous study of stochastic dynamics in the context&lt;br/&gt;of the topology of the system.  This tool can identify precursor behavior&lt;br/&gt;to outbreaks, allowing the control of the dynamics by a parameter, such as&lt;br/&gt;vaccination, to avoid these patterns and avert epidemics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Disease dynamics have been modeled and studied for hundreds of years. &lt;br/&gt;Yet, epidemiologists cannot accurately predict large-scale outbreaks or&lt;br/&gt;epidemics in the most common diseases.  Currently, there are fears of new&lt;br/&gt;strains of deadly diseases and calls for a defensive plan.  Questions are&lt;br/&gt;being asked about which vaccination or quarantine strategies are necessary&lt;br/&gt;to avert outbreaks.  Due to ethical issues of testing vaccination&lt;br/&gt;strategies on people, epidemiologists must rely on data from past epidemics&lt;br/&gt;and corresponding mathematical models to guide these decisions.  Models are&lt;br/&gt;powerful tools if their results are interpreted correctly.  They can&lt;br/&gt;capture qualitative dynamics that point to patterns and mechanisms that&lt;br/&gt;enable disease persistence in a population.  They can also predict the&lt;br/&gt;success of an action taken to avert an outbreak.  In collaboration with&lt;br/&gt;epidemiologists, a better mathematical understanding of the possible&lt;br/&gt;dynamics in these models can lead to improved methods of disease control. &lt;br/&gt;This work can also be extended to new models to describe the propagation of&lt;br/&gt;multiple disease strains and certain types of computer viruses.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
