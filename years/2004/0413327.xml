<AbstractNarration>This action is to provide partial support for the joint meeting of the 11th International Conference on Soil Dynamics and Earthquake Engineering (11th ICSDEE), and the 3rd International Conference on Earthquake Geotechnical Engineering (3rd ICEGE).  This joint conference will be held on 7-9 January 2004 on the campus of the University of California at Berkeley.  The Conference is jointly overseen by the International Organizing Committee for the ICSDEE, and by Committee TC-4 (Earthquake Geotechnical Engineering) of the International Society for Soil Mechanics and Geotechnical Engineering (ISSMGE).  The joint conference serves the objectives of both conference series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scientific program will cover the following topics:&lt;br/&gt;1. Dynamic characterization and modeling of soils.&lt;br/&gt;2. Seismicity, ground motions and site effects (including hazard assessment, microzonation, vertical motions, near-field motions, distant events, etc.)&lt;br/&gt;3. Soil-structure interaction, and performance of soil-structure systems.&lt;br/&gt;4. Soil liquefaction.&lt;br/&gt;5. Slopes, embankments, dams and waste fills.&lt;br/&gt;6. Bridges and highways, retaining, waterfront and underground structures.&lt;br/&gt;7. Response and performance of deep foundation systems.&lt;br/&gt;8. Fault rupture hazard.&lt;br/&gt;9. Lifeline earthquake engineering.&lt;br/&gt;10. Field and laboratory testing.&lt;br/&gt;11. Analytical and numerical methods.&lt;br/&gt;12. Project and field performance case histories.&lt;br/&gt;13. Blasting and other rapid, man-made loads.&lt;br/&gt;14. Vibration sensitive structures and systems.&lt;br/&gt;15. Active and passive control of response related to geotechnical engineering.&lt;br/&gt;16. Codes, policy issues, insurance, and standards of practice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The support provided by the National Science Foundation will be used to provide a subsidized reduced registration rate for students in order to encourage their attendance at the conference.  It will also be used to help support the publication of the Conference Proceedings.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
