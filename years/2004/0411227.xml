<AbstractNarration>===========================ABSTRACT=============================&lt;br/&gt;Nanocrystalline materials with characteristic grain size of 1-100 nanometers &lt;br/&gt;have been synthesized and investigated extensively in the last decade. Small &lt;br/&gt;sized grains and large volume fraction of atoms sitting on grain or interface &lt;br/&gt;boundaries characterize these materials. They exhibit many unusual mechanical &lt;br/&gt;properties, making them by far one of only a few nanoscale material systems &lt;br/&gt;that have potential to be used as large-scale structural material in civil, &lt;br/&gt;mechanical, transport, and industrial applications. However, as the dimensions &lt;br/&gt;of the grain size are pushed down to nanometer scale, the degrees of difficulty &lt;br/&gt;multiply in determining and understanding the mechanical properties and their &lt;br/&gt;relations with microstructures. As a result, quantitative constitutive &lt;br/&gt;relations for various mechanical properties and their relation with &lt;br/&gt;microstructures have not been fully established. This work aims at filling this &lt;br/&gt;gap by searching for micromechanical constitutive relations in nanocrystalline &lt;br/&gt;materials using large-scale atomistic simulations. To achieve this goal, we &lt;br/&gt;plan to perform large-scale atomistic modeling of various detailed &lt;br/&gt;microstructures and their contributions to constitutive relations in nanoscale &lt;br/&gt;environment. And to perform continuum modeling of deformation process in model &lt;br/&gt;nanocrystalline samples. The detailed constitutive relation and microstructure-&lt;br/&gt;property relation obtained from atomistic simulations will be used in corse-&lt;br/&gt;grained modeling. The proposed topics are timely and answers to these questions &lt;br/&gt;are urgently needed for materials and mechanics community. Successful execution &lt;br/&gt;of this proposed work is expected to contribute to establishing systematic &lt;br/&gt;approaches for modeling microstructures and laying a solid foundation for &lt;br/&gt;constitutive modeling of mechanical deformation in nanoscale polycrystalline &lt;br/&gt;materials.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
