<AbstractNarration>Hybrid polymer-inorganic materials represent an important development in the polymer&lt;br/&gt;materials field due to the ability to potentially tailor the physical properties of these materials&lt;br/&gt;with varying chemical composition and percentage of the inorganic component. This Research at&lt;br/&gt;Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) proposal addresses several areas of intellectual merit. The&lt;br/&gt;primary technical objective of this study is to understand the fundamental physicochemical&lt;br/&gt;surface properties of polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS)-based nanocomposite&lt;br/&gt;polymer materials when modified by oxidizing or reducing plasma environments, and their longterm&lt;br/&gt;stability at elevated temperatures or with ultraviolet light exposure. A second objective is to&lt;br/&gt;determine whether plasma-modified POSS-based polymers can be used as a coating material for&lt;br/&gt;improved polymer microfluidic devices. Plasma control of the spatial and chemical composition&lt;br/&gt;of the POSS-based polymer surface will be achieved using a remote plasma treatment tool and&lt;br/&gt;the properties will be studied using a combination of surface analysis techniques including x-ray&lt;br/&gt;photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), atomic and lateral force microscopy (AFM/LFM), scanning&lt;br/&gt;electron microscopy (SEM), and contact angle measurements. Test designs for PMMA-based&lt;br/&gt;microfluidic devices have been fabricated, and POSS-based thin films will be deposited onto&lt;br/&gt;these to determine the change in electroosmotic flow (EOF) characteristics using plasma surface&lt;br/&gt;modification. Spatial control of the surface will be accomplished through a microfabricated&lt;br/&gt;shadow mask allowing for a hydrophilic / hydrophobic gradient to be patterned into the&lt;br/&gt;microfluidic channel. EOF and fluid flow measurements will be made in collaboration with the&lt;br/&gt;University of Virginia to determine whether fluid flow can be controlled through a spatially&lt;br/&gt;modulated surface within a microfluidic structure. A further objective is to design and develop&lt;br/&gt;an integrated detection methodology for microfluidic devices using ultraviolet-visible absorption&lt;br/&gt;spectroscopy taking advantage of the lower absorption edge of PMMA compared to the glass&lt;br/&gt;substrates typically used in microfluidic devices.&lt;br/&gt;A final objective related to the broader impacts of this proposal is the scientific training of&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate research students and high school science teachers in a highly interdisciplinary&lt;br/&gt;research environment. This project will involve the training of six to ten undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;researchers and three high school chemistry, physics or biology teachers over the duration of the&lt;br/&gt;program. In both cases, this project will introduce undergraduate chemistry and physics students&lt;br/&gt;and secondary school teachers to the materials science issues of structure-property relationships.&lt;br/&gt;Both students and teachers will be exposed to surface analytical techniques, vacuum science,&lt;br/&gt;polymer materials characterization and processing, and microfluidic technology and science. The&lt;br/&gt;participants in this program will also interact with graduate students and post-doctoral&lt;br/&gt;researchers at the University of Virginia through direct laboratory exposure in order to&lt;br/&gt;experience research at a research institution. These activities help serve to broadly impact the&lt;br/&gt;pipeline of future scientists from the high school through the graduate level.</AbstractNarration>
