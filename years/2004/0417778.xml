<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit:  The university offers degree programs in computer science, engineering, engineering technology, and mathematics. These disciplines each have challenging programs of study. Each department has been successful at producing well-educated graduates, and placement trends are exceptional. However, each department desires to increase the number of students entering their programs and retain those students until they have earned their respective degrees. Scholarship support is particularly lacking for upper level BS students who find themselves in financial hardship in finishing their programs of study.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The STEM departments have noted a high percentage of upper-level students who enroll in fulltime study, yet work a significant number of hours at off-campus employment in order to pay for their education. This financial pressure leads to more time away from study, which often causes poor academic performance, subsequently leading to frustration, discouragement, and often the abandonment of the student's academic pursuits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project continues a scholarship program for deserving students with demonstrated financial need. Faculty "Road Scholar" teams visit regional high schools and community colleges in order to publicize MSU's CSEMS degree programs. The funds here provide scholarships for students who are selected by the project directors. Recipients benefit from a comprehensive infrastructure of support programs: professional preparatory seminars and placement services offered through the MSU Office of Career Services; aptitude surveys, interest assessments, and career advice from the MSU Counseling and Testing Center; support from the Office of African-American Student Services; and a unique opportunity for international technical study through the Office of International Programs.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  This project represents an enhancement of a successful project that has been in place during the previous four years. The existing CSEMS project has focused an unparalleled level of attention on the high-tech disciplines on the MSU campus. Students have participated in professional preparatory workshops, mentoring programs, and specialized tutoring when needed. They have been introduced to professionals from industry and the international engineering community at a personal level. Guest speakers have included the Deputy Director of NASA-Marshall Space Flight Center and the Director for Nuclear Safety from the International Atomic Energy Agency. Both these agencies, as well as local industries, have promised continuing support for students internships and professional guidance. These scientists and engineers invigorate the students, motivate them to persist in their studies, and encourage their commitment to their disciplines. The impact on the recipient's quality of life, both intellectually and economically, will be felt for generations and will elevate career aspirations in this geographic region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project continues to give special consideration to populations underrepresented in the STEM disciplines, and the economic conditions in west Kentucky make this program especially attractive to regional students. The resulting increase in the number of graduates with technical degrees promotes a well-educated, technically-prepared, culturally aware, and diverse workforce that supports state efforts to boost economic development. Results of the program will be reported at state and national meetings on STEM education, and to state agencies charged with tracking educational and economic indicators in the technology sector.</AbstractNarration>
