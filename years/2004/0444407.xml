<AbstractNarration>Current high-end applications usually exploit just a fraction of the theoretical performance of &lt;br/&gt;large platforms. Interactions among the hardware, system software, programming interface, and &lt;br/&gt;algorithm are extremely complex, and the implications for development of hybrid MPI+OpenMP &lt;br/&gt;Fortran/C/C++ applications are challenging. The emerging generation of machines will be even &lt;br/&gt;more complex, as will the applications that exploit them. Typical application development and &lt;br/&gt;tuning scenarios involve the manual and separate use of compilers and performance tools, and &lt;br/&gt;program modifications based upon insights laboriously gleaned from their output.  &lt;br/&gt;In this proposal, we intend to raise the quality of the application development and tuning &lt;br/&gt;process by creating an integrated environment for program optimization that reduces the manual &lt;br/&gt;labor and guesswork of existing approaches. We will develop strategies  and the corresponding &lt;br/&gt;interfaces that enable the application developer, compiler and performance tools to collaborate to &lt;br/&gt;generate optimized code based upon a variety of sources of feedback, including performance &lt;br/&gt;data from  .offline. development runs as well as  from .online. production runs. We will build &lt;br/&gt;and deploy a flexible, working system that combines robust, existing, open source software . a &lt;br/&gt;compiler, a program analysis tool and two performance tools with complementary features - into &lt;br/&gt;a single, coherent environment for collaborative static and dynamic application tuning. &lt;br/&gt;Application codes of varying complexity supplied by our application partner will motivate our &lt;br/&gt;development  work  as well  as  test  and  demonstrate  our  results.  The  result  will  be  a  powerful, &lt;br/&gt;integrated  environment  that can be used to obtain traditional performance data via program &lt;br/&gt;monitoring, event tracing  and/or the  extraction of hardware counter information, and to obtain &lt;br/&gt;support for the static or dynamic tuning of an application code. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt;The proposed environment integrates several different existing technologies to provide a new &lt;br/&gt;level  of  support  for  optimizing  hybrid MPI+OpenMP codes. Support for experimentation with &lt;br/&gt;the hybrid programming model is provided. The range of information that may be exploited by &lt;br/&gt;the  compiler  to  optimize  code  is  expanded  to  cover  many  system  and  application-level &lt;br/&gt;phenomena and a variety of optimization scenarios. Interactions between tools will facilitate the &lt;br/&gt;provision of an approach that is able to handle extreme-scale computations.  Integration issues &lt;br/&gt;will be addressed with the goal of creating a deployable, extensible system.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts &lt;br/&gt;The tools, ideas, and results of this project will be freely distributed and made available to the &lt;br/&gt;HPC community, nationally and internationally. Besides the general dissemination of results, the &lt;br/&gt;project has strong ties to performance engineering experts at NCSA. The tools will be installed &lt;br/&gt;on NCSA systems for testing and evaluation and will be made available to other users. The &lt;br/&gt;research brings together compiler, performance tool, and application developers, enriching the &lt;br/&gt;research experience of graduate students to create a well-rounded IT workforce. The PI is active &lt;br/&gt;in the OpenMP community and the project team has close working relationships with DOE and &lt;br/&gt;DOD. New knowledge generated will be integrated into advanced graduate coursework.</AbstractNarration>
