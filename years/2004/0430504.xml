<AbstractNarration>Nonlinear programming (the minimization of a smooth nonlinear function subject to smooth&lt;br/&gt;(possibly) nonlinear constraints) is a touchstone problem in optimization. The problem continues&lt;br/&gt;to excite strong interest among optimization researchers for many reasons, among them new&lt;br/&gt;developments in algorithms and software (especially of the interior-point variety), the study of&lt;br/&gt;mathematical programs with equilibrium constraints (MPEC), and the discovery of new application&lt;br/&gt;areas.&lt;br/&gt;The broad scope of the nonlinear programming paradigm admits a great many pathologies in&lt;br/&gt;the geometric nature of the problem and in its algebraic speci.cation. It is impossible to design&lt;br/&gt;algorithms that converge reliably in all circumstances. Local convergence theory for most algorithms&lt;br/&gt;depends on regularity and strict complementarity assumptions, and problems for which&lt;br/&gt;these assumptions are not satis.ed (degenerate problems) are the cause of undesirable and awkward&lt;br/&gt;behavior in most algorithms and codes.&lt;br/&gt;This project will investigate some approaches to nonlinear programming, related to approaches&lt;br/&gt;currently in use, that have the potential for improved performance on degenerate and large-scale&lt;br/&gt;problems. These techniques will be theoretically rigorous and practical, in that the marginal&lt;br/&gt;computational cost of handling degeneracy will not be too great and in that they will behave well&lt;br/&gt;even when implemented in .oating-point arithmetic. Particular attention will be given to MPECs,&lt;br/&gt;which exhibit degeneracy of a speci.c type. Extensions to degenerate complementary problems&lt;br/&gt;and variational inequalities will also be investigated. Special attention will be paid to the numerical&lt;br/&gt;aspects of implementing these algorithms, an important issue because of the ill conditioning that&lt;br/&gt;may be present in the subproblems at each iteration. All this research will be carried out in a&lt;br/&gt;coordinated manner, coupling theoretical advances with computational experiments using both&lt;br/&gt;prototype software and modi.cations to production software.&lt;br/&gt;Work on applications of nonlinear programming, performed in collaboration with domain scientists&lt;br/&gt;and engineers, will be the second key contribution of the proposal. Interdisciplinary research of&lt;br/&gt;this type plays a key role in any research program in algorithmic optimization. The PI has ongoing&lt;br/&gt;collaborations in such areas as engineering control, statistics, and cancer treatment planning.&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the proposed work lies in improvements to our understanding of&lt;br/&gt;nonlinear programs and of the algorithms that solve these problems, in the construction of better&lt;br/&gt;algorithms and software that are robust in the face of degeneracy, and in the impact of these&lt;br/&gt;advances on many application areas including those described in the proposal.&lt;br/&gt;The work will have a wider impact on users of optimization technology, ultimately bene.ting&lt;br/&gt;many of those who use optimization software packages to solve problems in an extremely wide&lt;br/&gt;range of applications. Domain scientists and engineers in the areas highlighted in the proposal will&lt;br/&gt;bene.t especially.</AbstractNarration>
