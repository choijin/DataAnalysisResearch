    <AbstractNarration>The "Plant Genomes: From Sequence to Phenome Conference" will be held December 9-12, 2004, at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, as the fifth conference in the winter series focused on the theme of plant genomes. The meeting will focus on functional and evolutionary genomics in a diverse range of plants, and will serve to explore themes and technologies from other genomes including animals and fungi. There will be six sessions, focusing on regulatory networks and gene expression, proteomics, phenomics, genome organization and evolution, new genomes and annotation, and chemical genomics/metabolomics. A central theme of the entire conference will be the integration of information across large and varied data sets, and how this may be best achieved, presented and distributed. It is hoped that this meeting will provide a mechanism for the establishment of new collaborations, and a forum for discussing new experimental and conceptual approaches.</AbstractNarration>
