    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop an interactive NURBS modeling system using a force/position sensitive glove that mimics in real time the process of modeling objects using a clay or similar materials. The system will allow designers to use their artistic talents for conceptualizing, modeling and modifying products, in a very natural and intuitive manner. The Phase I work will address four objectives: 1) it will develop a design framework for capturing force and motion applied by the human hand during sculpting tasks; 2) it will develop a methodology to transmit and/or synthetically simulate the patterns of force and motion on a virtual model; 3) an intuitive user interface and interaction system will be proposed to make the task of design both practical, easy and pleasurable; and 4) the system will interface with commercial CAD systems and Rapid Prototyping systems, through a neutral file exchange system, making this into a ubiquitous CAD peripheral system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research effort will impact in the state of art in design, human factors and ergonomics, education opportunities for students learning CAD fundamentals and mechanical engineers designing and modeling products. Future leveraging of the software and hardware infrastructure developed through this Phase I research for a commercial system will revolutionize the process of product design and manufacturing.</AbstractNarration>
