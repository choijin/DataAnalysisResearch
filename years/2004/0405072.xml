<AbstractNarration>DNA microarrays can provide insight into genetic changes occurring&lt;br/&gt;during stagewise progression of diseases like cancer.  Accurate&lt;br/&gt;identification of these changes has significant therapeutic and&lt;br/&gt;diagnostic implications.  Statistical analysis of such data is however&lt;br/&gt;challenging due to the sheer volume of information.  With new&lt;br/&gt;microarray technology it is possible to measure expressions on nearly&lt;br/&gt;60,000 transcripts for each sample of tissue analyzed.  To properly&lt;br/&gt;understand the evolution of a progressive disease, expression values&lt;br/&gt;are collected over all possible biological stages, thus the number of&lt;br/&gt;parameters in such problems can be in the hundreds of thousands, or&lt;br/&gt;even millions.  The high dimensionality presents theoretical problems&lt;br/&gt;to standard ANOVA-based extensions of two-sample Z-tests, a popular&lt;br/&gt;method for detecting differentially expressed genes in two groups.&lt;br/&gt;Additionally, standard approaches that focus on controlling false&lt;br/&gt;detection rates primarily apply to simpler experimental designs;&lt;br/&gt;moreover these approaches tend to be conservative and are expected to&lt;br/&gt;be worse in multigroup settings.  This work introduces a new&lt;br/&gt;methodology called Bayesian ANOVA for Microarrays (BAM) for reliably&lt;br/&gt;detecting differentially expressed genes in complex experimental&lt;br/&gt;settings.  The method rests on a high dimensional variable selection&lt;br/&gt;method that exploits a rescaled spike and slab hierarchical model.&lt;br/&gt;BAM is shown to be risk optimal in terms of the total number of&lt;br/&gt;misclassified genes.  The exact mechanisms for this risk optimality&lt;br/&gt;are theoretically delineated as a selective shrinkage effect. Theory&lt;br/&gt;guides development of graphical devices for adaptive optimal gene&lt;br/&gt;selection.  A large multistage colon cancer microarray repository&lt;br/&gt;collected at the Ireland Cancer Center of Case Western Reserve&lt;br/&gt;University serves as a testbed for the methods.  In parallel to this&lt;br/&gt;is the development of JAVA-based software for implementing BAM.&lt;br/&gt;Software uses a menu driven GUI and includes a minimal number of&lt;br/&gt;user-specified tuning parameters, thus making it user friendly for use&lt;br/&gt;by other molecular biology laboratories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DNA microarrays allow for high throughput analysis of potential&lt;br/&gt;genetic determinants of diseases like cancer.  It is now typical to&lt;br/&gt;have expression on nearly 60,000 transcripts for each sample of tissue&lt;br/&gt;analyzed.  This information can potentially provide information about&lt;br/&gt;which genes are involved in stagewise development of cancer as well as&lt;br/&gt;indicate novel therapeutic and diagnostic targets.  However,&lt;br/&gt;statistical inferences to identify interesting genes is challenging&lt;br/&gt;due to the large number of statistical tests that are run.  Standard&lt;br/&gt;approaches employ ANOVA test statistics and are prone to high false&lt;br/&gt;detections.  False detection rate control methods tend to be overly&lt;br/&gt;conservative and do not extend naturally to more complex multistage&lt;br/&gt;experimental designs.  This work introduces a new methodology called&lt;br/&gt;Bayesian ANOVA for Microarrays (BAM) which reliably detects&lt;br/&gt;differentially expressed genes in multigroup experimental design&lt;br/&gt;settings.  The method employs a special hierarchical model that&lt;br/&gt;imparts an oracle like behaviour for gene selection --- that is,&lt;br/&gt;ultimately, only those truly differentially expressing genes are&lt;br/&gt;selected.  The reasons for this behaviour are theoretically delineated&lt;br/&gt;in this research, and the theory guides the development of novel&lt;br/&gt;graphical devices for adaptively optimal gene selection in real&lt;br/&gt;microarray datasets.  A large multistage colon cancer microarray&lt;br/&gt;repository collected at the Ireland Cancer Center of Case Western&lt;br/&gt;Reserve University serves as a testbed for the methods and also&lt;br/&gt;provides a tremendous opportunity to understand the colon cancer&lt;br/&gt;disease process, a topic which is of great medical importance.  While&lt;br/&gt;colon cancer has a well defined evolution defined by clinical stage,&lt;br/&gt;very little is known about its molecular evolution.  In parallel to&lt;br/&gt;this, is the development of JAVA-based software using a menu driven&lt;br/&gt;GUI having a minimal number of user-specified tuning parameters, thus&lt;br/&gt;making it feasible to port the software to molecular biology&lt;br/&gt;laboratories for active use in analysis of other disease processes and&lt;br/&gt;potentially other high throughput sources of data.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
