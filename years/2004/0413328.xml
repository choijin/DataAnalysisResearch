<AbstractNarration>The proposal plans, organizes and carries out a PI meeting for CISE's new Shared Cyberinfrastructure (SCI) division, targeted for late February 2004. The meeting's goals are:  to enhance collaboration among PI's and the larger community, increase information exchange, hear from PI's and their results to-date, explore areas of leveraging work and outputs across awards, expose members of the research community to status and direction of SCI, discuss new opportunities and emerging areas of research, and hear from other programs at NSF whose Cyberinfrastructure activities are closely related to SCI. This meeting benefits NSF officers as much as the PI's: it is expected that SCI will have a new Division Director on board by the time of this meeting, and this event offers new and existing NSF officers the chance to quickly come up to speed on a comprehensive portfolio of SCI activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A web site will be made available to coordinate attendance, agenda, and logistics. The site will also document meeting results and act as an archive of information and material relating to the meeting. The majority of active awards in SCI will be invited to give talks. All PI's will be invited to provide posters for a poster session, and some demos are expected. The 3-day event will be organized according to session tracks. Due to the volume of talks, parallel tracks will be necessary. Major programs in SCI, such as PACI, Teragrid/DTF/ETF, and NMI will be covered extensively. Technical categories of talks span networking and computational infrastructure, and they include: Cyberinfrastructure programs, advanced applications, network monitoring and measurement, optical networks, network services and security, and middleware.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
