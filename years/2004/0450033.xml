<AbstractNarration>The transmission of electrical impulses among cells in the nervous system is a fundamental aspect of neural function. The proposed studies will investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying this important process. A major challenge at present is to make connections between the wealth of biochemical data defining the properties and interactions of specific proteins and the endogenous molecular mechanisms operating in living cells and tissues. A very promising solution is fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), a powerful imaging method allowing protein interactions to be examined in living cells. To take full advantage of this approach, this study combines FRET analysis with the experimental tools available in the genetic model system, Drosophila.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of this project include high quality research experiences and educational opportunities for undergraduates. Several undergraduate students have already been actively involved and contributing to this project, including two women.  The project will provide broad training opportunities for these students ranging from Drosophila genetics and molecular biology to live imaging.  The materials and approaches developed will also be integrated into a team-taught undergraduate/graduate laboratory course to provide a demonstration of FRET analysis.  Finally, the project will include rigorous multidisciplinary graduate training.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investment of tax dollars in this project will advance our knowledge of a critical aspect of brain function, allowing us to better understand and control the molecular mechanisms of neurological disease. In addition, this project will promote the development of junior scientists who may lead us to new discoveries in the future.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
