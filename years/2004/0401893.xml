<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0401893&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Justin T. Moore&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research concerns applying new techniques in set&lt;br/&gt;theory and infinite combinatorics to basis problems in topology,&lt;br/&gt;graph theory, and order theory.  In each case, the goal is to&lt;br/&gt;prove a classification theorem for the uncountable objects in a&lt;br/&gt;certain category.  Three such categories are topological spaces,&lt;br/&gt;bipartite graphs, and linear orders.  The goal is to use forcing&lt;br/&gt;axioms to prove that the category has a finite basis of classical&lt;br/&gt;examples. The techniques employed in analyzing such problems are&lt;br/&gt;often Ramsey theoretic and frequently draw upon results and&lt;br/&gt;motivation which arise in analyzing Cantor's continuum problem&lt;br/&gt;and Suslin's classification problem for the real line.  The&lt;br/&gt;proposed research seeks to expand our understanding of forcing&lt;br/&gt;axioms and their impact upon basis problems and the continuum&lt;br/&gt;problem.  The PI has already proved that the Proper Forcing Axiom&lt;br/&gt;implies that the uncountable linear orders have a five element&lt;br/&gt;basis, answering one of the central problems of the proposal.&lt;br/&gt;The proof involved new techniques in infinite combinatorics which&lt;br/&gt;are likely relevant to completing the rest of the proposal.  At&lt;br/&gt;the crux is the PI's notion of set mapping reflection which was&lt;br/&gt;formulated in relation to his results on the Proper Forcing Axiom&lt;br/&gt;and the size of the continuum.  Conspicuous in the solution is&lt;br/&gt;the need for a strong axiom of infinity to obtain the consistency&lt;br/&gt;of a five element basis.  This was quite unexpected and may serve&lt;br/&gt;both to explain past difficulties and fuel future research on the&lt;br/&gt;relationship between very large sets and combinatorics associated&lt;br/&gt;with the smallest uncountable cardinal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research represents an analysis of fundamental&lt;br/&gt;mathematical objects - graphs, orders, and topologies - using a&lt;br/&gt;generalized version of the probabilistic method which Paul Erdos&lt;br/&gt;pioneered in his study of networks, packings, prime numbers, and&lt;br/&gt;circuit complexity.  The apothegm of the probabilistic method is:&lt;br/&gt;"If an object occurs with positive probability, it exists."  For&lt;br/&gt;finite probability spaces, this is a fact.  For infinite spaces&lt;br/&gt;and their generalizations - known as forcing notions - it&lt;br/&gt;requires additional axiomatic assumptions - known as forcing&lt;br/&gt;axioms.  The PI has recently shown, for instance, under such&lt;br/&gt;assumptions that any linear order which cannot be represented as&lt;br/&gt;a collection of rational numbers must contain one of five&lt;br/&gt;critical orders.  While at the present this would seem to&lt;br/&gt;represent a theoretical accomplishment with little practical&lt;br/&gt;significance, the style of argument may inspire real world&lt;br/&gt;applications in the future.  A recent example of such a success&lt;br/&gt;in set theory is Laver's algorithm for comparing braids.  An&lt;br/&gt;important question which arises in a number of areas of&lt;br/&gt;mathematics and science - from particle physics to genetics - is&lt;br/&gt;when two braids can be made to look the same without cutting or&lt;br/&gt;breaking the strands.  Laver used ideas from the theory of large&lt;br/&gt;infinite sets to devise a fast algorithm for comparing braids.&lt;br/&gt;The previous algorithm was exponentially slow.  Current&lt;br/&gt;algorithms based on Laver's idea run in quadratic time (fast).&lt;br/&gt;Hence the study of infinite sets can provide practical&lt;br/&gt;applications to much more down to earth objects.  The proposed&lt;br/&gt;research may some day have applications in the traditional&lt;br/&gt;finitary probabilistic method or less foreseeable impact as with&lt;br/&gt;with Laver's work.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
