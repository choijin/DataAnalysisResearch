<AbstractNarration> The aim of this study is to better understand the early evolution of apes and other primates through paleontological research at sites in northeastern Uganda.  The Ugandan fossil sites have yielded the oldest known ape of modern appearance, as well as the oldest Old World monkey and numerous other primates and mammals.  Of particular interest is Morotopithecus bishopi.  Analysis of fossils of this 20-million year old ape has revealed that unlike contemporaneous primates from Kenya who resembled monkeys in overall body plan, Morotopithecus would have engaged in upright postures and arm swinging behaviors like its modern relatives.  The adaptations for upright posture and forelimb suspension suggest a close relationship between Morotopithecus and living apes and humans. Furthermore, as the oldest known ape to exhibit these adaptations, Morotopithecus is key to understanding their origins.  &lt;br/&gt; Much remains to be determined about Morotopithecus including its relationship to both living and fossil ape species, its paleoenvironmental context and its anatomy. Research will include field collection of more fossils, as well as investigation of the geology and paleoecology of the Ugandan sites.  The latter will provide crucial contextual data on the timing of evolutionary events and on the conditions under which Morotopithecus and other mammals evolved.  &lt;br/&gt; Broader impacts of the study include the participation of four women (the P.I. and 3 senior personnel) and the training of American and Ugandan students.  Although East Africa is "the cradle of humanity", historically few East Africans have participated in paleoanthropological research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
