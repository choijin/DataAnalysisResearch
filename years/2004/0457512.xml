<AbstractNarration>The PI will study forbidden subgraph problems, namely the Turan and&lt;br/&gt;saturation functions, as well as positional games. It is hoped that a&lt;br/&gt;better understanding of some of the key topics, such as the Turan density,&lt;br/&gt;exactness results, stability, jumps, and non-principality phenomena will&lt;br/&gt;be achieved. The PI will work on enlarging the list of forbidden&lt;br/&gt;hypergraphs for which the complete solution has been obtained. Also, the&lt;br/&gt;more general setting of the above problems, wherein the restriction of&lt;br/&gt;containing no forbidden subgraph is replaced by an arbitrary property&lt;br/&gt;expressible in first order logic, will be considered. Another direction of&lt;br/&gt;research is to study positional games, such as Breaker-Maker, coloring,&lt;br/&gt;and symmetry games. In particular, the PI will continue the previous&lt;br/&gt;investigation of the first order descriptive complexity of combinatorial&lt;br/&gt;structures, in which the Ehrenfeucht game is an indispensable tool.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed topics of extremal combinatorics comprise many important and&lt;br/&gt;difficult problems, some of which have withstood decades of attempts. This&lt;br/&gt;area is rich in connections to other fields, such as the probabilistic&lt;br/&gt;method, linear algebra, codes, design theory, and finite field&lt;br/&gt;constructions. Also, the investigator's work on positional games and first&lt;br/&gt;order properties, which play an important role in combinatorics, computer&lt;br/&gt;science, and logic, may potentially lead to improvements in redundancy and&lt;br/&gt;representation algorithms for combinatorial data.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
