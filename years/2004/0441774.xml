    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project focuses on the development of new terahertz source modules based on difference frequency generation through GaSe nonlinear opticalcrystals. This Phase I project will focus on using Q-switched fiber lasers to generate THz sources by virtue of their high power density. These unique fiber lasers could also be implemented to generate ultra narrow-linewidth THz sources. The overall Phase I objective is to demonstrate the feasibility of a high power terahertz source with diffraction-limited output beam and the possibility of being fully implemented in Phase II. For many applications based on detection of the absorption of THz waves, there is critical need for a THz source that is coherent, narrow-linewidth, and high-power and has low divergence angle. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This will answer the market requirement for compact, portable, high-power, diffraction -limited beam, narrow-linewidth, and ultra-stable THz sources. Such THz sources can be used for security screening, non-destructive testing, remote sensing, molecular spectroscopy, bio-medical imaging, pollution monitoring, and eventually also for target acquisition as well as tracking and pointing. The fiber-laser-based design will also have potential to be low-cost.</AbstractNarration>
