<AbstractNarration>SES-0452269&lt;br/&gt;Mark Chaves&lt;br/&gt;University of Arizona&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will complete a second wave of the National Congregations Study (NCS).  The 1998 NCS was the first high quality nationally representative survey of American congregations from across the religious spectrum.  It collected data about a wide range of congregational characteristics and activities.  This project will generate data from a national sample of congregations derived from the 2006 General Social Survey (GSS), and it will survey them in order to study how American religious congregations have changed over time.  The replicates the sampling strategy, data collection methods, and many of the items used in the 1998 survey.  In this way the d project is uniquely situated to discover how congregations have and have not changed between 1998 and 2006.  The data collected will enable the PI, for the first time, to assess how much stability versus change there is in congregations' core characteristics and activities, including their social composition, size, social service involvement, political activity, neighborhood embeddedness, connections with other religious and secular organizations, and many other things.  Where there is change, it will now be possible to assess how much of that change is produced by organizational adaptation (existing organizations changing what they do) and how much is produced by cohort replacement (new generations of organizations with different characteristics entering the population). &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Data and results from this second survey will be disseminated broadly to scholars, journalists, policy makers, and leaders of both secular and religious nonprofit organizations.   Study results could potentially contribute to public debate and policy formulation concerning the evolving role of religious congregations in the nation's social welfare system. .  The National Congregation Survey data set is currently available in two public data archives.  It serves as a benchmark by which other congregational samples are judged and sometimes corrected.  In addition to appearing in scientific and scholarly books and articles, NCS results have been reported in major media and have been written about in outlets aimed at policy makers and leaders of nonprofit organizations. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
