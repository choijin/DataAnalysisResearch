<AbstractNarration>Proposal DMS-0401277&lt;br/&gt;PI: Rowan Killip, UCLA&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Schroedinger operators, integrable systems, and other&lt;br/&gt;simple models in mathematical physics&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is devoted to the furtherance of the mathematical&lt;br/&gt;understanding of certain simple physical models: (a) The long-time&lt;br/&gt;asymptotics of the KdV equation will be studied for slowly decreasing&lt;br/&gt;initial data via the inverse scattering/spectral method, with recent&lt;br/&gt;developments in the spectral theory of such operators with merely&lt;br/&gt;square-integrable potentials leading the way.  Of particular interest is&lt;br/&gt;the question of what behaviours can be attributed to embedded singular&lt;br/&gt;spectrum in the way that solitons are related to isolated eigenvalues. (b)&lt;br/&gt;The Schrodinger equation with random potentials (or Anderson model) and&lt;br/&gt;its connections to unique continuation and thence to the uncertainty&lt;br/&gt;principle (particularly in the form advocated by Fefferman).  This also&lt;br/&gt;makes links to symplectic geometry. (c) The classical Coulomb gas at all&lt;br/&gt;temperatures, or equivalently, random matrices at general $\beta$. This&lt;br/&gt;will be pursued through the study of orthogonal polynomials with random&lt;br/&gt;recurrence coefficients as pioneered by Dumitriu and Edelman. (d) The&lt;br/&gt;stability of the absolutely continuous spectrum of general Schrodinger&lt;br/&gt;operators under rough long-range (say square-integrable) perturbation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By studying simple physical models, it is possible to concentrate on&lt;br/&gt;essential difficulties, without being waylaid by technicalities.  The&lt;br/&gt;methods and perhaps more importantly, perspectives that developed for&lt;br/&gt;these simple models then inform those working closer to applications.&lt;br/&gt;Three examples taken from this project are the following:  (a) By studying&lt;br/&gt;random matrices at general inverse temperature, beta, one hopes to better&lt;br/&gt;understand the most interesting case: when beta equals two.  This case is&lt;br/&gt;so interesting because of its (currently mostly empirical) connection to&lt;br/&gt;the zeros of the Riemann zeta function.  Of course, analytic number theory&lt;br/&gt;has much to offer society at the present particularly in terms of&lt;br/&gt;cryptography; while this project does not address these questions&lt;br/&gt;directly, one must be careful to remember the many tributaries that make a&lt;br/&gt;mighty river.  (b) While integrable Hamiltonian PDEs have received&lt;br/&gt;intensive study in recent decades, attention has mostly been directed to&lt;br/&gt;the cases of periodic or rapidly-decreasing initial data.  This side-steps&lt;br/&gt;the very natural question of what behaviours are attributable to the&lt;br/&gt;existence of embedded singular spectrum for the Lax operator.  As is well&lt;br/&gt;understood, solitons are a consequence of isolated eigenvalues.  A&lt;br/&gt;potential implication of this work is the prediction of new quasi-particle&lt;br/&gt;modes in non-linear media. (c) The better understanding of inverse&lt;br/&gt;scattering found from the study of the one-dimensional Schrodinger&lt;br/&gt;equation with rough and slowly decaying potentials may lead to&lt;br/&gt;improvements in remote sensing technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
