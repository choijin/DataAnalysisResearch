<AbstractNarration>This is a project to plan for long-term U.S.-Russian collaborative research in the area of nano- and microsatellite design.  The principal investigators are Ramesh Agarwal from Washington University and Valentin Zelentsov from Bauman Moscow State Technical University (MSTU).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI's current efforts are focused on modernizing the engineering curriculum taught at Washington University - a need emphasized by aerospace industry advisors.  The current curriculum focuses on the standard ABET-required courses:  aerodynamics, aerospace structures, propulsion, flight mechanics and control, orbital mechanics and aerospace design.  Industry advisors have noted, in particular, the need to include the physics, theory and design of micro air vehicles and nanosatellites into the standard courses and to provide hands-on experience along two tracks: aircraft design and spacecraft design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MSTU has a well-established and outstanding nano- and micro-satellite design, build and fly program.  It offers a distinctive approach to engineering education by combining academic studies with research, design, and experimental work, and it has been a leader in research, design, and building of satellites in Russia.  Working with MSTU will provide an excellent educational opportunity for U.S. engineering students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project in aerospace engineering research fulfills the program objectives of bringing together leading experts in the U.S. and Central/Eastern Europe to combine complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest and competence on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.</AbstractNarration>
