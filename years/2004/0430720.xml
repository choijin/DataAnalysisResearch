<AbstractNarration>Abstract for the project:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Distributed source coding (DSC) refers to the compression of the outputs&lt;br/&gt;of two or more physically separated sources that do not communicate with&lt;br/&gt;each other. Driven by a host of emerging applications (e.g., distributed&lt;br/&gt;sensor networks and wireless video), DSC has assumed renewed interest in&lt;br/&gt;recent years. Although the theoretical result given by the Slepian-Wolf&lt;br/&gt;theorem has been known for more than 30 years, practical approaches to&lt;br/&gt;DSC did not appear until 1999.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aiming to advance the field, this research covers the theory, algorithms,&lt;br/&gt;and applications of DSC, with focus on the hard problem of practical code&lt;br/&gt;design. The basic element of a distributed source code is the binning&lt;br/&gt;scheme. For Wyner-Ziv code design, the PI proposes a paradigm based on&lt;br/&gt;Slepian-Wolf coded quantization (SWCQ). Preliminary analytical results&lt;br/&gt;show that the performance limits of SWCQ mirror those in classic source&lt;br/&gt;coding. Initial code design based on TCQ and LDPC codes gives results that&lt;br/&gt;are significantly better than any previously reported. Inspired by these&lt;br/&gt;results, the PI proposes to study successive refinement for the Wyner-Ziv&lt;br/&gt;problem and apply SWCQ to layered video coding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will also tackle the more general problem of multiterminal&lt;br/&gt;source coding under the same powerful paradigm of SWCQ. While asymmetric&lt;br/&gt;Slepian-Wolf coding is used in SWCQ for Wyner-Ziv coding, for&lt;br/&gt;multiterminal source coding with SWCQ, the PI will explore symmetric&lt;br/&gt;Slepian-Wolf coding after quantization of each source. Both direct&lt;br/&gt;multiterminal source coding and indirect multiterminal source coding &lt;br/&gt;(e.g., the CEO problem that arises in distributed sensor networks) will &lt;br/&gt;be treated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theme of the research is to view lossy DSC as a source-channel coding&lt;br/&gt;problem and perform algebraic binning via the combination of quantization&lt;br/&gt;and Slepian-Wolf coding based on channel codes. The main novelty lies in&lt;br/&gt;using a single SWCQ framework as the embodiment of algebraic binning to&lt;br/&gt;solve different code design problems and address potential applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
