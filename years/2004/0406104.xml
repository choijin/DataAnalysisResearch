<AbstractNarration>The PI's research includes the use of fixed-point methods,&lt;br/&gt;the method of moments, and complex-analytic singularity analysis to&lt;br/&gt;study additive functionals on random trees, which arise in the&lt;br/&gt;analysis of divide-and-conquer algorithms.  It seeks to explain,&lt;br/&gt;using continuum random trees and Brownian excursion or otherwise, an&lt;br/&gt;invariance of distributions observed across various random-trees&lt;br/&gt;models.  A refined analysis, under the so-called random permutation&lt;br/&gt;model, of the periodic asymptotic distributional behavior of&lt;br/&gt;additive functionals for trees with large branching factor also&lt;br/&gt;extends to urn models and multi-type branching processes.&lt;br/&gt;Additionally, the research encompasses digital analyses and&lt;br/&gt;improvements of algorithms for searching and sorting, such as the&lt;br/&gt;widely-used Quicksort; use of a perfect simulation algorithm&lt;br/&gt;pioneered by the PI to estimate mixing times of Markov chains&lt;br/&gt;statistically; and the novel application of Mellin transforms to the&lt;br/&gt;study of small deviations (small-ball probabilities) for Gaussian&lt;br/&gt;random fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research to be performed lies at the interface of probability&lt;br/&gt;and computer science.  It involves the design and application of&lt;br/&gt;efficient algorithms for computer simulation from complicated&lt;br/&gt;probability distributions; the probabilistic analysis of algorithms&lt;br/&gt;and data structures arising in connection with such basic and&lt;br/&gt;important algorithms as Quicksort, which is the standard sorting&lt;br/&gt;procedure in Unix systems and which, in a computer science review&lt;br/&gt;paper in 2000, was cited as one of the ten algorithms with the&lt;br/&gt;greatest influence on the development and practice of science and&lt;br/&gt;engineering in the last century; and the novel application of a&lt;br/&gt;common analysis-of-algorithms tool ("Mellin transforms") to an area&lt;br/&gt;of probability ("small deviations", involving the estimation of the&lt;br/&gt;chance of certain uncommon events).&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
