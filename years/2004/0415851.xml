    <AbstractNarration>Although over 200 genes have been identified in immune responses of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, little is known about how genetic variation leads to differences in immune capability. Even less is known about interactions between genetic variants and pathogens of Drosophila. Brian Lazzaro's project is at the intersection of those two questions. Drosophila will be collected from five locations around the globe for at least three consecutive years. The diversity of bacteria pathogenizing these wild flies will be determined to discover whether a) there are differences among populations in bacterial prevalence and b) bacterial composition changes over time. Simultaneously, genotypes of at least 20 important immune response genes will be obtained from each wild-caught fly a) to test for differences among fly populations and b) to assess in the field whether fly genotypes correlate with the absence/presence of specific bacteria (implying resistance/susceptibility to infection). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Immune responses are highly conserved among insects and the conclusions drawn from Drosophila experiments have direct application in other systems. This study will contribute to an understanding of the ecology of insects and bacterial pathogens, currently poorly understood from a genetic perspective. Observed adaptation of Drosophila to local pathogens may suggest the potential for evolution of resistance in pests to biological control mechanisms in agricultural fields.</AbstractNarration>
