<AbstractNarration>Physics (13) The LivePhoto Physics project is developing a collection of digital video &lt;br/&gt;analysis materials for introductory physics courses, using research-based development&lt;br/&gt;methods that were refined through projects such as Tools for Scientific Thinking&lt;br/&gt;and Workshop Physics. These materials include videos, lecture demonstration&lt;br/&gt;sequences, homework assignments, instructor notes, and software. In digital video&lt;br/&gt;analysis, students use computers as laboratory instruments to make measurements&lt;br/&gt;on video images of real events. These techniques are being used increasingly in&lt;br/&gt;physics courses, and there is evidence that they are effective in teaching physics&lt;br/&gt;concepts. In spite of the wealth of mass-media and educational videos available that&lt;br/&gt;can be used in laboratories or student projects, very few existing videos are ideal for&lt;br/&gt;analysis by students. The LivePhoto Physics project is&lt;br/&gt;meeting this need by producing a collection of digital videos that span many of the&lt;br/&gt;topics covered in a one-year physics course, including videos made with high-&lt;br/&gt;speed/slow-motion equipment that is not available at most teaching facilities. An&lt;br/&gt;innovative aspect of the project is that the topic selection is being guided by the&lt;br/&gt;results of physics education research. Written curricular materials using the videos&lt;br/&gt;in Interactive Lecture Demonstrations, distance-learning exercises and extended&lt;br/&gt;homework problem sets are being produced and classroom tested in a three-year&lt;br/&gt;research-based development cycle. Field testing is taking place at two-year colleges&lt;br/&gt;and four-year colleges/universities with diverse student audiences. Computer&lt;br/&gt;software that extends the display and visualization capabilities of digital video&lt;br/&gt;analysis is being developed during the project. The final set of videos, curricular&lt;br/&gt;materials and software will be published in the form of a CD. The LivePhoto&lt;br/&gt;Physics project is addressing the need for faculty development and the integration of&lt;br/&gt;technology in education by sponsoring six workshops on the use of digital video&lt;br/&gt;analysis in physics teaching.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
