<AbstractNarration>Previous work has resulted in data indicating that there are morphological and chemical indicators of bleaching related stress in one species of modem coral (Porites divaricata) that have potential as proxies for coral bleaching in the fossil record. This project will investigate whether these same indicators can be seen in fossil (Holocene, Plio Pleistocene) corals. Well preserved Holocene, Pleistocene, and Pliocene Porties spp. will be examined with SEM, and analyzed for trace metal content with ICPAES. Resulting data should indicate if potential proxies identified in preliminary results can be identified in fossil specimens. This project is a necessary intermediate step between previous work, and a larger project investigating the geologic history of coral bleaching.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is no existing proxy for identification of stress in fossil Scleractinia. Morphological and trace metal signals for bleaching related stress have been identified in the modem scleractinian skeleton as they have been in foraminifera. Because these signals have potential for identification in the fossil record, the Neogene fossil record could become a source of information about the permanence of damage done to modern coral reef communities, the effect on the biodiversity of the reef community, and the prognosis for recovery of today's reef systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Small Grant for Exploratory Research will be carried out by post-doc, Sande Burr, who generated the preliminary data as part of her PhD dissertation. This project will allow her to advance her training and skills relating to ICPAES and SEM. If this project is successful, a larger, fully funded project which would involve collaboration with scientists in the Dominican Republic, will be proposed.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
