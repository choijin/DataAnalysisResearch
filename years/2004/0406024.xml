<AbstractNarration>We plan to study several random structures, such as the random graphs and&lt;br/&gt;mappings, the random Young tableaux and the plane integer partitions. While&lt;br/&gt;a tremendous progress has been achieved in analysis of the Erdos-Renyi &lt;br/&gt;random graph process, much less is known about the transitional behavior of the&lt;br/&gt;directed graph version of this process. One obstacle is a dearth of&lt;br/&gt;enumeratve results for directed graphs. In cooperation with Wormald&lt;br/&gt;the proponent plans to work on asymptotic counts of digraphs by the vertex &lt;br/&gt;degrees, using some ideas of their prior research on undirected graphs. The &lt;br/&gt;proponent is confident that this study will result in a detailed description of &lt;br/&gt;the phase transition in the random digraph. The proponent plans to analyze an &lt;br/&gt;alternative graph process suggested by Lovasz, in which the new edges appear with &lt;br/&gt;probabilities proportional to the resulting vertex degrees. This analysis will require &lt;br/&gt;solving a host of natural extensions of classic graph enumeration problems. Inspired by &lt;br/&gt;the work of Propp and Wilson, and Dalal-Schmutz, the proponent plans to study the &lt;br/&gt;collapse time of the compositions of the independent random mappings. The proponent will &lt;br/&gt;continue a study of the likely shapes of random plane and solid diagrams, and will try &lt;br/&gt;to answer open questions formulated in two recent studies of an optimal partitioning &lt;br/&gt;problem, conducted jointly with Borgs, Chayes and Mertens. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However idealized, the random graph methodology provides a way to describe dynamics&lt;br/&gt;of large evolving networks. We hope that our work on the graph processes will contribute &lt;br/&gt;to a better understanding of an "abrupt change" phenomenon characteristic&lt;br/&gt;for real-life networks, when addition of few connections leads to formation of a tight&lt;br/&gt;"core". Our continued study of the partitioning problem will provide a deeper insight&lt;br/&gt;into critical dependence of its algorithmic complexity on the relations between the random&lt;br/&gt;input parameters. We believe that this analysis will serve as a model&lt;br/&gt;for study of a broader class of combinatorial optimization problems important in&lt;br/&gt;applications, such as the "knapsack" problem and the "bin packing" problems.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
