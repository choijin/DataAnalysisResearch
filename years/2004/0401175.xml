<AbstractNarration>Lipshitz and Robinson propose to continue their collaborative investigation&lt;br/&gt;into the model theory of non-Archimedean valued fields with analytic&lt;br/&gt;structure. The analytic geometry of closed balls over an algebraically&lt;br/&gt;closed valued field, termed affinoid rigid analytic geometry, was developed&lt;br/&gt;in the 1960s and 70s by Tate, Remmert and others. Lipshitz and Robinson have&lt;br/&gt;previously extended affinoid geometry to the setting, which they term&lt;br/&gt;quasi-affinoid, of relative affinoid geometry over an open ball. They&lt;br/&gt;applied that theory to prove rigid analytic quantifier elimination and&lt;br/&gt;quantifier simplification theorems that yield precise information about the&lt;br/&gt;structure of sets definable by rigid analytic functions and their images.&lt;br/&gt;They propose to continue this investigation. In particular, a central&lt;br/&gt;remaining question is whether there is a quantifier elimination theorem in&lt;br/&gt;the affinoid rigid analytic category. They also propose to continue their&lt;br/&gt;recently-begun collaboration with Raf Cluckers into uniform cell&lt;br/&gt;decomposition theorems for (equicharacteristic zero) valued fields with&lt;br/&gt;analytic  structure, extending the uniform algebraic cell decomposition of&lt;br/&gt;Pas to the case of (equicharacteristic zero) valued fields with analytic&lt;br/&gt;structure. In the discretely valued cases, the analytic  structure is&lt;br/&gt;provided by affinoid power series and in the non-discretely valued case by&lt;br/&gt;quasi-affinoid power series.  Key is a generalization of the classical&lt;br/&gt;Mittag-Leffler decomposition to 'analytic' functions on a generalized&lt;br/&gt;annulus with coefficients in a valued field with analytic structure that is&lt;br/&gt;not necessarily complete or algebraically closed. Pas's algebraic cell&lt;br/&gt;decomposition theorem gives results uniform in the prime p about the&lt;br/&gt;rationality of p-adic zeta-functions. This investigation will extend that&lt;br/&gt;theory to the analytic category and will also have applications to motivic&lt;br/&gt;integration. The methods to be used in the investigation come from model&lt;br/&gt;theory, rigid analytic function theory, commutative algebra and algebraic&lt;br/&gt;geometry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Archimedean property of the real numbers is the fact that any two&lt;br/&gt;nonzero real numbers are commensurate; that is, there is an integer multiple&lt;br/&gt;of the first the magnitude of which exceeds the magnitude of the other.  In&lt;br/&gt;various branches of mathematics, e.g., number theory and algebraic geometry,&lt;br/&gt;non-Archimedean fields arise. These are fields with a notion of magnitude&lt;br/&gt;that does not satisfy the Archimedean property: the magnitude of a sum of&lt;br/&gt;elements is no larger than the largest term of the sum. A natural example of&lt;br/&gt;such a field is the field of Laurent series (power series in one variable&lt;br/&gt;with at most finitely many negative exponents) with coefficients in a field&lt;br/&gt;K. The nonzero elements of the coefficient field all have unit magnitude,&lt;br/&gt;and the magnitude of the variable is considered to be small (1/2, say.)&lt;br/&gt;Power series satisfy the implicit function theorem, a central property&lt;br/&gt;linking the magnitude and the algebraic structure. Other non-Archimedean&lt;br/&gt;fields satisfy Hensel's Lemma, a generalization of the implicit function&lt;br/&gt;theorem. A great deal of the algebraic structure of such fields is coded in&lt;br/&gt;the structures of the residue field (the ring of elements of unit magnitude&lt;br/&gt;modulo the ideal of smaller elements; in the example, K) and the value group&lt;br/&gt;(the set of magnitudes that occur; in the example, all integer powers of 2.)&lt;br/&gt;Definable subsets over such fields can often be decomposed into finitely&lt;br/&gt;many particularly simple pieces, called cells. This decomposition is very&lt;br/&gt;useful in the evaluation of various integrals that arise in number-theoretic&lt;br/&gt;and geometric contexts. Lipshitz and Robinson propose to extend&lt;br/&gt;non-Archimedean cell decomposition results and applications, which are known&lt;br/&gt;in the algebraic category, to the analytic category; i.e. to non-Archimedean&lt;br/&gt;fields satisfying Hensel's Lemma on which, in addition to the polynomial&lt;br/&gt;functions, a natural class of analytic functions is defined.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
