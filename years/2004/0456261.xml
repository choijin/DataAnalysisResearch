<AbstractNarration>This proposal describes a theoretical study of the rotational properties of clouds of ultracold atoms.&lt;br/&gt;Building on his previous work, the investigator will explore several topical subjects, with the fol-&lt;br/&gt;lowing four objectives. (1) He will calculate the topological structures which will form in a rapidly&lt;br/&gt;rotating gases of spin-1 bosons in the presence of magnetic fields. (2) He will determine the kinet-&lt;br/&gt;ics of spinning up small clusters of atoms at the nodes of an optical lattice. (3) He will produce&lt;br/&gt;a practical scheme for creating fields which couple to neutral atoms in the same way that the&lt;br/&gt;electromagnetic fields couple to charged particle. (4) He will study interference between rotating&lt;br/&gt;clouds and demonstrate that an interference experiment can distinguishing condensed and strongly&lt;br/&gt;correlated rotating states.&lt;br/&gt;These projects are motivated by both interest in fundamental physical properties of these cold&lt;br/&gt;gases [topics (1), (2), and (4)] and by a desire to produce experimental protocols to create and&lt;br/&gt;measure exotic states of matter [topics (2), (3), and (4)]. Topic (1) addresses the basic ground&lt;br/&gt;state properties of clouds of rotating atoms. Topic (2) allows the study of fundamental questions of&lt;br/&gt;energy and entropy transfer in isolated systems, while possibly providing an experimental pathway&lt;br/&gt;to producing analogs of quantum Hall effects. Topic (3) is aimed at producing a valuable tool for&lt;br/&gt;exploring vortex physics, quantum Hall effects, the pinning of vortex lattices, and the interplay&lt;br/&gt;between lattices and quantum Hall effects. Topic (4) studies the basic coherence properties of both&lt;br/&gt;condensed and correlated states, and provides an experimental strategy for distinguishing these&lt;br/&gt;states.&lt;br/&gt;The investigator will use an array of analytic and computational techniques, related to those&lt;br/&gt;used in previous projects. These include lowest-Landau-level calculus, field theory, variational&lt;br/&gt;methods, numerical exact diagonalization, and numerical Monte-Carlo.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
