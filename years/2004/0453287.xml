<AbstractNarration>This project is a research experience for undergraduates (REU) site that provides 10 psychology students a hands-on, ten-week summer independent research project, working collaboratively with a faculty member from one of the departments within the College of Social and Behavioral Sciences at Weber State University.  Students conduct research on the effects of circadian disruption through shift-work on military and law enforcement personnel.  Intellectual Merits- Through a collaboration with the Air Force Research Laboratories Human Effectiveness Directorate, Warfighter Fatigue Countermeasures Branch, REU students research the effects of fatigue on performance, quantifying and optimizing existing Air Force and law-enforcement shift-work scheduling practices.  Research is conducted on a variety of levels, including physiological, cognitive, behavioral, and social aspects of shift-work.   Broader Impacts- Four populations of students are targeted for participation in this REU site-women and underrepresented minorities, nontraditional students, students from institutions where research opportunities are limited, and students contemplating graduate school.  The goal is to provide students with the opportunity to design and conduct research and to participate in a number of professional development activities intended to assess their desire toward pursuing graduate school.  In addition, the research conducted by student investigators will directly contribute to the growing pool of knowledge necessary to improve working conditions for our military and law-enforcement personnel.</AbstractNarration>
