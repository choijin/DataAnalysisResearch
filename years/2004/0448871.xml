<AbstractNarration>Modeling of coupled continental tectonics, mantle dynamics, and surface&lt;br/&gt;processes will be undertaken to explore surface deformation and deeper&lt;br/&gt;mantle flow during continental collision. Surface erosion will be&lt;br/&gt;incorporated into the models to explore the interaction between tectonics&lt;br/&gt;and atmospheric processes. Model predictions will be compared to data from&lt;br/&gt;collisional settings to provide a better understanding of continental&lt;br/&gt;collision. The links between continental growth and the Earth's thermal&lt;br/&gt;evolution will also be explored. A combination of theory, numerical&lt;br/&gt;simulations, and lab experiments will be used to provide insight into&lt;br/&gt;coupled planetary cooling and continental growth. Geochemical data will&lt;br/&gt;provide constraints on continental growth. The methodologies developed to&lt;br/&gt;model the interaction between conducting continents and the convecting&lt;br/&gt;mantle will also be used to address hydrothermal convection below&lt;br/&gt;insulating cap rock and the cooling history of magma chambers within host&lt;br/&gt;rock. The PI's modeling across earth science sub-fields will provide unity&lt;br/&gt;between his teaching and research. Lecture demonstrations, i.e., models&lt;br/&gt;designed for education, can convey general foundational ideas that students&lt;br/&gt;then link to approach a range of earth science problems. This will allow&lt;br/&gt;students in introductory classes to see that scientific ideas are not isolated&lt;br/&gt;bits of information. The broader impact is that a portion of the student&lt;br/&gt;population that will not go into science will have a clearer view of what&lt;br/&gt;science is. Demonstrations will also be used in a reverse mode. A workshop&lt;br/&gt;will be developed where advanced students will build demonstrations and simple&lt;br/&gt;experiments of their own design to convey key ideas from their primary earth&lt;br/&gt;science field. In presenting their work to each other they will see how many&lt;br/&gt;key concepts do not care about artificial sub-field boundaries. They will&lt;br/&gt;see connections and be better prepared to make new ones. The space will also&lt;br/&gt;house a scientific visualization studio where students will work on effective&lt;br/&gt;visual communication of scientific ideas. The workspace/studio will be&lt;br/&gt;available to K-12 educator colleagues in the Houston area.</AbstractNarration>
