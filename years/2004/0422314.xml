<AbstractNarration>The Mathematics, Engineering and Technology (MET) Scholarship Program is designed to increase the number of underrepresented students pursuing careers in computer science, mathematics, and engineering (CSEM). It has the following objectives:&lt;br/&gt;1. Recruit and enroll 33 students a semester (28 grant supported scholarships and 5 contributed by the college) into an Associate of Science and Associate of Applied Science MET Scholarship Program.&lt;br/&gt;2. Retain at least 75% of participants to the completion of a degree and transfer to a baccalaureate degree program.&lt;br/&gt;3. Establish 6 paid summer internships in CSEM fields for promising students in the scholarship program to increase collaborations with industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because the five colleges in the system cover a wide geographic area, faculty at each college mentor the scholarship students. The scholars are brought together as a group for orientation and interact in small study groups and at lectures and field trips offered throughout the academic year. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;The MET Scholarship Program is increasing the numbers of well educated and skilled employees in technical areas; improving educational opportunities for students in CSEM fields; increasing student retention to an associate degree and transfer to a baccalaureate program; and strengthening partnerships between the college and high technology industry in the Houston area. The success rate of students transferring from the college to four-year institutions gives evidence to the quality of academic programs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;By targeting underrepresented minorities, there are both short-term and long-term increases in the number of underrepresented students entering the college and completing an associate degree to pursue careers in CSEM fields. The scholarships significantly increase the ability to draw new students into math, computer science and technology, and engineering programs. The MET Scholarship Program and a full system of academic support prepares the participants from a largely minority student population to compete successfully in baccalaureate degree programs and as working professionals.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
