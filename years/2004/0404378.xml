<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to achieve direct excitation of surface plasmons (or surface plasma waves) from quantum dots. The approach to accomplishing this task starts with the high quality quantum dots grown using the Stranski-Krastanow self-assembly mechanism occurring during molecular beam epitaxy of the InAs/GaInAs/GaAs materials system in our laboratory. Combined with available e-beam lithography and imaging interferometric lithography, nanophotonic structures and devices investigating coupling will be grown, fabricated and characterized. Modeling using rigorous techniques evolved from coupled wave approaches will help in understanding of physical mechanisms such as dipole-dipole interactions coupling quantum dots and surface plasmons. &lt;br/&gt;        Successfully achieving such a device structure may allow direct electrical excitation of surface plasmons and make possible several new devices replacing plasmon sensors based on attenuated total reflection. Furthermore, the approach taken by this program requires a level of understanding by the researcher of the interplay between materials, device, and electromagnetic properties that offers exceptional opportunities for the broad-based education of graduate students and postdoctoral associates. The University of New Mexico fulfills a key responsibility in the successful education of underrepresented groups at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. Our program strongly aligns with the outreach efforts of the National Nanotechnology Infrastructure network node recently established at the University of New Mexico that serves as a conduit for outreach to local public schools, but also has strong ties to local media that should aid in furthering public awareness and understanding of important developments in nanophotonics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
