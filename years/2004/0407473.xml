<AbstractNarration>This grant supports the 2004 Biennial Conference of the Federation of Materials Societies to be held in Washington DC in May 2004. The conference is titled "Materials Education for the 21st Century Workforce". It helps establish the education needs in materials science for the 21st century and focuses on all aspects of materials education including K-12, undergraduate and graduate education, and continuing education. The scope of the conference will be in six areas: &lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;The changing undergraduate and graduate materials curriculum (including issues related to accreditation and continuous improvement), &lt;br/&gt;   Programs to enhance K-12 education in materials and technology, &lt;br/&gt;   Continuing education and the role of the community colleges, and education for the non-materials professional, the national infrastructure for research and development, &lt;br/&gt;   Meeting the needs of industry in metals, metallurgy, microelectronics and &lt;br/&gt;soft materials, &lt;br/&gt;   The present status and future needs of local and national facilities as a &lt;br/&gt;resource for the education of future materials scientists and engineers. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The venue of the conference and workshop will include one distinguished plenary session, invited presentations covering the above topics, panel discussions with recorded recommendations.  Participation from industry and academia will be sought. &lt;br/&gt;This proposed conference has national importance since materials education will be critical in advancing technology and enhancing the nation's economy, security and health.  The conference will concentrate on defining educational requirements for a workforce which will solve industrial and societal needs that require materials development in the new century.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
