<AbstractNarration>Abstract for award DMS-0401403  of  Flach&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the project is to explore the usefulness of Taylor-Wiles systems &lt;br/&gt;for establishing cases of the Tamagawa number conjecture on special values &lt;br/&gt;of Hasse-Weil L-functions. Following the initial breakthrough by Taylor and &lt;br/&gt;Wiles this has been done in the case of the adjoint L-function of elliptic &lt;br/&gt;modular forms in joint work with Diamond and Guo. The next cases we intend &lt;br/&gt;to look at are those where the Taylor-Wiles method has been worked out but &lt;br/&gt;the relationship to values of L-functions is still missing, notably Siegel &lt;br/&gt;modular forms of genus 2, Hilbert modular forms and possibly unitary groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;L-functions figure prominently in modern number theory, or even in all of &lt;br/&gt;pure mathematics if one takes as a benchmark the seven Clay millenium &lt;br/&gt;problems, two of which are directly concerned with L-functions. In high &lt;br/&gt;school algebra one draws the solution set in the plane of an algebraic &lt;br/&gt;equation in two variables x and y. One may also look at the solutions in &lt;br/&gt;rational numbers, integers or integers modulo a prime number. L-functions &lt;br/&gt;are built from the number of solutions modulo primes (of any set of &lt;br/&gt;equations in any number of variables) and are expected to give information &lt;br/&gt;about solutions in rational numbers. Solving equations in rational numbers &lt;br/&gt;is notoriously hard, whereas values of L-functions are often very &lt;br/&gt;computable, so such a relationship lies very deep. The primordial example &lt;br/&gt;is of course the conjecture of Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer, one of the &lt;br/&gt;millenium problems. As often in mathematics, one generalizes a problem in &lt;br/&gt;order to understand it better but the tradeoff is an increasingly abstract &lt;br/&gt;framework ("cohomology" in this case). On the positive side, other &lt;br/&gt;instances of the generalized framework may actually be provable with &lt;br/&gt;current methods, and this is what the project aims to explore. The aim is &lt;br/&gt;to prove new cases of the expected special value formula for L-functions, &lt;br/&gt;using the relatively recent method of Taylor-Wiles systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
