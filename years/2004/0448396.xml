<AbstractNarration>During hibernation in ground squirrels, core body temperatures may be as low as -2 degrees C, heart rates may fall from around 200-250 beats per minute to as low as 3-4 erratic beats per minute, and metabolic rates can approach 1/100th of normal rates.  The amazing metabolic depression of hibernation means that critical metabolic activities like protein synthesis and degradation must be reversibly turned off.  However, the maintenance of protein pools is required if one is to survive.  Biochemical and molecular strategies will be employed to examine the mechanisms by which protein metabolism is depressed as well as the implications of that depression.  This research will address specifically the mechanism of how the bulk of protein synthesis initiation is down-regulated during hibernation.  Also studied will be the role of a novel mechanism of protein synthesis initiation that could promote the survivorship of hibernation by increasing the production of stress proteins.  Finally, the mechanism of how protein degradation is depressed will be examined.  This research will not only answer basic questions on how a fundamental process like protein metabolism can be depressed while still allowing for survivorship, but in addition, should provide insight for future applied efforts that exploit these natural lessons for human health therapies. For example, a better understanding of hibernation may have profound implications for designing therapies for cardiac dysfunction, muscle disuse atrophy, and kidney failure.  Education at both undergraduate and graduate levels will be an integral part of this research.   An outreach component of this grant will be a local, children's television show produced in conjunction with UNLV-TV entitled 'Desert Survivor'.  This program will showcase the local flora and fauna and is designed to promote scientific literacy in the local elementary schools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this award, we investigated protein metabolism (transcription of mRNA, translation of that mRNA into proteins, and protein degradation) during hibernation in ground squirrels.  Ground squirrels are thought to be the masters of hibernation and core body temperatures may be below 0 &deg;C and oxygen consumption 1/100th of active rates.  Significant findings our our studies included demonstration that transcription factors may be partially activated yet ineffective during the non-steady state of torpor (the depressed metabolic state of hiberation).  An alternative form of protein translation called internal ribosome entry site (IRES) mediated initiation of translation is preferred during the torpid state.  The result is that as squirrels periodically arouse from torpor, stress proteins will be preferentially translated and may facilitate survivorship of the hibernator.  We found that the tagging of protein with ubiqutin for degradation is largely temperature-insensitive.  However, degradation of those proteins is very temperature sensitive.  The result of this mismatch is an accumulation of tagged proteins during torpor.   Taken together, these data overturn a previously held notion that hibernators maintained a constant albeit slowed down state.  Instead, our data demonstrate that ground squirrel hibernation is not a steady state condition.  There are signficant mismatches in what are thought to be vital processes.  Rather than simply running at a lower setpoint, ground squirrels appear to allow vital processes to become uncoupled and then somehow manage to reestablish these processes during the euthermic arousals.  We created 12 episodes of a television program entitled Desert Survivors and designed to increase science literacy in 5th graders.  This program was aired on 2 cable telelvision networks and was supported through a web site.   We received a supplement to the grant that allowed us to develop a model system based on common tenrecs.  These bizarre mammals have a variable body temperature and a unique form of hibernation devoid of the periodic interbout arousals that all other small mammalian hibernators experience.  Since our earlier work on protein metabolism implicated the interbout arousal would allow resumption of normal processes, we will investigate what these tenrecs do in the absence of these arousals.
