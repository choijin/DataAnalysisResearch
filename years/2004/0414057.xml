<AbstractNarration>Terman&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The basal ganglia are a group of nuclei that play an important role in&lt;br/&gt;the generation of movement.  Dysfunction of the basal ganglia is associated&lt;br/&gt;with movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease and Huntington's&lt;br/&gt;chorea.  Structures within the basal ganglia have in fact been the target&lt;br/&gt;of recent therapeutic surgical procedures including pallidotomy and deep&lt;br/&gt;brain stimulation.  Numerous experiments have demonstrated that neurons&lt;br/&gt;within the basal ganglia display a variety of dynamic behaviors; moreover,&lt;br/&gt;patterns of neuronal activity differ between normal and pathological&lt;br/&gt;states.  Neither the origins of these neural firing patterns nor the&lt;br/&gt;mechanisms that underlie the patterns are understood.  The primary goals of&lt;br/&gt;the project are to develop detailed computational models, based on&lt;br/&gt;experimental data, for basal ganglia activity and to develop mathematical&lt;br/&gt;tools for analyzing these models.  The investigator systematically studies&lt;br/&gt;mechanisms underlying complex activity patterns found in a broad class of&lt;br/&gt;excitatory-inhibitory neuronal networks.  These include a recently&lt;br/&gt;constructed model for neurons within the so-called indirect pathway of the&lt;br/&gt;basal ganglia.  He also uses geometric, dynamical systems methods to&lt;br/&gt;explore how these networks transform incoming firing patterns. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The investigator develops a computational model for neuronal activity&lt;br/&gt;in the basal ganglia.  The model is used to formulate and test hypotheses&lt;br/&gt;concerning the functional role of the basal ganglia in both healthy and&lt;br/&gt;diseased states.  As it evolves, the model serves as a tool that can be&lt;br/&gt;used to test hypotheses about the function basal ganglia, the pathologies&lt;br/&gt;that develop in motor disorders, and the mechanisms through which&lt;br/&gt;therapeutic interventions such as deep brain stimulation (DBS) may prove&lt;br/&gt;effective.  In particular, a central aspect of this research is to test&lt;br/&gt;hypotheses about how DBS reduces parkinsonian motor symptoms.  This may&lt;br/&gt;lead to new strategies by which DBS can be applied.  Topics in this project&lt;br/&gt;present tremendous opportunities for cross-disciplinary seminars, workshops&lt;br/&gt;and collaborations.  The principal investigator has been very active in the&lt;br/&gt;training of undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students.  He has&lt;br/&gt;organized numerous workshops at international conferences and has lectured&lt;br/&gt;at several summer educational programs.  A primary goal of these activities&lt;br/&gt;is to help nurture a community of scholars from different disciplines&lt;br/&gt;involved in the mathematical biosciences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
