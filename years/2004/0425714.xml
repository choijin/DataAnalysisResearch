    <AbstractNarration>An international conference on Group IV Photonics will be held September 29-October 1, 2004 in Hong Kong. The conference is organized to include discussion of new research results on materials and devices in which the active region consists of binary or ternary alloys of C, Si, Ge, Sn or of the elemental semiconductors themselves will be presented and discussed. Materials structures may employ bulk layers or quantum-confined heterostructures including quantum wells, wires, and dots. Papers on photonic-bandgap structures and other nanostructures are welcomed. Although an "all-group-IV" solution is emphasized, the conference will accept papers that describe monolithic, or quasi-monolithic, integration of group III-V and II-VI semiconductor structures upon silicon. The format includes oral and poster sessions. The conference is expected to stimulate collaboration and discussion between researchers, especially between young professionals and established experts and to identify critical scientific issues.&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;An evaluation of the progress and status of fundamental phenomena involved in Group IV Photonics is an important and timely topic, and will be of great value to progress in the electronics/photonics field. Along with the opportunity to assess the field and future directions, it is expected that new ties will be established among universities, research institutions, and industry. The requested NSF funds will be used to facilitate participation in the meeting by students. &lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>
