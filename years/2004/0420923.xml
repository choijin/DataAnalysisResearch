<AbstractNarration>This is an instrument development project at Northwestern University (NU) supported by the Major Research Instrumentation program. A unique and patented technique of Near-Field Acoustic Holography (NFAH) system will be developed. This will be a novel system and will address emerging issues in imaging and analysis of diverse "embedded" nano and microscale structures, and engineered systems. NFAH development program will significantly contribute to achieiving the research/educations goals of Northwestern University and collaborative partners. There is a remarkably broad interest in applications of the proposed development across dozens of potential faculty users, other local academic/research institutions (Argonne, UIUC, UIC) as well as industrial clients (JEOL, Asylum Research, Veeco, Molecular Imaging, Baxter, AMD, GE, SEMATECH and  Dow Corning). The instrument will be an integral part of NU's new multiuser, multifunctional and full 24/7 access NUANCE (Northwestern University Atomic and Nanoscale Characterization Experimental) Center (www.nuance.northwestern.edu), and will be housed within the NIFTI (Nanoscale Integrated Fabrication, Testing and Instrumentation) user facility. A fully integrated development, implementation and usage program is planned, which draws from 400+ existing users of NUANCE, and plans to enhance the usage through short courses, web-based content delivery, extensive hands-on training and educational initiatives. It will also enhance NU's nano-analytical infrastructure, and Northwestern's mission towards the "Highest Order of Excellence", namely Life and Biomedical Sciences and Materials Science in their broadest definition. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This instrument development project at Northwestern University (NU) is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation program.
