<AbstractNarration>The objective of the proposed program is to provide undergraduate members of groups traditionally underrepresented in computer science and engineering with a practical and inspiring summer study experience to reinforce and supplement their regular course of study, build their leadership and teamwork skills, and motivate them to go on to pursue graduate degrees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interns will gain expertise in the science of design learn to understand and frame problems, capture requirements and derive specifications for software engineering. The design of software will be applied to network systems, mathematic and simulation models, geographic information systems and renewable energy systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;REU-RMS at HSU will contribute to the broader goal of attracting more women and minorities to fields in computer science and engineering in which they are underrepresented, and preparing them for successful careers in those fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HSU will provide minority and women faculty in computing science, mathematics, engineering and natural resource sciences to serve as mentors for minority and women students in the program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HSU is nationally known for its successfulprograms to recruit and support Native American students, particularly in sciences, natural resources, and engineering, and in addition has existing solid and successful recruiting and support programs for women and minority students.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
