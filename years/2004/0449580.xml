<AbstractNarration>The objective of this work is to develop monodisperse III-V diluted magnetic semiconductor quantum dots (DMS QDs) as ideal domains for potential applications of spintronics especially for quantum computing (QC). The scope of the proposed project covers a broad range of fundamental education components, including Solid State Inorganic Chemistry, Physical Chemistry, Materials Chemistry, Organometallic Chemistry, Solid State Physics, Structural and Magnetic Characterization. The significance of this research endeavor lies in the following three aspects: (1) creating a novel exploration avenue to chemically develop promising DMS QDs by extending the DMS system from II-VI or IV-VI to III-V compounds and doping them with manganese (Mn2+ ); (2) providing conclusive spin information and the viability of the proposed materials by evaluating the spin behaviors of one (or a few) quantum-confined electron(s) trapped in a QD; (3) proving some spintronic concepts in nanophase based on the experimental observation on real QDs. The broad impacts of this project are three-fold: (1) to attract, train and position students in various levels (high-school, undergraduate, graduate, and post-doctoral) to this promising interdisciplinary field; (2) to enhance the research and education capability of the State of Louisiana in Materials Chemistry and NanoScience; (3) to closely link academia to industry and to enhance the students' ability in solving industrial problems through these cutting-edge research techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this work is to explore the further development of high-quality diluted magnetic semiconductor quantum dots (DMS QDs) as ideal materials for application in spin electronics (spintronics) with a particular use for quantum computing. The idea of using the electron spin of an atom as an additional degree of freedom in microelectronics materials related to information storage devices is feasible, and has received strong support from experiments. Such a spintronic effect may lead to a revolution in the next generation of electronic devices for memory storage and quantum computing. Our work focuses on (1) the preparation and the manipulation of various DMS QDs (mainly for III-V Group elements) with size-control and (2) the development of systematic analytical methods to characterize the spin behavior and the collective properties of these novel QDs for possible use in quantum computing design.  State of the art quantum computing designs are theoretically based on DMS QDs by trapping a spin of one (or a few) electron(s) inside a dimension-restricted, isolated semiconductor unit. To experimentally achieve this objective, the fabrication of the promising DMS QDs is the first challenge, followed by the characterization of the spin behavior of these QDs. The proposed research program will speed up exploration in this promising direction, and will also enhance various activities of high-tech K12 education in the State of Louisiana. Throughout the course of this project, the PI/PD will continuously participate in a high school student outreach program, high school teacher summer training program and REU summer research program already established at the University of New Orleans.</AbstractNarration>
