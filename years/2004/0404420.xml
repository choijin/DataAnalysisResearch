<AbstractNarration>In the ocean autotrophs are the principle particle vector converting dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) &lt;br/&gt;to particulate organic matter (POM).   Exudates, principally derived from phytoplankton as dissolved &lt;br/&gt;organic matter (DOM), exist in the ocean as labile, semi-labile and refractory DOM.  As an alternate &lt;br/&gt;particulate pathway the microbial loop represents a process where bacteria are able to metabolize a &lt;br/&gt;portion of this DOM and therefore convert DOM to POM.  This conversion of DOM to POM has &lt;br/&gt;been found to be substantial, providing significant energy for higher trophic levels.  Recently, a &lt;br/&gt;process has been described where 0.2 um filtered and poisoned river water produced particles &lt;br/&gt;abiotically in dark incubations.  The analysis of particles and source waters showed that the particles &lt;br/&gt;are distinctly different from TEP (transparent exopolymers particles) and were derived from DOM &lt;br/&gt;and contained organic components found in living organisms (i.e., DNA, carbohydrates, lipids, &lt;br/&gt;proteins).  Over the incubation period the rate and magnitude of formation, as well as size, of these &lt;br/&gt;abiotic microparticles were similar to bacteria, and carbon-nitrogen ratios suggest they could be &lt;br/&gt;nutritionally important.  If a similar process occurs in the marine environment it would by-pass the &lt;br/&gt;traditional biotic microbial loop in terms of transforming DOM to POM and may constitute an &lt;br/&gt;important alternate pathway, especially if labile DOM comprise major components of the abiotic &lt;br/&gt;particle formation pathway.  However, if the source material of the microparticles are composed &lt;br/&gt;primarily of the refractory fraction of the DOM pool then they may provide a poor nutritional source, &lt;br/&gt;but may still make a significant contribution to the deep sea carbon flux.   &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The proposed study will examine the abiotic formation of organic particles in two major contrasting &lt;br/&gt;ocean environments: the oligotrophic North Pacific near Station ALOHA and the highly productive &lt;br/&gt;upwelling zone off the Pacific coast of N. America (cruise of opportunity).  Carefully controlled &lt;br/&gt;time-series experimental incubations will be conducted with filtered and poisoned surface (1% light &lt;br/&gt;level) and deep (~1000 m) seawater to elucidate the formation rate, size, quantity, composition and &lt;br/&gt;nutritional quality of abiotically formed particles as well as a determination of source material.   &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The results of this research will provide a first-order global estimate of the &lt;br/&gt;magnitude of this process in the sea and its significance relative to the traditional microbial loop &lt;br/&gt;pathway.  If the abiotic formation of organic particles is a significant process in the sea, then this &lt;br/&gt;process could be a significant shunt to the microbial loop and would expand our understanding of &lt;br/&gt;particle dynamics in the sea. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: There is a strong educational benefit to these studies. Undergraduate students will &lt;br/&gt;be intimately involved in the planning and implementation of this project, and will benefit from &lt;br/&gt;exposure to interdisciplinary faculty from UH and other institutions involved with HOTs and other &lt;br/&gt;cruises (informal education in the form of dissemination of ideas, techniques and field experience).  &lt;br/&gt;Project PI Cowen is a faculty member of the Global Environmental Sciences, a rigorous &lt;br/&gt;undergraduate science major administered through the Department of Oceanography; it is anticipated &lt;br/&gt;that undergraduate participation in this project will lead to at least one student Senior Thesis.  Cowen &lt;br/&gt;is also involved in Science-Teacher outreach projects and will continue the very successful .Teacher &lt;br/&gt;at Sea. outreach program initiated by Cowen as part of another NSF project; this program integrates &lt;br/&gt;local teachers and their classrooms into all phases of the research project; in this project we will &lt;br/&gt;involve teachers in the local sample collections, incubation experiments and analyses.  Teachers. &lt;br/&gt;students will be invited to UH ships and to analytical facilities for examination of project samples.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
