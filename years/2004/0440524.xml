<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;In this 3-year project, the Colleges of Engineering and Education at the University of Missouri-&lt;br/&gt;Columbia will collaborate with three central Missouri school districts (one small city and two &lt;br/&gt;rural), engineering businesses, and the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary &lt;br/&gt;Education to improve the pedagogy and team-building skills of engineering graduate students, &lt;br/&gt;increase the engineering content for G6-9 science and mathematics teachers, and provide &lt;br/&gt;opportunities to increase interest in science and mathematics among G6-9 students using hands-&lt;br/&gt;on engineering design projects.   &lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit. Engineering and education faculty working together with Fellows and G6-&lt;br/&gt;9 science teachers blends content and pedagogy skills for better overall impact on the Fellows' &lt;br/&gt;development. This is further emphasized by requiring the Fellows to include a chapter about this &lt;br/&gt;outreach activity in their dissertation. Empowerment of the Fellows and development of &lt;br/&gt;leadership skills is included by explicitly involving them in decision making;  infusion of &lt;br/&gt;engineering design into K-12 education, a nationally recognized need, is furthered by the project, &lt;br/&gt;using a unique team approach;  development of  Future Scientists and  Engineers Clubs in schools links the proposed activities with curricular ones, enhancing effectiveness and improving sustainability, and; the proposed global connections via distance links adds an important educational dimension to all the activities, for all the participants. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact.  The proposed project will help develop infrastructure for deeper and sustained &lt;br/&gt;partnerships, centered on engineering design, among G6-9 science and mathematics educators, &lt;br/&gt;higher education, industry, and the department of elementary and secondary education of the &lt;br/&gt;state. The prototype resources (for graduate students, teachers, and G6-9 students) developed will &lt;br/&gt;be made available to graduate students, middle and secondary science and mathematics teachers, &lt;br/&gt;and higher education throughout the region, the state, and the nation, with the expectation that &lt;br/&gt;they will utilize them whenever appropriate. Infusion of engineering design projects should also &lt;br/&gt;facilitate the development of content-rich and inquiry-based approaches. The graduate students &lt;br/&gt;will also benefit from enhanced skills transferable to a variety of occupations. The importance of &lt;br/&gt;actively engaging students in design has the potential not only to enrich teaching of science and &lt;br/&gt;mathematics, but also to forge connections to daily life by providing approaches to meet other &lt;br/&gt;challenges in diverse areas ranging from ecological issues to personal life.  The inclusion of women and minorities in all aspects of this program will be stressed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Partial funding for this project is provided by the Directorate for Engineering.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
