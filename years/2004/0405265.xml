<AbstractNarration>Proposal 0405265&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: Rudi Weikard&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Univ of Alabama Birmingham&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Conference on the Titchmarsh-Weyl m-function&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The m-function was originally introduced by Weyl. Its implications for the spectral theory of the underlying differential operator were first investigated by Titchmarsh. In the intervening 50 years the scope of the m-function and also its analogies for other mathematical systems have been developed extensively. A meeting on the Titchmarsh-Weyl m-function is planned for July 2004 in Cardiff, Wales, to bring together experts in the subject as well as scientists outside of mathematics who may exploit its use to develop new results in their own work.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this proposal is to make it possible for American &lt;br/&gt;scientists (mostly graduate students and recent Ph.D.s) to participate. Monies obtained through this proposal will enhance the infrastructure for research and education by exposing particularly young scientists and graduate students to a very active current research area. In selecting participants the &lt;br/&gt;proposer will give careful consideration to those groups which are underrepresented in mathematics.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
