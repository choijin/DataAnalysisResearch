    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes to develop field deployable kits for the detection of bio-terror pathogens. These kits would consist of fluorescent-labeled antibodies directed against protein toxins expressed by bio-terror pathogens, relying for detection on strong antibody-antigen interactions and fast chromatographic discrimination using simple chromatography strips supplied with inexpensive pre-measured reagents. In Phase I project, new water soluble blue-emitting reporter fluorophores were synthesized that were extremely photo-stable and could be easily visualized under any type of light conditions. These fluorophores were conjugated to an antibody against Bacillus anthracis as the initial proof-of-concept, and methodology was developed to attach these reporter fluorophores to monoclonal, polyclonal or recombinant antibodies. The objectives of Phase II project are to optimize reagents and chromatography, to synthesize new fluorophores for multiplexed pathogen detection, to design and assemble prototype kits, and to test and validate the kits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial application of this project will be in the area of homeland security. The proposed kits are expected to be inexpensive, versatile, and easy to use by relatively untrained first responders (such as police, firefighters, paramedics, hazmat personnel, other emergency response teams).</AbstractNarration>
