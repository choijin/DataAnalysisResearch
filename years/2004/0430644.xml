<AbstractNarration>Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;--------&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a semidefinite programming (SDP) problem, a linear function of&lt;br/&gt;a symmetric matrix variable $X$ is minimized subject to linear&lt;br/&gt;equality constraints on $X$ and the essential constraint that $X$&lt;br/&gt;be positive semidefinite.  Many mathematical optimization problems&lt;br/&gt;can be cast as SDP problems including linear programming (LP) problems,&lt;br/&gt;convex quadratic problems with convex quadratic inequality constraints,&lt;br/&gt;matrix norm minimization problems, and a variety of maximum and&lt;br/&gt;minimum eigenvalue problems. In addition, SDP has many&lt;br/&gt;applications in combinatorial optimization, engineering,&lt;br/&gt;statistics, and robust optimization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today, there are numerous algorithms and codes available for&lt;br/&gt;solving LPs, SDPs, and other cone programs,&lt;br/&gt;and these methods can be loosely grouped into three types:&lt;br/&gt;second-order interior-point (IP) methods based on exact linear solvers,&lt;br/&gt;second-order IP methods based on iterative linear solvers, and first-order&lt;br/&gt;nonlinear programming (NLP) methods. The choice of which type to&lt;br/&gt;use for a particular application is determined primarily by&lt;br/&gt;problem size --- second-order IP methods based on exact linear solvers&lt;br/&gt;are more efficient on small- to medium-scale problems while&lt;br/&gt;first-order NLP methods and second-order IP methods based on iterative&lt;br/&gt;linear solvers are better for large-scale problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Second-order IP algorithms for SDP are derived from similar&lt;br/&gt;algorithms for LP and, in&lt;br/&gt;particular, inherit the polynomial-time complexity of IP methods&lt;br/&gt;for LP. In addition, as in LP, the subclass of primal-dual methods&lt;br/&gt;and their higher-order variants are very effective for solving SDP&lt;br/&gt;problems practically. In contrast to LP, however, there are many&lt;br/&gt;ways one can compute the Newton search directions used in&lt;br/&gt;primal-dual algorithms for SDP. For this reason, the theory and&lt;br/&gt;implementation of primal-dual methods for SDP is substantially&lt;br/&gt;more difficult than that for LP.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First-order NLP algorithms have been developed as an alternative&lt;br/&gt;to second-order IP methods (based on exact linear solvers)&lt;br/&gt;for solving large-scale SDPs that arise&lt;br/&gt;in certain applications, e.g., in combinatorial optimization.&lt;br/&gt;These methods reformulate the SDP problem into a NLP problem that&lt;br/&gt;can be solved using standard NLP techniques --- in particular,&lt;br/&gt;first-order techniques that do not require as much computation as&lt;br/&gt;second-order techniques. The exclusion of second-order&lt;br/&gt;information, however, makes it difficult (perhaps impossible) to&lt;br/&gt;establish the polynomial complexity of such algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Polynomial convergence analysis of second-order IP methods based on&lt;br/&gt;iterative linear solvers is still a topic which is not well-understood.&lt;br/&gt;Since these methods have the potential to outperform first-order&lt;br/&gt;methods in the solution of large-scale SDP problems, it is of&lt;br/&gt;paramount importance to study the theoretical and practical behavior of these&lt;br/&gt;methods. This proposal will address this topic in depth first in&lt;br/&gt;the context of the basic LP problem and then in the context of&lt;br/&gt;other cone programming problems such as quadratic programming (QP),&lt;br/&gt;second-order cone programming and SDP.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal addresses the development of the theory and&lt;br/&gt;implementation of algorithms for SDP and also investigates the applications&lt;br/&gt;of SDP. The objectives of this research project consist of:&lt;br/&gt;1) advancing the knowledge of the theory and implementation of&lt;br/&gt;second-order primal-dual methods for LP, SDP and other cone&lt;br/&gt;programming problems;&lt;br/&gt;2) developing and implementing second-order IP algorithms based on iterative&lt;br/&gt;linear solvers for LP and more general cone programs;&lt;br/&gt;3) developing new and/or improving existing algorithms and implementations for&lt;br/&gt;first-order smooth and non-smooth methods for SDP;&lt;br/&gt;4) enhancing the variety, applicability, usefulness, and robustness&lt;br/&gt;of first-order NLP methods for SDP;&lt;br/&gt;5) developing SDP heuristics for combinatorial problems based on low-rank&lt;br/&gt;restricted SDP problems; and&lt;br/&gt;6) develop new insights of the geometry of the central path and its&lt;br/&gt;consequences into the polynomial solvability of IP methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will lead to new and improved algorithms and codes&lt;br/&gt;to find exact or approximate solutions to optimization problems&lt;br/&gt;arising in diverse applications in industry, finance, science, and&lt;br/&gt;engineering.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
