<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;proposal: 0406169&lt;br/&gt;PI: Glen Meeden&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A synthesis of  objective Bayesian and designed based methods &lt;br/&gt;                 for finite population sampling&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;         Project Abstract &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the frequentist or design approach to finite population sampling prior&lt;br/&gt;information is incorporated in the sampling design. However in some cases &lt;br/&gt;when calculating estimates the design weights need to be readjusted, and &lt;br/&gt;then it can be difficult to find  sensible estimates of variance.&lt;br/&gt;In the Bayesian approach prior information is incorporated  through&lt;br/&gt;a prior distribution. Since the posterior distribution does not depend &lt;br/&gt;on the design it has been  difficult to theoretically reconcile the &lt;br/&gt;two approaches. The Polya posterior is an objective  Bayesian approach &lt;br/&gt;to finite population sampling that is appropriate when little&lt;br/&gt;or no prior information is available. The investigator is developing &lt;br/&gt;a synthesis of this objective Bayesian approach and the design&lt;br/&gt;based approach. It has two main threads. In the first the Polya &lt;br/&gt;posterior is extended to problems where it cannot be applied directly &lt;br/&gt;because of additional prior information contained in  auxiliary&lt;br/&gt;variables. This leads to a constrained or restricted&lt;br/&gt;version of the Polya posterior. In the second Bayesian models are&lt;br/&gt;developed which directly include the design in the specification of the &lt;br/&gt;prior. Such models are a generalization of the Polya &lt;br/&gt;posterior and using them one  can objectively incorporate &lt;br/&gt;into a prior the same kind of information that is encapsulated in a design.&lt;br/&gt;The investigator is developing the underlying theory and methods to&lt;br/&gt;simulate from these  objective posteriors so that  estimators can be &lt;br/&gt;found in practice and their frequentist properties studied. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the most basic problems of statistics is making an inference  &lt;br/&gt;about a population based on a sample collected from the population.&lt;br/&gt;When little is known about the population the  mean of the&lt;br/&gt;values in a random sample is used as an estimate of the population&lt;br/&gt;mean. However in addition to the estimate one also needs a &lt;br/&gt;sensible measure of its uncertainty or variance. In most&lt;br/&gt;situations there is prior information available about the population. &lt;br/&gt;This information should be used in deciding what units are to be &lt;br/&gt;included in the sample, the value of the estimate and the appropriate &lt;br/&gt;measure of uncertainty. The investigator is working on a synthesis &lt;br/&gt;of the two standard approaches to these problems.  The results should make &lt;br/&gt;more effective use of available prior information than present methods.&lt;br/&gt;Because of the many surveys done each year by  government and others &lt;br/&gt;improving survey practice is of great practical significance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
