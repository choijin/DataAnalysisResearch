<AbstractNarration>PROJECT SUMMARY &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:  &lt;br/&gt;Molar-tooth (MT) is an enigmatic carbonate fabric marked by variously shaped voids &lt;br/&gt;filled with a uniform, equant microspar. To date, research has focused largely on deciphering &lt;br/&gt;mechanisms of void formation and delineating MT distribution in time and space. MT &lt;br/&gt;preservation, however, is intimately linked to precipitation of MT microspar, about which we &lt;br/&gt;know little. MT microspar consists of uniform, equant, non-interlocking crystals that under &lt;br/&gt;cathodoluminescence (CL) show dully-luminescent, subspherical cores (5-7 m diameter) and &lt;br/&gt;luminescent overgrowths. Conditions favoring precipitation were common in the &lt;br/&gt;Mesoproterozoic and early Neoproterozoic (1600-750 Ma), where MT microspar comprises &lt;br/&gt;&gt;90% of individual beds and 5-25% of preserved carbonate (volumetrically equivalent to &lt;br/&gt;Paleozoic skeletal grains). The objective of this project is to investigate an unusual, yet &lt;br/&gt;volumetrically significant, morphology of carbonate, termed molar-tooth (MT) microspar, whose &lt;br/&gt;widespread occurrence in the Mesoproterozoic and early Neoproterozoic suggests linkages &lt;br/&gt;between carbonate precipitation and the broad-scale geochemical evolution of marine &lt;br/&gt;environments. This proposal will address three questions: (1) What are the nucleation and growth &lt;br/&gt;mechanisms of this unusual carbonate microspar? (2) Was vaterite the original mineralogy of this &lt;br/&gt;microspar, as has been previously proposed? and (3) What can this unusual carbonate &lt;br/&gt;morphology tell us about the composition of Proterozoic marine systems?  &lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately, small crystal sizes inhibit use of many traditional techniques in further &lt;br/&gt;examining microspar origins. I propose a multidisciplinary approach wherein high-resolution CL &lt;br/&gt;and SEM imaging will be used to define morphologic endmembers, reconstruct crystal size &lt;br/&gt;distributions, and interpret nucleation and growth mechanisms; laser-Raman spectroscopy will be &lt;br/&gt;used to document lattice structure to help constrain mineralogical change; and combined high-&lt;br/&gt;resolution SIMS trace element imaging, Raman spectroscopy, and crystal growth experiments &lt;br/&gt;will be used to constrain initial fluid compositions and precipitation conditions. Ultimately, &lt;br/&gt;deciphering the genesis of MT microspar will help identify chemical environments of formation &lt;br/&gt;and will aid in understanding the sedimentary impact of long-term chemical changes in the &lt;br/&gt;Earth.s biosphere. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:   &lt;br/&gt;This project aims to advance discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, &lt;br/&gt;training, and learning by expanding the breadth of carbonate-based research at the University of &lt;br/&gt;Tennessee, adding research opportunities for undergraduate students, involving students directly &lt;br/&gt;in the process of scientific inquiry, encouraging scientific activity in which undergraduates will &lt;br/&gt;assist and be mentored by graduate students and faculty, and encouraging student participation in &lt;br/&gt;regional and national meetings. Currently, I have 3 students lined up for this project [1 M.S. &lt;br/&gt;(male) and 2 B.S. (female); 2 of them non-traditional students returning to school after starting &lt;br/&gt;families]. This project will also enhance the research and education infrastructure at the UT by &lt;br/&gt;supporting initiatives to expand use of multi-user facilities and establish interdisciplinary &lt;br/&gt;collaboration within the University (Geology-Chemistry) and with Oak Ridge National Labs. &lt;br/&gt;Finally, the project aims to broaden participation of under-represented groups through continued &lt;br/&gt;research- and equipment-based collaboration with the State University of West Georgia, a non-&lt;br/&gt;Ph.D. granting institution. Such collaboration raises student awareness of opportunities in the &lt;br/&gt;Earth Sciences and strengthens UT.s ability to attract new graduate students.</AbstractNarration>
