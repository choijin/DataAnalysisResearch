<AbstractNarration>SST: CAD Tools and Verification for Resonator-Based Sensor Technology&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A major effort in sensing technology centers about the miniaturization of sensing elements.&lt;br/&gt;Much investment is being expended upon the development of sensing systems that can be incorpo-rated&lt;br/&gt;into autonomous micro-electrical-mechanical systems (MEMS) for widespread wireless sensing&lt;br/&gt;needs ranging from monitoring buildings and bridges for safety, to electronic noses for detecting&lt;br/&gt;atmospheric chemical hazards across wide geographic areas, to electronic ears for monitoring com-munication&lt;br/&gt;channels just to name a few. One key to the successful deployment of such systems&lt;br/&gt;is overcoming the energy needs of sensor nodes. Note that sensors need power not only to sense&lt;br/&gt;but also to communicate. An attractive technology for dealing with many of these issues is bulk-acoustic&lt;br/&gt;wave resonators (BAWRs); at the MEMS scale of a few microns these devices operate in&lt;br/&gt;the GHz range (cell phone frequencies). BAWRs can be used as high quality frequency references&lt;br/&gt;in chemical sensors, elements of signal processing filter networks, and as elements of wireless com-munication&lt;br/&gt;systems all at very low power compared to alternate technologies. Much of the promise&lt;br/&gt;of such devices has been seen in proof-of-concept experiments that have recently been published.&lt;br/&gt;However, a careful reading of these publications shows that while the general operating principles&lt;br/&gt;of BAWRs are known, there is a distinct lack of accuracy to which resonant-based MEMS sensor&lt;br/&gt;designers understand expected system behavior. This proposal intends to help rectify this defi-ciency&lt;br/&gt;and to promote more rapid development of successful BAWR devices by developing freely&lt;br/&gt;available computer aided design (CAD) tools.&lt;br/&gt;This interdisciplinary team of researchers intends to not only develop a CAD tool but to also&lt;br/&gt;conduct experiments to verify its accuracy. Their CAD software is designed to accurately predict&lt;br/&gt;resonator quality degradation from thermoelastic damping, intrinsic material losses, and anchor&lt;br/&gt;(or clamping) losses. They will tackle the problem in a new way for the MEMS community by&lt;br/&gt;looking directly to the governing partial differential equations (PDEs) for the resonator behavior&lt;br/&gt;and then abstracting small, accurate, and fast models for design level computations using advanced&lt;br/&gt;Krylov model reduction methods. Novel aspects in their approach include a modeling system that&lt;br/&gt;will automatically separate different damping effects from each other and make possible new virtual&lt;br/&gt;experiments for the creation of heretofore unknown BAWRs. Key to this last point is their proposal&lt;br/&gt;to develop an optimization module for the CAD tool that will allow for the optimization of targeted&lt;br/&gt;performance parameters, such as transfer functions, that are needed for higher level sensor node&lt;br/&gt;design. Integral to the proposed work will be the fabrication of poly- and single-crystal BAWRs&lt;br/&gt;that will test the models, help refine them, and test new concepts in coupled resonator designs.&lt;br/&gt;The team make-up includes experts in material modeling, scientific computing, and MEMS design&lt;br/&gt;and fabrication. They intend to build upon their past successes in creating new MEMS devices&lt;br/&gt;and in creating and disseminating MEMS design software.&lt;br/&gt;The scientific questions to be addressed in this proposal are of a critical importance to the&lt;br/&gt;community. But beyond these merits, it is noted that the proposal will have the broader impact&lt;br/&gt;of developing the community's research infrastructure as the software to be developed will be dis-tributed&lt;br/&gt;freely. On the human resource side the proposers will fill a broader objective by training&lt;br/&gt;students in an highly interdisciplinary field by combining training in semi-conductor engineering&lt;br/&gt;with mechanical modeling and scientific computing. Such graduates are sorely needed in the com-munity.&lt;br/&gt;The proposers additionally plan to recruit from the successful Summer Undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;Program in Engineering Research at Berkeley (SUPERB). This program aims to reach out to&lt;br/&gt;under-represented groups in engineering and provide them with a high quality research experience&lt;br/&gt;and encourage them to aspire to graduate degrees. The PIs have successfully participated in this&lt;br/&gt;program in the past.</AbstractNarration>
