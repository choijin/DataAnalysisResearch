<AbstractNarration>This project builds Stevens' capacity in information assurance and computer security education by developing new interdisciplinary cybersecurity degree programs on both the undergraduate and the graduate level. Although the computer science department offers a graduate certificate in cybersecurity, none of the available programs in science, technology management, engineering, or mathematics at Stevens Institute of Technology allow the students to earn an actual degree in cybersecurity. It is believed that having separate degree programs will allow Stevens to attract more students to the program, as well as providing these students with an education that prepares them more thoroughly for careers as information assurance and computer security professionals. A major step in achieving this goal is to offer an interdisciplinary education, integrating core computer science with conventional sciences and cybersecurity, as well as with engineering and technology management. The newly proposed degrees are interdisciplinary in character and are intended to build on and extend current efforts to better suit these needs. Nevertheless, the new degree programs are primarily based in computer science, as professionals in computer security and information assurance need to have both strong theoretical and practical backgrounds in order to be well prepared for their careers.</AbstractNarration>
