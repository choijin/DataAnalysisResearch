<AbstractNarration>The American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) proposes to hold a &lt;br/&gt;workshop addressing the issues surrounding graduate student and postdoctoral support.  This &lt;br/&gt;event is part of a series of events co-sponsored by the National Science Foundation (NSF), the &lt;br/&gt;Council of Graduate Schools (CGS), and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) designed to &lt;br/&gt;examine and improve knowledge and practice in graduate education and research training.     &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt;There are many who believe that the US is facing a critical shortage of citizens trained in &lt;br/&gt;science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields. This workshop will address &lt;br/&gt;this issue by examining the factors that lead students to pursue graduate education and &lt;br/&gt;postdoctoral training in STEM areas, focusing especially on the critical role that financial &lt;br/&gt;support and benefits play in preparing a technological workforce.   &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;AAAS will work cooperatively with the NSF Division of Graduate Education to organize a two-&lt;br/&gt;day workshop to be held at AAAS headquarters in Washington, DC on June 17-18, 2004.  The &lt;br/&gt;workshop will consider the role and impact of student financial support in promoting the &lt;br/&gt;production of more and better prepared US citizens in STEM fields.  The conference will &lt;br/&gt;examine the interplay between components of graduates student support such as mode, duration &lt;br/&gt;and amount of stipend, as well as health care and other benefits.  These elements will be &lt;br/&gt;considered in relationship to indicators of student progress such as completion rate, time to &lt;br/&gt;degree and time to first position.  The meeting will also explore the economic impacts of &lt;br/&gt;graduate and postdoctoral compensation on the research enterprise and on the domestic scientific &lt;br/&gt;labor market overall.   &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The meeting will involve one hundred participants including graduate students; postdoctoral &lt;br/&gt;researchers; STEM faculty and deans; labor economists; and representatives from industry and &lt;br/&gt;research funding organizations.  It will be held at AAAS Headquarters in downtown &lt;br/&gt;Washington, DC, for convenient access.  The information shared at this meeting, combined with &lt;br/&gt;the policy recommendations developed, will significantly advance knowledge and practice in &lt;br/&gt;graduate education.  A crucial group of stakeholders will be empowered to create and &lt;br/&gt;disseminate a set of best practices surrounding mode, duration and amount of student support. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts &lt;br/&gt;The outcome of the workshop will be a set of best-practices and identification of knowledge gaps &lt;br/&gt;to be addressed by future research on these topics.  It will also help to build a community of &lt;br/&gt;researchers, educators, and stakeholders who will maintain an ongoing dialogue in this critical &lt;br/&gt;area.  AAAS will work with NSF to disseminate these findings broadly.   &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This meeting will advance our understanding of how the many facets of graduate student support &lt;br/&gt;contribute to creating the US STEM workforce, and it will promote the leadership of a more &lt;br/&gt;knowledgeable and invested set of stakeholders.  The best practices guidelines developed at this &lt;br/&gt;meeting will be disseminated widely by the meeting organizers and participants, and will lead to &lt;br/&gt;infrastructure changes that will enhance graduate education nationwide.  The meeting will also &lt;br/&gt;address how changes in mode and amount of support may differentially affect underrepresented &lt;br/&gt;groups along racial, gender or socioeconomic lines.</AbstractNarration>
