    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0405873&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: John Loftin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A geometric structure on a manifold is a set of restricted&lt;br/&gt;coordinate charts and gluing functions. There are often partial&lt;br/&gt;differential equations which behave well with respect to these&lt;br/&gt;gluing functions, and in turn these PDEs can be used to study the&lt;br/&gt;geometric structure. Dr. Loftin will continue to apply the&lt;br/&gt;theory of Monge-Ampere equations to manifolds with geometric&lt;br/&gt;structure. In particular, the relationship between Goldman's&lt;br/&gt;Fenchel-Nielsen type coordinates on the deformation space of&lt;br/&gt;convex real projective surfaces and the holomorphic coordinates&lt;br/&gt;introduced by Loftin will be further studied. Together with Eric&lt;br/&gt;Zaslow and S.T. Yau, Dr. Loftin will study parabolic affine&lt;br/&gt;sphere metrics on certain affine manifolds with singularities.&lt;br/&gt;These metrics are degenerate real slices of the Calabi-Yau&lt;br/&gt;metrics. Yau, Zaslow, and Loftin will follow the conjecture of&lt;br/&gt;Strominger-Yau-Zaslow to relate these metrics to a larger program&lt;br/&gt;arising from string theory of understanding mirror symmetry of&lt;br/&gt;Calabi-Yau manifolds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Monge-Ampere equations have an illustrious history in&lt;br/&gt;differential geometry. Yau's celebrated theorem constructed&lt;br/&gt;important notions of distance on a large class of spaces&lt;br/&gt;(so-called Calabi-Yau manifolds) by solving a Monge-Ampere&lt;br/&gt;equation. Dr. Loftin will study Monge-Ampere equations on other&lt;br/&gt;spaces. Some of these spaces are useful in the study of string&lt;br/&gt;theory, a physical theory which proposes a unification of all the&lt;br/&gt;forces in nature. In particular, there are singular Calabi-Yau&lt;br/&gt;spaces which Dr. Loftin, together with Yau and Zaslow, will study&lt;br/&gt;in order to shed light on the physics of string theory. Also,&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Loftin will put also into practice curricular extensions in&lt;br/&gt;teaching precalculus. These extensions were developed in a&lt;br/&gt;program involving other faculty and high school teachers, in&lt;br/&gt;July, 2003, associated with Columbia University's VIGRE program.&lt;br/&gt;He will also continue to develop similar curricular extensions.</AbstractNarration>
