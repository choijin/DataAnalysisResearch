<AbstractNarration>This CAREER project investigates fundamental structure-dielectric property relationships of ceramics with the pyrochlore structure.   In particular, the research focuses on the series of Ln2(M,Nb)2O7 pyrochlore compounds (where Ln = La3+, Nd3+, Sm3+, Gd3+, Dy3+, Er3+, Yb3+ and M = Zn2+, Mg2+, Fe3+, Al3+).  Acquisition and analysis of experimental data is used to help attain a fundamental understanding of the nature of the dielectric properties of pyrochlore ceramics and their correlation with composition and crystal structure.  Specifically this project investigates: (i) the phase stability of the compounds, (ii) the relationship between cation radii and cation ordering, (iii) the relationship between cation polarizability and dielectric permittivity, and (iv) the relationship between cation ordering and high frequency dielectric properties.   This investigation will result in the development of a paradigm for compositional design of pyrochlores with optimized dielectric properties tailored for electronic applications such as capacitors, resonators and filters.  In addition, this project focuses on increasing the participation of Hispanics in the field of science and engineering of ceramic materials and on providing early exposure to ceramics research experiences for middle and high school teachers and students, as well as undergraduate engineering students.  To foster Pan-American collaboration in ceramics research and education, a series of short workshops on electronic ceramics will be organized at targeted universities in South America.  &lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;Dielectric ceramics are present in virtually every electronic application in the form of passive components such as capacitors, filters and resonators.  This CAREER project focuses on the development of new and improved dielectrics materials that are required to enable the size reduction and increased functionality that is expected of the next generation of handheld electronics and wireless communications devices.  At a local and national level, the project also focuses on increasing the participation of Hispanics in the field of science and engineering of ceramic materials and on providing early exposure to ceramics research experiences for middle and high school teachers and students, as well as undergraduate engineering students.  Internationally, a series of short workshops on electronic ceramics will be organized at targeted universities in South America to foster Pan-American collaboration in the field.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project was to attain a fundamental understanding of the structure-dielectric properties relationship in fluorite-related ceramics.  To this effect, the project yielded several key outcomes in terms of new knowledge and understanding of dielectric phenomena in these ceramics.  The highlights of these technical findings can be summarized as follows:  a) More than 50 fluorite-related compounds were synthesized and their detailed dielectric response as a function of temperature and frequency was reported with the data now part of open literature.   b) It was determined that in compounds of the type Ln3NbO7 (Ln3+ = La3+, Nd3+, and Gd3+), the dielectric relaxation temperature, where the maximum permittivity occurs, increases with decreasing NbO6 octahedral distortion.  This identified relationship implies that one can tailor the dielectric response of compounds with fluorite-related structures by controlling the crystallographic distortion of the main cation coordination octahedra in the lattice.  This constitutes a paradigm shift in how to design new dielectric ceramics. c) The temperature coefficient of capacitance of fluorite-related compounds of the type Ln3NbO7 is chiefly mediated by the ionic radius of the lanthanide (Ln) ions.  This identified relationship allows for the control of the temperature stability in the dielectric response and thus serves as a new paradigm for the development and design of new dielectric materials with desired temperature response. d) By comparative dielectric spectroscopy analysis of the dielectric responses of the synthesized compounds under this project, including Bi2Ti2O7, Bi1.5Zn0.92Nb1.5O6.92 (BZN), and Ca1.5Ti1.5Nb1.0O7 (CTN), it was determined that cation substitution is a necessary condition for the appearance of dielectric relaxation in pyrochlore compounds.  It was further demonstrated that the presence of a highly polarizable cation with lone pair electrons is neither sufficient nor necessary to induce dielectric relaxation.  The same was found in terms of atomic displacements from the high symmetry crystallographic position. This key finding resolves the debate that has been ongoing for more than 40 years on the origins of dielectric relaxation.   In terms of training, education, and dissemination activities, over the lifetime of this CAREER project, two Ph.D. students and four Masters students were graduated.  In addition, ten undergraduate students and two high school students participated in the research activities associated with the project.  Of the 16 students directly involved with the project, 6 were Hispanic and 4 female.  The PI participation in the MSE Teach programs at the University of Florida led to sharing lectures on ceramics with high school teachers across the state of Florida to share in their classrooms and thus promote STEM careers.  In addition, the PI organized and delivered International Electroceramics Workshops across the Bolivarian countries of South America, including Colombia, Peru, and Venezuela.  The total number of peer-reviewed journal publications under this CAREER program were 40.  The total number of oral and poster presentations under this CAREER program were 52.  Same as the publications, these presentations acknowledged the funding by NSF and this particular CAREER award.       Last Modified: 08/06/2013       Submitted by: Juan C Nino]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
