<AbstractNarration>AST-0407011&lt;br/&gt;Koopmann&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Numerical simulations of the growth of structure predict that the nearby universe should contain large numbers of low mass halos, which by their very nature are hard to detect.  Recent advances in the mapping capability of centimeter wave radio telescopes have enabled surveys for atomic hydrogen emitters, which are not ruled out by any other observations, but the low mass end of the resultant mass function is poorly determined and may depend on environment.  The new Arecibo L-band Feed Array (ALFA) revolutionizes the ability of the telescope to find these systems, and the planned survey will not only provide an answer to this problem but also produce an archived dataset of value to other studies.  This first phase supports the principal investigator for one year to refine the details of the collaboration with Cornell University to carry out this important work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The survey principles will be designed to maximize the scientific return, engage the broadest community of researchers, educate the next generation of students, and raise the broadest level of public interest.  Meanwhile, support for this researcher from Union College will provide increased opportunities for undergraduates to receive exposure to radio astronomy, and will assist in the development of teaching modules and visitor center displays.</AbstractNarration>
