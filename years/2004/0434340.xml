<AbstractNarration>Animal populations, such as fish and zooplankton in the oceans, and terrestrial species from bison to locusts and midges, can self-organize into schools and swarms through the interactions of individuals with each other and their environment. This project aspires to achieve a new level of understanding of the emergence of such population-level behaviors through the development, implementation, and validation of coarse-grained, systems-level numerical methods for individual-based models of collections of organisms. Systems-level tasks enabled through this computational approach include long-time predictions, stability and bifurcation analysis (which details how observed behavior depends on environmental and organism properties), control, and optimization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding aggregation behavior is of both theoretical and applied importance, for problems as diverse as fisheries management and pest control. The details of animal behavior involve individual-level dynamics that are too complicated to analyze rigorously. What is of interest, however, are the macroscopic dynamics of populations.  This project will build a tool for providing this understanding, in a systematic, flexible, and effective way. The algorithms and ideas that will be developed will also have an impact outside of biology, with potential applications in computational chemistry, materials science, and economics.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
