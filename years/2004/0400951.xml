<AbstractNarration>The main focus of the present proposal is the study of representations&lt;br/&gt;and cohomology of EI-categories - that is, categories all of whose&lt;br/&gt;endomorphisms are isomorphisms. The motivations for this proposal have&lt;br/&gt;their roots in long standing conjectures in modular representation theory as&lt;br/&gt;well as open problems in the homotopy theory of p-local groups, a certain&lt;br/&gt;type of p-complete topological spaces whose homotopy theory has been&lt;br/&gt;developed in work by Broto, Levi and Oliver.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator has recently shown that one of the most&lt;br/&gt;well-known conjectures in modular representation theory, Alperin's weight&lt;br/&gt;conjecture, (which is originally a numerical equality involving the number of &lt;br/&gt;simple modules of a p-block of a finite group), has a structural&lt;br/&gt;reformulation in terms of the cohomology of a certain functor on a suitable&lt;br/&gt;EI-category.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the directions the principal investigator proposes to explore is&lt;br/&gt;that there should be similar structural results - exploiting work of&lt;br/&gt;G. R. Robinson - regarding Dade's conjectures (which are, very roughly,&lt;br/&gt;refinements of Alperin's weight conjecture taking into account more&lt;br/&gt;subtle invariants of characters). The problem is to find the ``right"&lt;br/&gt;EI-category.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two important open problems in block theory can be formulated in a&lt;br/&gt;completely general way as ``gluing problems" of 2-cocycles of certain functors on&lt;br/&gt;appropriate categories: the question whether one can associate a&lt;br/&gt;classifying space with each p-block and the question whether the K"ulshammer-Puig&lt;br/&gt;2-cocycles on automorphism groups of centric subgroups of a block are&lt;br/&gt;the restrictions of a 2-cocycle defined on the fusion system of the&lt;br/&gt;block.&lt;br/&gt;Another recent result of the principal investigator is that there is&lt;br/&gt;a spectral sequence relating the cohomology of a functor&lt;br/&gt;on a regular EI-category to the cohomology of functors on the poset of&lt;br/&gt;isomorphism classes of objects of that category.&lt;br/&gt;This spectral sequence should be useful for addressing&lt;br/&gt;the two mentioned gluing problems; this&lt;br/&gt;is another direction the principal investigator proposes to take. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;                                   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One way to look at a - not even necessarily mathematical - object is to&lt;br/&gt;consider all maps of that object to itself which preserve its&lt;br/&gt;structure (the group of its "symmetries") and deduce from those &lt;br/&gt;maps properties of the considered object -&lt;br/&gt;this is, in a very simplified way, the general principle of&lt;br/&gt;representation&lt;br/&gt;theory. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
