    <AbstractNarration>The Soundprint Media Center will conduct planning for "Evolution Discoveries," a multi-part radio series on evolutionary science, contemporary issues and new discoveries. The project will help educate the public about the insights evolutionary science can offer current problems and issues, while at the same time help to explain basic principles of evolutionary science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Key planning activities over five months will include identifying gaps in public understanding of evolutionary science, creating a framework for the radio series and producing and testing a pilot program. They will work with an advisory group that includes museums and researchers that are studying visitor understanding of evolution -- geographically, developmentally and by gender. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They plan to develop partnerships with informal science organizations (museums, zoos, aquariums, etc.) to extend the reach of the audio material beyond those of public radio. Other components of the project include a public radio station resource guide to help establish local collaborations between stations and local scientists, museums, zoos, aquariums and others; a resource guide for teachers and a website that will complement and be compatible with other online resources such as those supported by natural history museums and the Human Genome Management Project.</AbstractNarration>
