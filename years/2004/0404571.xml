<AbstractNarration>In this project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Saykally of the University of California at Berkeley will continue his experimental and theoretical research program on the properties of water and water clusters.  Detailed studies of the translational and librational vibration-rotation-tunneling (VRT) bands of water clusters will be undertaken by means of terahertz and infrared cavity ring-down spectroscopies.  The new data, which will include translational and librational VRT bands, will be used to generate improved water dimer potential surfaces.  These, in turn, will be used to construct potentials for larger water clusters and liquid water, which will be tested against experiment with Quantum Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics methods. A similar approach will be used for the study of protonated water clusters, using terahertz velocity modulation spectroscopy and supersonic discharge plasmas.  The goal here is to elucidate details of the proton transfer dynamics, such as the dependence of proton tunneling rates on intermolecular distances and orientation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Water is the most fundamental substance on our planet, and enhancing our understanding of its nature will impact many areas of science and technology.  Water clusters have recently been detected in the earth's atmosphere, and are predicted to have important effects on its chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Graduate and undergraduate students as well as postdoctoral research associates will participate in this research.  They will thereby gain valuable experience in a forefront area of contemporary physical chemistry.  Professor Saykally will continue to be active in an outreach program through overview lectures, the popular press, and other media, as opportunities arise, to bring new developments in science to the public at large.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
