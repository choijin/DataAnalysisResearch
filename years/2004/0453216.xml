<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT 0453216&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports development of an REU Site at the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology (SDSM&amp;T) focusing upon Materials, Mechanics, and Manufacturing (3M) is proposed. The main objective of the 3M REU Site is to enhance student interest in post-graduate study. Another objective of the 3M REU Site is to improve student abilities with respect to those tools that will make them more competitive in a research environment, namely, team building, technical communication, ethics, and overall research acumen. Additional objectives are to promote minority-student exposure to cutting-edge research.  One of the targeted populations is drawn from Oglala Lakota College (OLC), a Native-American institution. Three-to-four OLC students participate in this 3M REU Site summer program on an annual basis. The second targeted student population includes SDSM&amp;T undergraduates. Three SDSM&amp;T students participate in the 3M REU 10-week summer program on an annual basis. The third category of targeted student groups is found at regional four-year institutions that do not possess a program to support undergraduate research. Three students from the regional four-year schools participate in the 3M REU summer program on an annual basis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Projects focus on cutting-edge research in materials, mechanics, and manufacturing and are led by senior SDSM&amp;T Faculty Mentors. Research projects involve freeform laser deposition, composite materials, nanomaterials/lithography, and materials selection in product design. This research draws upon existing SDSM&amp;T faculty expertise and research infrastructure, including the SDSM&amp;T Advanced Materials Processing Center and the Center for Advanced Manufacturing and Production. A detailed 3M REU-Site Assessment Plan has been developed and includes assessment components for both the summer and academic portions of the program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 3M REU Site offers the potential for significant broad impact on the Nation's human resources given the emphasis on the recruitment of Native-American students into the program. In general, many of the 3M REU students tend to be first-generation college students. Thus, the 3M Site serves both minority and other traditionally underrepresented students and encourages them to pursue post-graduate study and a career in research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
