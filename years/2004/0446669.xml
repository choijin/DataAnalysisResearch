    <AbstractNarration>Self-objectification occurs when people take a third person perspective on the self, viewing their bodies as objects (Fredrickson &amp; Roberts, 1997). Previous research has shown that when women are in a state of self-objectification, they perform worse on a standardized math test (Fredrickson, Roberts, Noll, Quinn, &amp; Twenge, 1998). The research proposed in this grant will integrate work on self-awareness theory (Duval &amp; Wicklund, 1972) with self-objectification processes to explicate the mechanisms by which self-objectification disrupts performance. Specifically, self-awareness theory contends that there are two non-overlapping states of self: objective self-awareness, when a person's attention is focused on the self (one's values, beliefs, appearance), and subjective self-awareness, when attention is focused on things external to the self (tasks, other people). By converging these theoretical viewpoints, the proposed research can identify a primary means by which self-objectification interferes with performance - through a prolonged state of objective self-awareness. Study 1 examines whether objective self-awareness mediates the effect of an experimentally induced state of self-objectification on attentional resources. Participants will be asked to try on an item of clothing that either will induce self-objectification (a swimsuit) or not (a sweater), and then they will complete a measure of objective self-awareness and a reaction time task. Hypothesized findings are that women experiencing self-objectification will be slower on the reaction time task, and this slowness will be due to an increased focus on the self at the expense of the task. Study 2 examines whether people who are high in trait level self-objectification are prone to prolonged states of objective self-awareness that disrupt task performance and engagement. Participants who score in the top and bottom third of a trait self-objectification measure will come to the lab to complete an engaging task (a computer game). Half will be subtly made objectively self-aware by having a mirror in the room. We hypothesize that people high in trait self-objectification who are made self-aware will be unable to concentrate on the game and will report less enjoyment as well as lower performance. By revealing the mechanism by which self-objectification disrupts performance, this research has the potential to broaden the participation and achievement of women in educational and professional settings.</AbstractNarration>
