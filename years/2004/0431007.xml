<AbstractNarration>The P.I. proposed to provide middle school science teachers in the Pittsburgh region a professional development program that would focus on the effective us of technology to creatively support the standard curriculum in science and mathematics. It would contain elements of outreach and awareness intended to promote the participation of underserved populations in science and engineering.  The program would last five days and be an intensive hands-on workshop designed to increase teachers' knowledge of technology tools such as CBLs and CBRs (sensors and probes for automatic data collection with graphing calculators) and encourage more effective use of these tools.  It was expected the program would raise teacher's awareness of their role in shaping and encouraging the next generation of scientists to achieve full participation in science and technology programs. Follow on activities would be held during the school year that would give teachers an opportunity to share gender equity issues and technology knowledge with colleagues who were not participants in the summer session.  Follow up activities were planned for the remainder of the award year.</AbstractNarration>
