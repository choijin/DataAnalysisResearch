<AbstractNarration>The purpose of the North Carolina Alliance to Create Opportunity through Education (OPT-ED) AGEP is to substantially enhance efforts in North Carolina to increase the number of underrepresented minority (URM) students receiving PhD degrees and ultimately entering the professoriate in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. The proposed AGEP project combines two existing Minority Graduate Education (MGE) projects at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNCCH) and jointly at North Carolina State University (NCSU) and North Carolina A&amp;T State University (NC A&amp;T). Immediately after the MGE grants were awarded, the three schools formed an alliance; one year later, formed a formal network that included all NSF-HRD supported URM initiative projects in North Carolina: the Louis Stokes Alliance Minority Participation Program, the Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and Centers for Research Excellence in Science and Technology, in addition to the North Carolina Math Science Education Network, a K-12 program with sites at college campuses across the state. Thus, OPT-ED is the formal alliance of the three institutions under one program and the building and strengthening of the collaborative network or alliance among NSF-supported URM initiative projects in the state.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit. OPT-ED.s strength and uniqueness is its incorporation of NSF URM initiative&lt;br/&gt;programs in North Carolina into a broader alliance to form student pathways to the PhD degree and the professoriate. OPT-ED and its network partners recognize that STEM PhDs are not the result of graduate programs alone, but are fashioned from the intellectual building blocks that occur in middle and high school. The logic behind the development of OPT-ED stems from the conceptualization that the connecting of programs with common goals, to advance the participation of URM students in STEM fields would strengthen this effort in a much broader fashion. The key is the participation of programs from the education spectrum ranging from middle school to PhD programs. This in itself is a unique development. This framework allows a clear pathway to be evident in that students in the middle school program can receive guidance and support all the way through to the completion of the PhD. These connections will enhance the possibility of students continuing to receive encouragement, reinforcement, and expanded research experiences that will increase their successfully pursuing STEM graduate degrees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts. Through integrating the resources of all NSF-HRD (and ultimately other) diversity&lt;br/&gt;programs in the state, OPT-ED will have a broad impact across several educational levels, the state of North Carolina, the Southeast and, with the eventual production of PhD recipients, the nation. Thus, OPTED will serve as a comprehensive project for recruiting, mentoring, and graduating URM students in STEM PhD programs, and to carry out strategies to identify and broadly support URM students who want to pursue graduate studies and careers. The norms of inclusiveness at the AGEP institutions and the relationships that have been forged in Phase I and will be strengthened in Phase II will endure well past the termination of grant support. Given its goals and objectives, this alliance and the expected expansion of network programs will continue to work in partnership to provide URM students with opportunities to pursue PhD degrees and prepare for the professoriate well into the future.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ AGEP Collaborative Research Training: North Carolina Alliance to Create Opportunity Through Education (NC OPT-ED)  A Collaborative Project Outcomes Report  NC OPT-ED is an alliance among the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, North Carolina State University and North Carolina A&amp;T State University. The strength and uniqueness of this network is its incorporation of diversity programs throughout North Carolina into a broader alliance to form student pathways to the PhD degree and the professoriate.  NC OPT-ED and its network partners recognize that STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) PhDÆs are not the result of graduate programs alone but are enhanced by participation in programs from the education spectrum ranging from middle school to the PhD.  This framework allows a clear pathway to be evident in that students in the middle school program can receive guidance and support all the way through to the completion of the PhD.   With this collaborative approach, each alliance university provided both common and unique contributions as well as overarching activities. Examples included:  Crosstalks were designed to provide a forum for graduate students within the alliance and across the state to network and discuss issues of importance in their graduate education (807 attendees since 2006).   Alliance Day was a statewide conference for students from middle school through graduate school, that provided participants the opportunity to network, present research, and attend professional development workshops (5997+ attendees since 2005).   Mentoring Workshop for Faculty was a seminar in which faculty, staff and students from institutions across NC participated.  The objective was to raise knowledge levels and share best practices related to the mentor/mentee relationship (251 attendees since 2006). Summer Research Programs for undergraduate students were offered by each institution, where NC OPT-ED Alliance partner institutions were targeted for recruitment.  UNC-CH: Summer Pre-Graduate Research Experience     (SPGRE) was a 10-week, full-time research experience for STEM and SBE (800+ participants since 1988). NCSU: Summer Research Experience (SRE) is a 10-week, full-time research experience (200+ participants since 2000) NC A&amp;T:  Summer Research Initiative provided financial support to graduates students in STEM disciplines to engage in faculty-supervised research from May to July (61+ participants since 2005).    In addition to the collaborative activities, each alliance university had a focus that was specific to the students  (AGEP Fellows) at their respective institutions.  Institution-specific impact is as follows:  UNC-CH approximately 85% of the AGEP undergraduates have enrolled in doctoral programs and approximately 135 doctoral students have received AGEP research assistantships. Of those doctoral students, over 40 have completed the PhD. The AGEP Fellow PhD graduation rate of 80% is nearly 20% higher than the university average.   NCSU 239 undergraduates participated in summer and academic year mentored research experiences and 64 graduate students participated in graduate school preparation and research programs for those at transitional stages in their education  (between their bachelor's and master's, or between their master's and doctoral degree). Although NCSUÆs AGEP program components over the past 12 years have focused primarily on preparing undergraduates for graduate school, 41 participants have received PhDÆs and 71 have been awarded masterÆs degrees. The majority of those who graduated have achieved successful careers in STEM, with 11 currently in the professoriate.  NC A&amp;T supported approximately 285 students during the tenure of OPT-ED, including 232 African American mastersÆ students and 35 African American doctoral students. NC A&amp;T awarded doctoral degrees in engineering to 17 of its AGEP students.  An additional 21 AGEP doctoral candidates are in the process of com...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
