<AbstractNarration>0438582&lt;br/&gt;Cox&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is to the University of North Florida to support the activity described below for 36 months.  The proposal was submitted in response to the Partnerships for Innovation Program Solicitation (NSF-04556).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Partners&lt;br/&gt;The partners include University of North Florida (Lead Institution), Armor Holdings, Dura Automotive, Florida Machine Works, Predator Products, The Ronco Group, Lorenz Surgical, Cornerstone Regional Development Partnership, Fresh Ministries, and First Coast Manufacturers Association.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary objectives are to establish a Manufacturing Innovation Partnership (MIP) Program with two primary goals: (1) to develop a shared design and manufacturing center providing resources for the local manufacturing and design companies to aid in the economic and technical development of the Northeast Florida Region, also referred to as Florida's First Coast, and (2) to improve the technical education and preparation of the future workforce in the region. The focus of the MIP Program with the shared design and manufacturing resource center is to create an environment that fosters innovations in current and new products, processes, and/or systems through project-centered manufacturing and design activities of mutual benefit to regional industry and academia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Potential Economic Impact&lt;br/&gt;The activity will create a more competitive, prosperous company in the region in a stronger position to create high-technology jobs. In turn, the experiences gained by the student participants in the MIP Program create another broader impact of a more scientifically and technologically literate workforce trained with relevance to industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the project will result from creating an environment that fosters innovations in current and new products, processes, and/or systems through project-centered manufacturing and design activities of mutual benefit to regional industry and academia. The outcomes of the project-centered activities are in the areas of design and manufacturing that increase the competitiveness of the partner company through innovation. Of primary significance is that the majority of the company sites that participate in areas of common interest are likely to be small with less than 50 employees. Small companies often lack the staff and resources to develop advanced design and manufacturing solutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the activity concentrate on catalyzing the growth and success of manufacturing companies in the region. Workforce development, including connections and mentorship programs at the high school level should help with workforce and diversity issues. The partnership seeks to attract and retain engineering students to serve the local economy, with particular focus on inner city high schools. The extensive assessment metrics are important and necessary for sustainability and for application of innovation transfer processes in other areas.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
