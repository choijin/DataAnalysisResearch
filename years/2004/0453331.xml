    <AbstractNarration>The Plant Genome Research Program at the Boyce Thompson Institute and Cornell University will provide ten-week summer internships for twelve undergraduate students each year. The laboratories involved in hosting this REU Site are at the forefront of plant molecular biology research, contributing to the latest advances in genomics, quantitative genetics, proteomics, metabolite profiling, plant transformation, and other scientific methods. Basic and applied research projects in the program laboratories include studying plant defense against pathogens and insects, biosynthesis of primary and secondary metabolites, phosphate uptake, metal tolerance, light perception, seed dormancy, and chloroplast function. These projects incorporate not only important crops such as maize, wheat, rice, tomato, melon, and pepper, but also genetic model plants such as Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, a single-celled alga, and the small crucifer Arabidopsis thaliana. Summer interns will work on supervised independent projects within the framework of their mentor's research program. Other educational opportunities will include weekly lectures, student presentations and a research symposium at the end of the summer. In addition, two half-day discussion forums will focus on ethical issues that students will almost certainly encounter in the course of their scientific careers. The complete ten-week Plant Genome Research internship will serve to introduce undergraduates to plant molecular biology research and encourage them to pursue graduate degrees and future careers in this field. Students who are admitted to the program will be supplied with a stipend, housing, meals and airfare. Under-represented minorities and students from colleges with limited research opportunities are particularly encouraged to apply.
