<AbstractNarration>This proposal has two parts.  The part on stochastic networks will &lt;br/&gt;consider networks of queues in heavy traffic when tasks have due dates.  &lt;br/&gt;The lead times (time until due date) of these tasks are modeled as &lt;br/&gt;counting measures on the real line.  As part of a previous project, the &lt;br/&gt;limit of these measure-valued processes was identified as the network &lt;br/&gt;traffic intensity approached one.  This project will identify the &lt;br/&gt;difference between the limiting measure-valued process and the pre-limit &lt;br/&gt;processes, so that the accuracy of using the limiting process as a model &lt;br/&gt;for a heavily loaded network can be determined.  The second part of the &lt;br/&gt;proposal treats credit risk in financial markets.  Of particular interest &lt;br/&gt;is the spread movements of tranches of collaterialized loan obligations.  &lt;br/&gt;These respond to market expectations concerning the default probabilities &lt;br/&gt;of the loans composing the structure, but in a highly nonlinear way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Computer networks, manufacturing networks and telephone networks have the &lt;br/&gt;common feature that tasks (e.g., messages, silicon wafers, telephone &lt;br/&gt;calls) arrive at stations (e.g., computers,, machines, switches) at random &lt;br/&gt;times and require random amounts of service.  Under heavy traffic &lt;br/&gt;conditions, the performance of these networks can be analyzed using the &lt;br/&gt;theory of Brownian motion.  In this project, we consider networks in which &lt;br/&gt;tasks arrive and must move through and exit the network ahead &lt;br/&gt;of deadlines.  This project will develop a method to determine what &lt;br/&gt;proportion of tasks a network will process within their deadlines.  &lt;br/&gt;Brownian motion is also the fundamental process for building models of the &lt;br/&gt;behavior of prices in financial markets.  A second part of this proposal &lt;br/&gt;will consider prices of financial assets that are backed by loan &lt;br/&gt;payments (e.g., mortgage-backed securities).  These assets are &lt;br/&gt;sensitive to the credit risk of the loans backing them.  Construction of &lt;br/&gt;reliable models for the price movements of these assets is an important &lt;br/&gt;step in measuring and controlling the risk associated with holding &lt;br/&gt;and trading these securities. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
