<AbstractNarration>The proposer will continue his study of the longstanding Kadison--Ringrose&lt;br/&gt;conjecture on the cohomology of von Neumann algebras. He will use and &lt;br/&gt;refine some recently developed techniques needed to show the complete &lt;br/&gt;boundedness of certain multilinear operators. Investigations of the cohomology&lt;br/&gt;groups have led naturally to the recently introduced concept of norming &lt;br/&gt;subalgebras, and this topic will be pursued since it applies directly to &lt;br/&gt;both cohomology and the bounded projection problem. In a different, but &lt;br/&gt;related, direction, maximal abelian subalgebras (masas) and general &lt;br/&gt;subalgebras of von Neumann algebras will be studied. In joint work, the &lt;br/&gt;proposer has introduced the concept of strongly singular masas, and has &lt;br/&gt;shown that many finite factors arising from hyperbolic groups (a class &lt;br/&gt;which includes the free groups) have such masas. The results so far &lt;br/&gt;obtained indicate that the theory can now expand to study general &lt;br/&gt;subalgebras. This relates directly to the structure of factors (the &lt;br/&gt;building blocks of operator algebras), and the overall goal of these &lt;br/&gt;proposed areas of research is to increase our understanding in this area. &lt;br/&gt;Building on previously accomplished work, problems in the theory of &lt;br/&gt;topological entropy for automorphisms will be studied. Automorphisms are &lt;br/&gt;the most basic objects associated to operator algebras, and they can &lt;br/&gt;reveal different facets of the same underlying object. The entropy is a &lt;br/&gt;numerical constant that distinguishes different automorphisms.&lt;br/&gt;Previous joint work of the proposer showed that the current theory, based &lt;br/&gt;on completely positive maps, can be better reformulated in terms of &lt;br/&gt;complete contractions. This puts the theory into a much more flexible &lt;br/&gt;situation where more general and powerful tools can be brought to bear on the &lt;br/&gt;problems of the field, notably relating to crossed products by &lt;br/&gt;automorphism groups.&lt;br/&gt;                                                                                &lt;br/&gt;  The modern study of operator algebras has evolved from two main sources. &lt;br/&gt;Matrices, which are generalizations of numbers, were introduced to solve &lt;br/&gt;equations and now find applications from computer graphics to search &lt;br/&gt;engines for the web. In formulating quantum mechanics mathematically, von &lt;br/&gt;Neumann found that he needed infinite dimensional versions of matrices &lt;br/&gt;called linear operators which were best studied in operator algebras. &lt;br/&gt;Moreover the time evolution of quantum mechanical systems came to be &lt;br/&gt;expressed in terms of the crossed product by groups of automorphisms, and &lt;br/&gt;here topological entropy plays an important role. The project is mainly &lt;br/&gt;concerned with the theoretical underpinnings of operator algebras, but &lt;br/&gt;the proposed work in these areas could impact some of these more concrete &lt;br/&gt;areas, since the finite factors are those operator algebras which most &lt;br/&gt;closely model matrices.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
