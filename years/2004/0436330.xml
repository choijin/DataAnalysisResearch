<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: Technological innovation has caused a renaissance in both biology and mathematics. The discovery of proteomics and microarrays and the deciphering of genomes has changed the types of information biologists collect and analyze. Concurrent advances in analytical techniques and computational capabilities enable researchers to explore hypotheses and evaluate conclusions with unprecedented power. To use this information there is the need to train and equip the next generation of scientists with interdisciplinary tools to both intellectually synthesize mathematical models and implement and understand technology driven data acquisition. It is also necessary to impart an appreciation of research culture early, and often, in undergraduate education. Further, academic excellence requires combining various points of view and the ability to work among diverse cultural and ethnic populations. It is in this spirit that this project is initiating interdisciplinary training for mathematics and biology majors. This program integrates interdisciplinary courses in mathematics and biology with multi-year research projects. The training program involves eight faculty mentors from the Departments of Biology and Mathematics and Statistics who provide teaching and research training linked to interdisciplinary research in biology and mathematics. The project combines the strength of the university's biology and mathematics faculty with the university's commitments to diversity, undergraduate research and interdisciplinary studies. The integrated, research-based curriculum includes Calculus for Life Science Students, College Biology, a Mathematical Biology and Ecology course, and a Seminar series on how Biology and Mathematics combine to examine hypotheses and analyze data in contemporary interdisciplinary studies. Thus, the curriculum includes courses that offer entry points for students from diverse backgrounds with differing knowledge of biology and mathematics. The program delivers significant extracurricular experiences that ensure breadth of knowledge and prepare trainees for advanced studies. A capstone course ensures that students have the opportunity to rigorously and thoroughly analyze their data, prepare manuscripts, and present papers at annual symposia. Student retention is enhanced by following practices demonstrated by the American Sociological Association to enhance retention, graduation and professional study.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The training program is designed to enhance overall educational quality, rigor and diversity by identifying and training students early in the pipeline. An exceptional aspect of the program is the four-year mentoring relationship being fostered. Curriculum and research projects are integrated into the development and critical evaluation of student research proposals to help students develop ample research expertise at the undergraduate level. Activities of the training program are being broadly disseminated via the UBM program website. At the university level, the program strengthens collaboration among biology and mathematics and statistics departments in both teaching and research.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
