<AbstractNarration>San Jacinto College (an Hispanic-serving institution), NASA-Johnson Space Center, and their partners propose a three-year comprehensive project targeting middle grades science, mathematics and technology teachers and students.  The National Middle School Aerospace Scholars Program (NaMAS) will increase opportunities for teachers and students in eight states to learn about and experience Information Technology as utilized in the aerospace industry. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Many students and teachers have limited opportunities to learn about and experience IT.  Two dramatic events of 2004 -- the Mars rover mission and the President's space agenda speech -- captured the imagination of America's youth, making this an ideal time to use space exploration as a hook for technology education.  NaMAS provides a way to leverage this excitement. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;One hundred and fifty teachers will each receive 120 hours of professional development and mentoring in IT concepts, skills, applications and pedagogical strategies, all tied to state/national standards.  More than 18,000 students will be impacted and approximately 1,500 middle grade students will receive additional instruction through a summer robotics experience.   Working in pairs, teachers will participate in four workshops (three at the Johnson Space Center and one online) and facilitate two distance learning events at their schools; they will then integrate their experiences with their classroom instruction.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This broadly disseminated, extensively evaluated project will increase teacher and student understanding of STEM activities and careers.  The project will also enhance diversity by specifically targeting schools with high numbers of underrepresented students.   The ultimate benefit to society is a more knowledgable and capable workforce that will help ensure a healthy economy and an enhanced quality of life.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
