<AbstractNarration>This project evaluates a system for preparing individuals from rural environments for success in computer science.  Moving from a rural setting to a large, public university can be very intimidating and a recipe for failure.  Charleston Southern University, with small classes and individual attention, provides an excellent environment for students to succeed.  However, even a bright student, in small school setting, needs a support system and a planned program to fill-in educational gaps left by some rural, secondary education programs.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Fifty-one, economically disadvantaged students participate in a foundation-building process. University applicants from rural areas who are in the top quarter of their graduating class or who meet specific SAT requirements are being screened and selected with women, minorities and those with disabilities being encouraged to apply. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each summer, prior to the academic years, students take special summer classes or participate in research or an internship. During the summer, the scholarship pays tuition for the courses, and the university provides an additional scholarship for room and board.  The summer courses allow the students to form a bond among themselves and with the mathematics and computer science faculty.  First year students take a mathematics course and a computer science, problem-solving course in the summer. During subsequent summers, second and third year students take a cognate course and act as mentors to the next cohort.  Prior to their final year, students participate in an internship at a local company or act as a research assistant.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Undergraduate teaching assistants are available in all laboratories.  The Student Success Center provides a study hall environment with tutors and monitors progress in other academic areas.  A freshman seminar provides a forum to work with students through difficulties in their transition to college.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Overall effectiveness is being measured by comparing cohort members with past enrollment and graduate data.  Exit interviews and post-graduation questionnaires are being performed. Employers of graduates and interns are also being solicited for comments.  The results of the program are being published in an appropriate venue such as an ACM regional or SIGCSE conference. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students, bolstered by the proposed system, have a firm foundation in computer science.  Graduates, who otherwise would be unable to either develop the necessary critical thinking skills or afford a bachelor's degree, are strengthening the nation's computer infrastructure.  Many bright individuals live in rural environments but lack the educational system to prepare them for college.   With support, these individuals can ASPIRE to become tomorrow's technology leaders.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
