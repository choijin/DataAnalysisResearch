<AbstractNarration>3D Scene Digitization  A Novel Invariant Approach for&lt;br/&gt;Large-Scale Environment Capture&lt;br/&gt;Daniel G. Aliaga, Mireille Boutin, Carl Cowen&lt;br/&gt;Purdue University&lt;br/&gt;The simulation of large real-world environments is a core challenge of computing technology&lt;br/&gt;today. Applications are numerous and diverse. For example, it would enable students to pay virtual&lt;br/&gt;visits to famous historical sites such as museums, temples, battlefields, and distant cities; civil&lt;br/&gt;engineers to capture buildings and compare them to the original design or to simulations (e.g., to&lt;br/&gt;compare as-built models and simulated models before and after a catastrophe); archeologists to&lt;br/&gt;virtually preserve complex excavation sites such as trenches as they evolve over time; soldiers and fire&lt;br/&gt;fighters to train in simulated environments; real estate agents to show buyers the interiors of homes;&lt;br/&gt;and, people all over the world to enjoy virtual travel or multi-player 3D games.&lt;br/&gt;Despite tremendous increases in computational power and storage space, current acquisition&lt;br/&gt;methods perform quite poorly. Even for small scenes, they usually fail to adequately capture many&lt;br/&gt;details. Manually created models, although popular, are extremely time-consuming and rendered&lt;br/&gt;images are poor representations of reality. Alternatively, image-based modeling and rendering,&lt;br/&gt;produces photorealistic images but only in the context of small and/or diffuse environments seen from&lt;br/&gt;a limited range of viewpoints (e.g., QuickTime VR). Similarly, approaches which focus on recreating&lt;br/&gt;the geometry of the scene such as the reconstruction methods developed in computer vision or the&lt;br/&gt;laser-scanning approaches struggle with complex occlusions, specular surfaces and large data sets.&lt;br/&gt;The research objective of this proposal is thus to develop the algorithms needed to capture and&lt;br/&gt;manipulate visually rich computer models of large and complex real-world scenes. The proposal&lt;br/&gt;attacks this research problem with a new hybrid method combining both geometric and photometric&lt;br/&gt;information contained in the scene. More precisely, the approach captures a 3D environment by&lt;br/&gt;densely sampling the space of viewpoints and uses this redundant data set to extract accurate models&lt;br/&gt;of the surface geometry and the reflectance properties of the scene. This is in contrast with most&lt;br/&gt;current approaches where one acquires a sparse set of data and uses methods to interpolate missing&lt;br/&gt;information. The work replaces interpolation by the easier tasks of semi-automatic platform&lt;br/&gt;navigation, data filtering, and working-set management. The key is the development of highly&lt;br/&gt;effective mathematical data processing techniques.&lt;br/&gt;The main research contribution of the proposed approach is the merging of expertise from the&lt;br/&gt;Mathematical and Computer Sciences to solve a difficult problem in computing technology today. In&lt;br/&gt;particular, the research makes use of a novel geometry reconstruction method based on Lie group&lt;br/&gt;theory which was recently developed by one of the co-PIs. This method uses a set of invariants of a&lt;br/&gt;group action to eliminate a number of superfluous unknowns normally included in the 3D&lt;br/&gt;reconstruction problem. These superfluous unknowns are exactly the ones that make the&lt;br/&gt;reconstruction equations nonlinear. By removing them, the method ends up with a simple set of sparse&lt;br/&gt;linear equations involving a minimum number of unknowns which can be solved sequentially. This&lt;br/&gt;allows the project to quickly and robustly extract the geometric (and photometric) information of large&lt;br/&gt;data sets and reconstruct large 3D environments.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will have impact beyond the immediate reconstruction results. Never&lt;br/&gt;before have researchers had access to such large and dense samplings of environments. Aside from&lt;br/&gt;publications and making all software available, the research project will create a public repository to&lt;br/&gt;store models for subsequent study (e.g., historically significant locations). The impact of the proposed&lt;br/&gt;work is not an incrementally better method for capturing environments, but a bold new approach that&lt;br/&gt;can significantly change how people think about computer simulation of large environments.</AbstractNarration>
