<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;The QEM Network will provide technical assistance to grantee and potential grantee institutions to the Foundation's HBCU-UP Program.  Technical assistance will focus on efforts to: (1) enhance the success of potential grantees in securing HBCU-UP support; (2) ensure that newly-funded HBCU-UP projects get off to a strong start; and (3) encourage linkages between and among HBCU-UP Projects as well as linkages to other NSF- funded initiatives.  To help further the overall goal of the HBCU-UP Program, QEM will conduct proposal development workshops; provide on-site technical assistance; conduct special workshops focused on the key components of the HBCU-UP Program; and facilitate communications between and among HBCU-UP grantees as well as with other NSF-funded projects.  QEM will plan and conduct a special two-day faculty workshop during year two that is focused on information, resources, and strategies that support the professional development of undergraduate students majoring in STEM disciplines at HBCU-UP grantee institutions.  QEM also will plan and conduct a two-day STEM faculty development workshop in year three for HBCU-UP multi-year grantee institutions that will focus on research opportunities for faculty, including opportunities at major NSF-funded Research Centers; curricula and pedagogy with an emphasis on the integration of research and teaching; and effective student mentoring. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit. &lt;br/&gt;QEM has a successful track record in the conduct and outcome of proposal development workshops. It also has successfully implemented a series of scholarly productivity workshops for faculty at HBCUs and minority-serving institutions that will inform the content of the Student Professional Development Workshop for Faculty and the Faculty Development Workshop.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact. The project will not only reach the total pool of HBCU-UP grantees, it will increase understanding of the HBCU-UP guidelines and NSF application and reporting procedures among HBCUs; improve the quality of STEM curricula, instruction, research opportunities, and student advising/mentoring at HBCUs; strengthen the implementation of HBCU-UP funded projects; and facilitate linkages between HBCUs and NSF-funded Centers. Materials developed through the Project will be widely disseminated to faculty on all HBCU campuses and will be made available at QEM's website. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
