<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;Michael Caterino&lt;br/&gt;DEB 0447694&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This CAREERS project, based at the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History,&lt;br/&gt;will build a foundation for synthetic study of the rich beetle fauna of the&lt;br/&gt;California Floristic Province. It will establish the PI as one of a very&lt;br/&gt;small number of arthropod biodiversity specialists of this increasingly&lt;br/&gt;imperiled region. Focusing on the southern Californian Transverse Ranges,&lt;br/&gt;this project integrates field-based inventory work, DNA-based studies of&lt;br/&gt;geographic variation, and a cutting edge bioinformatics platform to develop&lt;br/&gt;a uniquely deep understanding of the area's biodiversity. The California&lt;br/&gt;Floristic Province is an internationally recognized biodiversity hotspot,&lt;br/&gt;yet its most diverse inhabitants, beetles and other arthropods, remain very&lt;br/&gt;poorly known. This project will discover hundreds of undescribed beetle&lt;br/&gt;species, will reveal the extent of genetic diversity across the region, and&lt;br/&gt;will document the distributions of thousands of species in unprecedented&lt;br/&gt;detail. The data developed through this study will have far-reaching&lt;br/&gt;application. The region has long been recognized as an important natural&lt;br/&gt;laboratory for studying evolution, providing important insights into the&lt;br/&gt;process of speciation. But these studies have been taxonomically limited.&lt;br/&gt;Expanding on this body of work through studies of regional beetles will&lt;br/&gt;allow real generalizations to be made about these processes. Additionally,&lt;br/&gt;despite their ecological significance, invertebrates have received little&lt;br/&gt;consideration in land use management in the region, due principally to a&lt;br/&gt;lack of applicable and accessible data. This project will produce this data&lt;br/&gt;and an online system for accessing it.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Promoting knowledge and appreciation of insect biodiversity in the region is&lt;br/&gt;one of the project's primary goals. Students at high school, undergraduate,&lt;br/&gt;and postdoctoral levels will be directly involved in the research. They will&lt;br/&gt;gain experience in field biology, modern molecular systematics techniques,&lt;br/&gt;and bioinformatics methodology. All project personnel will share findings&lt;br/&gt;through public presentations at the Museum, through professional&lt;br/&gt;presentations at international conferences, and through an attractive,&lt;br/&gt;user-friendly project web site. The web site will provide the primary portal&lt;br/&gt;for direct access to project data. The underlying database will house&lt;br/&gt;thousands of georeferenced specimen records, enabling GIS-based mapping  and&lt;br/&gt;distributional analyses. These data will also be accessible to automated&lt;br/&gt;queries from remote servers assembling a global biodiversity data&lt;br/&gt;architecture. For general users the web site will provide access to natural&lt;br/&gt;history information and photographs of many species they may find in the&lt;br/&gt;area. Special effort will be also made to make this information readily&lt;br/&gt;useful by primary school students and educators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
