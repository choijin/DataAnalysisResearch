<AbstractNarration>Microelectromechanical  systems (MEMS) have been developed into numerous physical sensors. While individual sensors have demonstrated the viability of the technology, many applications require arrays of many different sensors.  Development of efficient methods to monitor  resonant sensor arrays is proposed including the integration of the monitoring system with micromechanical sensor arrays. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Microsystems  for monitoring temperature, pressure, acceleration,  rotation, stress, chemicals, biological agents and other physical parameters have been developed. Often information for more than one parameter or single parameters at numerous locations is required. A method to probe numerous sensors simultaneously will be developed. The method is based on energy absorption of resonant sensing circuits. Energy absorption techniques are well known in spectroscopy but have not been applied to sensor arrays. Rather than look at the energy emission and  absorption  of  atomic  transitions  in  materials,  energy  absorption  of  sensing  arrays  will  be investigated using similar techniques.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The  sensor  that  will  initially  be  integrated  into  the  sensing  system  will  be  the  flexural plate resonator. This sensor was chosen because it has been demonstrated for both chemical and biological agents, operates in liquid and vapor environments, has resonant frequencies in the megahertz range  and can be easily microfabricated using standard techniques. The resonant sensor will be manufactured to have a resonant frequency that is within the electrical absorption &lt;br/&gt;frequencies of an inductor-capacitor  circuit. Electrical energy will inductively  couple into the electrical circuit and drive the sensor into resonance. The absorption of the electrical and mechanical  energy  will  effectively  change  the  impedance  of  the  driving  circuit,  the  maximum change being at the mechanical resonance of the sensor. The resonant frequency will vary with changes in the mass and stresses of the structure. This is made sensitive to different agents by coating  the  resonant  surface  with  thin  film  sorption  layers.  Combining  numerous  sensors  will create an  absorption spectrum that can be used to monitor resonances by  FM spectroscopy techniques. The system  will sweep the frequency and lock to each resonance,  record the value then continue the sweep to the next resonance, much like the scan button on car radios. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The  intellectual  merit of this research is the development of wireless sensor interrogation technology and the application of these technologies to interdisciplinary problems that  require  sensors.  The  goal  of  this  research  is  to  develop  a  wireless  telemetry  system  for remotely interrogating arrays of resonant MEMS sensors based on the  absorption of electrical energy through inductive coupling. These sensors and sensing system would have applications as chemical vapor and biochemical detectors, as well as strain, humidity, pressure and acceleration sensors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader  impact of this research is the continued integration of sensor technology with microelectromechanical systems and radio frequency identification. This work will lay the foundation to create  a  system that will passively monitor parameters,  store the information through  electrical  or mechanical means  and  transmit  the  data when  probed.  This  research  will increase the investigators knowledge base and expertise in system performance assessment, and this research will also impact the education of both graduate and undergraduate students through the  respective  university  curriculum  and  student  research  programs.    The  multi-disciplinary features  of  this  research  will  require  graduate  students  of  mechanical,  electrical  and  chemical engineering to interact to solve the stated problem.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
