<AbstractNarration>The award will provide partial financial support for six emerging scientists to travel to the Fourth International Symposium on Radiative Transport in Istanbul. Each invitee will be expected to participate fully in the Symposium, submitting some aspect of their research activity for review and presentation.  The Symposium is the only global venue for discussion of challenging issues related to radiative transport and will offer a significant opportunity for young scientists to establish research relationships with colleagues abroad. As such, it provides a unique opportunity for teaching, training, and learning for young investigators just entering the field.  Priority for awards will be given to post-doctoral investigators and to doctoral students, followed by pre-tenure faculty. The PI's will make a strong effort to identify individuals that will broaden the base of participation by under-represented groups.  Because results presented at the International Symposia are published and widely cited in the radiation community, young scientists supported under this proposal are exposed to the most contemporary, highest quality research in the field; Technological advances often draw on expertise in radiation transfer to improve world conditions. Participation of young scientists in such a forum provides continuity to the knowledge base, as well as inspiring new technology that has the potential to improve society.  This award has been funded by the Thermal Transport and Thermal Processing of the Chemical and Transport Systems Division.</AbstractNarration>
