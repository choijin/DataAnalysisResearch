<AbstractNarration>This project is a continuation of a previously and currently successful CSEMS program at Arizona State University. The project implements a comprehensive mentor driven scholarship program that significantly improves the retention, graduation, and placement of low income lower division students majoring in CSEM disciplines; e.g. computer science, computer technology, engineering, engineering technology, and mathematics. The program makes use of existing services made possible by the Arizona State University (ASU) SUMS Institute. &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Selected students participate in a variety of mentor-supervised activities designed to insure success in their undergraduate studies and successful transition from their undergraduate environment into graduate school and/or industry. The program builds on an extensive track record established by the ASU SUMS Institute in managing such programs. This includes two prior CSEMS programs; one aimed at incoming freshmen and lower division students; the other aimed at juniors and seniors. These programs provide the project directors with extensive knowledge - knowledge that serves as the basis for the program.&lt;br/&gt;The program selects a total of 30 lower division students to receive CSEMS scholarships each year. Twenty of the selected students are  incoming freshmen. The incoming freshmen participate in a summer bridge program where they enroll in either calculus (8 weeks) or pre-calculus (5 weeks).  This bridge program assists the students in their transition to the university environment. An additional ten students, already enrolled, lower division ASU students will also be selected to receive CSEMS scholarships. &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: As the students transition from lower division to upper division, efforts are made by the project directors to assist in the transition of capable students to funded faculty-directed research projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
