    <AbstractNarration>Sacker&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator and colleagues organize an international conference on&lt;br/&gt;difference equations. This conference, ninth in a sequence, is tbe first&lt;br/&gt;one with a mathematical biology theme. The meeting brings together both&lt;br/&gt;experts and novices in the theory and application of difference equations,&lt;br/&gt;and experts in mathematical modeling of biological systems. In addition to&lt;br/&gt;presenting new results, they explore the role of difference equations in&lt;br/&gt;modeling biological phenomena and the advances in difference equation&lt;br/&gt;theory stimulated by biological models. The conference features 14 plenary&lt;br/&gt;talks and about 40 shorter talks. Topics covered include population&lt;br/&gt;biology, population genetics, mathematical ecology, epidemiology,&lt;br/&gt;asymptotic behavior, stability, and complex nonlinear dynamics including&lt;br/&gt;chaos. Using the successful model implemented at the Society of&lt;br/&gt;Mathematical Biology conferences, the meeting includes a mentoring program&lt;br/&gt;for student and postdoc participants. Special efforts are made to recruit&lt;br/&gt;a diversity of participants from under-represented groups. Proceedings of&lt;br/&gt;the conference, including a session on future directions, are published. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Difference equations are apparently simple ways to describe the changes in&lt;br/&gt;a system from time to time. They are analogous to differential equations,&lt;br/&gt;which include derivatives that describe the instantaneous changes of the&lt;br/&gt;variables of the system. Unlike differential equations, however, the&lt;br/&gt;changes in variables of a difference equation need not be thought of as&lt;br/&gt;instantaneous. This makes difference equations well suited to model a wide&lt;br/&gt;variety of phenomena that occur in distinct stages, such as changes between&lt;br/&gt;generations of plants or animals. The principal investigator and his&lt;br/&gt;colleagues organize a conference about recent advances in the theory of&lt;br/&gt;difference equations, the application of difference equations to modeling&lt;br/&gt;of biological phenomena, and new mathematical questions about difference&lt;br/&gt;equations that arise in the course of this modeling. Emphasis is given to&lt;br/&gt;applications in population biology, genetics, ecology, and epidemiology. &lt;br/&gt;The meeting involves students and postdocs, including participants from&lt;br/&gt;under-represented groups. Proceedings of the meeting are published,&lt;br/&gt;helping to disseminate more widely the results of the conference.</AbstractNarration>
