    <AbstractNarration>The University of Colorado at Boulder has been awarded a grant to support student participation in the 2004 Taxonomic Databases Working Group annual meeting in Christchurch, New Zealand, Oct 10-17, 2004. There is a potential for intellectual growth for the individual student participants as well as securing continued intellectual growth in the field by bringing the next generation of biodiversity informaticians into the community. Students from a diverse group of students, both male and female, and from different cultural and ethnic backgrounds will participate. Because training occurs during all phases of student development, and professional meetings early in careers can help shape later choices, there will be a wide range of expertise represented in the students chosen, including undergraduate, Masters, PhD and post-doctoral students. A national competition for open slots will provide an opportunity for deserving students, who couldn't otherwise afford to attend TDWG, a chance to participate.</AbstractNarration>
