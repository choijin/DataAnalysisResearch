<AbstractNarration>Professor Wayne will study the long-time behavior of partial&lt;br/&gt;differential equations like the Navier-Stokes, Euler, and Maxwell's&lt;br/&gt;equations which arise in the study of fluid dynamics and optics.  He&lt;br/&gt;will use methods and techniques from dynamical systems theory to make&lt;br/&gt;qualitative and quantitative predictions about the behavior of the&lt;br/&gt;solutions of these equations and  will focus on five main areas: (i)&lt;br/&gt;The derivation, justification and experimental validation of model&lt;br/&gt;equations for waves on fluid surfaces; (ii) The long-time behavior of&lt;br/&gt;solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations; particularly vortex&lt;br/&gt;solutions; (iii) The modeling of very short pulses in optical media;&lt;br/&gt;(iv) The existence and stability of pulse solutions in coupled optical&lt;br/&gt;systems; and (v) The approximation of the motion of thin elastic&lt;br/&gt;media. In particular, he will attempt to extend the insights gained&lt;br/&gt;from understanding the invariant geometrical objects in the phase&lt;br/&gt;space of ordinary differential equations to the infinite dimensional&lt;br/&gt;setting of partial differential equations, focusing particularly on&lt;br/&gt;the case of problems on unbounded spatial domains where the presence&lt;br/&gt;of continuous spectrum may cause qualitative differences between the&lt;br/&gt;behavior of the finite and infinite dimensional systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The types of systems that Professor Wayne will study arise in many&lt;br/&gt;applications, including nonlinear optical communication, fluid&lt;br/&gt;mechanics and the behavior of elastic materials.  For instance,&lt;br/&gt;attempts to obtain faster and faster transmission of information&lt;br/&gt;through optical fibers often utilize extremely short optical pulses.&lt;br/&gt;While there is a well understood and much studied method for&lt;br/&gt;approximating the transmission of long pulses through such fibers&lt;br/&gt;optical technology is now reaching the point where this approximation&lt;br/&gt;breaks down and new models are needed.  Point (iii) in the list of&lt;br/&gt;projects above aims to develop such approximations.  This problem,&lt;br/&gt;like the others that will be studied in this project, is characterized&lt;br/&gt;by the fact that while it is impossible to solve the equations&lt;br/&gt;governing the system exactly, applications require at least a&lt;br/&gt;qualitative understanding of the behavior of solutions.  Professor&lt;br/&gt;Wayne's research has three goals:  First, the derivation of model&lt;br/&gt;equations which can be used to approximate the behavior of the true&lt;br/&gt;physical system -- whether it arises in optics, fluids, or elsewhere.&lt;br/&gt;Secondly, the computation of accurate estimates to control how much&lt;br/&gt;the behavior of the true system can deviate from that of the model&lt;br/&gt;system, and finally the development of geometrical insights which can&lt;br/&gt;provide a  qualitative means of understanding and predicting the&lt;br/&gt;behavior of this type of complicated physical system even if the&lt;br/&gt;actual solution can not be computed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
