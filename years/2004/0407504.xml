<AbstractNarration>This project will address these issues; under-prepared Native students, poorly designed &lt;br/&gt;courses, and a need for water and wastewater technicians.  The project proposes to &lt;br/&gt;investigate the literature regarding Native American and Native Alaskan learning styles &lt;br/&gt;and to design, develop, deliver and evaluate six short, online technical courses for the &lt;br/&gt;Environmental Technology Program at UAS - Sitka. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Sound teaching strategies, designed and tested through this project, will be adopted for &lt;br/&gt;the rest of the UAS - Sitka Environmental Technology Program, and other technical &lt;br/&gt;distance program at the university will be encouraged to use them.  Strategies will also be &lt;br/&gt;appropriate for other STEM courses and programs, and could be valuable for Native &lt;br/&gt;American students throughout the country.  Skills developed, during study in the security &lt;br/&gt;of their home community, will encourage Native students to enroll in STEM programs &lt;br/&gt;and should increase retention and graduation rates.</AbstractNarration>
