<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;0424080&lt;br/&gt;VUCKOVIC&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI proposes to build two novel types of quantum dot-photonic crystal lasers: a two-dimensional coupled photonic crystal resonator array (CPCRA) laser, and a single quantum dot laser. The former is based on CPCRA structures that he has proposed recently; such a laser would exhibit low operating threshold resulting from a large spontaneous emission rate enhancement in photonic crystal microcavities, together with increased output power (relative to conventional photonic crystal microcavity lasers) resulting from the phase-coupled operation of hundreds of photonic crystal microcavity lasers on a chip. The second type of laser that he proposes is a single quantum dot laser, which represents an ultimate limit in laser miniaturization. This laser would be based on photonic crystal microcavities that he has proposed for cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) with a single quantum dot exciton, and would represent a solid-state equivalent of a single atom laser demonstrated recently. However, a single quantum dot laser would not require a very complicated atom trapping mechanism, which limits the duration of a single-atom laser operation at present.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the application level, the development of photonic crystal lasers with low threshold and increased output power is crucial for most of their proposed commercial applications. In addition, the development of a single quantum dot laser would be of great importance for ultra-low-power laser applications, as the structure would have lower threshold than any conventional laser. On the fundamental level, the demonstration of a single quantum dot laser would open opportunities to study cavity QED and quantum optics in the solid state instead of using atoms trapped inside cavities. Finally, as part of this project, the PI will also develop an integrated research and educational program ranging from fundamental science (quantum optics, quantum information science, and mesoscopic physics) to engineering (photonics and optoelectronics). The PI believes that an investment into education of a new generation of researchers and technologists will enable exploitation of photonic crystals and quantum optics at their full potential in the future. Moreover, by making researchers in other fields of science familiar with his work, he will possibly create new applications and research directions.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
