<AbstractNarration>We intend to study maximal models for the powersets of the first&lt;br/&gt;two uncountable cardinals as realized by the forcing method in the&lt;br/&gt;context of large cardinals and determinacy, and the applications&lt;br/&gt;of these models to other areas, especially topology. Many of these&lt;br/&gt;issues complement a new theory of the infinite developed by W. &lt;br/&gt;Hugh Woodin called Omega-logic. By now it is a well established&lt;br/&gt;theme in set theory that large cardinals impose certain forms of&lt;br/&gt;canonicity and absoluteness on the universe of sets. In&lt;br/&gt;particular, the existence of certain large cardinals implies that&lt;br/&gt;the theories of certain definable inner models of the universe are&lt;br/&gt;invariant under forcing. Furthermore, these large cardinals also&lt;br/&gt;tend to give rise to a detailed structure theory for these inner&lt;br/&gt;models.   The prototypical results of this type are results of&lt;br/&gt;Woodin, building on work of Foreman, Magidor, Shelah, Martin and&lt;br/&gt;Steel, showing that a proper class of Woodin cardinals implies&lt;br/&gt;that the theory of the least inner model of set theory containing&lt;br/&gt;the reals and the ordinals (L(R)) cannot be changed by set&lt;br/&gt;forcing, and that this fixed theory includes the Axiom of&lt;br/&gt;Determinacy. One natural program in the wake of these results is&lt;br/&gt;to identify and study larger models for which similar results&lt;br/&gt;hold. Another direction, noting that the Axiom of Determinacy&lt;br/&gt;contradicts the Axiom of Choice, is to find similar forms of&lt;br/&gt;absoluteness compatible with AC. One way of doing this is to&lt;br/&gt;consider statements to the effect that the universe of sets is&lt;br/&gt;closed under certain forcing operations. Such statements are&lt;br/&gt;typically called forcing axioms. Another approach is to consider&lt;br/&gt;forcing extensions of these inner models of determinacy. One major&lt;br/&gt;advance in this direction is Woodin's forcing Pmax. Heuristically,&lt;br/&gt;every natural question about the subsets of the first uncountable&lt;br/&gt;cardinal should have an answer in the Pmax extension of L(R).&lt;br/&gt;Nonetheless, there are several important questions about the Pmax&lt;br/&gt;extension which remain open. Some of these questions concern the&lt;br/&gt;properties of the nonstationary ideal on the first uncountable&lt;br/&gt;cardinal. One goal in pursuing these questions is to develop a&lt;br/&gt;finer analysis of the Pmax extension. In the other direction there&lt;br/&gt;is the issue of whether results obtained by Pmax can be obtained&lt;br/&gt;by other methods. Furthermore, the Pmax method has a number of&lt;br/&gt;variations, some of which have found application in topology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cohen's method of forcing is a way of taking models of the&lt;br/&gt;mathematical universe and producing larger, often very different&lt;br/&gt;models. We intend to study properties of the first two uncountable&lt;br/&gt;cardinals as realized by the forcing method in the context of the&lt;br/&gt;regularity imposed by assuming the existence of large infinite&lt;br/&gt;objects (large cardinals) and certain regularity properties for&lt;br/&gt;set of real numbers (determinacy), and the applications of these&lt;br/&gt;models to other areas, especially topology. Many of these issues&lt;br/&gt;complement a new theory of the infinite developed by W. Hugh&lt;br/&gt;Woodin. By now it is a well established theme in set theory that&lt;br/&gt;large cardinals impose certain forms of canonicity and&lt;br/&gt;absoluteness on the universe of sets. In particular, the existence&lt;br/&gt;of certain large cardinals implies that the theories of certain&lt;br/&gt;definable inner models of the universe are invariant under&lt;br/&gt;forcing. Furthermore, these large cardinals also tend to give rise&lt;br/&gt;to a detailed structure theory for these inner models. One natural&lt;br/&gt;program in the wake of these results is to identify and study &lt;br/&gt;larger models for which similar results hold. One way of doing&lt;br/&gt;this is to consider statements to the effect that the universe of&lt;br/&gt;sets is closed under certain forcing operations. Another approach&lt;br/&gt;is to consider forcing extensions of canonical inner models of&lt;br/&gt;determinacy. One major advance in this direction is Woodin's&lt;br/&gt;forcing Pmax. Heuristically, every natural question about the&lt;br/&gt;subsets of the first uncountable cardinal should have an answer in&lt;br/&gt;the Pmax extension. Nonetheless, there are several important&lt;br/&gt;questions about the Pmax extension which remain open. One goal in&lt;br/&gt;pursuing these questions is to develop a finer analysis of the&lt;br/&gt;Pmax extension. In the other direction there is the issue of&lt;br/&gt;whether results obtained by Pmax can be obtained by other methods.&lt;br/&gt;Furthermore, the Pmax method has a number of variations, some of&lt;br/&gt;which have found application in other areas of mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
