<AbstractNarration>This award is in partial support to the Conference on Analysis, Modeling and Computation of PDE and Multiphase Flow. It took approximately 250  years from Euler's formulation of the partial differential equations governing the flow of compressible fluids to the proof that such flows  with arbitrarily prescribed initial states actually exist. This scientific breakthrough opened a new field in analysis and computation of the problem of multiphase fluid flow. The demonstration that the solutions can exist in weak form which include discontinuous structures poses a great challenge to mathematicians in designing numerical algorithms for the computation of the multiphase flow. The scientific progress in this field has always been an interplay between analysis and computation, by hard work and by mere luck. This conference brings scientists who have made important contribution to the field and those who are striving to find new solutions in more complicated systems and higher dimensions. The speakers will address the proof of existence and uniqueness of  the partial differential equations, numerical algorithms to solve such equations and computational examples emerged from scientific and  engineering problems which are governed by such partial differential equations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference is to foster communication among theoreticians, numerical analysts and computational scientists from universities and national laboratories and between leaders and students in these fields. Theoreticians can predict the qualitative aspects of the solutions while computational scientists will demonstrate the details of the numerical solution which is unknown to the analysts. The PDE and its application to the multiphase flow problem has a large impact in national defense and industry. Such problems are brought from national laboratories to the academic community to seek better mathematical understanding and a better design for numerical algorithms. Many university  participants of this conference have connection with national laboratories and industry. Woman scientists play an important role in this research and they are among several plenary and invited speakers of the conference. Others include brilliant graduate students and junior researchers from underrepresented minorities and people with physical disability. The conference also holds a poster session for the graduate students from several universities.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
