<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Program Phase II research project will develop a technology for improving security checkpoint effectiveness and increasing throughput while reducing labor costs for airports and other sensitive installations by integrating information technology systems incorporating new x-ray image inspection technology, new electronics communications technology, materials handling automation, and database-centric computerization. Current processing rates through a typical security checkpoint are relatively slow and laborious and costs are high. Today's checkpoints take little advantage of computerization thereby limiting their effectiveness. It is planned that the prototype system will be integrated into a TSA approved test site and tested and evaluated by an independent third party&lt;br/&gt;Modernization of checkpoint security will improve protection of many other segments of society. In today's world it is vital that our nation's citizenry, transportation systems, institutions, sensitive installations, and economy have the best protection possible. Security has become much more restrictive and time consuming. If successful this project will develop a product that will be able to increase the security at check bags handling facilities while reducing the time to conduct the checks. The streamlining and improving of security at federal buildings, government installations, maritime ports, shippers, mailrooms, and other sensitive locations can increase confidence in our day-to-day lives and help improve the nation's economic security.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
