<AbstractNarration>One of the most important questions for resource management is, under what &lt;br/&gt;conditions will users conserve the resources on which their livelihood &lt;br/&gt;depends?  This project studies the forest management &lt;br/&gt;strategies of different types of forest landowner groups in Maine.  Some &lt;br/&gt;owners are doing a far better job of managing their forests sustainably &lt;br/&gt;than are others. The quality of management practices is a crucial issues at this time, &lt;br/&gt;because the rapid depletion of forests is a world-wide problem. Maine is a &lt;br/&gt;particularly good laboratory to study forest management issues because it &lt;br/&gt;is the most heavily forested state in the country, and a wide variety of &lt;br/&gt;management practices are being used. In Maine, the rate of cutting is not &lt;br/&gt;sustainable, according to a number of studies. As a result, the amount of &lt;br/&gt;land covered with brush and scrub trees has increased greatly, and the &lt;br/&gt;amount of acreage in high quality forests has declined greatly. At the same &lt;br/&gt;time, Maine's entire forest industry, one of the state's largest &lt;br/&gt;industries, is undergoing great changes.  Paper mills are being closed, &lt;br/&gt;employment is declining sharply, and large tracts of land are changing hands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project involves an anthropologist and a forester studying Maine's &lt;br/&gt;paper companies, timber companies, forest contractors and small private &lt;br/&gt;forest owners.  Two different, but complementary, kinds of studies will be &lt;br/&gt;done.  First, information will be gathered on the forest management &lt;br/&gt;practices of a sample of landowners in each of the landowner categories, &lt;br/&gt;with emphasis on the paper companies and the private landowners. This &lt;br/&gt;information will be gathered using a number of techniques: mail surveys, &lt;br/&gt;qualitative in-person interviews, archival research, and direct &lt;br/&gt;observations. This study is designed to understand the forest management &lt;br/&gt;strategies of these landowners, and the social, cultural, economic and &lt;br/&gt;political factors motivating these decisions.  Second, the actual state of &lt;br/&gt;the forests of these landowners will be evaluated using both field visits &lt;br/&gt;and the analysis of satellite images.  Information from these studies will &lt;br/&gt;be used to test a number of hypotheses which will give us a greater &lt;br/&gt;understanding of the behavior of private forest-owners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader implications: This study will enhance our understanding of the &lt;br/&gt;factors motivating people in various landowner categories to conserve or &lt;br/&gt;over-exploit their forests.  Legislators, management &lt;br/&gt;agencies, and local communities would be able to act on this information to &lt;br/&gt;frame better resource management policies.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
