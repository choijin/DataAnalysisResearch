<AbstractNarration> This research is aimed at a fundamental understanding of dynamic processes - diffusion, viscosity, &lt;br/&gt;viscoelasticity  -  in  any  polymer  material  containing  more  than  one  chemical  repeat  unit.  Such &lt;br/&gt;multicomponent  polymers  .  a  class  that  includes  miscible  and  immiscible  blends,  random  and  block &lt;br/&gt;copolymers,  and  their  mixtures  .  are  ubiquitous  in  modern  macromolecular  science  and  technology. &lt;br/&gt;Description  of  the  dynamics  of  single  component  polymers  has  advanced  considerably,  primarily  via &lt;br/&gt;reptation-based models,  but  the  extension to multicomponent  systems  lags  behind. There are  two main &lt;br/&gt;obstacles:  (i)  limited  understanding  of  the  composition  and  temperature  dependence  of  the  local &lt;br/&gt;segmental dynamics that underly all mechanisms of chain relaxation, and (ii) incomplete understanding of &lt;br/&gt;the effects of mixing on the mechanisms of chain dynamics. The proposed research will address both of &lt;br/&gt;these  issues  through  strategic  measurements  on  model  systems,  using  a  unique  combination  of  three &lt;br/&gt;powerful techniques: rheology, oscillatory flow birefringence, and diffusion.  &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt;  Recent research has revealed a variety of fascinating phenomena in the dynamics of binary polymer &lt;br/&gt;mixtures, attributable to the fact that the temperature dependences of the segmental mobilities of the two &lt;br/&gt;components  are  distinct.  This  "thermorheological  complexity"  arises  both  from  intrinsic  differences  in &lt;br/&gt;flexibility, an intramolecular contribution, and from differences between the bulk, average composition, &lt;br/&gt;and  that  of  the  local  environment  surrounding  a  segment.  A  partial  explanation  for  these  observations &lt;br/&gt;based on the idea of self-concentration, the local enrichment of the environment in like monomers due &lt;br/&gt;simply to chain connectivity, has proven capable of describing much of the phenomenology. Furthermore, &lt;br/&gt;it  provides  an  organizing  principle  by  which  the  behavior  of  various  systems  can  be  classified,  and  it &lt;br/&gt;highlights  those  future  experiments  that  are  likely  to  be  most  revealing.  The  three  experimental &lt;br/&gt;techniques in combination will allow precise extraction of the dynamics of each component, in carefully &lt;br/&gt;selected model blends, over broad ranges of composition and temperature. These data should enable full &lt;br/&gt;characterization  of  the  local  dynamics,  which  in  turn  will  direct  the  development  of  an  improved, &lt;br/&gt;predictive model. Then, with an understanding of local dynamics in hand, it will be possible to address &lt;br/&gt;several longstanding issues concerning chain dynamics, via the same experimental protocol. In particular, &lt;br/&gt;measurements  of  the  composition  and  temperature  dependent  viscosity  on  the  same model  blends  will &lt;br/&gt;allow detailed testing of proposed models, such as "double reptation", for the effects of polydispersity on &lt;br/&gt;chain dynamics. Furthermore, the extraction of the full frequency dependent response and diffusivity of a &lt;br/&gt;dilute  component  in  a  mixture  will  lead  to  an  experimental  resolution  of  the  longstanding  "constraint &lt;br/&gt;release versus contour length fluctuations" controversy in linear viscoelasticity. &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact &lt;br/&gt;  The  vast  majority  of  commercial  polymer  materials  are  processed  in  the  liquid  state,  where  the &lt;br/&gt;viscoelastic response (both linear and non-linear) ultimately dictates what can and can't be done. As the &lt;br/&gt;fraction  of  commercial  materials  that  may  be  considered  "multicomponent"  increases  steadily,  the &lt;br/&gt;importance  and  utility  of  both  "correlative"  (i.e.,  take  what  is  observed  and  relate  it  to  molecular &lt;br/&gt;variables) and "predictive" (i.e., predict properties based on molecular variables) schemes grows as well. &lt;br/&gt;The  research  described  herein  shows  promise  of  providing  the  first  reliable  predictive  scheme  for  the &lt;br/&gt;viscosity  of  a  miscible  polymer  blend.  Furthermore,  the  underlying  concepts  should  contribute  to &lt;br/&gt;predictive schemes for the viscoelasticity of other multicomponent systems, and in the longer run for the &lt;br/&gt;non-linear flow properties as well. &lt;br/&gt;  This  program  integrates  teaching  and  research  over  the  full  range  of  polymer  science  .  synthesis, &lt;br/&gt;characterization,  morphology,  rheology,  dynamics,  and  theory  .  for  students  in  chemistry,  chemical &lt;br/&gt;engineering, and materials science programs. This breadth of training has made group alumni attractive in &lt;br/&gt;both academic and industrial settings, and to companies extending well beyond the traditional polymer &lt;br/&gt;industry.  Regular  opportunities  for  mentoring  undergraduates,  and  for  presenting  research  results  at &lt;br/&gt;national scientific meetings and to audiences of industrial scientists, constitute an essential component of &lt;br/&gt;graduate student education in this program.</AbstractNarration>
