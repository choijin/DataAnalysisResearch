    <AbstractNarration>Environmental Science and National Resources &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Northwest Center for Sustainable Resources (NCSR) operates as an ATE National Resource Center for ecosystem-oriented natural resource and environmental science education. The Center's foci are: (1) natural resource and environmental science educational materials development; (2) dissemination, adaptation, and implementation of these materials by educators; and (3) development and implementation of professional development institutes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NCSR has an established record of producing cutting-edge curriculum products that have been successfully adapted by natural resource programs across the nation. On-going evaluation of the NCSR program clearly demonstrates the positive long-term impact on faculty and their students of both the curriculum products and associated professional development. Materials being developed and disseminated include college-level courses, educator guides, laboratory and field teaching modules, and high school-level educational guides and instructional modules. Professional development activities focus on contemporary environmental science and natural resource topics and procedures germane to life sciences and advanced technical education for college faculty and secondary school educators. NCSR provides a comprehensive information and reference guide for natural resource educators on current concepts and practices in ecosystem management including Native American perspectives. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project is its emphasis on addressing major challenges in sustaining natural resource environments while supporting the economic needs of a growing population. Natural resource professionals must understand ecological systems. Technicians who support production and stewardship need knowledge of the evolving complexities of ecosystem science and management techniques that can ensure sustainability of these critical resources. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the project are the continued production of and increased skills and knowledge of advanced technicians nationwide. They bring to the workforce an understanding of the science and technical processes needed to rebuild and sustain our natural environment while providing economic benefit. NCSR's approach to ecosystem-based natural resource education is to: (1) emphasize seamless education from K-12 through the university; (2) work closely with employers in curriculum development; (3) develop core instructional materials that prepare students to obtain advanced knowledge and skills; (4) promote the successful use of these materials and approaches through professional development of college and secondary school faculty; and (5) produce skilled technicians who work for industry, agencies, and organizations involved with aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. This approach has proven to be effective both in creating widely adaptable curriculum products with emphasis on developing student understanding and in the use of inquiry-based science through rigorous laboratory and field-based instruction.</AbstractNarration>
