    <AbstractNarration>AST 0423151&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI Wasserman&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop entitled "Astrometry in the Age of the Next Generation of Large Telescope" is scheduled for three days, October 18-20, 2004, and will be held in the Visitors' Center of the Lowell Observatory, Flagstaff, Arizona. Attendance is limited to about 100 participants from throughout the United States and abroad. This is the first meeting since 1984 that has focused on narrow field astrometry, primarily carried out from the ground, and the future of precise astrometric measurements. Such fundamental measurements contribute to many areas of astrophysics. There have been deep impacts from the Hipparcos mission and the development of digital imaging cameras for astrometry. The next decade promises even more scientific returns on the investment in advanced large telescope technologies, if proper attention is paid to the specific requirements of positional astronomy, but these requirements must be folded into engineering designs and data pipelines now. Students will be encouraged to attend the meeting. Proceedings for the workshop will be published in a timely manner and all review talks and poster contributions will be included</AbstractNarration>
