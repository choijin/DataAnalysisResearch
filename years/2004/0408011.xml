<AbstractNarration>Nontechnical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research focuses on the biology of Septobasidium, a fungal parasite&lt;br/&gt;on scale insects. Scale insects are common agricultural and horticultural&lt;br/&gt;pests, and Septobasidium is a fungus that sterilizes the insects that it&lt;br/&gt;infects. However, colonies of Septobasidium require both infected and&lt;br/&gt;uninfected insects to survive. Because Septobasidium lives in this complex&lt;br/&gt;association with its host scale insects its diversification is expected to&lt;br/&gt;be tightly linked to diversity and diversification in host scale insects.&lt;br/&gt;This research seeks to elucidate any correlative patterns of&lt;br/&gt;diversification in the hosts and parasites and to determine the processes&lt;br/&gt;that lead to the formation of those patterns. The proposed research has&lt;br/&gt;two main parts. The first part uses DNA sequence data from both fungi and&lt;br/&gt;host insects to examine large-scale patterns of host association and&lt;br/&gt;cospeciation that structure diversity within the symbiosis. Phylogenetic&lt;br/&gt;methods are used to infer the history of hosts and parasites, and these&lt;br/&gt;reconstructed histories are compared to determine how host evolution is&lt;br/&gt;related to parasite evolution. The second part implements methods to&lt;br/&gt;analyze DNA sequence data from multiple populations of Septobasidium&lt;br/&gt;species from across the southeastern United States in order to identify&lt;br/&gt;processes that generate the large-scale patterns. Population processes&lt;br/&gt;such as migration and dispersal are estimated from DNA sequence variation&lt;br/&gt;separately and simultaneously for both hosts and parasites. Comparing&lt;br/&gt;these processes from several different fungal species with different host&lt;br/&gt;insects and ecologies but from overlapping geographic ranges will&lt;br/&gt;determine how strongly the host and parasite population processes&lt;br/&gt;influence each other. Combining the two major parts provides insight into&lt;br/&gt;evolutionary diversification in this symbiosis and represents the first&lt;br/&gt;study to apply critical genetic approaches to understand the ecology and&lt;br/&gt;evolution of this classic fungus/ insect relationship.&lt;br/&gt;This study benefits the public in several specific ways. This study&lt;br/&gt;improves cross discipline communication through collaboration of a&lt;br/&gt;mycology student and an expert entomologist. The study also provides&lt;br/&gt;opportunities for undergraduate students to gain research experience.&lt;br/&gt;Finally, the research furthers understanding of fungal/ scale insect&lt;br/&gt;parasitism that may lead to biological control of plant pests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
