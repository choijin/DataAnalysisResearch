<AbstractNarration> The shape or image of an object may be recorded digitally by a finite &lt;br/&gt;number k of landmarks or positions on the object, called a k-ad. The space &lt;br/&gt;of orbits under rotation and translation of k-ads is the size-and-shape &lt;br/&gt;space. If one includes scaling with rotation and translation, then the &lt;br/&gt;space of orbits under the resulting group of transformations on the k-ads&lt;br/&gt;is the shape space. These are examples of Riemannian manifolds, some with &lt;br/&gt;singularities. One approach proposed here for inference about a &lt;br/&gt;distribution on a general differentiable or Riemannian manifold M, based &lt;br/&gt;on a random sample from it, is to carry out a multivariate analysis of the &lt;br/&gt;image under the so-called Log map on one or more tangent spaces to M. &lt;br/&gt;Apart from this intrinsic approach, less computation intensive extrinsic &lt;br/&gt;procedures based on embeddings in Euclidean spaces are investigated. The &lt;br/&gt;project explores consistency and asymptotic distribution theory on &lt;br/&gt;manifolds for robust tests and confidence regions from both points of &lt;br/&gt;view--intrinsic and extrinsic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;   One motivation for this study comes from the need to identify &lt;br/&gt;deformations or shape changes for purposes of medical diagnosis and &lt;br/&gt;biomorphology. Immediate applications also arise to machine vision and &lt;br/&gt;pattern recognition. There are significant impacts of this research on &lt;br/&gt;these and many other fields. Another important goal of this project is to &lt;br/&gt;train students in the newly developed methodologies, leading to the &lt;br/&gt;dissemination of knowledge gained through this research and the creation &lt;br/&gt;of a body of technicians and experts to apply it.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
