<AbstractNarration>The Baltimore Ecosystem Study (BES) was initiated as an LTER project in 1997, designed to understand the controls on urban system structure and function, and how structure and function of the urban ecosystem affect one another.  The proposed research will expand the first phase BES work by addressing three fundamental questions: 1) How do the spatial structures of socio-economic, ecological and physical features of an urban area relate to one another and how do they change through time?  2) What are the fluxes of energy, matter, capital and population in the BES system, how do these fluxes relate to one another and how do they change over the long term?  3) How can people develop and use an understanding of the metropolis as an ecological system to improve the quality of their environment and to reduce pollution to downstream air and watersheds?  Conceptual frameworks motivating these questions include ecological, hydrologic and social patch dynamics, the human ecosystem framework and the role of exotics in community organization, as well as theories in socio-spatial relationships, resilience, biocomplexity and urban design. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Contributions.  The proposed research builds on data sets ranging from &lt;br/&gt;paleoecological, through historic time frames, to simulation of future scenarios. Highlights of proposed new research include: 1) using a $1 billion Baltimore City program to improve sanitary sewer infrastructure as an experimental manipulation, 2) an integrated physical, biological and social analysis of an urban watershed restoration (Watershed 263) project funded by over $1 million in U.S. Forest Service and other sources, 3) continued development of the first urban micrometeorological flux tower for analysis of carbon and water fluxes, and 4) continued development of ideas about the ecology of prestige, where lifestyle groups rather than more traditional metrics such as race, income and education are used to explain variation in urban ecosystem structure and function.  Integration of these efforts will be facilitated by continued development and use of a new, high-resolution urban land cover classification system (HERCULES), and by a series of models that operate at different scales for different questions.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts.  BES research will exploit new, management-relevant environmental interventions, such as the Watershed 263 restoration initiative to explore the role of urban reforestation on stormwater management. Evaluation of improvements to Baltimore City's sewer infrastructure will yield results broadly useful to managers and policy makers and to educators and community groups in the affected water- and sewer-sheds.  Modeling of ecosystem services will be a hallmark of the new research, providing information useful and interesting to citizens and decision leaders.  New BES education and outreach initiatives will include analyses of how formal and informal approaches to education facilitate the ability of people to think about the city as an ecosystem and development of new modules for the Urban Forest Effects (UFORE) model to evaluate the health of urban forests and their effects on energy use and water and air pollution. Education activities will build on successful curriculum development, teacher workshops and interactions with K-12 students, with special attention on reaching under-represented groups.  Training outside the classroom will include summer internships and after school programs at community centers and city environmental centers, again including under-represented groups.  Novel graduate training will focus on a new collaboration in urban design.  Multi-city information transfer will be achieved through cross-site LTER site projects and through an Urban Ecology Collaborative. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Baltimore Ecosystem Study, Phase II: Project Outcomes  Over the last seven years, the Baltimore Ecosystem Study (BES), Long-Term Ecological Research project has consolidated as one of the worldÆs premier platforms for urban socio-ecological research.  It has convincingly demonstrated that concepts important to mainstream ecology, such as the ecosystem, the watershed, and the shifting mosaic, help to understand the linked human-natural components of cities, suburbs, and exurban areas.  The knowledge generated has helped bring environmental education to students who have been underserved by education about nature and natural processes, has helped managers and policy makers identify new needs and opportunities for watershed management, planting of urban tree canopy, and the role of ecological processes and amenities in neighborhood revitalization.  BES has produced new knowledge about urban stream behavior, documenting their disconnection from floodplain and ground waters.  It has shown increasing salt pollution in streams the long-term, and shown the effectiveness of stormwater "best management practices" in old residential neighborhoods.  Findings of stream research focused watershed management beyond the near-stream zone, and subsequent research on urban tree canopy documented reduced exposure to UVB radiation and reduction of the urban heat island effect.  The urban heat island has been shown to be very patchy in its potential negative effects on people, and hotspots of urban heat are distributed inequitably throughout the metropolis.  Other pollutants beyond heat are also patchy, with nitrogen deposited from traffic exhaust being both higher in general magnitude than expected, and concentrated around travel corridors.  The capacity of the urban system to absorb carbon (C) dioxide has also been documented, and daily and weekly patterns confirm the relationship of C dynamics to the activity patterns work and travel.  The vegetation in Baltimore results in less release of C to the environment than would occur without trees and lawns.  The biological organisms other than people also have important roles in the urban system.  Homogenization of the identity of some of these animals across different cities does exist as expected, but not all groups are homogeneous, indicating that local specialization still exists in cities.  Urban soils contain a rich community of native and introduced species that contribute to soil metabolism and generate a capacity to absorb carbon dioxide and nitrates, taking these polluting compounds out of circulation.  New communities of aquatic animals establish in the novel habitats of stormwater detention ponds, and produce nutrient cycling services and provide the base for foodchains.  Notable members of aquatic foodchains are the introduced mosquitoes that can transmit West Nile virus (WNV) from birds to people.  The composition of mosquito communities shifts from rural to urban waters and containers, increasing the risk of WNV in the city sites.  Perhaps the most visible members of urban food chains are birds.  In some cities, the diversity of bird species relates to the wealth of neighborhoods, but in Baltimore it responds to the structure of the tree canopy in different neighborhoods.  Studies on the location of suburban development suggest that leapfrogging across boundaries representing different zoning strategies is a relatively minor contributor to sprawl.  The findings of BES have implications for urban design and planning, pointing out potential values of open and green spaces and the ecosystem structures and processes they support.  However, the findings of BES of ecosystem functions in complex urban environments suggests a value to ecologically informed urbanization and urban revitalization.
