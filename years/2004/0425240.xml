<AbstractNarration>This dissertation research investigates the activities, opportunities, achievements, limitations, and implications of a particular type of third sector organization operating at the local level in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania: the community-based organization (CBO).  Whereas the third sector comprises a wide range of organizations - i.e., those which are neither part of the state nor part of the business sector - operating at different levels and pursuing various goals, the term CBO refers specifically to groups formed by individuals for the purpose of improving the conditions of a geographically bounded area, such as a street, neighborhood, or village.  The project focuses on CBOs as a means to explore theoretical issues that revolve around development, democratization, and the concept of participation.  The research is proceeding in two phases: Phase one involves the in-depth analysis of two CBOs.  Methodologically, the researcher is using open-ended and structured interviews, participant observation, and textual analysis to gather data and probe the debates in the literature.   Phase two of the project entails the collection of primary data from all CBOs operating in Dar es Salaam.  This consists of approximately one hundred organizations spread across the city's three municipalities.  The researcher will utilize structured interviews, textual analysis, and statistical analysis.  The knowledge gained during both phases of the research and from this combination of methods will allow the researcher to address the broader debate concerning the potential of participation in third sector organizations to contribute to sustainable development and democratic social relations.  The research contributes to the social science literature in three distinct ways.  First, it explores issues that are central to development studies, where increased attention to participation in third sector organizations has arisen from the perceived poor performance of the public sector in developing countries and the desire to find more effective and efficient organizational forms for the delivery of goods and services.  Second, the project advances our understanding of the process of democratization. That is, analysis of third sector organizations operating at the local level will illuminate their capacity to extend and strengthen civil society, increase opportunities for popular participation, and challenge the monopolistic tendencies and poor performance of the state.  Third, the research demonstrates both the methods and the importance of looking at micro-level phenomena as a means to understand macro-level transformations.  The research will have broader impacts beyond its contribution to the social science literature.  Specifically, the findings and conclusions should be of particular interest to those who determine the course of development and democratization in countries undergoing significant economic and political change: professionals in multilateral development agencies, consultants, government officials, and academics.  By contributing to an informed policy debate, the research will assist those who endeavor to build the capacities of third sector organizations and to create an enabling environment for their activities.</AbstractNarration>
