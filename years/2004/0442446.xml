<AbstractNarration>Engineering-Mechanical (56) &lt;br/&gt;This project is developing computer-based instructional modules for Statics and Mechanics of Materials, two core engineering courses that traditionally serve large numbers of students and disciplines.  The work seeks to improve engineering education by addressing fundamental topics that are consistently difficult for instructors to teach and for students to learn - topics involving 3D geometry.  The project uses 3D rendering and animation software to produce instructional modules in which the user manipulates virtual 3D objects in much the same manner as they would physical objects.  To assist instructors, classroom teaching modules and a 3D modeling tool are being developed that enable instructors to realistically depict three-dimensional engineering objects, including the external forces acting on them and the internal responses to those external forces, as these topics are being explained during lectures.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For students, the courseware provides meaningful exercises using the same 3D virtual models that the instructor uses in class.  Further, an online 3D modeling tool with real-time voice and text collaboration provides students with a means to communicate on-line with peers or instructors in seeking answers to their questions.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Educational evaluation and research constitutes a major component of this project. This research includes the detailed exploration of learning and instructional design variables and the utilization of multiple methodologies and measurement tools. The research will produce important insights into basic cognitive and educational issues that underlie learning by means of innovative software.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is engaging a wide variety of institutions in the development and testing of the material. A CoPI is located at the University of Oklahoma Norman Campus, instructors at Pellissippi Community College will assess the effectiveness of the material at the community college level, and ten additional instructors at different institutions will be engaged to beta-test the curriculum and provide feedback. The computer-based instructional modules developed in this project are integrated with in-class demonstration activities that are being developed through another NSF funded project by Kris Wood at the University of Texas Austin and Dan Jensen at The Air Force Academy.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
