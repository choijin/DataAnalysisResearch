<AbstractNarration>Hyperspectral imaging sensor acquires and analyzes 3-D data consisting of 1-D spectral and 2-D spatial image information. It offers more accurate information extraction than possible with conventional imaging technique. Especially in infrared spectral band, hyperspectral imaging sensor can be used for materials identification, chemical and biological agents identification, military target/decoy discrimination identification and tracking, intelligent missile seeking, space weather sensing, remote monitoring of pollution sites, etc. Existing hyperspectral imaging devices use fixed spectral band and are too slow to analyze large amount of 3-D data and thus cannot meet real-time application requirements. We propose to develop a novel hyperspectral imaging sensor with spectral zooming feature. Using a special fiber bundle, we can expand the spatial domain and allow the dispersion of spectral information to be acquired simultaneously by the imaging camera. Thus, the 1-D spectral and 2-D spatial image information can be acquired at the same time without the need for sequential acquisition as commonly done by existing spectral imaging devices. It is preferred that the hyperspectral imaging sensor can offer wide spectral band for searching target of interest that emit certain spectral information. It is also preferred that it can offer high spectral resolution. Using limited spectral pixels, the spectral information can still cover wide spectral band (spectral course view) and narrow spectral band (spectral fine view) through the spectral zooming feature. The device is capable of contour mapping of designated spectral ranges for pin pointing specific target area and capable of rapid processing spectral image data. The successful development of hyperspectral imaging sensor along with high sensitive sol gel film has significant scientific and engineering value since the hyperspectral imaging is of vital importance to the sensing field.  The proposed research will also benefit university education, academic research, and photonic material development.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
