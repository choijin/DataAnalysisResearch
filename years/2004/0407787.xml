<AbstractNarration>This grant would allow CIT to capacity build in the STEM curricular areas as we develop &lt;br/&gt;the breadth and depth of assorted associate degrees.  Student recruitment and retention &lt;br/&gt;will be enhanced through innovative strategies applicable to a population that has &lt;br/&gt;historically been excluded from opportunities in mainstream STEM programs. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Scientific/Intellectual Merit: The learning laboratory, classrooms, and science labs will &lt;br/&gt;be equipped with scientific and technological equipment that will make the educating of &lt;br/&gt;students in STEM courses possible and allow CIT to become a more noticeable presence &lt;br/&gt;on the Navajo Nation.  The grant will provide enhancement of existing and development &lt;br/&gt;of new learning and teaching strategies such as internships, cooperative exchanges, paid &lt;br/&gt;research experiences, and research exchanges with federal labs and universities. &lt;br/&gt;  Faculty research capacity capabilities will be  developed now that  CIT is a &lt;br/&gt;candidate for accreditation and strives to become accredited.  Such progress would allow &lt;br/&gt;CIT  to compete for additional funding from research agencies and organizations in the &lt;br/&gt;future.  Existing unique programs such as veterinary technician, nursing, dental assistant &lt;br/&gt;and environmental sciences will be able to reach full accreditation by their professional &lt;br/&gt;organizations as well.    Funding from the NSF/TCUP program will assure that these &lt;br/&gt;programs will be successful.  The Institute.s programs fill a unique vocational/technical &lt;br/&gt;niche in the educational opportunities available to Native American Indian students. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Chief Manuelito, a Navajo Leader of the 1860s, is on record as having spoken of &lt;br/&gt;education as a ladder toward a brighter and more prosperous future. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Program  Impact:  The NSF funded project would allow CIT to develop badly needed &lt;br/&gt;infrastructure to meet its mission of providing a quality technical/vocational education to &lt;br/&gt;its students.   The  capacity building embedded in this proposal would move  CIT into a &lt;br/&gt;leadership  capacity by allowing us to broaden degree and certificate program offerings.  &lt;br/&gt;Also we would be  able  to  address  the  critical  shortage of  students entering  into STEM &lt;br/&gt;content fields through better recruitment and retention efforts.</AbstractNarration>
