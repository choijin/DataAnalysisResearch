<AbstractNarration>Advanced Signal Processing for Ultra-Wide-Band (UWB) Communications in Wireless Networks&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Following the February 2002 order by the Federal Communications Commission, ultra-wide-&lt;br/&gt;band (UWB) communications technology has emerged as the leading standard for very high data&lt;br/&gt;rate applications in wireless networks. The technology will allow the wireless connection of multiple&lt;br/&gt;devices at very high rates and at low power consumption. UWB will allow the transmission of&lt;br/&gt;video, audio, and other data traffic among devices at rates that may reach 480Mbps. For example,&lt;br/&gt;UWB could stream real-time video content from a PC or a consumer electronics device, such as&lt;br/&gt;a camcorder, a DVD player or a personal video recorder, to a flat-screen HDTV display without&lt;br/&gt;the need for wires. In order for this technology to become widely adopted it is necessary to&lt;br/&gt;maintain the costs of UWB devices low. A major challenge arises from the signal distortions&lt;br/&gt;that are introduced during the analog processing as a result of manufacturing imperfections. The&lt;br/&gt;effects of such distortions will be compounded in future high-performance wireless networks due&lt;br/&gt;to the higher silicon integration, lower power consumption, larger bandwidth, and higher carrier&lt;br/&gt;frequency. There are at least two strategies to address this diffculty. One strategy is generally&lt;br/&gt;costly and relies on building more reliable front-end radios. The second strategy, which is one of&lt;br/&gt;the objectives of this proposal, is to model and cancel signal distortions by using advanced signal&lt;br/&gt;processing and compensation algorithms in the digital domain. This research proposes a systematic&lt;br/&gt;way for modeling distortion effects, exploiting the distortion models in receiver design, developing&lt;br/&gt;enhanced OFDM receivers that counter-balance the effects of distortions and that improve the&lt;br/&gt;range of UWB devices, investigating theoretical limits of performance, and also implementing and&lt;br/&gt;testing the developed algorithms on an FPGA testbed.&lt;br/&gt;Objectives. (1) Develop distortion models and distortion cancellation techniques for UWB de-&lt;br/&gt;vices by using advanced signal processing algorithms in the digital domain. (2) Develop enhanced&lt;br/&gt;OFDM receivers for UWB communications by jointly addressing the issues of improved range,&lt;br/&gt;improved channel estimation, and distortion compensation. (3) Use the developed distortion can-&lt;br/&gt;cellation receivers for both single user and multi-user (space-time coded) communications scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;(4) Investigate theoretical limits of performance and effects of distortion on system performance. (5)&lt;br/&gt;Pursue a proof-of-concept implementation of a UWB system on an FPGA by using the developed&lt;br/&gt;algorithms in order to investigate the models and the algorithms for improved performance.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit of the Proposed Activity. The PI and his research group have extensive research&lt;br/&gt;experience on different aspects of advanced signal processing, communications, and adaptive system&lt;br/&gt;design. The proposed research activity is creative in several respects: (1) It recognizes the need to&lt;br/&gt;address signal distortions introduced by analog processing as a step towards maintaining the cost&lt;br/&gt;of UWB devices low. (2) It recognizes the importance of cancelling distortion in the digital domain,&lt;br/&gt;as opposed to the analog domain. (3) It studies the effects of major sources of distortion (including&lt;br/&gt;IQ imbalances, phase noise, and transmitter and receiver nonlinearities) on algorithm development&lt;br/&gt;and performance. (4) It addresses major performance hurdles such as enhanced channel estimation&lt;br/&gt;in order to incorporate distortion models, the design of distortion-robust OFDM-based SISO and&lt;br/&gt;MIMO (space-time coded) communications, and the need for improved range for UWB devices due&lt;br/&gt;to their limited transmit power. (5) It pays attention to the intricate balance between algorithm&lt;br/&gt;complexity and hardware implementation.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of the Proposed Activity. The broader impacts of the proposed research are&lt;br/&gt;as follows: (1) It has significant implications on the information technology infrastructure of the&lt;br/&gt;nation by making the promising UWB technology widely spread at lower costs. (2) It contributes&lt;br/&gt;to the development of ultra-high-speed wireless networks for PC peripherals, consumer electronics,&lt;br/&gt;home networking, and mobile devices at data rates that may reach 480Mbps. (3) It trains both&lt;br/&gt;graduate and undergraduate students in an area of fundamental relevance to future communications&lt;br/&gt;systems. (4) The results of the research will be widely disseminated online and via publications in&lt;br/&gt;archival journals and conference proceedings, and also via demonstrations of the hardware testbed.&lt;br/&gt;A-1</AbstractNarration>
