    <AbstractNarration>SoundVision Productions proposes to develop five one-hour radio documentaries, five five-minute features, and a website to inform a diverse public about the important advances in genomics and related sciences. Each of the new topics represents a rapidly developing field within genomics rarely covered in depth by the media. Those topics include systems biology, neurogenetics, RNA and Immunology, and Individualizing the Genome. The DNA Files will provide public radio listeners and web site users informal education in the genomic revolution and follow-on research and technology, its scientific underpinnings, and related social, philosophical and legal issues. The project will offer audiences an awareness of the societal benefits of research and the intellectual tools to join in legal and social policy debates. A collaboration with the Exploratorium will extend the reach of the project through the development of a "DNA Workshop Kit", a series of four or five hands-on workshops for the general public that can be produced at the Exploratorium and other science museums around the country. A comprehensive outreach strategy will be implemented by 20 local public radio stations around the country in partnership with community organizations.</AbstractNarration>
