<AbstractNarration>Non-technical abstract: Dissertation Research: Morphological &lt;br/&gt;diversification of anostomimorph and curimatimorph fishes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why is biodiversity distributed unequally across the tree-of-life?  Some &lt;br/&gt;groups of species have evolved extraordinary anatomical variation while &lt;br/&gt;other groups contain many species that look and act similar. To begin to &lt;br/&gt;understand how and why the general phenomenon of unequal diversification &lt;br/&gt;occurs, this research will investigate how and why a specific lineage of &lt;br/&gt;South American fishes related to piranhas and tetras evolved an anatomical &lt;br/&gt;diversity very much greater than that of the lineage of its closest &lt;br/&gt;relatives. This case study is rare and valuable because it approximates a &lt;br/&gt;naturally controlled experiment. Because the two groups of fishes contain &lt;br/&gt;equal numbers of species, share a recent common ancestor (and therefore &lt;br/&gt;began to evolve independently at the same time) and live together &lt;br/&gt;throughout tropical South America, the differences in their diversities &lt;br/&gt;cannot be explained by differences in net speciation rate, age, or &lt;br/&gt;environmental effects.  The removal of these factors leaves at least two &lt;br/&gt;potential explanations of the observed differences in diversity. The &lt;br/&gt;differences may be due to random evolution, or an intrinsic feature of &lt;br/&gt;anatomy or ecology shared only by the more diverse group may promote the &lt;br/&gt;evolution of new morphologies.  This research program will investigate &lt;br/&gt;these two alternatives by 1) using a detailed anatomical study to &lt;br/&gt;reconstruct the genealogical relationships, or "trees-of-life" for these &lt;br/&gt;fishes, 2) measuring the anatomical differences between these species from &lt;br/&gt;an extensive series of x-ray images and 3) performing a novel analysis that &lt;br/&gt;combines the measurements of anatomical differences and trees-of-life with &lt;br/&gt;computer simulations of evolution. This analysis will test whether &lt;br/&gt;diversities as different as those observed could have evolved randomly.  If &lt;br/&gt;the analysis were to reject the hypothesis of random evolution, then it &lt;br/&gt;would be likely that an intrinsic difference drove one group to diversify &lt;br/&gt;greatly while the other did not.  If the second alternative is supported, &lt;br/&gt;this project will identify the anatomical and ecological features most &lt;br/&gt;likely to have catalyzed the evolution of novelties in the more diverse &lt;br/&gt;group. Future studies can then test whether the evolution of similar &lt;br/&gt;properties in other groups of organisms generally promotes the genesis and &lt;br/&gt;maintenance of biodiversity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a broad sense, this study will help reveal why biodiversity is not &lt;br/&gt;distributed equally across the tree-of-life for all organisms. The methods &lt;br/&gt;developed for use in this project are transferable to studies of a wide &lt;br/&gt;variety of other organisms and will be made freely available via the &lt;br/&gt;Internet. This project will also promote international collaboration on the &lt;br/&gt;study of an important group of tropical fishes valued as food throughout &lt;br/&gt;South America, prized for their ornamental beauty worldwide and that serve &lt;br/&gt;important ecological roles as part of the most species-rich freshwater fish &lt;br/&gt;fauna in the world.  Current and potential collaborations include work on &lt;br/&gt;the discovery and description of new species, the building of natural &lt;br/&gt;history collections in the United States and in South America, and &lt;br/&gt;conservation biology. Results from this work also fuel a continuing &lt;br/&gt;dialogue about biodiversity with students and museum visitors through a &lt;br/&gt;series of exhibits and public presentations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
