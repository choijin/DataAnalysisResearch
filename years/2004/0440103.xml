<AbstractNarration>Conveying molecular-level chemistry processes to students is notoriously difficult.  Dynamic, molecular-level animations are used increasingly in chemistry and biology to help students visualize chemical structures and processes. However, animations are often too complex to be accurately perceived, especially by novices, who may not even know where to look or how to interpret what they are seeing.  Animated graphics may even convey or sustain misconceptions about chemical processes. The goals of this project are to reveal how students perceive and interpret various kinds of molecular animations and to develop design principles for creating and presenting effective static graphics and dynamic visualizations in chemistry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal posits that effective animated and static visualizations can be designed. To this end, the proposal applies techniques from cognitive psychology to reveal: a) mental models novices and experts have about key chemical processes, and b) graphic tools that will convey those concepts adequately.  The research has 5 steps, which will be carried out sequentially during the three-year period: 1. In-depth talk-aloud sessions with experts and novices to reveal the mental models; 2. Analysis of attempts by novices and experts to convey key concepts graphically and in language; 3. Extraction of design principles from 1 &amp; 2; 4. Development of animated and static visualization prototypes in which those design principles have been applied; 5. Testing the new visualizations on new students.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To carry out such a wide-ranging project requires expertise in cognitive psychology, in chemistry education, in chemistry, and in the development of animations and visualizations. This project involves collaboration among the disciplines of chemistry, molecular biology, education, and cognitive science to develop research-based design principles for effective molecular animations. The project will provide useful guidelines for the effective design of dynamic molecular visualizations and illustrate them with concrete examples. It will also generate research tools that can be used to study the characteristics of animations and simulations in other scientific fields. Results of the study will allow the developers of all types of molecular visualizations to make informed design decisions and will give instructors a sound pedagogical basis for effective use of molecular animations and simulations. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
