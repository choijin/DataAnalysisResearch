<AbstractNarration>The goal of the proposed exploratory research is to investigate novel polymeric nanoscale pulsed&lt;br/&gt;power capacitor flexible thin films based on the self-assembly of block copolymers. The flexible&lt;br/&gt;pulsed power capacitor system would exhibit a lamellar or cylindrical microphase separation, with&lt;br/&gt;electrode, and polymeric electrolyte as the A and B blocks. The A block (redox cobalt oxide&lt;br/&gt;or p-doped conductive polymer) forms the high surface area electrode material, and the B block&lt;br/&gt;(sulfonated polynorbornene or sulfonated polystyrene) is the electrolyte. Casting of the synthesized&lt;br/&gt;block copolymer from a solvent results in a self-assembled A/B nanostructure, which is equivalent to&lt;br/&gt;many nanoscale capacitor cells in parallel, thus providing the maximum possible power. A variety&lt;br/&gt;of microstructure and electrical properties characterization tools will be employed to evaluate the&lt;br/&gt;flexible pulsed power capacitor system's performance.                                                                                           &lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the proposed exploratory research relate to a block copolymer nanoscale&lt;br/&gt;capacitor device system which would be flexible because it is made out of a polymer, and transparent&lt;br/&gt;to visible light due to the nanoscale dimensions of its morphology. The ease of processing a&lt;br/&gt;polymer electrolyte would allow the production of thin film nanoscale self-assembled flexible pulsed&lt;br/&gt;power capacitors that could be wound into coils or processed as coatings and sheets. A pulsed&lt;br/&gt;power capacitor based on the nanoscale self-assembly of block copolymers will provide devices with&lt;br/&gt;integrated electronics, yet distributed over a large area substrate as freestanding flexible films or&lt;br/&gt;coatings. The active circuit components would be directly integrated on the flexible substrate.&lt;br/&gt;Such supercapacitor system could be applied in power conditioning for directed energy weapon&lt;br/&gt;components. The proposed nanoscale pulsed power capacitor system thus promises to open new&lt;br/&gt;avenues for autonomous power of the all electric ships or airplanes and thus helping enhance&lt;br/&gt;homeland security capabilities. The education activities to be undertaken in this work include&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate and graduate teaching, middle school teacher training, graduate student advising,&lt;br/&gt;and various opportunities in undergraduate research involvement and mentoring.</AbstractNarration>
