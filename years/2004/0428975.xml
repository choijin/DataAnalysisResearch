<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;A means for unobtrusive and ubiquitous detection and monitoring of heart and respiration activity &lt;br/&gt;from  a  distance  could  be  a powerful  tool  for  health  care,  emergency,  and  surveillance  applications,  yet &lt;br/&gt;remains a largely unrealized goal. Without contact or subject preparation (special clothing, attachments, &lt;br/&gt;etc.),  this  could  better  extend  health  monitoring  to  the  chronically  ill  in  routine  life,  allow  wellness &lt;br/&gt;monitoring for a large population without known predisposition for risk or harm, and provide alarm and &lt;br/&gt;data in emergencies. Such technology could also be used to detect lost or hidden subjects, to help assess &lt;br/&gt;emotional  state,  and  to  compliment  more  cumbersome  measurements  as  pre-screening.  Doppler  radar &lt;br/&gt;remote  sensing  of  vital  signs  has  shown  promise  to  this  end,  with  proof  of  concept  demonstrated  for &lt;br/&gt;various applications by the UHM PI.s and others. Unfortunately, this principle has not been developed to &lt;br/&gt;the level of practical application, mainly due to a lack of an effective way to isolate desired target motion &lt;br/&gt;from  interference.  However,  by  leveraging  recent  advances  in  signal  processing  and  wireless &lt;br/&gt;communications  technologies,  this  technique  has  the  potential  to  transcend  mere  novelty  and  make  a &lt;br/&gt;profound impact on health and welfare in society.  &lt;br/&gt;We propose to explore robust radar monitoring techniques by isolating desired radar return signals &lt;br/&gt;from  unwanted  motion  through  recent  developments  in  multiple  input  multiple  output  (MIMO)  signal &lt;br/&gt;processing  techniques,  developed  to  enhance  wireless  communications  channel  capacity  through &lt;br/&gt;constructive use of multipath phenomenon. The approach would involve three primary areas of research: &lt;br/&gt;(1)  development  of  spatial-frequency  algorithms  for  single  and  multiple  source  radar,  (2)  active  radar &lt;br/&gt;system  implementation  using  wireless  terminals  and/or  silicon  radar  chips,  and  (3)  development  of  an &lt;br/&gt;effective .pseudo-passive. sensing system where radio signals in the environment are harnessed for radar &lt;br/&gt;monitoring  without  control  or  specification  of  the  signal  source.  The  project  will  culminate  with  the &lt;br/&gt;demonstration of robust Doppler radar MIMO system capable of isolating and determining the number of &lt;br/&gt;subjects in the monitoring field, and measuring their heart and respiration rates.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;The proposed three-year collaborative research effort between the University of Hawaii at Manoa &lt;br/&gt;(UHM)  and  Bell  laboratories  (BL)  would  explore  techniques  for  making  non-contact  Doppler  radar &lt;br/&gt;sensing  of  cardiopulmonary  activity  a  practical  alternative  or  supplement  to  more  cumbersome  and &lt;br/&gt;invasive  technologies  that  necessarily  limit  application.  Recent  work  by  the  UHM  PI  and  one  Co-PI &lt;br/&gt;(Lubecke)  to  implement  Doppler  sensing  by  leveraging  telecommunications  technology,  including  the &lt;br/&gt;detection of heart and respiration signatures with wireless terminals, has attracted international attention &lt;br/&gt;for  its  potential.  The  second  UHM  Co-PI  (Host-Madsen)  is  an  established  expert  in  statistical  and &lt;br/&gt;communications signal processing with numerous publications in multi-user detection, estimation theory, &lt;br/&gt;and adaptive signal processing. The industry partner, BL, is widely considered the leader in the field of &lt;br/&gt;MIMO  and  other  wireless  systems  technology.  In  related  work,  graduate  students  working  with  the  PI &lt;br/&gt;have won three student paper competition awards in major IEEE MTT and EMB conferences.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: &lt;br/&gt;The outcomes of this project can lead to valuable tools beneficial for society in the areas of health &lt;br/&gt;care, emergency  response,  military,  and  security  operations.  The  research  would  present  a  particularly &lt;br/&gt;motivating educational opportunity that leverages Hawaii.s unique needs for remote healthcare tools, and &lt;br/&gt;reaches out to a diverse population of ethnic minority students that have been historically underserved by &lt;br/&gt;local  educational  and  industrial  opportunities.  Thus,  an  important  aspect  of  this  program  will  be &lt;br/&gt;interactions of UHM students with BL industrial co-advisors, involving extended periods of training in the &lt;br/&gt;highly relevant fields of communications and bio-sensing engineering, beyond the limits of the University &lt;br/&gt;(and Hawaii), at BL in a world-class research environment. The partnership established will allow UHM &lt;br/&gt;students  and  faculty  to  complement  UHM  resources  by  leveraging  BL.s  considerable  expertise  and &lt;br/&gt;facilities without charge, including a broad range of wireless test systems.</AbstractNarration>
