<AbstractNarration>Abstract &lt;br/&gt;Kasparov&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main objective of this project are applications of operator &lt;br/&gt;K-theory to a number of well known problems in topology, harmonic &lt;br/&gt;analysis and index theory. These problems are the Novikov conjecture on &lt;br/&gt;higher signatures of smooth manifolds, the Baum-Connes conjecture in &lt;br/&gt;K-theory of group C*-algebras, the problem of multiplicities of &lt;br/&gt;automorphic forms, index theory for transversally elliptic operators. &lt;br/&gt;Operator K-theory has its origins in the index theory of elliptic &lt;br/&gt;operators, and it is most natural to study elliptic operators, &lt;br/&gt;including transversally elliptic operators, using operator K-theory. &lt;br/&gt;Also operator K-theory is a very suitable tool in applications related &lt;br/&gt;to geometric group actions, which makes it exceptionally useful for &lt;br/&gt;problems like the Novikov and the Baum-Connes conjectures. &lt;br/&gt;Multiplicities of automorphic forms is another topic where operator &lt;br/&gt;K-theory gives new approaches to old problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development of quantum mechanics in the 20th century has led to the &lt;br/&gt;creation  of the theory of operators in Hilbert space and later to the &lt;br/&gt;creation of the theory of C*-algebras. The theory of C*-algebras is &lt;br/&gt;closely related with the contemporary field theory in physics, as well &lt;br/&gt;as with geometry, topology, Lie group representation theory, etc. &lt;br/&gt;Operator K-theory came to the C*-algebra theory from topology and grew &lt;br/&gt;out into a highly powerful tool. Nowadays, operator K-theory is part of &lt;br/&gt;the non-commutative geometry which is a synthesis of analysis and &lt;br/&gt;geometry with wide applications in many areas of mathematics and &lt;br/&gt;theoretical physics. The emphasis of the present project is on the &lt;br/&gt;applications of operator K-theory to several well known problems in &lt;br/&gt;analysis and topology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
