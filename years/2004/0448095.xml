<AbstractNarration>This Career Development Plan is focused on Metric Embeddings, a powerful area of algorithms research. Interest in embeddings stems from their broad algorithmic applicability; they are being used extensively to&lt;br/&gt;obtain solutions and design algorithms that are simple, elegant and versatile. The use of metric embeddings has often allowed ad-hoc methods to be replaced by powerful general principles, and has suggested new&lt;br/&gt;approaches to tackle long-standing open problems. The impact of these techniques can be seen on problems in finding graph separators, data clustering, network design, streaming computation, and geometric and&lt;br/&gt;on-line algorithms, to name but a few. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research intends to focus on the algorithmic theory of embeddings in the context of these applications. Informally, an embedding is a map of an arbitrary metric space into a ``simpler'' one which does not alter &lt;br/&gt;distances by much, and the focus of this research is on two natural and fundamental themes: (a) to investigate the complexity of metric spaces from an algorithmic perspective, and to use this to develop efficient &lt;br/&gt;algorithms, and (b) to develop embeddings that simplify metrics; i.e. embed general metric spaces to well-understood simpler ones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal offers a broad spectrum of research opportunities at both graduate and undergraduate levels: these include the investigation of theoretical principles, the development of algorithms and embeddings, &lt;br/&gt;and the implementation and experimental evaluation of these results. Progress in this research will influence the curriculum via special courses presenting theoretical advances along with their applications. &lt;br/&gt;Workshops and seminars will be used to promote interdisciplinary research.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
