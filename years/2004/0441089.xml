<AbstractNarration>The goal of the present research is to develop an exploratory program addressing the communication patterns of groups and communities in social networks. The interplay between network topology and communication will be investigated through extensive data collection efforts, capturing the detailed time dependent communication activity of each individual. Building on these measurements, the investigators will explore the basic mechanisms that govern community and group formation and the associated communication patterns. Particular attention will be paid to time dependent changes in the community structure and determining the likelihood of a given community's emergence, thereby distinguishing common from rare communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With interdependencies developing in most technological, informational and social systems, networks are on everybody's mind these days. Previously unconnected computers and devices are being linked up; formerly scattered information is reorganized in consolidated databases; geographically isolated people with common interests form new virtual communities. The benefits of networks come with inevitable vulnerabilities, as local errors can propagate along the links, turning into global failures. Examples range from the recent Northeast blackout to computer and biological virus induced damages. Fighting terrorism also raises a number of novel networking problems, ranging from the discovery of terrorist cells to devising strategies to cripple an illegal organization. To advance the understanding of complex interconnected systems, the proposed research will develop a deep and quantitative description of the laws that govern the formation and function of communities in social networks and the standard communication patterns between individuals. The obtained results could have a strong impact on  national security, and could have long range economic impact through the development of better tools to explore social networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is supported jointly by the NSF and the Intelligence Community. The Approaches to Terrorism program in the Directorate for Mathematics and Physical Sciences supports new concepts in basic research and workforce development with the potential to contribute to national security.</AbstractNarration>
