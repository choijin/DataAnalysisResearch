<AbstractNarration>AST-0407176&lt;br/&gt;Cen&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent observations from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey together suggest that the universal reionization may be prolonged and much more complex than previously thought.  This research will systematically study all of the astrophysical processes relevant to the universal reionization and heating process, to set up a working framework for proper interpretation of major observations of the high redshift universe.  Semi-analytic methods and state-of-the-art hydrodynamical and radiation hydrodynamical simulations will be used both for this, and to focus on gaining a fuller understanding of star formation at high redshift.  Informed comparison between observations and theoretical predictions should help with working out the correct cosmological model. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will feed into a continuing outreach program intended to enhance the scientific understanding of cosmological research by the general public.  Results will be visualized and presented through various channels, including planetaria and public television.  The technological demand of the simulations will also test advances in high performance computing.</AbstractNarration>
