<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;The objective of control is to in .uence the behavior of dynamical systems.Achiev-&lt;br/&gt;ing fast and accurate control under di .erent environmental conditions,even while&lt;br/&gt;assuring stability and robustness,is the aim of all control system design.When&lt;br/&gt;environmental changes are signi .cant (e.g.faults o subsystem failures)the design&lt;br/&gt;may equire the use of multiple controllers,each of which is appropriate in a speci .c&lt;br/&gt;context.By a switching system we mean a hybrid dynamical system with a decision&lt;br/&gt;mechanism which orchestrates the switching between di .erent controllers.With great&lt;br/&gt;advances in computer technology,and the concomitant increase in the complexity of&lt;br/&gt;dynamical systems,switching system are becoming ubiquitous.The analysis and&lt;br/&gt;synthesis of such systems is consequently assuming major importance.&lt;br/&gt;Stability is the primary equirement of any control system.Once this is assured,&lt;br/&gt;optimization of the performance of the overall system can be undertaken within a&lt;br/&gt;framework of stability.Following this,modi .cations in the control laws can be un-&lt;br/&gt;dertaken to make the system robust under di .erent perturbations.This is the basic&lt;br/&gt;philosophy used in conventional control system design as well as in this proposal.&lt;br/&gt;Even though research on switching systems has been in progress for many years and&lt;br/&gt;numerous contributions have been made to the .eld,basic questions still remain unan-&lt;br/&gt;swered.For example the stability of many classes of linear,nonlinear,and adaptive&lt;br/&gt;switching systems still remains to be answered,and very little progress has been made&lt;br/&gt;in shaping the transient response resulting from the switching action.Both of these&lt;br/&gt;important issues are included in the proposal.&lt;br/&gt;The proposal consists of three parts.Since stability is undoubtedly the most impor-&lt;br/&gt;tant unresolved issue,the .rst part of the proposal is devoted to it.Switching between&lt;br/&gt;general linear time-invariant systems and positive linear systems is treated in this con-&lt;br/&gt;text.Special attention is given to systems with diagonal Lyapunov functions in view&lt;br/&gt;of their importance to switching in decentralized systems.Also treated are piecewise&lt;br/&gt;linear systems which are practically important and theoretically tractable.Following&lt;br/&gt;this,in the second part of the proposal,the performance that can be achieved by&lt;br/&gt;switching is considered.The third and last part of the proposal is devoted to switch-&lt;br/&gt;ing in adaptive systems.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The PI believes that the research proposed addresses funda-&lt;br/&gt;mental questions whose solutions are essential for a better understanding of switching&lt;br/&gt;systems.This in turn is vital for the design of future control systems.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The esearch proposed will enhance collaboration between the&lt;br/&gt;PI and other international esearchers (particularly Dr.Robert Shorten at the Hamil-&lt;br/&gt;ton Institute,Ireland and Dr.Jens Kalkuhl of Daimler-Chrysler Research),lead to&lt;br/&gt;increased interaction with industry,and most important of all,provide training to&lt;br/&gt;both graduate and undergraduate students on advanced control techniques.&lt;br/&gt;1</AbstractNarration>
