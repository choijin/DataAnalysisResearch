<AbstractNarration>The focus on polyelectrolyte and colloidal nanoparticle materials is timely, given the interest in nanoscale science and technology. This conference to be held in conjunction with the 227th National American Chemical Society meeting, March 2004,  will cover a range of materials topics which are fundamental or technological in nature.  The major aims of this conference is to bring together academic and industrial scientists,  students, researchers to report on the emerging field of colloidal and polyelectrolyte assemblies as applied to ultrathin film materials. These topics include: polyelectrolyte assemblies, nanoparticle . polymer systems, colloidal particles and assemblies, supramolecular structures, functional ultrathin films, patterning and devices. Primarily the unique role of interfaces and self-assembly mechanisms will be emphasized. The conference will also highlight new characterization methods of these materials as well as synthesis. Already, some of the new interesting topics that have been reported recently  includes: 1) .sensors based on patterned polyelectrolyte layer-by-layer assemblies of  quantum dot nanoparticles, 2) .nanoparticles on colloidal particles prepared using layer-by-layer assemblies for biomarkers:, 3) .in-situ nanoparticle growth on polyelectrolyte block copolymer amphiphiles.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:  Polyelectrolytes are capable of directing highly ordered assemblies and supramolecular structures based primarily on polymer chain dynamics, electrostatic interactions, and solution conditions. Introducing metal and inorganic nanoparticles with their inherent quantum size effects in both colloids and ultrathin films with polyelectrolytes results in hybrid organic-inorganic materials with unique order and function. The conference will also cover recent applications in electronic displays and bio-applications. The resulting cross-fertilization and varying perspectives will provide a stimulating atmosphere for critical insight and new research initiatives. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The unique feature of this symposium is that it brings together scientists working in the areas of polymer materials, interfacial phenomena, and nanoscience. This means that scientists from diverse fields can contribute different view points and discussions on the current challenges and opportunities of these hybrid polymer materials and their future growth.  The focus on inviting young scientists, students, and international researchers from abroad will offer a unique opportunity for US scientists in having a broad perspective of this type of materials research and learn about emerging fields and research leads. This will lead to increasing internationalism in materials research and mutually benefit researchers worldwide. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
