    <AbstractNarration>As multimedia processing and networking technologies, products and&lt;br/&gt;services evolve, the number of people communicating interactively&lt;br/&gt;is growing rapidly. Consequently, multimedia communication&lt;br/&gt;services are starting to consume a considerable share of the&lt;br/&gt;backbone traffic. This highlights the problem of transmitting&lt;br/&gt;real-time media efficiently. Effective multimedia communication&lt;br/&gt;demands appropriate media-aware and application-specific&lt;br/&gt;solutions, without which the full benefits of such services will&lt;br/&gt;not be realized. Poor approaches often lead to such system&lt;br/&gt;performance degradations as unacceptable presentation quality&lt;br/&gt;perceived by the clients, possible network collapse due to the&lt;br/&gt;high-bandwidth nature of multimedia applications, and poor&lt;br/&gt;performance observed by other network flows due to the&lt;br/&gt;unresponsiveness of such applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Given the fact that existing protocol suites are unable to provide&lt;br/&gt;the desired features, the study of media-aware transport protocols&lt;br/&gt;is overdue. The focus of this research is on the design and&lt;br/&gt;evaluation of end-to-end solutions for reliable multimedia&lt;br/&gt;services. Nonetheless, it is a challenging task to develop a&lt;br/&gt;generic solution that can satisfy the needs of the broad range of&lt;br/&gt;multimedia applications available today. Such an approach would&lt;br/&gt;result either in an unnecessarily complicated protocol that is far&lt;br/&gt;beyond real implementation or in a very high-level one that cannot&lt;br/&gt;exploit the specific features of the media. The investigators' aim&lt;br/&gt;is to develop a suite of Multimedia Transport Protocols (MMTP)&lt;br/&gt;that integrate media properties, application requirements, and&lt;br/&gt;network characteristics in such a way that the presentation&lt;br/&gt;quality is optimal in the rate-distortion sense.</AbstractNarration>
