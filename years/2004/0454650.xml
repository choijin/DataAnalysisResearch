    <AbstractNarration>Commercial use of genetically modified conifers is now underway with &lt;br/&gt;field trials concentrated in the southern United States. Opposition has &lt;br/&gt;ranged from requests for a planting moratorium to threats of &lt;br/&gt;ecoterrorism. This tension will only grow as genomics continues to &lt;br/&gt;provide gene discovery available for genetic modification. Similarly, &lt;br/&gt;policy has not progressed as fast as technology. By default, &lt;br/&gt;agricultural policies cover forest management in the US yet few decision &lt;br/&gt;makers are clear about the many ways in which genetically modified &lt;br/&gt;forests deviate from GM food crops. Balanced, open dialogue is needed to &lt;br/&gt;find common-interest solutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2004 Nicholas School Forum at Duke University will open dialogue &lt;br/&gt;about genetic composition of US forests. Attendees will identify &lt;br/&gt;emerging issues for forest genomics portfolios, ecosystem interface, &lt;br/&gt;landowners, regulations and community perspective. The forum has &lt;br/&gt;attracted inclusive participation by science writers, employees of &lt;br/&gt;biotechnology firms and timber corporations, non-government activists, &lt;br/&gt;students, university faculty, state and federal government officials and &lt;br/&gt;foresters. Eminent international speakers will broaden perspective on &lt;br/&gt;this regional and national issue. Forum organizer Claire Williams and &lt;br/&gt;her colleagues will complete an edited volume entitled 'Landscapes, &lt;br/&gt;Genomics and Transgenic Conifer Forests' to be published by &lt;br/&gt;Kluwer-Springer by summer 2005. Our participatory forum on genetically &lt;br/&gt;modified conifers is designed to catalyze similar venues in the US and &lt;br/&gt;other countries.</AbstractNarration>
