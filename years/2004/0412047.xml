<AbstractNarration>Ruan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator studies the effect of spatial heterogeneity,&lt;br/&gt;nonlocal interactions and time delay on the spatiotemporal&lt;br/&gt;dynamics of epidemiological and ecological models.  Three&lt;br/&gt;particular examples are considered.  The first is the generalized&lt;br/&gt;Ross-Macdonald vector-host (malaria) models.  The focus here is&lt;br/&gt;on the existence of traveling waves in a vector disease model&lt;br/&gt;described by diffusive integrodifferential equations with delay&lt;br/&gt;and the effects of nonlocal interaction and time delay on the&lt;br/&gt;epidemic waves and spatiotemporal dynamics.  The effects of&lt;br/&gt;spatial heterogeneity and time delay on the establishment and&lt;br/&gt;transmission of the disease are studied by considering a&lt;br/&gt;multi-patch model.  The second is nosocomial epidemic models with&lt;br/&gt;antibiotic resistance and infection age.  Persistence and&lt;br/&gt;extinction of the infected population are considered.  The impact&lt;br/&gt;of control measures such as isolation of patients infected with&lt;br/&gt;resistant strains, restricted use of antibiotics, and reduced or&lt;br/&gt;extended hospital stays, are discussed in terms of the model&lt;br/&gt;parameters.  The third is the biological and physical&lt;br/&gt;nutrient-phytoplankton-zooplankton (NPZ) models.  The&lt;br/&gt;investigator studies spatiotemporal dynamics such as traveling&lt;br/&gt;waves and chaotic mixing in the advective-diffusive NPZ models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the most important environmental effects of globalization&lt;br/&gt;is the dramatic increase in the introduction of exotic species,&lt;br/&gt;including pathogens that may cause disease in humans, into new&lt;br/&gt;regions.  Such introductions can lead to biological invasions,&lt;br/&gt;which in turn can threaten public health or affect ecosystem&lt;br/&gt;structure.  Examples include nonindigenous vectors that arrive,&lt;br/&gt;establish, and spread in new areas and foment epidemics of human&lt;br/&gt;diseases such as malaria, yellow fever, typhus, plague, and West&lt;br/&gt;Nile virus.  The investigator studies the spatial transmission of&lt;br/&gt;certain vector-host diseases such as malaria and hopes that the&lt;br/&gt;study can help to understand the establishment and spread of&lt;br/&gt;other vector-borne diseases such as West Nile.  He also studies&lt;br/&gt;nosocomial epidemics with antibiotic resistance, aiming to&lt;br/&gt;provide some control measures to combat such epidemics inside&lt;br/&gt;hospitals.  Finally, he examines the spatiotemporal dynamics of&lt;br/&gt;plankton populations; this may lead to a better understanding of&lt;br/&gt;global issues such as the depletion of ocean fish markets and the&lt;br/&gt;greenhouse effect.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
