<AbstractNarration>Most bone forms in one of two ways: through a cartilage model (endochondral &lt;br/&gt;bone) or directly in the skin (dermal bone).  Turtle shells and crocodile &lt;br/&gt;scutes are formed of dermal bone, and although some aspects of their &lt;br/&gt;development are well understood, it is not clear how their development is &lt;br/&gt;initiated.  Some researchers have proposed that these bones come from a tissue &lt;br/&gt;called the neural crest; however, this origin has not been demonstrated.  The &lt;br/&gt;neural crest is a tissue formed in the ectoderm of the vertebrate embryo that &lt;br/&gt;contributes the dermal bones of the skull.  A separate embryonic tissue, the &lt;br/&gt;mesoderm, contributes endochondral bone to the skull and forms the rest of the &lt;br/&gt;skeleton.  This study investigates gene expression as a means to trace the &lt;br/&gt;contribution of neural crest and mesoderm to turtle shells and crocodile &lt;br/&gt;scutes.  Genes expressed in neural crest or mesoderm in other vertebrate &lt;br/&gt;animals will be studied as potential markers for these tissues in turtle and &lt;br/&gt;alligator embryos using RNA hybridization techniques.  The importance of this &lt;br/&gt;study for systematics lies in its assessment of the evolutionary developmental &lt;br/&gt;origin of dermal bone.  It may also aid in understanding the evolutionary &lt;br/&gt;relationships of turtles to other reptiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study harnesses approaches from evolutionary biology and molecular &lt;br/&gt;biology to analyze a very old problem in new terms.  Normally, studies using &lt;br/&gt;these methods are performed on model systems, such as fruit flies, frogs, &lt;br/&gt;chickens, or mice.  By using turtles and alligators, this study expands the &lt;br/&gt;knowledge and technical resources that can be used for the study of &lt;br/&gt;evolutionary history.  The doctoral student is a Hispanic female, her training &lt;br/&gt;is broad, and she disseminates her work through seminars, courses, scientific &lt;br/&gt;meetings, and the worldwide web.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
