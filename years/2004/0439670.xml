<AbstractNarration>OIA-0439670&lt;br/&gt;Mazza&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The National Academies' Science, Technology and Law Program will convene a committee to organize a series of regional meetings on university campuses to discuss recent federal policies aimed at maintaining a strong research partnership in an era of heightened security concerns.  Recent changes in visa policies, the publication review process, and the role of foreign students and faculty are having different effects throughout the country, however the cumulative impact of these changes have not been examined.  The meetings and the associated report will be extremely useful to policy makers in determining measures to maintain the nation's strong research and education enterprise while providing necessary security procedures.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
