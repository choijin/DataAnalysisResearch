    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes to develop and validate highly sensitive contrasting agents in-vivo, for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) diagnosis, based on a series of novel nano-sized ferromagnets. Prior Phase I work used combinatorial chemistry to synthesize magnetic nanoparticles with significantly enhanced magnetic resonance signal and sensitivity than currently available paramagnetic contrasting agents. The specific objectives of Phase II research are to further optimize the nano-magnet cores with combinatorial chemistry , to functionalize their surfaces for in-vitro imaging of cells, to validate the newly developed contrasting agents in comparative animal MRI studies against products in use, and to evaluate their toxicity effects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial application of this project will be in the area of whole-body imaging techniques. The proposed technology will enable superior medical images to be taken at significantly higher throughput and sensitivity, and at a lower cost. Further, it may allow for new medical diagnosis-imaging applications using magnetic resonance (for example, in the early detection and prevention of cardiovascular disease).</AbstractNarration>
