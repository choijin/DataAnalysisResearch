<AbstractNarration>Why do university students exit courses capable of solving difficult &lt;br/&gt;analytic problems (e.g., calculate current in a complex circuit), but &lt;br/&gt;are unable to explain the same content conceptually (e.g., which light &lt;br/&gt;bulb is brighter in such a circuit)? Which educational activities &lt;br/&gt;address this challenge and why?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Building on the well-established foundations of physics education &lt;br/&gt;research that have focused on student cognition, curriculum design and &lt;br/&gt;course practices, this research program establishes another perspective &lt;br/&gt;from which we may understand student learning in physics: one that &lt;br/&gt;emphasizes learning in context. That is, how and what students learn &lt;br/&gt;depends not only on traditionally conceived content but also upon the &lt;br/&gt;formation of tasks, class environments, and broader institutional &lt;br/&gt;structures in which the content is embedded. Such a perspective begins &lt;br/&gt;to explain a host of research questions, such as the one listed above, &lt;br/&gt;and is directed at understanding sustainable and scalable models of &lt;br/&gt;reform in physics education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project coordinates two levels of research on the role of context &lt;br/&gt;in student learning: the level of individual students and the level of &lt;br/&gt;course activities. Many of the associated research questions are new in &lt;br/&gt;physics (e.g., examining the effects of having students teach others in &lt;br/&gt;order to learn) while others augment existing lines of research (e.g., &lt;br/&gt;the role of computer simulations in the classroom). Collectively, these &lt;br/&gt;investigations provide a framework for understanding each of the &lt;br/&gt;individual research studies, as well as the portability of the results &lt;br/&gt;of these studies to other environments. Furthermore, their coordinated &lt;br/&gt;outcomes will result in meaningful models of context in student &lt;br/&gt;learning, which will serve as the foundation for long-term research in &lt;br/&gt;this area. This research is designed to improve educational practices &lt;br/&gt;in physics and to better understand how to make them sustainable and &lt;br/&gt;scalable.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
