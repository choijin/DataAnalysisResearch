<AbstractNarration>AST-0406587&lt;br/&gt;Kashlinsky&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cosmic infrared background (CIB) arises from accumulated emissions from early galaxy populations spanning a large range of redshifts. This research will measure and study the anisotropies in the CIB by using both ground-based and space-based archival data.  After careful processing of these data to create a reliable, uncontaminated map of the CIB, the spatial correlation function and the spatial power spectrum calculated therefrom will be modeled using synthetic data sets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will be carried out at a minority woman-owned small business, in collaboration with academic institutions, and using an online education resource (http://www.theastronomycafe.net) that has been recommended by the American Association for the Advancement of Science.  The team has already employed high school students through their working relationship with area schools, and this activity will continue, and may expand.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
