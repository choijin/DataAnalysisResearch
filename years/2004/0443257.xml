<AbstractNarration>   The optical network is a promising high-speed backbone or transportation network that requires&lt;br/&gt;an extremely caution in operations. The reconfiguration is one of the indispensable operations if a&lt;br/&gt;virtual topology no longer serves a traffic demand which is changed over time.&lt;br/&gt;   We propose to develop an algorithm and a complete reconfiguration model for wavelengthrouted&lt;br/&gt;optical networks which includes the reconfiguration process and the policy. The reconfiguration&lt;br/&gt;process provides the choices of the reconfiguration operations (e.g., add, delete or re-route&lt;br/&gt;lightpaths) to maintain the high performance of the network in any traffic demand volumes and&lt;br/&gt;patterns while minimally disturbs the current virtual topology. The reconfiguration policy defines&lt;br/&gt;which choice to be selected that returns the optimal expected outcome based on the cost of operation&lt;br/&gt;and the performance reward. We have preliminary experimental results that show that selecting&lt;br/&gt;the choice with the highest immediate outcome does not return the optimal expected outcome in&lt;br/&gt;the long term.&lt;br/&gt;   Although the reconfiguration problem is an NP-hard problem and is a trade-off between performance&lt;br/&gt;and number of changes in virtual topology, we can still find the solutions using a multiobjective&lt;br/&gt;evolutionary algorithm with the concept of Pareto Optimal. The algorithm provides a set&lt;br/&gt;of solutions in the Pareto front while the policy picks one of solutions in the Pareto front that gains&lt;br/&gt;the optimal expected outcome. The policy depends on the pattern of traffic. If the future pattern&lt;br/&gt;of traffic can be predicted or estimated, the Markov Decision Process (MDP) can define the policy.&lt;br/&gt;However, the status of network or the MDP's state which effects the Pareto front needs an intensive&lt;br/&gt;study.&lt;br/&gt;   Our goal is to develop the theory and algorithms in accordance with realistic traffic demand and&lt;br/&gt;protocol. The model will be the centralized control over the network, which will not be designed&lt;br/&gt;only for the specific performance objective or traffic type but be applicable for various objectives&lt;br/&gt;and traffic types. The development of practical algorithms for solving these problems represent an&lt;br/&gt;important step in allowing reasonable scale implementation of optical networks.&lt;br/&gt;   Intellectual Merit of the proposed research rests on the integration between the reconfiguration&lt;br/&gt;process and the policy based on the Pareto optimal concept and MDP that has not yet happened in&lt;br/&gt;the Optical network reconfiguration field. Reconfiguration problems are among the most difficult&lt;br/&gt;in the areas of optical networks since such problems encompass the construction of algorithms&lt;br/&gt;involving the extremely high-speed communication over an optical fiber. The consequence problem&lt;br/&gt;is how or when to perform the reconfiguration process. From the practical application viewpoint,&lt;br/&gt;we want to advance our model to the practical optical networks.&lt;br/&gt;   Broader Impacts of the proposed research is expected to be strong since we are proposing&lt;br/&gt;to integrate two disciplines, the evolutionary computing and the stochastic process for the recon-&lt;br/&gt;figuration in the optical networks. We expect that the work will have broad impact in industrial&lt;br/&gt;practices on network provisioning, protection and restoration areas.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
