<AbstractNarration>Sign languages of the Deaf have extensive lexical inventories and use complex morphological and syntactic constructions like vocally produced languages do. However, unlike the production of spoken words, some categories of signs must be directed or placed in gradient meaningful ways. The American Sign Language (ASL) verb ASK, for example, must be directed toward the one asked - if present. There is no grammatical parallel for this in speech.  When not physically present, signers conceptualize space as though missing entities were present. Several conventionalized ways of conceptualizing non-present entities as present have been identified. Once the one asked is conceptualized as present, ASK could be directed toward that spatially conceptualized entity.  Although required and meaningful, these gradient aspects of signing are not symbolic. Thus, the ASL language signal includes gradience and gesture overlaid on symbolic signs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study examines the signing of two-, four-, and six-year-old Deaf children acquiring ASL. How these children direct signs when referents are physically present reveals the children's awareness of the spatial requirements of these signs.  How children direct these signs when entities are missing provides evidence of the children's developing abilities to conceptualize space. The analysis should reveal an interaction between the developing ability to meaningfully direct signs and the developing ability to conceptualize missing entities as present.  This research should shed light on the interaction of grammar, gesture and spatial conceptualization in the acquisition of ASL and thereby provide valuable new insights into the acquisition of a language that goes beyond lexicon and grammar.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
