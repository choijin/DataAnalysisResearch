<AbstractNarration>Proposal Number:  CTS-0450050&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Donald G. Baird&lt;br/&gt;Institution: VA Polytechnic Inst &amp; St U&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The grant provides funds for travel to England (Leeds University) for a planning meeting to develop a cooperative research program (joint NSF/EPSRC) with colleagues in Europe(Leeds University and the University of Athens). The title of the proposed program is.  Design of Long Chain Branched Metallocene-Catalyzed Polyethylene for Optimum Processing and Properties. Although efforts will be made to draft the proposal before the meeting, funds are requested for travel to Leeds University in early October to complete details of the cooperative proposal. At least three days of intense work will be needed to finalize the proposals and ensure that the cooperative effort is fully developed. Funds for a follow up trip are requested in the event additional work is needed to complete the proposals or to travel to Greece in the event Professor Hadijichristidis can.t attend the working and planning meeting in Leeds. Only by meeting on a face-to-face basis can the proposals be thoroughly interfaced.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The colleagues in England are the worlds experts in molecular theory for branched and entangled polymers while those in Greece are the leaders in metallocene-catalysts and generation of branching topology. Their expertise coupled with that of the PI in extensional rheology and polymer processing will allow us to develop predictive models for determining polymerization conditions which will lead to molecules with the desired branching topology for optimum processing performance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:  The ability to travel to Leeds to thoroughly develop the cooperative research program will enhance the chances of generating a successful proposal. The proposed research is of great practical value as it will allow industry to eliminate lengthy experimental programs using statistically designed experiments for determining the desired branching topology which will provide the optimum processing performance and properties. The results of the research should allow companies in the U.S. and Europe to compete better with the world in the polyethylene market. The ability to keep graduate students at the forefront of molecular theories for polymer flow and their applications will be considerably enhanced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
