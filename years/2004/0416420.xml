<AbstractNarration>Each year federal governmental bureaucracies are given broad authority by Congress to  implement public policies that range from welfare reform to civil rights enforcement.  Despite  the importance of bureaucratic decisions on issues that affect minorities, most race and  representation scholars have neglected to include this policy-making activity in their analysis of  substantive representation.  Instead most have focused on roll call voting as the primary measure  of representation.  This project demonstrates that scholars. inattention to legislative intervention  in agency policy-making systematically understates minority members' responsiveness on issues  that disproportionately affect racial and ethnic minorities.  As a result of racial or ethnic group  identity, Black and Latino legislators are more likely (relative to Whites) to intervene in agency  actions relating to civil rights enforcement.     &lt;br/&gt;This project improves upon the limitations of earlier studies by using a combination of  quantitative and qualitative methods to examine the effects of race or ethnicity in a less visible  activity such as committee oversight of agency policies.  These methods include a detailed  content analysis of congressional oversight hearings and a series of elite interviews with  legislators and their staff from the 107th Congress (2001-2002).  These data gauge legislators.  intensity  by examining the amount of time, energy and resources that individual legislators  invest in ensuring that bureaucracies are implementing civil rights laws, rules and regulations.   &lt;br/&gt; The study expands the conceptualization of substantive representation from an exclusive focus  on legislators. roll call voting behavior to one that includes their actions in non-bill related  activities such as rulemaking and policy implementation.  Additionally, the project shows that  racial or ethnic identities of legislators are significant in determining why they pay high costs to  intervene in agency policy-making.  &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  The research provides insight to policy-makers and  scholars by assessing whether racial redistricting measures, designed to get more minorities  elected to Congress, translate into enhanced substantive representation of minority interests.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
