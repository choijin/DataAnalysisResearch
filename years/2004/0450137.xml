The intellectual merit of our alliance has been to draw upon and expand our participating institutionsÆ large existing communities of URM STEM scholar/researcher/teacher/mentors and student apprentice/scholar/researcher/ teacher/prot&eacute;g&eacute;s working collaboratively to further structure and sustain a research-based "hot house" environment to create widespread regional systemic change with dramatically positive national implications and repercussions.

We have strong reason to believe that our MGE@MSA AGEP alliance is a national model for the strengthening and diversification of STEM faculty to ensure that the U.S. will continue to lead the world in research and technology despite the increasingly intense global competition of the 21st century.  For example:  By the tenth and final year of Phase II our MGE@MSA AGEP alliance we had an alliance yearly total of 94 underrepresented STEM doctoral graduations, an increase of 6% from the previous year. Our annual rate is now 409% of the original Phase I Baseline.  In total, MGE@MSA participating underrepresented STEM doctoral students published at least 385 research articles in peer- reviewed STEM academic journals.  MGE@MSA AGEP alliance, our MGE@MSA participating underrepresented STEM doctoral students made at least 1,490 presentations of their research at academic research conferences.
