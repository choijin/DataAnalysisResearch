    <AbstractNarration>Professors Jiri Janata and Miroslawa Josowicz of Georgia Tech University are supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry program to work on "chemically-sensitive field-effect transistors" (CHEMFET). The idea is to tune organic semiconductors for optimization of their electron transfer properties for use as gas sensors and novel devices for information processing. The group has previously utilized chemical, electrochemical and photochemical means to change the Fermi level of the solid, with most studies focusing on polyaniline. The group is now pursuing other properties needed in a sensor, for example, long term stability and fast response time of the selective layer. The use of additional secondary dopants is being explored, including ionic liquids. A magnetic quartz crystal microbalance (MQCM) is being developed to simultaneously monitor changes in magnetic spin density and the mass dopant uptake by the solid. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Organic electronics is a new technological area that offers a wide range of applications not feasible with conventional silicon electronics. However, understanding and controlling the chemical environmental factors is critical for both solid-state sensors and organic electronics intended for signal and information processing. Additionally, new chemical sensors are required to detect ambient vapors. Inexpensive, long-lasting and easily manufactured gas sensors are needed in the interest of national security, for example.</AbstractNarration>
