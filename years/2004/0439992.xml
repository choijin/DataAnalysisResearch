<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;Mountain building by continent-continent collision is the most&lt;br/&gt;important orogenic process on Earth whose mechanism is not&lt;br/&gt;well understood.  The collision between India and Asia is the&lt;br/&gt;largest region of such collision and has produced the world's most&lt;br/&gt;spectacular topography. Within this region, the Tibetan Plateau&lt;br/&gt;stands out as a natural laboratory in which we can test hypotheses&lt;br/&gt;regarding a fundamental process that has impacted continental&lt;br/&gt;dynamics.  Collision models, obtained in various studies, predict&lt;br/&gt;significantly different upper-mantle structure beneath the plateau.&lt;br/&gt;The upper mantle, therefore, holds a key to differentiating between&lt;br/&gt;possible collisional models and to unraveling how this archetype&lt;br/&gt;of plateaus came into being.  The objective of this research is&lt;br/&gt;to determine high resolution 3-D upper-mantle P and S velocity&lt;br/&gt;structure beneath the Tibetan Plateau and neighboring regions.&lt;br/&gt;The PIs will collect and process available seismic waveform&lt;br/&gt;data of more than 300 broadband stations in the study area from&lt;br/&gt;earthquakes in the upper-mantle distance range.  These studies&lt;br/&gt;should provide much improved lateral and depth resolution in the&lt;br/&gt;upper mantle than it has been possible in all previous studies.&lt;br/&gt;The results of the proposed study can be used to verify or dismiss&lt;br/&gt;existing collision models and to develop new ones.  The research&lt;br/&gt;topic is also closely related to several undergraduate and graduate&lt;br/&gt;courses (plate tectonics and geodynamics) that the PI is currently&lt;br/&gt;developing and teaching at SLU.  The proposed research involves&lt;br/&gt;collaboration between Saint Louis University and the Institute of&lt;br/&gt;Geophysics, Chinese Earthquake Administration.  It will use seismic&lt;br/&gt;data collected by several multi-national (China, France, Germany,&lt;br/&gt;USA, etc) projects in Tibet.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
