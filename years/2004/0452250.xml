<AbstractNarration>Understanding the foundations of political liberalism has become one of most critical issues of the past fifteen years. Countries that are not democracies or that are in transition face global pressures to build moderate states via independent, competent judiciaries, to permit the opening of civil society, and to institute and protect core rights against state oppression. These elements of political liberalism are also relevant for mature democracies as they confront the growth of the administrative state, threats to their security, and potential erosion of well-entrenched civil rights.   This project seeks to understand the impact of the legal complex (configurations of lawyers, judges, legal academics) on advances towards or retreats from political liberalism over recent decades. It does so in several ways: by examining their salience to contemporary political transitions; by broadening the scope of countries to East Asia, Africa, Central and Eastern Europe, and Latin America; by juxtaposing mature democracies with new democracies, transitional regimes, and illiberal regimes; and by drawing the dynamics of lawyers, judges, and legal academics into the same explanatory frame.  The research enterprise brings together approximately twenty specialists on law and politics for particular countries to produce case studies of the legal complex and liberalism. The project is a collective effort where participants will deliberate intensively in two conferences to compare and contrast cases and to develop jointly new concepts and theory that can embrace the diversity of cases.  The project will produce one or more books and some articles that are tightly integrated around the theoretical framework that is developed collectively, and is intended as a stepping-stone more extensive and systematic inquiry, including quantitative analysis, worldwide.</AbstractNarration>
