    <AbstractNarration>The North American Paleontological Convention (NAPC) is a quadrennial gathering of&lt;br/&gt;paleontologists from a variety of disciplines. The meeting planned for June 19 through&lt;br/&gt;June 26, 2005 at Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia will be the eighth NAPC. Each&lt;br/&gt;previous convention has been judged an excellent opportunity for the presentation of the&lt;br/&gt;results of new research and for discussions of current areas of paleontological research.&lt;br/&gt;One aim of NAPC is to allow specialists who would not otherwise normally be in contact to&lt;br/&gt;meet and exchange ideas. For example, micropaleontologists and vertebrate paleontologists&lt;br/&gt;have different professional societies that meet at different times, yet some members of&lt;br/&gt;these two groups work on fossils from the same rock units. Based on past experience, the&lt;br/&gt;Organizing Committee for NAPC-2005 expects that more than 500 professionals will attend&lt;br/&gt;and interact during three days of meetings and on several field trips. NAPC provides an&lt;br/&gt;outstanding educational opportunity to obtain focused presentations of paleontological&lt;br/&gt;information from talks and poster presentations without the other distractions presented&lt;br/&gt;at a general geological meeting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Organizing Committee believes that the continued interest of students is critical to&lt;br/&gt;the health of the field. Not only will students maintain the study of past life, they are&lt;br/&gt;the ones who will provide fresh approaches and examine old fossils with new eyes. NAPC&lt;br/&gt;allows students the ready opportunity to meet with leaders in the field and to discuss&lt;br/&gt;their research in progress, both formally and informally, in a venue not provided by a&lt;br/&gt;national or regional geologic meeting.</AbstractNarration>
