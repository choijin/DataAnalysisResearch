<AbstractNarration>This proposal represents phase I of our long-term plan for the development of a state-of-the-art spectromicroscopy facility specializing in investigating the interactions of nano- and micro-structures with soft materials, including polymers, inorganic-organic composites, and biosystems such as proteins, cells, viruses and bacteria.  In addition to high-resolution structural characterization, the instruments in the facility allow the studies of the kinetics, mechanism and dynamics of these interactions. These investigations are critical for realizing the potential applications of nanoscience in modern materials science and biotechnology. In phase I, we propose the acquisition of a combined confocal optical and atomic force microscope (CCOAFM).  The CCOAFM is the first of its kind from Asylum Research, which allows simultaneous acquisition of high-resolution AFM images and multichannel confocal microscopy images. A key feature is the closed-loop and non-tube based AFM scanner, which effectively reduces drift, increases scanning speed, and allows integrated and concurrent confocal imaging. Moreover, the setup is modular allowing subsequent additions of advanced spectroscopy features in phase II. The scientific projects address manipulation of thin films and nanostructures, crystal growth mechanisms, production and properties of inorganic-organic composite materials, immunoprocesses such as allergy and initial viral infection, and the feasibility of using artificially engineered 2D nanostructure arrays or nano and microfunctional lipid bilayers as near-native hosts to probe the dynamics of protein-lipid and protein-protein interactions related to cell surface dynamics and signaling.  These projects represent the thrust areas of an organized research unit (ORU) at UC Davis: Nanomaterials in the Environment Agriculture and Technology (NEAT).  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NEAT ORU aims to bring students to the forefront of nanoscience and nanotechnology by providing interdisciplinary research projects, state-of-the-art facilities, and advanced educational programs. Complementary to the existing programs studying hard materials, such as catalysts, magnetic and optical materials, this proposal intends to equip the NEAT students with solid fundamental knowledge and skills to identify, approach, and understand the advantages and limitations of nanomaterials in the context of advanced soft materials, and biotechnology.  With the support of NSF-IGERT, NEAT has offered 46 graduate fellowships, graduated 6 Ph.D. degrees. The new facility, together with existing ones, will provide advanced training and technical expertise for NEAT students to face modern challenges in material characterization, nanotechnology, and nanobiotechnology, which are critical for maintaining our nation's leadership in science, industry R&amp;D, and homeland security.  This proposed facility has also generated great enthusiasm from local interdisciplinary programs, industry, community colleges, and high schools.  Several outreach programs will be expanded, as our existing ties are strengthened by the impact and allure of imaging.  The facility enhances our existing interactions and communication with the NSF-supported CPIMA program, the NSF Science and Technology Center for Biophotonics (CBST) program led by UC Davis and LLNL, as well as the Molecular Foundry at LBNL.  In addition, many local corporations (Agilent, Alza, Kovio, Metrolaser, IBM, Integrated Nanosystems, and Intermatix) have expressed their strong interests in beginning or continuing collaborations with NEAT teams through the utilization of the CCOAFM.  We anticipate a new phase of NEAT-Industry partnership with the establishment of the advanced spectromicroscopy facility. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal represents phase I of our long-term plan for the development of a state-of-the-art instrument facility specializing in high-resolution imaging and spectroscopy.  In phase I, we propose the acquisition of a combined confocal optical and atomic force microscope.  The instrument is the first of its kind from Asylum Research.  This new combination provides, by using confocal mode, three-dimensional visualization of materials down to subcellular level resolution, and simultaneously, is able to zoom into points of interests and to further image local structures with nanometer to molecular resolution by atomic force microscopy. The proposed combination has superior performance among the few competitors in stability, speed, resolution and ability to do dynamic studies, mainly due to the revolutionary design of the imaging scanner by Asylum Research.  Research teams at UC Davis plan to use this new instrument for production and visualization of nanostructures, for the study of crystal growth mechanisms, for the production and properties of novel inorganic-organic composite materials, for monitoring of the immunoprocesses such as allergy and initial viral infection, and for testing the feasibility of using artificially engineered nanostructures to mimic cell signaling.  We anticipate that results from these investigations would provide critical information in realizing potential applications of nanoscience in modern materials science and biotechnology.  The proposed equipment and projects represent the thrust areas of an organized research unit (ORU) at UC Davis: Nanomaterials in the Environment Agriculture and Technology (NEAT). The new facility, together with existing ones, will provide advanced training and technical expertise for NEAT students to face modern challenges in material characterization, nanotechnology, and nanobiotechnology, which are critical for maintaining our nation's leadership in science, industry R&amp;D, and homeland security.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
