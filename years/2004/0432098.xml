<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit Protein folding pathway prediction is a very important problem since protein&lt;br/&gt;misfolding has been identified as the cause of several diseases such as Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease,&lt;br/&gt;cystic fibrosis, hereditary emphysema and some cancers. Furthermore, knowledge of pathways for&lt;br/&gt;protein folding can give important insight into the structure of proteins. To make pathway based&lt;br/&gt;approaches to structure prediction a reality, plausible protein folding pathways need to be modeled&lt;br/&gt;and validated.&lt;br/&gt;Our novel approach outlined in this proposal is to start with a folded protein in its final state&lt;br/&gt;and learn how to unfold the protein in an approximately ordered sequence of steps, to its unfolded&lt;br/&gt;state. The reversal of such a sequence then represents a plausible protein folding pathway.&lt;br/&gt;Using the known structure and a fast, graph-based algorithm for recursive splitting of the structure&lt;br/&gt;along its most energetically labile contacts, we are able to develop a general model for topological&lt;br/&gt;unfolding.&lt;br/&gt;We propose to explore the effect on the folding pathway of mutations that are known to cause&lt;br/&gt;(or suppress) misfolding diseases, especially those associated with amyloid fiber formation. We&lt;br/&gt;will calculate the distribution of folding intermediates and then compare these distributions for&lt;br/&gt;natural mutatations that are known to cause amyloid accumulation in the cell.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact This proposal builds on a proven track record of success of the PIs, both in&lt;br/&gt;collaborative research and educational efforts. For instance, Bystroff and Zaki have team taught&lt;br/&gt;NSF Chautauqua Summer Course on New Directions in Bioinformatics and Biotechnology, held&lt;br/&gt;anually at RPI (1999-2004). The PIs have a track record of advising and promoting research&lt;br/&gt;activity in under-represented groups. For instance, both PIs jointly supervised a Native American&lt;br/&gt;M.S. student, and Zaki has supervised 7 femaleM.S. students. Currently he is supervising 2 female&lt;br/&gt;PhD students. Bystroff currently has three African-American undergraduate researchers.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work will be made publically available as a web server, and also open-source&lt;br/&gt;software, that predicts the unfolding pathway. Two full-time graduate students will be trained&lt;br/&gt;on this grant. Undergraduates, including underrepresented groups, will continue to play a large&lt;br/&gt;part in our research efforts. This proposal will support a continuing inter-disciplinary research&lt;br/&gt;team, which has resulted in several joint courses and publications. Much of the preliminary work&lt;br/&gt;described in this proposal is the fruit of this collaboration. Finally this grant will support one of&lt;br/&gt;the nation's strongest teaching programs in bioinformatics.</AbstractNarration>
