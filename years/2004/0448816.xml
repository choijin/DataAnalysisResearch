<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this CAREER program is to develop a methodology to assemble functional, nano-scale components (50-500 nm), to form three-dimensional (3D) networks, structures and arrays in a cost-effective and highly parallel manner. The strategy proposed is based on surface tension driven fluidic self-assembly. The assembly of structures that result from the minimization of interfacial free energy between chemically patterned nano-scale components that are agitated in a fluidic medium. The specific CAREER objectives are (a) to develop nano-solder based assembly to form 3D, integrated electrical networks; (b) to develop nano-epoxy based assembly to fabricate 3D mechanical structures; (c) to characterize chemically functionalized nano-components used for assembly, and the 3D structures that result on assembly; and (d) to design robust, functional assemblies by quantifying yields, and generating strategies for overcoming defects. The educational objectives of the CAREER program are focused on significantly impacting the careers of undergraduate students at Johns Hopkins University (JHU), and the large numbers of minority students in Baltimore public schools. At JHU, the PI proposes to develop a new laboratory course titled, "Novel methods in micro- and nano-fabrication" that will train students in emerging methods of nano-manufacturing. The PI will continue to expand undergraduate research in his laboratory, thereby invigorating classroom based education with the joy of discovery and invention. The PI plans to strengthen collaborations with the Baltimore public school teachers that participated in a workshop in his research laboratory in the summer of 2004 titled, "Micro and Nanotechnology: A Glimpse into the Future". Specific goals include expanding the workshop to a three-day event, holding technology demonstrations at Baltimore public schools, inviting exceptional school students to participate in research, and encouraging undergraduate researchers to mentor at-risk school students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research plan will greatly impact the fields of nano-manufacturing, nano-electronics, nano-electromechanical systems (NEMS) and nano-medicine. The strategy being developed enables a methodology for cost-effective, parallel, nano-manufacturing of 3D systems.  At the present moment no such methodology exists. The 3D electronic networks being proposed have high densities with short interconnects and high interconnectivity.  These features will enable the design of 3D nano-electronic and neuromorphic devices. The 3D mechanical structures being developed will significantly impact the emerging fields of NEMS and nano-medicine since these structures (a) have a high surface area to volume ratio that allow for large interactions with the surrounding media, (b) have small form factors, and (c) can be made complex and isotropic. These characteristics are especially attractive for the design of drug delivery systems, nano-magnetic coils for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), early diagnostic devices, and spherical sensory arrays for use in the human body. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
