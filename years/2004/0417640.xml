<AbstractNarration>Proposal No.     CTS-0417640&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:   Michael E. Mackay, Michigan StateUniversity &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Equipment- An HPLC System with Multiple Detectors to Determine Molecular Morphology&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This equipment grant is for an advanced High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system that will be used to characterize the molecular morphology of unique macromolecules.  Molecular architecture is an important factor in producing nanoscale effects and is the thrust of several ongoing research topics in Prof. Mackay's laboratory.  The system incorporates a multitude of detectors to determine the radius of gyration, hydrodynamic radius, molecular weight, intrinsic viscosity, second virial coefficient and concentration.  From these molecular parameters it is possible to elucidate the molecular morphology.  For example, the ratio of the radius of gyration and hydrodynamic radius is a powerful parameter related to the segment density distribution within a molecule to uniquely characterize it.  This equipment will be used by graduate students and advanced undergraduate students as part of their research training.  Prof. Mackay is developing a laboratory course, Nanoscale Characterization, and the HPLC system will also be used as part of this course.  Other instruments within his laboratory will also be used including Atomic Force Microscopes and rheometers.  The students will also take a trip to Argonne National Laboratory to perform a day of neutron scattering measurements as well as use the Scanning Electron Microscopes and Tunneling Electron Microscopes on campus.  This will be a unique course and the students will perform characterization of samples on all the instruments to gain a fuller understanding of each instrument's capabilities.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
