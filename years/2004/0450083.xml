<AbstractNarration>Proposal DMS-0306212&lt;br/&gt;PI: Chikako Mese (Connectitcut College)&lt;br/&gt;Title: Harmonic maps into and between singular spaces&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The principal investigator proposes to study harmonic maps into and&lt;br/&gt;between singular spaces.  The classical theory of harmonic maps deals with&lt;br/&gt;maps between Riemannian manifolds.  More recently, the importance of&lt;br/&gt;considering singular domains and targets has been discovered.  Harmonic map&lt;br/&gt;theory in singular spaces was initiated by Gromov and Schoen and their&lt;br/&gt;analysis of harmonic maps into non-positively curved Riemannian simplicial&lt;br/&gt;complexes combined with Corlette's vanishing theorem is the basis of their&lt;br/&gt;proof of p-adic super-rigidity.  The study of harmonic maps into singular&lt;br/&gt;targets was further generalized by Korevaar and Schoen and independently by&lt;br/&gt;Jost.  Further generalization is to consider singular domains.  In this&lt;br/&gt;project, we study harmonic maps from a simplicial polyhedron to a metric&lt;br/&gt;space of non-positive curvature.  A fundamental question is the regularity&lt;br/&gt;of these maps, and our goal is to show that these maps are smooth enough to&lt;br/&gt;be useful in many applications.  In particular, we hope to bring harmonic&lt;br/&gt;map theory and holomorphic quadratic differentials into the study of&lt;br/&gt;finitely generated groups.  More precisely, we will use harmonic maps from a&lt;br/&gt;two-dimensional simplicial complex to understand finitely generated groups&lt;br/&gt;from their actions on R-trees.   This point of view is important in the&lt;br/&gt;study of combinatorial group theory and three-dimensional topology.&lt;br/&gt;Harmonic maps will also be used to investigate compactifications of the&lt;br/&gt;Teichmuller space of a compact surface.  Finally, the study of minimal&lt;br/&gt;surfaces will be considered as an extension of the generalized harmonic map&lt;br/&gt;theory.  &lt;br/&gt;The proposed work contributes to the basic understanding of geometric&lt;br/&gt;variational problems.  Mathematicians have devoted large effort in&lt;br/&gt;developing variational methods and the successes of these investigations&lt;br/&gt;have laid the foundations of many branches of sience. There is a natural&lt;br/&gt;notion of energy associated to maps between certain spaces and, in this&lt;br/&gt;project, we study its critical points which are called harmonic maps. They&lt;br/&gt;have shown to be extremely useful as an analytic tool in geometry.  The&lt;br/&gt;generalization of harmonic maps between smooth spaces to non-smooth spaces&lt;br/&gt;promises to yield many more applications. We investigate the extent to which&lt;br/&gt;the classical methods in harmonic maps can be carried over to the singular&lt;br/&gt;setting.  The applications of the generalized theory make these questions&lt;br/&gt;relevant to a broad mathematical community.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
