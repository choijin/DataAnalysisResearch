    <AbstractNarration>The investigator's research combines a number of diverse areas in&lt;br/&gt;mathematics: logic, set theory, algebra, topology, and analysis,&lt;br/&gt;as well as some automated reasoning techniques from computer science.&lt;br/&gt;In topology, the investigator focuses on properties of scattered spaces,&lt;br/&gt;compact homogeneous spaces, and Bohr topologies. Topology and analysis&lt;br/&gt;are integrated in this research, especially in the area of Bohr topologies,&lt;br/&gt;since the subject involves the standard cardinal functions of general&lt;br/&gt;topology (such as weight, character, etc.), but is studied via the&lt;br/&gt;theory of group representations, which is part of harmonic analysis.&lt;br/&gt;Also, compact homogeneous spaces are often constructed with the aid&lt;br/&gt;of measures on the spaces. Logic and set theory are relevant because&lt;br/&gt;statements about topology and measure theory are frequently independent&lt;br/&gt;of the usual axioms of set theory; when a result is proved independent,&lt;br/&gt;the methods used are those of formal logic. For example, the notion of&lt;br/&gt;the Cantor-Bendixson sequence and scattered spaces is 100 years old,&lt;br/&gt;but there are still questions about the cardinals which can arise&lt;br/&gt;in the sequence of Cantor-Bendixson derivatives; part of the&lt;br/&gt;investigator's research studies how this sequence varies in different&lt;br/&gt;models of set theory. In algebra, the investigator works on algebraic&lt;br/&gt;systems such as quasigroups and loops. Automated reasoning tools&lt;br/&gt;are very useful here. These algebraic systems are described by&lt;br/&gt;fairly simple axioms, and a computer search can often reveal&lt;br/&gt;interesting new consequences of these axioms. However, the&lt;br/&gt;investigator combines the computer use with classical arguments&lt;br/&gt;involving combinatorics and group theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator's research studies a number of topics in pure&lt;br/&gt;mathematics which arose naturally in an attempt to generalize&lt;br/&gt;properties of the physical universe. For example, topology arises&lt;br/&gt;naturally in an attempt to generalize the geometry of physical space.&lt;br/&gt;Measure theory is a natural extension of the notion of probability.&lt;br/&gt;The research also studies algebraic properties of loops, which naturally&lt;br/&gt;generalize the concept of groups, which arise in the study of symmetry.&lt;br/&gt;There is also a computational component to this research, especially&lt;br/&gt;involving loops. Frequently in this area, one wants to know&lt;br/&gt;whether one equation implies another. A proof of such an implication&lt;br/&gt;involves symbolic manipulation which can be performed by a computer program.&lt;br/&gt;In recent years, the hardware and software have become powerful enough&lt;br/&gt;to discover new implications and to solve problems which had been&lt;br/&gt;intractable without computer assistance. The investigator's&lt;br/&gt;research here is of interest both for the mathematics itself,&lt;br/&gt;and for the advancement of the computer tools used.</AbstractNarration>
