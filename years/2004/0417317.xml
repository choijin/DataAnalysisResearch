<AbstractNarration>PROJECT SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;Page A&lt;br/&gt;Many hypotheses have been proposed for the response of the land plants, insects, and&lt;br/&gt;vertebrates to the P/Tr boundary extinction event. Many of these hypotheses are based on&lt;br/&gt;poorly unconstrained spatial and/or temporal data. Most lack any contextual constraint&lt;br/&gt;of the paleontological data used in the analysis used to support the interpretation.&lt;br/&gt;Hence, it is not possible to know if the ?trends? or ?changes? seen to occur from the&lt;br/&gt;preboundary assemblages into the transitional and post-boundary assemblages are a true&lt;br/&gt;reflection of the ecosystem or are biased taphonomically.&lt;br/&gt;This proposal hypothesizes that an isotaphonomic data set of pre-boundary,&lt;br/&gt;trans-boundary, and post-boundary plant-fossil assemblages will allow for the emergence of&lt;br/&gt;a credible characterization of the response within this part of the terrestrial ecosystem&lt;br/&gt;at this critical point in Earth history. Will the isotaphonomic plant-fossil record&lt;br/&gt;parallel or be tangential to the well established response in the marine realm? Or, will&lt;br/&gt;there be no change in biodiversity; might the replacement and/or turnover occur earlier or&lt;br/&gt;later in time than directly at the P/Tr boundary?&lt;br/&gt;Research conducted, to date, in KwaZulu Natal Province, South Africa, in the northeastern&lt;br/&gt;part of the Karoo Basin indicates that Late Permian megafloral assemblages are preserved&lt;br/&gt;in four different sedimentologic and taphonomic conditions. Each megafloral assemblage&lt;br/&gt;type preserves a very different signature of the vegetation contributed to the fossil&lt;br/&gt;record. These are: (1) parautochthonous assemblages within abandoned fluvial channel fill&lt;br/&gt;sequences, similar to modern and other ancient oxbow lakes; (2) dispersed and isolated,&lt;br/&gt;allochthonous assemblages preserved on foreset beds and reactivation surfaces within&lt;br/&gt;large, fine-grained fluvial regimes; (3) concentrated, mat-like allochthonous assemblages&lt;br/&gt;within bedload dunes of coarse siltstone channels; and (4) dispersed, sorted assemblages&lt;br/&gt;in turbidites. Data presented in the text concerning two localities ? Bulwer and&lt;br/&gt;Wagendrift Dam ? demonstrate that previous interpretations of the fossil assemblages in&lt;br/&gt;these sites are incorrect. And if these data are used from the literature as the basis&lt;br/&gt;for interpretation, the resulting suppositions are inappropriate.&lt;br/&gt;With an increasing continentalization of the sedimentary package in the Karoo into the&lt;br/&gt;Triassic, all but the last taphonomic assemblage type should be encountered in the&lt;br/&gt;transitional and post-boundary sections. Seven cross boundary and post boundary sections&lt;br/&gt;have been identified in which plant fossils and/or vertebrates are preserved, and will&lt;br/&gt;serve as the basis for the 2004 field season. It is anticipated that identification of&lt;br/&gt;isotaphonomic assemblages in this part of the stratigraphy will allow for direct&lt;br/&gt;comparison of biodiversity indices with those presently being determined by other members&lt;br/&gt;of an international research team, involving U.S., Dutch, and South African scientists.&lt;br/&gt;The present proposal requests funds to support undergraduate student research designed to&lt;br/&gt;assist in the acquisition of an isotaphonomic data set in the Karoo Basin, South Africa.&lt;br/&gt;Through the next two years of field work and laboratory analysis, P/Tr and early to middle&lt;br/&gt;Triassic localities will be assessed to identify and characterize those depositional&lt;br/&gt;sequences as found in the latest Permian.</AbstractNarration>
