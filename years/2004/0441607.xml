    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop and test a series of covert, nanoscale taggants based on Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) for use in the authentication of printed documents and packages. SERS nanotags consist of a gold core, an organic label molecule and a glass coating. These 50 nm diameter particles generate unique fingerprint like spectral signatures, with a readout based on surface enhanced Raman scattering. The tasks carried out during this project will: (1) determine the feasibility of adding SERS nanotags to paper and inks, as covert tags, (2) define the instrument parameters needed for a commercially successful hand held detection system and (3) develop novel software algorithms to enable tag identification. The successful combination of nanotechnology, optical engineering, and software design proposed in this work present a new solution for product authentication in the commercial markets, and have the potential to act as a covert tag in matters of national security. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Commercially SERS nanotags will have a broad impact across many commercial and government sectors, because counterfeiting affects such a wide variety of products. The protection of packaging on retail products can save corporations, and hence the economy, millions of dollars. In addition, counterfeiting threatens the security of our country as terrorist groups are increasingly turning to counterfeiting as a method to fund their activities. The protection of currency against counterfeiting can save governments millions (if not billions) of dollars (or Euros). The protection of pharmaceuticals against counterfeiting can save the legal pharmaceutical industry millions of dollars and protect consumers against the consumption of ineffective drugs. The protection of travel documents, including passports and visas, can safeguard national security.</AbstractNarration>
