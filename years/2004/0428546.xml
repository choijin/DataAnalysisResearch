<AbstractNarration>Proposal NO: 0428546 - Won &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to develop autonomously aligning micro-navigation sensor network for small satellites.  In particular, the PI and his students will develop a novel laser alignment technique for the autonomous attitude alignment, a new nonlinear optimal control theory for sensor attitude control, a multi-sensor integration method for accurate attitude determination, a micro-navigation sensor network for a group of small satellites, and a testbed for verification of the new theories and algorithms.  Furthermore, the PI will develop a spacecraft systems engineering course to educate and train students.  The PI will also establish a laboratory to enhance the research infrastructure, and to integrate research and education.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; As intellectual merits of this proposal, theories and techniques for an autonomously aligning micro-navigation sensor network will be developed. Two laser beams will be used for automatic alignment of the satellite's attitude.  A novel optimal control theory called cost density control or statistical control will be developed and applied for the search and control of the laser beams.  Accurate position and orientation determinations problems will be addressed using multi-sensor estimation and integration methods.  Then developed theories and algorithms will be verified by building a testbed.   As for the broader impact, this project will supplement the research goals of the university and it will provide a great opportunity for engineering students to learn by performing high-quality research.  This proposal will build a research infrastructure through the Control and Micro-Space Systems Laboratory.  Moreover, students will be trained in the newly developed Spacecraft Systems Engineering course.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
