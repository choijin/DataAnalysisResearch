<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project advances Syandus's interactive learning platform by integrating multiplayer game technology.  Syandus's current interactive delivery platform allows pharmaceutical firms and content experts to communicate complex concepts to physicians and patients through interactive presentations, discussion groups or self-directed learning.  The addition of network-enabled collaboration afforded by this project creates the opportunity for interaction between users and content experts without the constraints of geography.  The integration of multiplayer game technology into Syandus's platform requires the innovative application of this technology to serve a new purpose.  This project will develop the functional requirements, assess technology options and deliver a detailed design plan and proof of concept prototypes as needed to demonstrate feasibility.  Syandus is currently working with one of the top five pharmaceutical companies in world to develop and deliver innovative medical education to physicians.  In the first business application derived from this concept, physicians will be able to remotely connect with nationwide content experts to interactively learn the latest best practices and medical science in a more compelling way than currently available. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pharmaceutical industry strives to communicate medical science innovation and new treatment methods through an information cascade from international and national level thought leaders, to regional physician thought leaders, to practicing physicians and their patients.  The anticipated results from this concept will be a learning tool for pharmaceutical companies that allow tens or hundreds of physicians nationwide to have an interactive dialog about a disease state and appropriate treatment.  Longer term, in the educational realm, Syandus's technology could be used to develop more sophisticated collaborative learning environments where each individual or group is responsible for one part of a large interactive system.  Imagine a learning tool that allows science students from around the country to collaborate to optimize the function of a cell.  Some students control protein synthesis, some RNA synthesis, others the flux of nutrients in and out of the plasma membrane.  Process algorithms control the cellular outputs from each group based on students' inputs. Each optimizes their function for the overall performance of the cell. Transforming Syandus's existing platform with multi user capability adds rich human interaction into the remote learning process, brings scientific models to life, and allows greater dissemination of knowledge.</AbstractNarration>
