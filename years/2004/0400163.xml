<AbstractNarration>The proposal addresses problems in model theory of o-minimal structures. The&lt;br/&gt;principal investigator will continue further developing model theory and&lt;br/&gt;analytic geometry associated with o-minimal structures. In developing model&lt;br/&gt;theory of o-minimal structures the principal investigator is planning to use&lt;br/&gt;differential-geometric techniques. In turn the principal investigator hopes&lt;br/&gt;to apply model-theoretic techniques to questions in complex and real&lt;br/&gt;analytic geometries. Model theory of compact complex manifolds has had&lt;br/&gt;remarkable success in the recent years and the proposer plans, among the&lt;br/&gt;other things, to extend these advances, using methods developed by him and&lt;br/&gt;his collaborators. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal is in in a branch of mathematical logic called model theory.&lt;br/&gt;Model theory studies mathematical structures by considering the first-order&lt;br/&gt;sentences true in those structures, and the family of alternate structures&lt;br/&gt;that also satisfy all of those first-order sentences. (Sentences in logic&lt;br/&gt;are built out of a small repertoire of elements and constructions.&lt;br/&gt;"First-order" refers to the number of quantifiers in a sentence, a measure&lt;br/&gt;of complexity.) In many cases these alternative structures illuminate some&lt;br/&gt;properties of the original mathematical objects. &lt;br/&gt;A good example is the non-standard analysis. A part of this proposal is an&lt;br/&gt;extension on ideas of non-standard analysis to complex-analytic functions. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
