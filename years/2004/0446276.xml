<AbstractNarration>Numerous studies have shown that prey tend to avoid areas with higher predation risk, and conversely, that predators tend to prefer areas with more prey.  These are conflicting responses.  Surprisingly few studies have looked at spatial outcomes when both predators and prey are free to respond to the other.  Responses of prey and predator could be positively correlated, negatively correlated, or show no correlation. Gaining a better understanding of this 'predator-prey space game' is an area of major importance for behavioral ecology that should yield useful insights for predator-prey population and community ecology. This project will involve empirical studies and a modeling framework using genetic algorithms to incorporate complex aspects of reality into predator-prey games. A series of experiments on space games involving Pacific treefrog tadpoles, Hyla regilla, and their predators (salamander larvae, dragonfly larvae) will include experimental and statistical methods to yield new insights that guide further theory.  The project will involve a complex setup of experimental ponds of predators and prey to quantify the relationship between space use and predation risk and predator reward.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts. The proposed project will continue the PIs record of training by involving a postdoctoral associate, 2 graduate student RAs and 2 or more undergraduate researchers each year.  Every effort will be made to recruit women and minorities into these positions. Because the project includes modeling, fieldwork, and controlled experiments, trainees will gain an appreciation of the benefits of integrating a range of techniques.  The results should yield valuable insights for many applied ecological issues (e.g., biocontrol, fisheries, conservation biology). Project participants will actively disseminate results at conferences, research seminars, and in publications.  Past work from this lab has been widely cited in the academic literature, and has been featured in several textbooks, newspaper articles and an occasional interview.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
