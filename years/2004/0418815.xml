<AbstractNarration>Coastal geomorphic-depositional systems represent the dynamic response of &lt;br/&gt;sediments to forcing  mechanisms that operate across  a range of spatio-temporal scales.  &lt;br/&gt;Characterizing these systems is important for meaningful prediction in both modern coastal &lt;br/&gt;systems and for accurate stratigraphic interpretation of ancient analogs.   In carbonate &lt;br/&gt;depositional systems,  general sedimentologic criteria indicative of different facies  are well &lt;br/&gt;documented, as are the  general factors that control the regional distribution of these facies on &lt;br/&gt;carbonate platforms.  What remains unclear are  the details of the landscape-scale  geomorphic &lt;br/&gt;and sedimentologic patterns within individual facies belts and bodies, the processes that &lt;br/&gt;influence these patterns, and possible feedbacks between process and product.   In examining &lt;br/&gt;how sediments build  into geomorphologic features which  eventually may become the &lt;br/&gt;stratigraphic record, this intermediate scale represents a fundamental .missing link. between &lt;br/&gt;documentation of carbonate sediments and study of carbonate stratigraphy. &lt;br/&gt;  To begin to fill this basic gap in understanding, this study proposes quantitatively &lt;br/&gt;examining the landscape-scale patterns and processes within some Bahamian ooid shoals, one &lt;br/&gt;carbonate depositional environment.  Beyond the fact that these systems and the ooids forming &lt;br/&gt;them are inherently interesting, the locations chosen for this study also: a) have ancient analogs &lt;br/&gt;that form important water and hydrocarbon reservoirs; b) include ubiquitous lobate forms, &lt;br/&gt;geometries broadly analogous to some siliciclastic environments, allowing explicit comparison; &lt;br/&gt;and c) include lobes in both open-shelf and tidal delta settings, to permit assessing the generality &lt;br/&gt;of process-response dynamics in different conditions.   &lt;br/&gt;  We  outline  data  collection  and  experiments  to  test  several  linked  hypotheses  related  to &lt;br/&gt;modern carbonate ooid shoals and deltas,  including: 1)  at the  landscape scale, the &lt;br/&gt;geomorphology of shoals is closely linked to spatial patterns of fluid flow;  2) the grain size, &lt;br/&gt;sorting, and type varies systematically and predictably within this hydro-geomorphic framework; &lt;br/&gt;and 3) lobes are a dynamically stable  geomorphic configuration in many tide-dominated &lt;br/&gt;carbonate sand bodies in both tidal deltaic and more open shelf tide-dominated conditions.   &lt;br/&gt;  To  address  these  hypotheses,  this  research  will  integrate  remote  sensing,  bathymetric, &lt;br/&gt;grain  size  and  sorting,  grain  type,  and  fluid  flow  data  in  a GIS,.    In  providing  for quantitative &lt;br/&gt;characterization of these landscape-scale patterns and links to processes, these data will represent &lt;br/&gt;some of the first such analyses in carbonate systems.  In exploring patterns and processes within &lt;br/&gt;oolitic  tidal  systems,  this  study  will  provide  first-order  predictive  trends  in  morphodynamic &lt;br/&gt;evolution of shoals (.creating geobodies.) and quantitative links between geomorphic framework &lt;br/&gt;and grains (size, sorting) within shoals (.grains within geobodies.). &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts.  The application of new remote sensing, bathymetric and fluid flow analytical &lt;br/&gt;tools and quantitative integration of these data in a GIS represents a novel approach to study of &lt;br/&gt;landscape-scale sedimentologic-geomorphic systems.  This approach should be broadly &lt;br/&gt;applicable to other environments, and we expect it will lead to a deeper understanding of &lt;br/&gt;geomorphic-depositional systems in general. &lt;br/&gt;  In addition to training a Ph.D. student, this project includes educating underserved high &lt;br/&gt;school minority students about science, enhancing understanding of technology and environment &lt;br/&gt;in the local Bahamian  community, and providing new learning tools and  experiences for &lt;br/&gt;University of Miami students.</AbstractNarration>
