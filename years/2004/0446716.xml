<AbstractNarration>This NSF CAREER project represents an effort towards the development of embedded control software that is correct by design. The pursuit of this ambitious objective relies on novel ideas fostering a paradigm shift in embedded software design by integrating control with software design. In particular, through the use of finite abstractions of continuous control systems, control theoretic ideas are being applied to the design of software enforcing dynamic constraints (control), software constraints (e.g., shared resources, real-time properties) and hardware constraints (e.g., power consumption, execution times). In addition to alleviating the need for testing and formal verification this research is also developing automated synthesis methods allowing for faster design cycles and an increase in functionality and complexity of embedded applications. This correct by construction approach to embedded control software design has immediate technological, economical and societal consequences triggered by a reduction in software development time and cost. Furthermore, the research outcome of this project is also contributing to the advancement in functionality, robustness and dependability of the large networks of embedded systems that are becoming essential infrastructures of our society. Important contributions to graduate and undergraduate education complement the research component of the project. A new graduate course on verification and synthesis of embedded control systems is being offered at Notre Dame. The lecture notes supporting this course will be published to further disseminate the novel ideas developed in the context of this project and to promote the creation of similar courses in other universities. Undergraduate education at Notre Dame is being improved through the participation of undergraduate students in research and by revising the laboratorial component of the introductory course to electrical networks in order to familiarize second year electrical engineering students with embedded systems and basic skills in embedded programming.</AbstractNarration>
