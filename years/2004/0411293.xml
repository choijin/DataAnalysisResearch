<AbstractNarration>Chemistry (12)  The Department of Chemistry is acquiring a gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer that is dedicated to hands-on learning experiences for students at all levels. &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;Introductory general education students are observing demonstrations and collecting and analyzing data.  The instrument is incorporated into the chemistry major in a spiral curriculum:  chemistry majors use the instrument in ever more sophisticated experiments as courses progress from lower division organic chemistry to senior research projects.  In a systematic sequence of experiments, students use the instrument to identify reaction products, quantify contaminant levels, elucidate reaction mechanisms, assay product purity and determine isotopic abundances of heavy metals.  Experiments are being adapted from the educational literature in order to design a careful progression of experiences that expose students to the wide range of types of problems that can be investigated with the help of results obtained from a GC/MS.  The instrument also is supporting development of undergraduate programs in environmental chemistry and forensic science and is enhancing outreach activities to local high schools and to tribal colleges in Montana, again by adapting experiments from the educational literature and from EPA protocols. &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts &lt;br/&gt;This project involves curricular improvements for non-science majors, chemistry majors, and other science majors, and includes components directed at student recruitment and outreach to high school students and teachers.  A significant part of our recruitment of new majors dovetails with our outreach to regional high school teachers who supervise student research projects utilizing GC/MS.  Many of the high school projects deal with local issues and help portray the service role of the university to the community.  Use of the instrument in an REU program is enhancing research experiences for Native Americans and underrepresented students.  The instrument is important to the development of undergraduate concentrations in environmental and forensic science within the chemistry major.  The forensic science program is addressing national and regional needs for trained forensic scientists.  Experiments and experiences with the introductory programs, outreach programs, spiral curriculum and new concentrations will be widely disseminated, enabling adaptation and implementation of project results in other institutions. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
