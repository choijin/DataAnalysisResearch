<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0420383&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Haynes R. Miller&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award funds travel, particularly by junior researchers, to&lt;br/&gt;an international conference and summer school on topology to take&lt;br/&gt;place in Hanoi, Vietnam, in August 2004.  The focus will be on&lt;br/&gt;applications of the Steenrod algebra to problems in topology and&lt;br/&gt;algebra.  Three short courses will form a summer school preceding&lt;br/&gt;the conference to introduce students to background material.  A&lt;br/&gt;number of the developments to be discussed in the conference grow&lt;br/&gt;out of the solutions of the Segal Conjecture and the Sullivan&lt;br/&gt;Conjecture, and topics may include invariant theory and&lt;br/&gt;representation theory of the general linear group, polynomial&lt;br/&gt;functors, Mac Lane homology, topological cyclic homology, the&lt;br/&gt;study of p-compact groups and p-local finite groups, and the use&lt;br/&gt;of the Burnside ring in splittings of classifying spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will bring together mathematicians working in&lt;br/&gt;topology, representation theory, invariant theory, and group&lt;br/&gt;theory. The interest in this work is truly global: at least 21&lt;br/&gt;countries employ mathematicians we intend to invite. The summer&lt;br/&gt;school will attract younger people and enrich the exprience for&lt;br/&gt;them.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
