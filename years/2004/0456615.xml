<AbstractNarration> &lt;br/&gt;This proposal comprises three major projects and several additional smaller &lt;br/&gt;projects.  The first of the three main projects concerns the approximation of &lt;br/&gt;real numbers by rationals, a classical subject of research in number theory.  &lt;br/&gt;Over the past few decades many authors have applied ad hoc methods to &lt;br/&gt;obtain highly nontrivial bounds for the approximation by rationals whose &lt;br/&gt;denominators belong to particular types of sequences, such as the sequence &lt;br/&gt;of prime numbers, or the sequence of squares.  The proposer believes that &lt;br/&gt;results of this type should hold in a much more general context, and he hopes &lt;br/&gt;to prove a universal result for general  sequences that is of nearly the same&lt;br/&gt;quality as the results that have been obtained in the literature for special &lt;br/&gt;sequences.  The second project concerns the distribution of zeros of &lt;br/&gt;L-functions, a vast area of research motivated by the Riemann Hypothesis &lt;br/&gt;and its generalizations.  In particular, the so-called pair-correlation for the &lt;br/&gt;sequence of such zeros has received much attention in recent years because &lt;br/&gt;of surprising connections with phenomena arising in quantum chaos and the &lt;br/&gt;theory of random matrices. The proposer plans to investigate a new type of &lt;br/&gt;pair correlation, in which a second sequence is introduced, in the hope of &lt;br/&gt;obtaining new results by exploiting the added flexibility provided by the &lt;br/&gt;second sequence.  The third project is to apply methods and tools from &lt;br/&gt;number theory to certain problems in mathematical physics, in particular, the&lt;br/&gt;so-called Lorentz gas and the Sinai billiard problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project falls in the area of number theory, one of the oldest subjects of &lt;br/&gt;mathematics which in recent years has received renewed interest due to &lt;br/&gt;newly found applications (e.g., to cryptography and coding theory), &lt;br/&gt;unexpected connections with physics (such as the theory of quantum chaos &lt;br/&gt;and statistical mechanics), and major unsolved problems (such as the &lt;br/&gt;Riemann Hypothesis, one of the seven "million dollar" problems in &lt;br/&gt;mathematics). The proposed research is concerned with several problems &lt;br/&gt;that fall at the interface of number theory and mathematical physics and &lt;br/&gt;build upon ongoing work by the proposer and his collaborators.  It is hoped &lt;br/&gt;that deploying the powerful methods and tools of number theory to these &lt;br/&gt;problems will lead toinsights and results that specialists have not been able &lt;br/&gt;to  obtainand which will be of interest to a broad range of researchers,  &lt;br/&gt;both in mathematics and in physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
