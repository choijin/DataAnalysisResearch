<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0406454&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Thomas H. Parker&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project involves analytic aspects of the theory of&lt;br/&gt;pseudo-holomorphic curves.  The aim is to develop effective&lt;br/&gt;methods for computing Gromov-Witten invariants of symplectic&lt;br/&gt;manifolds and enumerative invariants of algebraic manifolds.  The&lt;br/&gt;main thrust is a continuing project with E. Ionel on the&lt;br/&gt;Gromov-Witten invariants of six-dimensional manifolds. String&lt;br/&gt;Theory is especially effective in making predictions about a&lt;br/&gt;special type of six-dimensional spaces called Calabi-Yau 3-folds.&lt;br/&gt;One of the most fascinating predictions of String Theory is the&lt;br/&gt;Gompakumar-Vafa conjecture, which claims that the plethora of&lt;br/&gt;Gromov-Witten invariants are determined by a more limited&lt;br/&gt;collection of `BPS numbers'.  The first proposed project seeks to&lt;br/&gt;derive and prove the Gompakumar-Vafa formulas by adapting the&lt;br/&gt;analytic methods that C. Taubes developed to relate the&lt;br/&gt;Seiberg-Witten and Gromov invariants.  This approach to the BPS&lt;br/&gt;numbers is different and more geometric than the physicists'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work also includes efforts to extend the PI's&lt;br/&gt;previous work on Relative GW invariants to invariants relative to&lt;br/&gt;``a stratified symplectic subspace'', and to give a geometric and&lt;br/&gt;computationally effective description of the virtual fundamental&lt;br/&gt;class for symplectic manifolds which are not necessary&lt;br/&gt;semipositive.  A fourth project concerns the ``modified GW&lt;br/&gt;invariants'' defined by the P.I.'s student Junho Lee; those make&lt;br/&gt;it possible to study a class of manifolds (Kahler surfaces with&lt;br/&gt;positive geometric genus) where there are important conjectures&lt;br/&gt;that are not currently approachable by GW methods.  The last&lt;br/&gt;project is geometric analysis of a different sort aimed at&lt;br/&gt;understanding how supersymmetry simplifies expressions for heat&lt;br/&gt;kernels on manifolds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the most notable developments in mathematics in the past&lt;br/&gt;decade has been the remarkable confluence of ideas coming from&lt;br/&gt;String Theory, Algebraic Geometry, Partial Differential&lt;br/&gt;Equations, and Symplectic Geometry.  A major part of that story&lt;br/&gt;revolves around the idea of counting holomorphic curves in&lt;br/&gt;algebraic manifolds.  That problem was studied for 100 years with&lt;br/&gt;few results.  Then, around 1990, it was realized that the problem&lt;br/&gt;can be translated into symplectic geometry and tackled using the&lt;br/&gt;powerful machinery of mathematical gauge theory. (Gauge theory,&lt;br/&gt;originally part of physics, has been the focus of many very&lt;br/&gt;fruitful interactions between mathematicians and physicists over&lt;br/&gt;the past twenty years; it includes Yang-Mills and Seiberg-Witten&lt;br/&gt;Theory, and String Theory).  This `Gromov-Witten invariant'&lt;br/&gt;approach led quickly to formulas answering some of the original&lt;br/&gt;curve-counting problems.  The subject is now advancing rapidly on&lt;br/&gt;many fronts, and is being continually stimulated by the&lt;br/&gt;predictions of physics.  This project is aimed toward further&lt;br/&gt;developing this theory using the gauge theory that is approach&lt;br/&gt;most closely aligned with physics, and to use the symplectic&lt;br/&gt;approach to make conceptual bridges between the algebraic and&lt;br/&gt;physics viewpoints.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
