<AbstractNarration>The investigators propose a mixed methods (quantitative and qualitative)&lt;br/&gt;study of distributed content leadership in middle school mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;There is little research on what content, pedagogical, and diagnostic&lt;br/&gt;knowledge leaders must have to effectively assist teachers in&lt;br/&gt;implementing demands of rigorous mathematics instruction and student&lt;br/&gt;learning.  This research builds on prior research of the investigators&lt;br/&gt;who examined distributed leadership at the elementary school level.&lt;br/&gt;However, this research will go much deeper into defining and&lt;br/&gt;understanding the leaders and the roles they play.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Much of the project is devoted to developing instruments to measure&lt;br/&gt;mathematics content leadership as distributed in middle schools.&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the team proposes to develop, test, and validate&lt;br/&gt;measurement instruments of content leadership practice and knowledge and&lt;br/&gt;to examine how content leadership affects how teachers teach.  They also&lt;br/&gt;propose to test whether content leadership can be learned.  All of this&lt;br/&gt;work will be conducted in the context of a Mathematics and Science&lt;br/&gt;Partnership (MSP) Teacher Institute for the 21sth Century site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed program of work fills a major gap in the knowledge base by&lt;br/&gt;generating new information and evidence about content leadership&lt;br/&gt;knowledge and practices as they relate to improvement in mathematics&lt;br/&gt;education. The senior research team brings together experienced scholars&lt;br/&gt;and teachers from mathematics, mathematics education, teacher learning,&lt;br/&gt;leadership, policy, and statistics.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research is divided into two main parts.  The first will focus on&lt;br/&gt;the development, piloting, and validation of instrumentation for&lt;br/&gt;identifying and documenting content area leadership practice for middle&lt;br/&gt;school mathematics.  The second part will study the nature (i.e., the&lt;br/&gt;what, the how and the why) of content area leadership practice for&lt;br/&gt;middle school mathematics and its relations to (a) leadership&lt;br/&gt;development and (b) classroom teachers and teaching.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work may have significant broad impact by generating usable&lt;br/&gt;knowledge and methodological tools that will be of considerable interest&lt;br/&gt;to MSPs and Institute Partnerships and to the school systems around the&lt;br/&gt;nation.  By focusing on content leadership in urban schools, this work&lt;br/&gt;will contribute to improving mathematics education for urban youth, who&lt;br/&gt;have historically been underserved by many school systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
