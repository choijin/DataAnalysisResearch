<AbstractNarration> I propose to use methods from algebraic topology in the study of knots.  A &lt;br/&gt;knot induces a map from the space of configurations on the knot to &lt;br/&gt;configurations in the ambient manifold.  With recently developed &lt;br/&gt;compactification technology, one can fix boundary conditions on those &lt;br/&gt;configuration spaces and study the homotopy class of this induced map &lt;br/&gt;relative to those boundary conditions.  Such an approach was pioneered &lt;br/&gt;by Bott and Taubes in de Rham theory and by the PI and his collaborators &lt;br/&gt;in homotopy theory itself.  Results of Volic may be used to show that all &lt;br/&gt;Bott-Taubes invariants, and thus all real finite-type invariants, are &lt;br/&gt;homotopy invariants of this induced map.  Already in lowest degree, new &lt;br/&gt;geometric understanding arises from studying the induced map directly &lt;br/&gt;homotopy, and I propose to continue this study in higher degrees.  I &lt;br/&gt;also propose to more deeply understand the role of operads in this theory, &lt;br/&gt;as well as to extend these techniques to study link homotopy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Knot theory, the study of embedded loops in space, is one of the oldest &lt;br/&gt;and most distinguished fields in topology.  For most of its life, knot &lt;br/&gt;theory has developed in parallel with other subfields of topology.  But &lt;br/&gt;in the last twenty years, the field has changed dramatically from the &lt;br/&gt;influence of previously unrelated fields.  In particular, quantum field &lt;br/&gt;theory has provided ground-breaking new constructions.  One can try to &lt;br/&gt;define the energy of a knot as an invariant, but in order to do so one &lt;br/&gt;must "integrate over all connections", that is over all ways of putting &lt;br/&gt;an "energy field" on the space in which the knot lives.  Such an integral &lt;br/&gt;does not exist in precise mathematical form, but through the standard &lt;br/&gt;perturbative expansion in quantum field theory one can write down &lt;br/&gt;Feynman integrals which are meant to approximate  it to finite order.  &lt;br/&gt;Topologists have made such integrals precise and rigorous in this &lt;br/&gt;setting, and shown that they provide a basis for the finite-type &lt;br/&gt;invariants of knots.  But topologists would like to reconnect the &lt;br/&gt;theory to more standard constructions in topology.  The PI's previous &lt;br/&gt;work marks the beginning of such a connection.  New geometric insight &lt;br/&gt;was gained in the process, as the simplest quantum invariant can now be &lt;br/&gt;computed by counting instances of a line intersecting a knot in exactly &lt;br/&gt;four places.   I hope to find both new connections with classical &lt;br/&gt;topology and novel geometric interpretations in this proposed work. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
