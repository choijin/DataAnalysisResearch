<AbstractNarration>Computer Science (31)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is developing a more effective way of teaching the introductory computer programming course (CS1) by creating a set of cooperative learning materials for use in the course, building on a previous CCLI proof-of-concept project. The effectiveness of the materials in improving student learning is being evaluated at a variety of types of institutions, serving students with diverse backgrounds and career goals. The project is also adding to the educational research base by studying ways of using cooperative learning in Computer Science courses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit&lt;br/&gt;Cooperative learning is not a new idea, but previous efforts in computer science have not taken full advantage of a key element in cooperative learning: assigning specific concept-related and process-related roles to group members. This project uses more structured exercises and making greater use of roles. The project also builds on the successes of the pair programming approach, another collaborative learning technique. It generalizes this approach by leading students through different levels of cooperation: from pure group work, to working in pairs with various levels of interaction, to individual work with group support.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts&lt;br/&gt;The results from a prior proof-of-concept study strongly indicate that cooperative learning leads to higher student performance and lower attrition, and cooperative learning also seems especially beneficial for women and other underrepresented groups. Thus, the application of cooperative learning methods in Computer Science is expected to increase student performance, reduce attrition, and help alleviate the under-representation of women and minority students in the Computer Science major.</AbstractNarration>
