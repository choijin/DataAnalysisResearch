<AbstractNarration>Abstract for NSF proposal DMS-0400548 Nakano&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator will explore problems involving &lt;br/&gt;the representation theory and cohomology of algebraic groups, &lt;br/&gt;Lie algebras and finite groups. An important object of study &lt;br/&gt;will be support varieties which provide a bridge linking  &lt;br/&gt;the representation theory, cohomology theory and the structure &lt;br/&gt;theory (involving conjugacy classes) of Lie algebras. &lt;br/&gt;Computations of such varieties will be considered as well &lt;br/&gt;as generalizations of the theory to quantum groups and affine &lt;br/&gt;Lie algebras. The investigator will also look at &lt;br/&gt;computations of cohomology groups/rings of finite Chevalley groups&lt;br/&gt;and Frobenius kernels especially for primes less than the Coxeter &lt;br/&gt;number. It is anticipated that the use of extensive &lt;br/&gt;computer calculations might be necessary for several of these &lt;br/&gt;projects. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Algebraic structures such are groups, rings and Lie algebras &lt;br/&gt;arise naturally, and the basic understanding of these objects have been &lt;br/&gt;used in applications involving biology, physics and chemistry. &lt;br/&gt;These algebraic objects have complicated internal symmetries. &lt;br/&gt;Information about the representation and cohomology theories &lt;br/&gt;allows one to organize and extract vital information that can &lt;br/&gt;be used in these various applications. The principal investigator &lt;br/&gt;has been actively promoting the working knowledge of these &lt;br/&gt;methods. He is currently organizing several conferences in &lt;br/&gt;representation/cohomology theory and is a co-organizer &lt;br/&gt;of the VIGRE (Vertical Integration of Research and Education) Algebra &lt;br/&gt;Group at the University of Georgia which promotes learning through &lt;br/&gt;active faculty and student participation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
