<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;This proposal presents a career development plan for integrating research and education. The research&lt;br/&gt;component of this program focuses on the study of collaborative signal and information processing (CSIP)&lt;br/&gt;algorithms as well as the supporting computing models and protocols in sensor networks. The educational&lt;br/&gt;component is aimed at enhancing the newly created computer engineering program of the department&lt;br/&gt;through innovative curriculum development, active student mentoring, and by incorporating research findings&lt;br/&gt;into classroom teaching. The project consolidates research and educational efforts, responds to the&lt;br/&gt;unique challenges presented by sensor networks, and contributes significantly to the PI's career development.&lt;br/&gt;A sensor network forms a loosely-coupled distributed environment where collaborative processing among&lt;br/&gt;multiple sensor nodes is essential in order to compensate for each other's limited capability in sensing, processing,&lt;br/&gt;power supply, and to tolerate faults. The extremely constraint resources of sensor networks have&lt;br/&gt;presented unique challenges to CSIP, the biggest of which is the contradictory requirements between energy&lt;br/&gt;efficiency and fault tolerance. While energy-efficient approaches try to limit the redundancy such that&lt;br/&gt;minimum amount of energy is required for fulfilling a certain task, redundancy is needed for providing&lt;br/&gt;fault tolerance since sensors might be faulty, malfunctioning, or even malicious. A balance has to be struck&lt;br/&gt;between these two objectives.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: An integrated research plan is proposed that tackles the unique challenges presented&lt;br/&gt;by sensor networks. This plan concerns not only the development of effective processing algorithms, it&lt;br/&gt;also studies the design of supporting computing paradigms and protocols which play an important role in&lt;br/&gt;facilitating the collaborative processing. In particular, the research plan focusses on three themes:&lt;br/&gt;First, the design, evaluation and implementation of a new paradigm, the mobile-agent-based paradigm,&lt;br/&gt;for realizing collaborative processing in sensor networks. In this model, instead of each sensor node sending&lt;br/&gt;local information to a processing center for integration, as is typical in a client/server-based computing, the&lt;br/&gt;integration code is moved to the sensor nodes through mobile agents. We discuss the potential of mobileagent-&lt;br/&gt;based collaborative processing in providing progressive accuracy while maintaining certain degree of&lt;br/&gt;fault tolerance. Second, the development and evaluation of a decentralized reactive clustering protocol to&lt;br/&gt;help adapt to the changing environment. Due to the sheer amount of nodes deployed, collaboration is usually&lt;br/&gt;carried out among nodes within the same cluster. We propose a decentralized reactive clustering (DRC)&lt;br/&gt;protocol in which the clustering procedure is initiated only when events are detected. Performance gain in&lt;br/&gt;terms of energy consumption and network lifetime is analyzed. Third, the study of distributed optimization&lt;br/&gt;for in-network data processing. We tackle the challenging CSIP problems including multiple target/event&lt;br/&gt;detection and unknown target/event identification and develop decentralized algorithms that achieve both&lt;br/&gt;energy-efficiency and bandwidth-efficiency advantages, as well as detection performance gain compared to&lt;br/&gt;its centralized counterpart.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The PI is dedicated to excellence in teaching and enthusiastic student mentoring.&lt;br/&gt;CSIP in sensor networks, as one of the areas that integrate multidisciplinary characteristics, will be used&lt;br/&gt;as an experimental concentration area to initiate innovative curriculum design, which helps bring in unique&lt;br/&gt;features to increase the quality and visibility of the newly established computer engineering program of&lt;br/&gt;the department. Although sensor networks have revealed great potential in CSIP, the extremely constraint&lt;br/&gt;resources have largely limited their practical deployment. The performance evaluation of computing models,&lt;br/&gt;protocols, and processing algorithms for CSIP would help understand the capability of sensor networks as&lt;br/&gt;well as provide theoretical guide in the design of CSIP algorithms. Both the research and educational results&lt;br/&gt;will be made available through the Twiki collaboration platform on the Internet.&lt;br/&gt;1</AbstractNarration>
