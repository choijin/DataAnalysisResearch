<AbstractNarration>The key to reliable communications over wireless channels is diversity. &lt;br/&gt;Of the various methods used to achieve diversity, spatial diversity &lt;br/&gt;through the use of multiple transmit and/or receive antennas is &lt;br/&gt;particularly attractive in that it does not require additional &lt;br/&gt;bandwidth or loss of transmission rate. Spatial diversity does, &lt;br/&gt;however, require the use of multiple antennas which must be separated &lt;br/&gt;by at least a few wavelengths in order to be effective. This physical &lt;br/&gt;constraint precludes the use of spatial diversity in many scenarios, &lt;br/&gt;but recently, researchers considered this problem in the context of &lt;br/&gt;multiuser communication systems in which there may be multiple sources &lt;br/&gt;and/or destinations each with only a single antenna. In these types of &lt;br/&gt;systems, communicating nodes can form "partnerships" to achieve a new &lt;br/&gt;kind of spatial diversity: "user cooperation diversity". Nodes in a &lt;br/&gt;partnership pool their antenna resources to form a virtual antenna &lt;br/&gt;array and many of the benefits of spatial diversity are achieved &lt;br/&gt;without the need for a "real" antenna array.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While user cooperation diversity can provide many of the advantages of &lt;br/&gt;antenna arrays to devices that would otherwise only have access to a &lt;br/&gt;single antenna, the implementation issues are significantly different &lt;br/&gt;than those of antenna arrays. Unlike a traditional antenna array, the &lt;br/&gt;nodes in a cooperative partnership are at least semi-autonomous in the &lt;br/&gt;sense that they each typically have their own local resources, &lt;br/&gt;quality-of-service requirements, and timing references. This project is &lt;br/&gt;centered around the questions created by the inherent autonomy of nodes &lt;br/&gt;in cooperative multiuser communication systems: how to initiate and &lt;br/&gt;maintain cooperative partnerships, how to optimally allocate resources &lt;br/&gt;in cooperative partnerships, and how to synchronize cooperating nodes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
