<AbstractNarration>Engineering-Engineering Technology (58)  The goal of this project is to adapt the work of other researchers to improve the delivery of electronics lecture and laboratory content in the Electronics &amp; Computer Technology (ECT) for students enrolled in Industrial Technology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is creating online lecture and laboratory materials for an upper division electronics course in control systems.  The project is (1) revising the lecture and laboratory content to be in line with theories of effectiveness in web-based instruction (Fisher &amp; Nygren in 2000 and Shiratuddin, Hassan and Landoni in 2003); (2) developing multimedia lecture materials using WebCT (Sharer &amp; Frisbee in 2003); (3) revising the laboratory activities to integrate an electronics kit so that students can complete ten laboratory exercises following the model established by Wang (2003); (4) adapting the curriculum materials to be in line with research on learning styles of women and minority students; (5) and integrating LabVIEW and Multisim into the class to provide the students with realistic, industry-based simulation experiences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program is building upon a problem-based learning initiative at San Jose State University, which uses mobile technologies to transform the learning environment. Students' performance using this curriculum will be compared with students who are enrolled in a traditional laboratory that uses electronic test equipment. The project is developing methodologies that target the learning styles of minority and women students because approximately two-thirds of undergraduates in the Electronics and Computer Technology program are identified as having non-White ethnicity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
