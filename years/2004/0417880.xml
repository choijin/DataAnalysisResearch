<AbstractNarration>With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Stanley Dubinsky and Dr. William Davies will organize a scholarly panel in connection with the Linguistic Society of America's annual meeting in January, 2005, and a two-day workshop to be held at the LSA Summer Institute in July, 2005.  The topic of these meetings is the analysis of two grammatical constructions, called Raising and Control, which have been central to the development of linguistic theory over the past 40 years. The January 2005 panel will gather leading researchers in order to articulate a common set of research questions to be addressed in the July 2005 workshop. Workshop participants will be asked to focus on new empirical data, especially from understudied languages. Workshop participants will be sought from both theoretical linguists and linguists whose research interests lie in the interdisciplinary areas of language acquisition, historical linguistics, sociolinguistics and language variation, and neurolinguistics. In order to make the proceedings of the panel widely available, a digital recording of the January panel will be made accessible on the project's website, along with a textual transcript. The website will also provide access to the workshop program and abstracts, and will provide the opportunity for participants to make drafts of their research available to the public.  Selected papers from the panel and workshop will be published as a book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
