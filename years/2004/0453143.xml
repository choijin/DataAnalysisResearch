<AbstractNarration>0453143&lt;br/&gt;Pinkel&lt;br/&gt;This award to Scripps Institution of Oceanography in California provides support for the installation of improved transducers and development of improved software for the Hydrographic Doppler Sonar System aboard R/V Revelle, a research vessel operated by Scripps Institution of Oceanography as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) academic research fleet. Specifically, the project will use the design implemented in a previous development effort to replace the two remaining original transducer arrays of the50 kHz sonar.  This is expected to provide significant improvement in S/N, as well as increased reliability and reduced maintenance.  The award will also replace outdated I/O boards in the current system, replace the sonar receivers of the 140 kHz system with a new design already implemented for the 50 kHz system, and implement new advanced Doppler processing algorithms in an effort to reduce signal contamination from hull reverberation and side lobes. The HDSS will continue to be operated as part of the standard array of instruments available to users of R/V Revelle, and it is expected to be of substantial advantage to scientists using the vessel in their oceanographic research during 2005 and future years.&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts:  As part of the project, a public web site will be established by the PI to share transducer hardware designs and new broadband Doppler processing algorithms with other researchers, and to make these copyrighted algorithms available to commercial manufacturers.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
