    <AbstractNarration>The MPS Distinguished International Postdoctoral Fellowship Program (MPS-DRF) enables U.S. scientists to conduct research abroad. The fellowship allows awardees to establish long-term international collaborations that will benefit them and the U.S. scientific community by developing international connections and perspectives in future science leaders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support a 24-month research fellowship for Dr. Oren A. Scherman to work with Professor Egbert W. Meijer and his group in the Laboratory of Macromolecular and Organic Chemistry at Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands. The proposed work will develop new methods to use non-covalent bonds to direct the assembly of high molecular weight co-polymers with well-defined architectures. The ability to control material morphology from the molecular level has great potential for studying energy and charge transfer processes in self-assembled structures and in developing new technologically useful materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prof. E. W. Meijer is a leading authority in the field of supramolecular polymer chemistry and is known for his strong efforts in training and mentoring students. The Meijer lab will provide a productive environment for Dr. Scherman to extend his background in polymer synthesis to supramolecular chemistry and dynamic self-assembly. This broadening will provide Dr. Scherman with a strong foundation to return to the U.S. to pursue his plans for an academic career in a research area of growing importance.</AbstractNarration>
