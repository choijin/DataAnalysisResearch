<AbstractNarration>Abstract 0406007, Nicholls, University of Notre Dame&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Free Surface Fluid Mechanics and Electromagnetic Scattering: Stable, High-Order Perturbation Techniques  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Principal Investigator (PI) proposes the investigation of&lt;br/&gt;fundamental phenomena in free-surface ideal fluid flows, and&lt;br/&gt;electromagnetic and acoustic scattering.  Among the applications are&lt;br/&gt;the efficient, stable, high-order computation of traveling&lt;br/&gt;three-dimensional, capillary-gravity water waves, and a numerical&lt;br/&gt;investigation of their dynamic stability.  Another problem the PI will&lt;br/&gt;address is the imposition of "non-reflecting" boundary conditions for&lt;br/&gt;differential equations posed on unbounded domains, particularly in the&lt;br/&gt;setting of electromagnetic and acoustic scattering.  The PI also&lt;br/&gt;proposes a synthesis of two major areas of his research through the&lt;br/&gt;study of backscattering returns of electromagnetic radiation from&lt;br/&gt;traveling ocean waves.  A unifying element in this project, and the&lt;br/&gt;principal numerical tool the PI will employ, is a class of boundary&lt;br/&gt;perturbation methods first introduced by O. Bruno &amp; F. Reitich in the&lt;br/&gt;context of numerical simulation of acoustic and electromagnetic&lt;br/&gt;scattering problems.  These methods have subsequently been&lt;br/&gt;significantly refined and stabilized by Reitich and the PI for the BVP&lt;br/&gt;of computing Dirichlet-Neumann operators, and approximating scattering&lt;br/&gt;configurations.  Among these refinements, the PI &amp; Reitich developed&lt;br/&gt;the method of "Transformed Field Expansions" (TFE) which enables the&lt;br/&gt;reliable, high-order, stable perturbative computation of BVP and FBP.&lt;br/&gt;While this method is extremely successful in resolving simulations&lt;br/&gt;well outside the reach of competing methods, it is somewhat&lt;br/&gt;disadvantaged in terms of computational complexity in comparison to&lt;br/&gt;other techniques (e.g. boundary integrals/elements).  A final project&lt;br/&gt;that the PI proposes is the investigation of two refinements of this&lt;br/&gt;TFE approach to increase its efficiency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fixed and free boundary problems arise in all areas of engineering and&lt;br/&gt;the sciences.  Two particular instances of relevance in this proposal&lt;br/&gt;are the classic free boundary problem of the motion of surface waves&lt;br/&gt;on a large body of water (e.g. a lake, sea, or ocean), and the fixed&lt;br/&gt;boundary problem of scattering of electromagnetic or acoustic waves&lt;br/&gt;from an irregular surface.  The accurate and reliable simulation of&lt;br/&gt;surface waves is used not only to model the capabilities of open-ocean&lt;br/&gt;structures (e.g. oil platforms), but also in the study of transport of&lt;br/&gt;pollutants and other substances of environmental interest across&lt;br/&gt;lakes, seas, and oceans.  Applications of electromagnetic and acoustic&lt;br/&gt;scattering come in problems of radar, imaging, and sensing to name&lt;br/&gt;just a few.  Many numerical techniques are available for the&lt;br/&gt;simulation of these problems and one of the goals of this proposal is&lt;br/&gt;the utilization and improvement of a class of techniques discovered&lt;br/&gt;and refined by the Principal Investigator (PI) and collaborators.  In&lt;br/&gt;particular, when the problems mentioned above are simulated in full&lt;br/&gt;three dimensions, the computations become quite intensive and the&lt;br/&gt;issues truly become those of high-performance computing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
