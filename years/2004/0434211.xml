<AbstractNarration>This is funding to support this year's CSCW doctoral research consortium (workshop) of approximately 12 promising doctoral students from the United States and abroad, along with distinguished research faculty.  The event will take place in conjunction with the ACM 2004 Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW'04), to be held November 6-10 in Chicago, and jointly sponsored by the Association for Computing Machinery's Special Interest Group on Human Computer Interaction (SIGCHI) and the Special Interest Group on Groups (SIGGROUP).  Goals of the workshop include building a cohort group of new researchers who will then have a network of colleagues spread out across the world, guiding the work of new researchers by having experts in the research field give them advice, and making it possible for promising new entrants to the field to attend their research conference.  Student participants will make formal presentations of their work during the workshop, and will receive feedback from the faculty panel.  The feedback is geared to helping students understand and articulate how their work is positioned relative to other CSCW research, whether their topics are adequately focused for thesis research projects, whether their methods are correctly chosen and applied, and whether their results are appropriately analyzed and presented.  Student participants will present their work to the doctoral consortium on November 7, with follow up activities (including poster sessions open to all attendees) to be held during the technical program of the CSCW'04 conference on November 8-10.  SIGCHI's conference management committee will evaluate the doctoral consortium, and the results made available to the organizers of future consortia.  The bi-annual CSCW doctoral consortia, which began in 1992, have been highly successful in providing a forum for the initial socialization into the field of young doctoral scholars, and many of today's leading CSCW researchers participated as students in earlier consortia.  These doctoral consortia traditionally bring together the best of the next generation of CSCW researchers, allowing them to create a social network both among themselves and with senior researchers at a critical stage in their professional development.  Because the students and faculty constitute a diverse group across a variety of dimensions, including nationality/cultural and scientific discipline, the students' horizons are broadened to the future benefit of the field.</AbstractNarration>
