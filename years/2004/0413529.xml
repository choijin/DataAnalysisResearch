<AbstractNarration>Through a competitive bidding process managed and coordinated by the Division of Acquisition and Cost Support (DACS), Kenn Borek Air Ltd. (KBA) of Calgary, Canada has been selected as the provider of medium lift, fixed-wing flight services to the NSF Office of Polar Programs.  KBA will operate a fleet of up to three twin otter aircraft from McMurdo Station, Antarctica and remote locations in the Antarctic from October to February of each year.  The base contract is for two aircraft - one utility and one "science" aircraft - the latter being capable of supporting a variety of airborne remote sensing applications when required.  This contract also contains provisions for the addition of a third utility aircraft, if required, in support of NASA-sponsored meteorite collection activities.  The contract also contains negotiated pricing, on a call-purchase basis, for the provision of utility or science aircraft for use in the Arctic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The value of the contract is estimated at a not-to-exceed level of $13,957,050 over an approximately seven-year period consisting of three years base award with four one-year option periods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Department of Interior, National Business Center, Aviation Management Division, through a memorandum of understanding with the National Science Foundation, Office of Polar Programs, provides support for aviation-related activities in support of United States Antarctic Program (USAP) activities in Antarctica and will manage and administer this contract on behalf of NSF.  All subsequent funding actions against this award will be made through the Department of Interior Award.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this nominal award of $1 is to: 1) bind the contract with KBA, and 2) establish the contract in the NSF financial accounting system for purposes of future awards that will be made over the period of performance of the services.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
