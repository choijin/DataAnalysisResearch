<AbstractNarration>This project is planning to reform and modernize the curriculum and instructional pedagogies of the computer engineering program in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department of The University of Alabama by incorporating a focus on embedded systems throughout the curriculum. The project will develop, evaluate, and disseminate syllabi, associated instructional materials, and an administrative plan for creating and maintaining a curriculum incorporating an integrated embedded systems theme. Development of this curriculum is based on concepts introduced at numerous prestigious institutions already heavily involved in embedded systems education. The curriculum will rely on a unique integration of an embedded systems theme throughout the reformed courses, systematic introduction of state-of-the-art toolsets for embedded systems, focused classroom and laboratory exercises replacing legacy materials in the curriculum, and new educational pedagogies to enhance the learning experience and increase the retention and graduation rates of our students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTELLECTUAL MERIT: The objectives, outcomes, rationale, and plans are based on 1) published work describing the need for an increased emphasis on embedded systems, 2) other successful educational programs in this area, and 3) new pedagogies (e.g. teaming) in engineering education. The investigators have extensive experience both in digital systems education and research and in engineering curriculum development. The evaluation plan is multifaceted with both formative and summative processes and includes input from students, other embedded systems educators from several prestigious universities, and industrial representatives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACT: The project will develop and disseminate a substantial amount of instructional material on embedded systems, an important, emerging educational area. It also will provide documentation on the design and use of an administration and coordination plan for the reformed curriculum that is directly applicable to other disciplines. A partnership with the University of Alabama's Multicultural Engineering Program promotes student recruiting, retention and mentoring of historically underrepresented groups. The dissemination plan outlines specific strategies for involving a group of interested faculty at other institutions and for promoting the ideas and materials through a website, and conference and journal publications.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
