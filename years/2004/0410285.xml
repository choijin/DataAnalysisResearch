<AbstractNarration>Hsieh-Klefstad Abstract&lt;br/&gt;---------&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project is developing new software engineering principles,&lt;br/&gt;techniques, and programming technology based on an improved understanding&lt;br/&gt;of how crosscutting concerns, such as real-time behavior and memory&lt;br/&gt;constraints, interact and can be modularized within embedded middleware.&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates how a combined component-based and&lt;br/&gt;aspect-oriented software engineering approach can advance the development&lt;br/&gt;of embedded applications and middleware.  Experience with existing&lt;br/&gt;middleware for distributed, real-time, and embedded (DRE) systems has&lt;br/&gt;illustrated both the benefits and the limits of implementing&lt;br/&gt;configurability through previous approaches to components and aspects.&lt;br/&gt;The research goal is to achieve expressive power through an&lt;br/&gt;integration of components and aspects.  The new model supports aspect&lt;br/&gt;definition and application at the component level: aspects are constructed&lt;br/&gt;through new compositional forms, and conversely, aspects introduce&lt;br/&gt;functionality at the level of component definitions and interconnections.&lt;br/&gt;Real-time predictability constraints are addressed through the model's&lt;br/&gt;support for real-time Java: components and aspects adapt to real-time&lt;br/&gt;concerns according to their contexts.  The model allows developers to&lt;br/&gt;manage complexity in new ways: by allowing flexible middleware&lt;br/&gt;configuration; by supporting both component-like encapsulation and&lt;br/&gt;controlled exposure to aspects; and by providing sound type checking of&lt;br/&gt;middleware configurations.  The new techniques are being validated through&lt;br/&gt;the development of new, modular, and highly configurable DRE middleware&lt;br/&gt;for real-time Java.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The knowledge that comes from this research will&lt;br/&gt;drive progress in embedded systems development and enable more effective&lt;br/&gt;techniques for modularizing concerns across application and middleware&lt;br/&gt;boundaries.  The project's technology is expected to be particularly useful for &lt;br/&gt;designing and building embedded and real-time software systems, as well as software&lt;br/&gt;systems in general.  Both component systems and middleware have become&lt;br/&gt;popular commercially; this technology should enable and demonstrate the evolution of future component systems and middleware.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
