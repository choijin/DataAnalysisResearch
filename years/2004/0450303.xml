<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: The FACES program is a significant ongoing commitment by the Georgia&lt;br/&gt;Institute of Technology, Emory University, Morehouse College, and Spelman College to&lt;br/&gt;increase the national representation of minorities (URMs) in the engineering and the&lt;br/&gt;sciences professoriate. The program is comprised of several components, and the aggregate&lt;br/&gt;program addresses each critical step along the path to an academic career. To provide a&lt;br/&gt;mechanism for the early recruitment of students into research and academic careers, FACES&lt;br/&gt;will establish a Research Careers Office at Morehouse College. Furthermore, undergraduates&lt;br/&gt;who have completed their sophomore year are provided summer and academic year research&lt;br/&gt;experiences as a means of promoting their interest in research and graduate school&lt;br/&gt;attendance. These students are then encouraged to enroll in graduate programs using a&lt;br/&gt;series of recruitment efforts at national events such as the NSBE Annual Convention or&lt;br/&gt;Annual Biomedical Research Conference for Minority Students (ABRCMS), campus visits and&lt;br/&gt;tours, and a lecture/workshop series on the merit of graduate school and careers in&lt;br/&gt;academia. Admitted Georgia Tech and Emory graduate students are supported on doctoral&lt;br/&gt;fellowship supplements throughout their matriculation. Graduate student support is&lt;br/&gt;provided by means of a stipend which increases in value as the student meets the critical&lt;br/&gt;milestones along the way toward the Ph.D. Another portion of these funds is used to&lt;br/&gt;support travel to technical meetings for research presentations. Finally, senior doctoral&lt;br/&gt;students compete for Career Initiation Grants, which they may use as start-up funds to&lt;br/&gt;assist in establishing their research programs in their initial academic appointments.&lt;br/&gt;Assessment of program outcomes will be performed annually.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: This program is a blending of the resources of these universities to focus&lt;br/&gt;specifically on increasing the production of URMs who earn engineering and science&lt;br/&gt;doctoral degrees. This proposal has been initiated by African American faculty who are&lt;br/&gt;committed to this goal and recognize that success breeds success. Recruiting, mentoring&lt;br/&gt;and academic support programs initiated by Georgia Tech, Emory, Morehouse and Spelman have&lt;br/&gt;been quite successful in increasing retention, grades, and overall production of URM&lt;br/&gt;degree candidates. Our partnership has created a pipeline of successful African American&lt;br/&gt;undergraduates and this proposal describes a doctoral-focused program that builds on the&lt;br/&gt;successful undergraduate efforts. As one of the leading producers of minority engineers&lt;br/&gt;and scientists, this alliance is ideally positioned to increase the national production of&lt;br/&gt;African American students who earn doctorates and promote their representation in academic&lt;br/&gt;careers. With the assistance of NSF funding to keep the program elements in place, FACES&lt;br/&gt;will continue to provide a mechanism to "change the face" of the national engineering and&lt;br/&gt;science professoriate, substantially improving the current dearth of underrepresented&lt;br/&gt;engineering and science faculty.</AbstractNarration>
