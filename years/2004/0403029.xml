<AbstractNarration>This research plan is divided into three projects in algebraic combinatorics and&lt;br/&gt;its applications to other areas of mathematics. The first project is concerned&lt;br/&gt;with several concrete aspects of Schubert calculus on generalized flag&lt;br/&gt;varieties. Its goal is to find combinatorial formulas for expressing the product&lt;br/&gt;of two Schubert classes (in cohomology) in the basis of Schubert classes; this&lt;br/&gt;is equivalent to counting points in a suitable triple intersection of Schubert&lt;br/&gt;varieties. The emphasis will be on the multiplication rule in the cohomology of&lt;br/&gt;the variety of complete flags in complex space. Many different approaches have&lt;br/&gt;been used in this area, but the only manifestly positive formulas that exist are&lt;br/&gt;limited to some easier special cases. The second project is concerned with the&lt;br/&gt;development of a simple combinatorial model (recently introduced by the&lt;br/&gt;investigator in collaboration with A. Postnikov) for the representation theory&lt;br/&gt;of complex semisimple Lie groups, as well as for the Chevalley-type&lt;br/&gt;multiplication formula in the equivariant K-theory of the corresponding&lt;br/&gt;generalized flag variety. The construction is based on combinatorics of&lt;br/&gt;decompositions in the corresponding affine Weyl group and enumeration of&lt;br/&gt;saturated chains in the Bruhat order on the (nonaffine) Weyl group. This model&lt;br/&gt;has several advantages over other combinatorial structures in the area, such as&lt;br/&gt;various specializations of the Littelmann path model. The new model will be&lt;br/&gt;extended in several directions, such as: the representation theory of Kac-Moody&lt;br/&gt;algebras, standard monomial theory, and the quantum K-theory of flag varieties.&lt;br/&gt;The connections with other models and a deeper study of the combinatorics&lt;br/&gt;involved will also be pursued. The third project is concerned with a&lt;br/&gt;combinatorial study of certain formal group laws related to topology. The main&lt;br/&gt;application is to certain immersion problems for lens spaces and projective&lt;br/&gt;spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A unifying theme of the projects outlined here is the emphasis on combinatorics&lt;br/&gt;and computation. During the last decades, computation has gained an important&lt;br/&gt;role in mathematical research. This stimulated the development of combinatorics,&lt;br/&gt;as it became clear that combinatorial structures are particularly well suited&lt;br/&gt;for encoding complex mathematical objects, while combinatorial methods are well&lt;br/&gt;suited for related computations. This research plan is part of the ongoing&lt;br/&gt;effort to perform concrete computations, based on combinatorial structures. One&lt;br/&gt;of the main objects of study are generalized flag varieties. Although these are&lt;br/&gt;classical varieties, they feature prominently in current mathematical research&lt;br/&gt;due to their remarkable combinatorial complexity and the subtle interplay&lt;br/&gt;between various areas related to them. Examples of such areas relevant to the&lt;br/&gt;projects in this plan are: enumerative geometry (concerned with problems such as&lt;br/&gt;counting the lines or planes satisfying a number of generic intersection&lt;br/&gt;conditions, which are equivalent to performing certain cohomology calculations),&lt;br/&gt;and the geometric construction of representations of Lie groups (and, more&lt;br/&gt;generally, Kac-Moody groups). Flag varieties also provide a useful testbed for&lt;br/&gt;the development of combinatorial models relevant to computations in various&lt;br/&gt;cohomology theories of certain projective varieties.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
