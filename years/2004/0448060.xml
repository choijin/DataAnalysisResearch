<AbstractNarration>CAREER: PERFORMANCE AND FITNESS CONSEQUENCES OF INSECT ORNAMENTS&lt;br/&gt;JOHN G. SWALLOW&lt;br/&gt;UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH DAKOTA&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sexual selection is responsible for much of the morphological diversity among animals and is often expressed in the form of male ornamental displays.   Sexual selection theory indicates that these display traits do not come without costs, such that the displays and their costs are countered by natural selection. Stalk-eyed flies provide the ideal model system to test for costs and tradeoffs related to male ornamentation. All species in this extraordinary family display exaggerated head morphology, with eyes and antennae displaced at the end of long stalks, and interspecific variation in eye span can be more than ten-fold. Furthermore, all available evidence indicates that eye stalks are critical sexual signals used in both male-male competition and female choice. This study will examine the effects of elongated eye stalks on flight performance and survivorship of stalk-eyed flies to assess whether these effects run counter to the effects of sexual selection. To achieve this goal, the PI will integrate information from three distinct avenues of research. First, to establish a link between morphology and performance, variation in eye span and locomotor performance will be measured in a single species, Cyrtodiopsis dalmanni, to test for trade-offs between secondary sexual traits and adaptations for flight. For this study, lines of C. dalmanni that have been bidirectionally selected for increased and decreased eye span will be used to increase the natural variation seen in this species. Direct measurements of acceleration, speed and maneuverability during flight will be made using computer-integrated high speed video cameras. Additionally, load lifting capacity and energy used during flight will be measured. Second, the fitness consequences of impaired flight performance will be directly measured in a series of predation avoidance experiments in greenhouse enclosures. Third, patterns of correlated evolution between morphology and flight performance measured on many species within the family Diopsidae will reveal evolutionary consequences of sexual selection. If eye stalks impair locomotor ability, compensatory changes in body design are predicted to evolve within the family to reduce the locomotor cost. Such compensatory changes would indirectly suggest that such reduction in performance was selectively important. This research program incorporates multiple disciplines and will certainly result in new insights regarding interactions between the costs of locomotion and the evolution of secondary sexual ornaments. The PI's educational activities will focus primarily on disadvantaged pre-college students from Native American reservation schools and rural schools. Both of these groups, particularly Native Americans, are traditionally underrepresented in both college and the sciences. South Dakota has both a large Native American population (~ 10%) and a large rural population. Through cooperation with the instructors affiliated with the Mobile Science Laboratory (MSL), the PI will develop a contribution on "Sexual selection and insect diversity: secondary sexual ornaments" for the MSL. Outreach projects developed for the MSL will expose K-12 students from Native American reservation and rural schools to the process of science and discovery. This outreach program has the potential to positively influence thousands of people throughout the state of South Dakota.   &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

Because any feature that helps an animal obtain a mate is selected for, sexual selection explains why males have evolved an array of conspicuous ornaments, behaviors, and weapons.  The assumption has been that the benefits that come with exaggerating one physical or behavioral characteristic for the sake of mating success do not come without costs that affect survival, such as being more vulnerable to disease, starvation or predation. The peacockÆs tail is a textbook example of this assumption.  My labÆs work with stalk-eyed flies shows that this assumption overlies a much more complex situation.   Stalk-eyed flies are a useful model for investigating the costs of carrying around a sexually selected ornament. All stalk-eyed flies are endowed with a bizarre T-shaped head, where the eyes and antennae are laterally displaced on the ends of elongated narrow stalks.

Males engage in ritualized behaviors in which they display and compare their eye stalks and sometimes these displays escalate into physical fights. What keeps eye stalks from growing to even more extravagant lengths is unknown. To fully understand what prevents "run-away" elaboration of male eye stalk length, it is important to understand the costs associated with producing and maintaining eye stalks.   Somewhat surprisingly, we showed that despite an elevated moment of inertia associated with increased eye-span that would require ~1.5 fold larger torques to rotate their bodies during aerial turning, males engaged in maneuvers that were equal to, or surpassed, those of females with shorter eye stalks.
