<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The foci of this conference are in the latest research areas in chemical process dynamics&lt;br/&gt;and control. These include new applications of process control throughout the many&lt;br/&gt;industries that involve chemical processes and products, including biochemical and&lt;br/&gt;materials processing; the development of new sensors; the development of new&lt;br/&gt;techniques that integrate process design and scheduling with control; new methods for&lt;br/&gt;performance monitoring; and new methods for modeling and identification.  Like past conferences, DYCOPS-7 is expected to catalyze the expansion of process&lt;br/&gt;dynamics and control applications in the manufacture of specialty chemicals using batch&lt;br/&gt;processes, in biochemical and biomedical applications, and in improved design strategies&lt;br/&gt;to achieve more controllable processes, among many other areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broad Impact&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The DYCOPS-7 symposium should have a broad impact due to three key factors. First,&lt;br/&gt;over 160 outstanding researchers in process dynamics and control will be participating&lt;br/&gt;from a broad array of countries worldwide. The advances reported by the plenary&lt;br/&gt;speakers and individual researchers are intended to significantly advance the operability&lt;br/&gt;and safety of chemical plants, increasing their productivity and profitability while&lt;br/&gt;protecting against the increased threat of terrorism. Second, the symposium will enable&lt;br/&gt;researchers in the United States to benefit from the experiences of colleagues worldwide,&lt;br/&gt;many of whom are involved in operating world-class chemical plants in developing&lt;br/&gt;countries. Third, the symposium will bring together outstanding young graduate student&lt;br/&gt;researchers from the United States, many of whom will present the results of their&lt;br/&gt;research for the first time at a technical conference. These young researchers should&lt;br/&gt;return to their doctoral research studies with increased motivation and new ideas based&lt;br/&gt;upon interactions with their new colleagues.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
