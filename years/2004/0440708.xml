    <AbstractNarration>Abstract for collaborative award DMS-0439264 and DMS-0440708 of Pollack and Weston:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Iwasawa theory is concerned with the relation between the Galois theoretic&lt;br/&gt;and p-adic analytic aspects of arithmetic objects. The investigators&lt;br/&gt;propose to study the Iwasawa theory of modular forms with supersingular&lt;br/&gt;reduction. A primary focus of this work is the behavior of Iwasawa&lt;br/&gt;invariants in p-adic analytic families of modular forms such as the&lt;br/&gt;eigencurve of Coleman and Mazur. In fact, the definitions of these&lt;br/&gt;invariants, well known in the ordinary case, are not yet known in general&lt;br/&gt;in the supersingular case. In order to define and study the algebraic&lt;br/&gt;Iwasawa invariants the PI's intend to use the p-adic Hodge theory of&lt;br/&gt;Fontaine to study the growth of Selmer groups of modular forms over&lt;br/&gt;cyclotomic fields. The definitions of the analytic invariants should be&lt;br/&gt;related to special values of modular L-functions; exhibiting the desired&lt;br/&gt;behavior in families will involve a study of congruences of special values&lt;br/&gt;of modular L-functions, a recurring theme in much recent work. An&lt;br/&gt;eventual goal of this project is to show that the main conjecture of&lt;br/&gt;Iwasawa theory can be checked for an entire family by checking it for a&lt;br/&gt;single form in the family. The investigators also intend to study the&lt;br/&gt;generalization of the Riemann-Hurwitz type formula of Kida, Hachimori and&lt;br/&gt;Matsuno, which describe the change in p-adic Iwasawa invariants over&lt;br/&gt;p-extensions of number fields, to modular forms of higher weight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Number theory, often considered the oldest mathematical discipline, has in&lt;br/&gt;recent times developed remarkable applications to cryptography. Many of&lt;br/&gt;these applications involve arithmetic geometric objects known as elliptic&lt;br/&gt;curves. Modular forms, the primary object of study in this proposal, are&lt;br/&gt;generalizations of elliptic curves which play a fundamental role in modern&lt;br/&gt;number theory. The questions investigated in this proposal deal with&lt;br/&gt;invariants which are closely related to those of interest in cryptography&lt;br/&gt;and may perhaps yield some insight into them.</AbstractNarration>
