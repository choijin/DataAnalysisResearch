<AbstractNarration>Redox homeostasis is central to the functions of oxygenic photosynthetic organisms&lt;br/&gt;such as cyanobacteria and plants. In this project, a systems approach will be&lt;br/&gt;undertaken to analyze the impact of cellular redox status on the overall functions of&lt;br/&gt;these organisms. The initial focus will be on the cyanobacterium Synechocystis 6803,&lt;br/&gt;with subsequent applications in the understanding of the biology of Arabidopsis, a&lt;br/&gt;vascular plant, and Physcomitrella, a non-vascular plant. Synechocystis 6803 has a&lt;br/&gt;completely sequenced genome and is amenable to high-throughput genome level&lt;br/&gt;manipulations. Although the detailed inventory of the genes, transcripts and proteins are&lt;br/&gt;available for Synechocystis, it is inadequate to comprehend the organizational hierarchy&lt;br/&gt;of the complex functions of this organism. A multidisciplinary approach will be used to&lt;br/&gt;resolve this gap in fundamental knowledge. The expertise of the project team spans&lt;br/&gt;molecular genetics, biochemistry, proteomics, metabolomics, computational biology and&lt;br/&gt;systems engineering, which includes nonlinear modeling, estimation and statistical&lt;br/&gt;analysis. The experimental research experience of the team spans model systems in&lt;br/&gt;cyanobacteria, moss and flowering plants. One aim is to infer a gene regulatory network&lt;br/&gt;in cyanobacteria that will include identification of the sensing and signaling pathways. In&lt;br/&gt;addition, a gene regulatory network will be independently generated in Arabidopsis, and&lt;br/&gt;the conservation of the genes and interactions will be evaluated. The network will be&lt;br/&gt;validated, the contribution of the network modules to the overall redox regulation will be&lt;br/&gt;studied, and the model will be extended to Physcomitrella. Such an iterative process is&lt;br/&gt;expected to generate fundamental insights into the organization and function of the&lt;br/&gt;redox control network (RCN) in these organisms. Furthermore, the proposed approach,&lt;br/&gt;viz. first to model an RCN in cyanobacteria and then to extend it to plants, will highlight&lt;br/&gt;the expected conserved nature of these processes during the evolution of land plants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broad Impact: The research activities in this project will be intimately connected to the&lt;br/&gt;training and development of undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral students, and&lt;br/&gt;visiting scholars, both at Washington University and Colgate University. In particular,&lt;br/&gt;students from both Biology and Systems Engineering will become well-versed in the use&lt;br/&gt;of mathematics and computational methods to answer challenging questions in biology.&lt;br/&gt;Collaborative interactions with Saitama University will allow scientific interactions and&lt;br/&gt;research visits between USA and Japan. An important goal of this project is an&lt;br/&gt;integration of cutting-edge technologies with learning experiences that will inspire faculty&lt;br/&gt;and student development from small colleges lacking significant research programs.&lt;br/&gt;The students will obtain mentoring, research credit and training. They will become&lt;br/&gt;aware of the fascinating array of activities and career choices in modern life science&lt;br/&gt;research. Hands-on training in genomics, bioinformatics and systems science research&lt;br/&gt;will have far-reaching educational impacts well beyond the project period.&lt;br/&gt;The link for the project web site is http://www.sysbio.wustl.edu/.</AbstractNarration>
