<AbstractNarration>HRD-0429799&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Lenore Blum has been a local and national leader in encouraging women in SMET, particularly mathematics and computer sciences,  for more than 30 years. Her pioneer program, Expanding Your Horizons, was developed when she was at Mills College, starting in 1973, and then expanded across the country through the Math/Science Network to reach thousands of young women in middle-schools. In EYH conferences young women are exposed, perhaps for the first time, to a variety of women in science and related careers. EYH was a centerpiece/model for several of the other national and local activities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The submitted nomination package is in support of a Presidential Award for Excellence in Science, Mathematics, and Engineering Mentoring (PAESMEM) to recognize outstanding mentoring efforts or programs that enhance the participation of historically underrepresented groups in science, mathematics, and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
