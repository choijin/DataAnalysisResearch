<AbstractNarration>Abstract DEB 0407894&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Passiflora (the Passionflowers) comprises more than 520 species of&lt;br/&gt;vines or small trees with highly specialized flowers that occur in tropical&lt;br/&gt;habitats worldwide. Most diverse in the New World, they are represented in&lt;br/&gt;the Old World by only about 22 uncommon and poorly known species from Asia&lt;br/&gt;and the Austral-Pacific region. Preliminary phylogenetic study indicates&lt;br/&gt;that those 22 species descended from a single common ancestor, thus forming&lt;br/&gt;a natural group (supersection Disemma). This group differs from other&lt;br/&gt;Passionflowers in its floral development, unusual leaf arrangements, and in&lt;br/&gt;the diverse array of sugar-producing nectaries found both in the flowers and&lt;br/&gt;on leaves and stems, meaning that an understanding of character patterns in&lt;br/&gt;this group is essential to understanding patterns of diversity in the genus&lt;br/&gt;as a whole.  A broad approach will be employed to reconstruct phylogenetic&lt;br/&gt;relationships among the species, using characters from morphology and&lt;br/&gt;anatomy of flowers and vegetative structures and nuclear and plastid gene&lt;br/&gt;sequences.  Nectaries will be studied by comparing gene expression among the&lt;br/&gt;various forms to address the question of whether they share an underlying&lt;br/&gt;genetic basis.  A monograph for the section will be completed that will&lt;br/&gt;present revised species circumscriptions, illustrations, distribution maps,&lt;br/&gt;and keys to facilitate identification of these species, forming an essential&lt;br/&gt;basis for conservation efforts for the group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;      The project has impact far beyond serving as a dissertation study.&lt;br/&gt;The Passionflowers are popular subjects for horticulture and therefore the&lt;br/&gt;results of this work can have implications for commercial growers and&lt;br/&gt;hobbyists.  Extensive collaboration with researchers in Central and&lt;br/&gt;Southeast Asia is an integral part of the study. Individuals from botanical&lt;br/&gt;gardens and universities in Yunnan, Guangdong, and Hainan provinces of&lt;br/&gt;China, as well as Vietnam, Thailand, India, and Papua New Guinea will be&lt;br/&gt;involved in the acquisition and study of these species, strengthening ties&lt;br/&gt;between US and foreign institutions. Collaboration provides an opportunity&lt;br/&gt;for all parties involved to learn about the practical aspects of conserving&lt;br/&gt;habitats and the rare species found within them. The monograph, including&lt;br/&gt;identification tools for Disemma, will be made available to the public&lt;br/&gt;broadly via the World Wide Web. This information will allow identification&lt;br/&gt;of rare species of Passionflowers in the wild, facilitating conservation&lt;br/&gt;efforts at the level of local management authorities. Live material&lt;br/&gt;collected in the field will be cultivated and distributed to botanical&lt;br/&gt;gardens in the United States, forming the basis for ex situ conservation&lt;br/&gt;efforts.  Preserved field collections will be distributed to herbaria,&lt;br/&gt;increasing resources for future workers.  The developmental study of&lt;br/&gt;nectaries will provide a model for how genetic techniques can be used to&lt;br/&gt;probe morphological diversity.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
