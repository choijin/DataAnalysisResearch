<AbstractNarration>0451688&lt;br/&gt;Tan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a planning visit to enable Professor Xiang-Dong Tan at the University of California in Riverside to meet with Professor Xianglong Hong at Tsinghua University in Beijing, China.  The visit will help develop a collaborative plan for the development of computer-aided design (CAD) tools for physical design and verification of low power nanometer VLSI designs.  The PI will finalize many details regarding the collaborative research and partnerships by:  1) preparing a number of joint funding proposals based on the research objectives and scopes;  2) holding a number of meetings with some semiconductor and electronic design automation (EDA) companies' technical representatives to discuss the sponsored research projects; and  3) present seminars to the faculty and students in the Design Automation Lab at Tsinghua University in order for the group to brainstorm new ideas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Tan has many years of experience on VLSI circuit verification and optimization and Professor Hong is a world-renowned expert on physical design.  The expertise and experience of the two faculty members are complementary for the proposed collaborative project, and they expect to collaborate through a coordinated division of labor.  In addition to adding significantly to the core knowledge of simulation and optimization for nanometer billion-transistor VLSI designs, the anticipated research will provide unique training and educational opportunities for U.S. graduate students and undergraduate students by enabling them to obtain a global experience.  It is anticipated that these early collaborations between the scientists and students from each country will lead to long-term collaborations that will benefit both institutions.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
