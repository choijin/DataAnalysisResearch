<AbstractNarration>AST-0407084&lt;br/&gt;Oh&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study of the cosmological Dark Ages is gaining momentum, fueled by recent observational breakthroughs and strides in computing power.  This project has three main themes.  Firstly, observations now suggest that the reionization history of the Universe progressed in a non-monotonic manner, and simulations and semi-analytic models will be developed and used to test possible contributing effects.  Secondly, optical depth effects and photon trapping will be added to simulations of early star formation, to try to make those studies more realistic.  Finally, brightness temperature fluctuations due to the free-free contribution from the reionization epoch will be modeled in detail, for comparison to planned observations.  This research could significantly alter the standard picture of how early star formation is thought to proceed.  It has a direct impact on the interpretation of recent observations, and bears upon future instruments, possibly influencing their design and observational strategies.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Collaboration meetings will strengthen ties with researchers on the East Coast and in Japan.  The Dark Ages is a glamorous subject, ideally suited for its intended use in public talks and journalism, planned in conjunction with the host institution's strong outreach program.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
