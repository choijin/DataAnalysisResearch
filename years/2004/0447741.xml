<AbstractNarration>CAREER: E-textile-based Wearable Computing for Sensing User Motions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project Abstract &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ideally, a wearable computer should always be available to the user,&lt;br/&gt;should not interfere with the user's movements, and should be invisible&lt;br/&gt;to those around the user.  Electronic textiles (e-textiles), an emerging&lt;br/&gt;technology that blends fabric with electronics, has the potential to&lt;br/&gt;meet these goals. Interconnections and components are an intrinsic&lt;br/&gt;part of the cloth, enabling the creation of "smart" garments that have&lt;br/&gt;the appearance and feel of normal clothing while providing sensing and&lt;br/&gt;computing capabilities. This NSF CAREER project addresses the research issues involved&lt;br/&gt;in designing e-textile garments that can sense their own shapes and&lt;br/&gt;the positions of their sensing/processing elements. The major&lt;br/&gt;outcome of the research component of this project will be a complete&lt;br/&gt;e-textiles design framework that will permit e-textiles to function&lt;br/&gt;robustly across a wide range of applications and the full spectrum of&lt;br/&gt;the user population.  The education component of this project integrates&lt;br/&gt;e-textiles research into the classroom and develops novel educational&lt;br/&gt;modules for improving the debugging skills of students based upon Kolb's&lt;br/&gt;learning cycle and Felder's learning styles.  The project's intellectual &lt;br/&gt;merit is that it enables e-textiles to reach their full potential&lt;br/&gt;for wearable computing, creating a better platform for existing wearable&lt;br/&gt;computing applications and being an enabling platform for applications&lt;br/&gt;that are not feasible with existing technology. The project also has&lt;br/&gt;significant broader impact, by enabling novel applications in the areas&lt;br/&gt;of health care for the elderly and people with disabilities, industry,&lt;br/&gt;emergency response, and untethered motion tracking. The collaborative&lt;br/&gt;nature of the project provides students with multidisciplinary research&lt;br/&gt;experience, enhancing their contributions to the future growth of the&lt;br/&gt;field.  Finally, it is expected that e-textiles can help reinvigorate&lt;br/&gt;the Virginia textile industry.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
