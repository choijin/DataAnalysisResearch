    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0405529&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Thomas E. Cecil&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this proposal is to study submanifolds of Euclidean&lt;br/&gt;space and the unit sphere which have special curvature&lt;br/&gt;properties. Of particular interest are isoparametric&lt;br/&gt;hypersurfaces, which have constant principal curvatures, and&lt;br/&gt;Dupin hypersurfaces, which have the property that each principal&lt;br/&gt;curvature is constant along each of its curvature surfaces.&lt;br/&gt;Although these important classes of hypersurfaces have been&lt;br/&gt;studied since the nineteenth century, many natural problems&lt;br/&gt;remain open at this time. The principal investigator and his&lt;br/&gt;collaborators, Quo-Shin Chi and Gary Jensen of Washington&lt;br/&gt;University, will employ the method of moving frames on Legendre&lt;br/&gt;submanifolds in Lie sphere geometry in their research on these&lt;br/&gt;problems. This method is applicable to the study of any&lt;br/&gt;submanifold in Euclidean space, not just to those mentioned here,&lt;br/&gt;and it has been used successfully by the principal investigator&lt;br/&gt;and his collaborators in previous research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dupin hypersurfaces have been studied extensively since the&lt;br/&gt;introduction of the cyclides of Dupin in 1822, and great progress&lt;br/&gt;has been made over the past 25 years in their classification.&lt;br/&gt;Dupin hypersurfaces have played a major role in various&lt;br/&gt;mathematical theories, such as the theory of taut embeddings, the&lt;br/&gt;study of Hamiltonian systems of hydrodynamic type, and the theory&lt;br/&gt;of higher-dimensional Laplace invariants. The cyclides of Dupin&lt;br/&gt;have also apperared in recent papers on computer aided geometric&lt;br/&gt;design. The study of isoparametric hypersurfaces in spheres was&lt;br/&gt;initiated by the renowned French mathematician, Elie Cartan, in&lt;br/&gt;the 1930's, and many mathematicians have made significant&lt;br/&gt;contributions to this beautiful theory. Included in the class of&lt;br/&gt;isoparametric hypersurfaces and their focal sets are many famous&lt;br/&gt;geometric objects, such as the Veronese surface and the&lt;br/&gt;Clifford-Stiefel manifolds, which have been studied by research&lt;br/&gt;mathematicians from several different points of view. In terms&lt;br/&gt;of Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) activities and&lt;br/&gt;the broader impact of the proposal, the principal investigator&lt;br/&gt;plans to continue his successful program of new course&lt;br/&gt;development and mentoring of individual students. Over the past&lt;br/&gt;fifteen years, this has resulted in 13 honors theses and a total&lt;br/&gt;of 25 students in geometry courses, who have attended or plan to&lt;br/&gt;attend graduate school in mathematics or related fields.</AbstractNarration>
