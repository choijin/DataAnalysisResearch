    <AbstractNarration>Proposal Title: Planning Meeting for NEES/E-DEFENSE Collaboration in&lt;br/&gt;Earthquake Engineering&lt;br/&gt;Institution: NEES Consortium, Inc.&lt;br/&gt;Abstract Date: 08/10/2004&lt;br/&gt;Project Summary&lt;br/&gt;The George E. Brown, Jr. Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES)&lt;br/&gt;initiated&lt;br/&gt;by the US National Science Foundation (NSF) in late 1999 is intended to transform the&lt;br/&gt;nation.s ability to carry out earthquake engineering research. With over $80 million in&lt;br/&gt;new&lt;br/&gt;cutting-edge tools for experimentation, networking, data curation and communication,&lt;br/&gt;the&lt;br/&gt;best minds in earthquake engineering will be able to challenge and solve the most&lt;br/&gt;difficult&lt;br/&gt;impediments to reducing the nation's vulnerability to earthquakes. To accelerate&lt;br/&gt;attainment&lt;br/&gt;of NEES's goals, and avoid unnecessary duplication of effort, US investigators need to&lt;br/&gt;collaborate and have access to data and facilities internationally.&lt;br/&gt;A major long-term, research initiative has begun in Japan known as .E-Defense.. This&lt;br/&gt;initiative is managed by the National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster&lt;br/&gt;Prevention (NIED) on behalf of the Japan Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports,&lt;br/&gt;Science&lt;br/&gt;and Technology (MExT). A key component of this initiative is a new, large (20 by 15 m)&lt;br/&gt;shaking table capable of subjecting full-scale, five-story tall, specimens to&lt;br/&gt;three-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;seismic excitations larger than those experienced in the devastating 1995 Hyogo-ken&lt;br/&gt;Nanbu&lt;br/&gt;earthquake. In addition, a long-term research program using this shaking table and&lt;br/&gt;other&lt;br/&gt;major facilities for experimentation and computer-based simulation is planned. This&lt;br/&gt;program&lt;br/&gt;calls for a strong, but as yet undefined, component of international collaboration.&lt;br/&gt;As such, a Planning Meeting is being convened in Shin-Kobe, Japan, near the&lt;br/&gt;E-Defense&lt;br/&gt;shaking table facility, during April 6-8, 2004 to discuss opportunities for collaboration&lt;br/&gt;between the NEES and E-Defense. A small, but diverse group of representative&lt;br/&gt;researchers&lt;br/&gt;from the US and Japan are meeting, along with representatives from NIED, MExT, NSF,&lt;br/&gt;the&lt;br/&gt;NEES Consortium, Inc. (NCI), to identify research topics of mutual interest that fully take&lt;br/&gt;advantage of the unique capabilities of the E-Defense facilities, mechanisms for&lt;br/&gt;developing&lt;br/&gt;NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Proposal:0431490 PI Name:Buckle, Ian&lt;br/&gt;Printed from eJacket: 08/10/04 Page 1 of 2&lt;br/&gt;research plans and projects, and steps needed to implement NEESgrid and related&lt;br/&gt;services&lt;br/&gt;within E-Defense so that the full potential of collaboration between those involved in the&lt;br/&gt;NEES Collaboratory and E-Defense can be realized. The findings of the meeting are&lt;br/&gt;being&lt;br/&gt;distributed widely to potential sponsors and researchers in Japan and in the US.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The E-Defense program in Japan provides truly phenomenal&lt;br/&gt;opportunities for discovery and innovation not possible within the current NEES&lt;br/&gt;portfolio.&lt;br/&gt;By leveraging US and Japanese resources through focused collaborative effort, it is&lt;br/&gt;possible&lt;br/&gt;to accelerate the pace of discovery and innovation needed to mitigate catastrophic&lt;br/&gt;losses due&lt;br/&gt;to large earthquakes. NEES/E-Defense is expected to provide the overall US&lt;br/&gt;earthquake&lt;br/&gt;engineering community access to rich sets of data.&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts resulting from proposed activity: Explicit NEES/E-Defense&lt;br/&gt;collaboration will provide heightened opportunities for international cooperation. These&lt;br/&gt;include conduct of collaborative research projects, sharing of unique research&lt;br/&gt;resources,&lt;br/&gt;development of international standards and capabilities for documenting, archiving and&lt;br/&gt;sharing information, and exchange of personnel. Participants in NEES/E-Defense&lt;br/&gt;projects&lt;br/&gt;are expected to include junior researchers, women and members of underrepresented&lt;br/&gt;groups,&lt;br/&gt;as well as senior members, of the earthquake engineering and IT research communities&lt;br/&gt;NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Proposal:0431490 PI Name:Buckle, Ian</AbstractNarration>
