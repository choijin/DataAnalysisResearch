<AbstractNarration>A junior faculty specializing in experimental studies of upper atmospheric electrodynamics, chemistry and plasma physics is supported.  Student support is realized from the technically proficient student population at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University.  A graduate degree granting program in Space Science is established following curriculum augmentation of three graduate level classes in Space Physics.  This faculty augmentation, along with the established membership if Virginia polytechnic Institute in the National Institute of Aerospace establishes a new international leader in Space Science education and research with particular emphasis placed upon ethnic and gender diversity in the Space Sciences.</AbstractNarration>
