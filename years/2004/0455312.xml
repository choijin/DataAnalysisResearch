<AbstractNarration>This is funding to support attendance by approximately 40 participants from the United States in the 2005 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA'05), which will be held in Barcelona, Spain, on April 18-22, 2005.  This annual IEEE event, sponsored by the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society, has become the largest annual conference in robotics and automation worldwide, and serves as the premier forum for gathering international researchers together for the exchange of ideas on technical problems and their solutions, and on emerging technologies.   NSF funds will help ensure a high U.S. presence at ICRA'05, by providing partial airfare reimbursement to selected U.S. researchers who have had papers accepted but who due to financial hardship would otherwise be unable to attend the conference to present their work.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  The PI has established a 4-member Selection Committee to choose the beneficiaries from the NSF funds.  The committee will pay special attention to enabling participation by student (co)authors and by members of traditionally under-represented groups and institutions.  This funding will expose participants to the latest research results while also enabling them to build and/or enhance their social network of peers and mentors within the research community, which will in the future benefit them and the country as a whole.</AbstractNarration>
