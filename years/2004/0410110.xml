<AbstractNarration>The investigator has developed tools for dimensional reduction and homogenization in nonlinear&lt;br/&gt;problems based on the Mori-Zwanzig formalism of irreversible statistical mechanics.&lt;br/&gt;He plans to use these methods, and if needed to extend them, in the following problems:&lt;br/&gt;1. Reduce the number of effective variables (in effect, perform an approximate&lt;br/&gt;marginalization) in the evaluation of the proposal distribution in a sequential&lt;br/&gt;Monte-Carlo implementation of the Bayesian filter for data assimilation.&lt;br/&gt;2. Formulate effective  block Monte-Carlo methods, with applications &lt;br/&gt;to the motion of biological heteropolymers and to a Monte-Carlo implementation of&lt;br/&gt;the Callen-Symanzik renormalization group for vortex-dominated phase transitions. &lt;br/&gt;3. Derive effective equations for multi-scale wave propagation problems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal has several components. The connecting thread is the use of methods the investigator&lt;br/&gt;has previously developed for reducing the number of variables in a complex problem&lt;br/&gt;while leaving intact its salient statistical features. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first component is the filtering/data assimilation problem. Suppose you have a&lt;br/&gt;complex system with some randomness and you make a forecast about its behavior&lt;br/&gt;at a future time ( for example, you make a weather forecast). Then new information comes&lt;br/&gt;in (for example, you open the window and you see that contrary to your forecast, &lt;br/&gt;it's raining).  How do you incorporate this new information into your forecast?&lt;br/&gt;In principle this can be done by a creating on the computer a collection of replicas &lt;br/&gt;of the system and then modifying the distribution of the replicas with the help of the&lt;br/&gt;new observations, but this is in general far too expensive in practice. The investigator's  &lt;br/&gt;previous work makes it possible in principle to reduce the cost of such algorithms&lt;br/&gt;by a considerable factor, but it is still unknown whether this reduction is sufficient&lt;br/&gt;to make them practical. The investigator proposes to find out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another component is the study of the mutual attraction of disordered&lt;br/&gt;heteropolymers. It has been proposed by biologists that such heteropolymers&lt;br/&gt;attract each other when the probability densities of the distribution of &lt;br/&gt;particular molecules on each fit in a statistical sense, even when the averaged &lt;br/&gt;interaction is zero, and that this happens for example when the immune system identifies&lt;br/&gt;invading viruses. To check this hypothesis on the computer leads to very large &lt;br/&gt;computational tasks which the investigator thinks he can simplify.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A further component comes from theoretical physics. The vortex unbinding transition is&lt;br/&gt;important in many problems ( for example in the theory of thin films) but more&lt;br/&gt;importantly it is a basic paradigm in quantum field theory. In earlier work with O. Hald&lt;br/&gt;the investigator has shown that present theory is incomplete and pointed out several paradoxes.&lt;br/&gt;To understand what is going on requires a calculation which has been until now too large&lt;br/&gt;to be successfully completed, but the new methods open the possibility that it can&lt;br/&gt;be brought to completion, and the investigator proposes to try.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
