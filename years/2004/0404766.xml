<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0404766&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  H. Blaine Lawson, Jr.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is concerned with the study of cycles, residues,&lt;br/&gt;boundaries and differential characters.  The proposal has several&lt;br/&gt;interrelated parts.  The first concerns the groups of algebraic&lt;br/&gt;cycles and cocycles on a projective variety $X$.  The aim is to&lt;br/&gt;relate these groups to the global structure of $X$.  The&lt;br/&gt;investigator has, with others, established a theory of homology&lt;br/&gt;type for algebraic varieties based on the homotopy groups of&lt;br/&gt;cycles spaces. This theory will be used to study concrete&lt;br/&gt;questions about algebraic spaces.  Implications for real&lt;br/&gt;algebraic geometry will be explored.  Striking onnections to&lt;br/&gt;universal constructions in topology which emerged in prior&lt;br/&gt;research will also be investigated. A second part of the proposal&lt;br/&gt;concerns cycles which bound complex subvarieties in a projective&lt;br/&gt;manifold.  Several new conjectures relate these cycles to&lt;br/&gt;approximation theory, pluripotential theory, and the projective&lt;br/&gt;spectrum of Banach graded algebras.  A third area of the proposal&lt;br/&gt;concerns the study of singularities and characteristic&lt;br/&gt;forms. This subject includes a generalization of Chern-Weil&lt;br/&gt;theory which gives canonical homologies between singularities of&lt;br/&gt;bundle maps and characteristic forms. It includes a useful&lt;br/&gt;analytic tool -- geometric atomicity -- which will be studied,&lt;br/&gt;and it yields a new approach to Morse Theory. Applications&lt;br/&gt;relating singularities to global geometry remain to be&lt;br/&gt;investigated. The forth part of the proposal concerns sparks and&lt;br/&gt;spark complexes. This recently developed framework for the study&lt;br/&gt;of differential characters has yielded interesting&lt;br/&gt;generalizations which extend Deligne cohomology and arithmetic&lt;br/&gt;Chow groups. They are essentially secondary invariants which&lt;br/&gt;mediate between cycles and smooth data. Further development of&lt;br/&gt;the theory and its application to the study of cycles is&lt;br/&gt;proposed. A fifth area is concerned with special cycles in&lt;br/&gt;geometry, in particular Special Lagrangian cycles in Calabi-Yau&lt;br/&gt;manifolds, and associative and Cayley cycles in $G_2$ and&lt;br/&gt;Spin$_7$ spaces. These latter subjects relate to mirror symmetry&lt;br/&gt;conjectures and to M-theory in Physics as well as many areas of&lt;br/&gt;geometry and algebra. This project will also be concerned with&lt;br/&gt;student development, including an undergraduate educational&lt;br/&gt;effort aimed at fostering mathematical independence and&lt;br/&gt;developing interactive enviornments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A concept of central importance in geometry is that of a&lt;br/&gt;``cycle''.  In algebraic geometry a cycle corresponds to the&lt;br/&gt;simultaneous solution of a system of polynomial equations. In&lt;br/&gt;differential geometry they arise in many ways: as the large scale&lt;br/&gt;solutions of certain differential equations, and as the level&lt;br/&gt;sets and singularity sets of differentiable mappings.  Curves and&lt;br/&gt;surfaces in space are simple examples.  Cycles with a particular&lt;br/&gt;geometry also play a fundamental role in modern physical theories&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is concerned with the study of cycles across this&lt;br/&gt;broad spectrum. In the algebraic setting cycles have been related&lt;br/&gt;to fundamental large-scale geometry of their surrounding&lt;br/&gt;space. This discovery has revealed surprizing and important&lt;br/&gt;relationships between spaces of algebraic cycles and fundamental&lt;br/&gt;constructions in algebraic topology and has led to new insights&lt;br/&gt;in both fields.  This work will be continued.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another area of investigation concerns cycles which form the&lt;br/&gt;boundary of subsets with special geometric structure.  They&lt;br/&gt;represent non-linear versions of classical boundary value&lt;br/&gt;problems in analysis. Such questions arise in many contexts.&lt;br/&gt;Recently the proposer has formulated conjectures relating certain&lt;br/&gt;important classes of such cycles to questions in approximation&lt;br/&gt;theory and Banach algebras. Successful resolution should produce&lt;br/&gt;significant new insights in several fields of mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A third area of study concerns a mathematical apparatus developed&lt;br/&gt;by the proposer to detect subtle relationships between cycles and&lt;br/&gt;the global structure of the space they live in.  This apparatus&lt;br/&gt;encompasses some of the most effective tools historically&lt;br/&gt;developed for this purpose, and it is much more general. Further&lt;br/&gt;development of this theory and its applications will be persued.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A fourth domain of investigation is concerned with special cycles&lt;br/&gt;in geometry: Special Lagrangian cycles in Calabi-Yau manifolds,&lt;br/&gt;and associative and Cayley cycles in G(2) and Spin(7) spaces.&lt;br/&gt;These latter subjects relate to gauge field theory and gravity in&lt;br/&gt;Physics&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will also be concerned with graduate student&lt;br/&gt;development.  Students will be part of the research team.  There&lt;br/&gt;will also be an undergraduate educational effort aimed at&lt;br/&gt;fostering mathematical independence and developing interactive&lt;br/&gt;environments.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
