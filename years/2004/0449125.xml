<AbstractNarration>0449125&lt;br/&gt;Khan&lt;br/&gt;Entrapped bacteria have been used in several applications including wastewater treatment.   Effects of entrapment on the bacterial physiology, such as growth rate, metabolic activity, and cell morphology, are known in food technology, biomedical, and pharmaceutical applications while in wastewater treatment applications very little is known on the topic. One of several goals of this research is to advance fundamental understanding on the use of cell entrapment in wastewater treatment.  To achieve this goal, the principal investigator (PI) proposes to investigate the effects of entrapment on growth rate, metabolic activity, cell morphology, cell surface properties, genetic material quantity, and stress of three pure cultures typically encountered in activated sludge. Several techniques in molecular biology and nanotechnology will be used to elucidate what lies beneath the performance of entrapped cells.  Knowledge and techniques from different disciplines, molecular biology and nanotechnology, will be used to solve the research problems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will benefit several parties: researchers, practitioners, and students at different levels. Underrepresented American Indians are the target group for activities for pre-college students. This project will have a broad impact because storm water pollution is not a problem only in the U.S. but throughout the world.  This progran will promote research partnerships between the PI and faculty in his department and other departments at his university, and a graduate program overseas.</AbstractNarration>
