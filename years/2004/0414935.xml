<AbstractNarration>A new Small-Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) System will fulfill immediate needs in the &lt;br/&gt;characterization of polymeric, catalytic, biological, electroactive, nanocomposite and other classes of materials and complex fluids. The instrument will be used as a multi-user facility available to all faculty and students in the COE and other units at UD. We have selected the high-flux SAXS system from Anton Paar (SAXSess) as the most suitable instrument for the COE on the basis of its capabilities, resolution, ease of use and the quality of the software for data analysis. It uses the line-shaped beam from a conventional X-ray tube that is focused using multilayer optics and a block collimator to produce an intense primary beam.  The signal is detected by a 2D imaging plate and the q range is very suitable for the samples that we propose to investigate. It has a built-in pinhole option that can be used to investigate oriented anisotropic samples and we plan to include the wide-angle extension that allows for the simultaneous measurement of the angular range from 0 degrees to 45 degrees of scattering angle.  Small angle scattering is essential for the characterization of nanostructured materials and complex fluids.  With the large emphasis on nanotechnology in the current research paradigm, and certainly here at UD, this new SAXS will fill a large materials characterization gap in the COE.s research capabilities and provide research benefit to 8 immediate users.  Up to 8 additional investigators both in the COE and in Physics and Astronomy have expressed the need for SAXS capabilities. The major users of the instrument will utilize it for the characterization of (1) self-assembled nanocomposite materials using biopolymer matrices and clay platelet or peptide fibrillar nanoscopic reinforcement; (2) to study the self-assembly of organic-silica nanoparticles in aqueous solutions; and (3) to investigate the structure and stability of colloidal surfactant aggregates.  &lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;A new Small-Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) System will fulfill immediate needs in the &lt;br/&gt;characterization of polymeric, catalytic, biological, electroactive, nanocomposite and other classes of materials and complex fluids.
