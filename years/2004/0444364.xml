<AbstractNarration>NEUROGENESIS AND THE MAKINGS OF MEMORIES&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A few years ago now, it was rediscovered that the adult brain continues to produce new neurons throughout the lifespan.  A structure known as the hippocampus generates thousands of new neurons each day, underscoring an amazing capacity for change throughout life.  Numerous studies have been undertaken to try to find out what these new neurons do and several indicate that they may participate in the formation of new memories.  Specifically, it has been shown that animals in which neurogenesis is prevented cannot form some types of new memories, often referred to as trace memories, yet readily acquire other types of memories.  One of the more curious features of these new neurons is that most die within weeks of their birth.  However, it has also been shown that learning these types of memory tasks can rescue the new neurons from death. Overall, the data suggest that new neurons in the hippocampus are somehow involved in the formation of memories. With funding from NSF, Dr. Shors and her laboratory will determine exactly how new neurons are used in the formation of new memories and what it about learning that enhances their survival.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Neurogenesis has not only captured the imagination of neuroscientists but also the public at large, many of whom are young people now attracted to a career in science. Dr. Shors provides public lectures on the topic and from these activities as well as her website, publications and visits to universities and local schools, has attracted large numbers of students interested in these studies. With the support of NSF, Dr. Shors will continue her efforts to attract new students, especially women and minorities as well as to distribute information about this exciting topic and its implications for human experience.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
