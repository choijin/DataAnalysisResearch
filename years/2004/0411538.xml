<AbstractNarration>The overall goal of the Huston-Tillotson College (HTC) planning project is to conduct self-assessments and external research that will result in the development of a full HBCU-UP implementation proposal.  The full proposal will include a conceptual blueprint for an exemplary program that is complementary to the goals of the institution and responsive to the learning needs of a student population that is under represented in science, technology, engineering and mathematic (STEM) fields.  The proposed planning grant will: (1) conduct a detailed evaluation of its STEM faculty, curriculum, students, and scientific infrastructure; (2) study and adopt the effective practices of institutions with exemplary STEM programs; (3) design professional development strategies that will improve the capabilities of STEM faculty and thereby increase student learning outcomes; and (4) develop cooperative agreements with research-intensive institutions as partners and collaborators. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the planning process, HTC will: (a) procure the services of a professional evaluator to conduct a STEM institutional assessment, (b) identify contingencies for unmet needs; (c) adapt the best-practices of partner and model institutions by performing site visits to other institutions; and (d) integrate the results into a cohesive and sustainable plan of action for the institution.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt;The planning grant activities are based on a research and have objectives that are tied to the institutional strategic goals.  The planning grant will evaluate all STEM programs to determine the best course of action to enhance the STEM programs for the institution.  HTC is poised and committed to enhancing the STEM education that is offered to its students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact &lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the development of a full HBCU-UP implementation project on the STEM programs at HTC includes: 1) The development of a collegiate environment that attracts STEM majors, trains and retains them to graduation, and 2) The increase of the numbers of HTC students going into graduate programs or careers in STEM fields.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
