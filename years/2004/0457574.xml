<AbstractNarration>Title: Combinatorics and Number Theory III&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: Wen-Ching Winnie Li, Penn State University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal contains two projects, in number theory and its&lt;br/&gt;applications to combinatorics. The first project concerns&lt;br/&gt;modular forms for noncongruence groups and their connections to forms&lt;br/&gt;for congruence groups. The arithmetic of the forms for noncongruence groups &lt;br/&gt;is little understood. Based on their numerical data, Atkin and Swinnerton-Dyer&lt;br/&gt; (ASD) suggest very interesting congruence relations  to be satisfied by a basis of cusp forms for a noncongruence group. A recent joint work by the PI,&lt;br/&gt;Long and Yang gives the first two-dimensional example establishing the ASD&lt;br/&gt;congruence relations between forms for noncongruence and congruence groups. &lt;br/&gt;To move forward, the PI plans to systematically study the structure of the &lt;br/&gt;cusp forms for noncongruence groups, to explore their relationship&lt;br/&gt;with forms for congruence groups, and to tackle the conjecture that   &lt;br/&gt;algebraic cusp forms genuinely living on noncongruence groups are distinguished&lt;br/&gt;by their Fourier coefficients having unbounded denominators. The second is on &lt;br/&gt;the interplay between automorphic forms and Ramanujan hypergraphs, and &lt;br/&gt;connections between hypergraphs and LDPC codes.  Ramanujan hypergraphs are &lt;br/&gt;higher dimensional analogue of Ramanujan graphs, which are known to have broad &lt;br/&gt;applications. The PI proposes to study whether the rich interplay between &lt;br/&gt;combinatorics and number theory, which exists for Ramanujan graphs, extends to &lt;br/&gt;Ramanujan hypergraphs. On the applied side, the PI plans to construct good &lt;br/&gt;LDPC codes using Ramanujan hypergraphs, and to generalize her joint work with &lt;br/&gt;Koetter, Vontobel, and Walker on  characterizing pseudo-codewords for LDPC &lt;br/&gt;codes from attached to graphs to attached to hypergraphs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It has been the PI's long term research goal to do fundamental research in &lt;br/&gt;number theory and to seek applications of number theory to graph theory and &lt;br/&gt;coding theory, especially to solve real world problems. The study of interplay &lt;br/&gt;between these areas has turned out to be quite fruitful. The PI has applied &lt;br/&gt;deep results in number theory to construct efficient communication networks; &lt;br/&gt;and conversely, investigations in graph theory inspired very interesting &lt;br/&gt;and unexpected results in number theory. This proposal is a continuation of&lt;br/&gt; the PI's effort to pursue the same general theme. The first&lt;br/&gt;project of the proposal lies in basic research, to understand the arithmetics&lt;br/&gt;of modular forms for noncongruence subgroups. The second project is to explore &lt;br/&gt; the interplay in arithmetic and connections between automorphic forms and &lt;br/&gt;Ramanujan hypergraphs, extending PI's previous success on Ramanujan graphs.  &lt;br/&gt;A potential application is to LDPC codes. The very efficient encoding and &lt;br/&gt;decoding algorithms for LDPC codes together with their extensive &lt;br/&gt;applications make them very hot research topic in coding theory. A primary &lt;br/&gt;goal of the second project is to construct good LDPC codes using Ramanujan &lt;br/&gt;hypergraphs, and to understand the "wrongly" decoded words arising from &lt;br/&gt;the rapid decoding algorithm. A conference is planned in 2007 to disseminate &lt;br/&gt;the results of this proposal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
