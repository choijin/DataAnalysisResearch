<AbstractNarration>0423403 &lt;br/&gt;Kurfess&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description:  This project supports a cooperative project by Dr. Thomas Kurfess and Dr. Dr. F. Levent Degertekin, School of Mechanical Engineering, Georgia Tech and Dr. Hakan Urey, Department of Electrical &amp; Electronics Engineering, Koc University, Istanbul, Turkey.  The project will address several issues in parallel optical metrology of dynamic MEMS (micro-electro-mechanical systems) devices using phase-sensitive diffraction grating microinterferometer arrays. For accurate measurement of MEMS device vibration profiles, the interferometer arrays need to be calibrated and the electrostatically actuated deformable gratings need to be characterized.  In addition, an optical system approach is essential for uniform illumination of the interferometer array and efficient light collection from the MEMS devices under test. The Georgia Tech team will fabricate and provide a model for various dynamic MEMS devices and deformable diffraction gratings for microinterferometer arrays. These devices will be evaluated in terms of dynamic response and optical performance by Koc University. Based on these results, a more accurate model of the deformable gratings will be developed. A model for the optical system to deliver uniform light from a single laser source to an array of interferometers will be jointly developed and implemented. Furthermore, the thermal response of the deformable diffraction grating structures will be investigated with the help of a model to investigate the use of these structures for uncooled IR imaging arrays.  A graduate student from Koc University will fabricate and evaluate several test structures for this purpose using the facilities at Georgia Tech. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scope and broader impacts:  The proposed research will help improve the manufacturing processes of the emerging U.S. MEMS industry, which suffers from low yield and repeatability. The collaboration involves U.S. and Turkish scientists with complementary expertise and capabilities in optical MEMS design, fabrication, and characterization and opens up possibilities for joint studies in imaging arrays and optical MEMS.  A graduate student from Koc University, a recently founded institution with excellent promise of contributing to scientific collaboration between Turkey and the United States, will participate in the project and will work with scientists and fellow graduate students at Georgia Tech.  This project is funded jointly by OISE and the Division of Manufacturing and Industrial Innovation.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
