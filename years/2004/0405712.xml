<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;The proposer's recent research has centered on knot theory and the&lt;br/&gt;theory of 3-manifolds, particularly Heegaard splittings of 3-manifolds&lt;br/&gt;and related notion of unknotting tunnels.  The main approach might&lt;br/&gt;humorously be called neo-classical, for it focuses on the behavior of&lt;br/&gt;surfaces contained in the 3-manifolds (a classical approach) but in a&lt;br/&gt;more sophisticated way.  For example, in combinatorial arguments on&lt;br/&gt;surface intersections, graph-theoretic lines of argument (on the arcs&lt;br/&gt;of intersection) have proven to be almost magically effective in&lt;br/&gt;distilling geometric information; in Gabai's theory of sutured&lt;br/&gt;3-manifolds, intersection with a `parameterizing surface is the chief&lt;br/&gt;mechanism for transmitting information from the end of the hierarchy&lt;br/&gt;back to the beginning; the minimax principle usually called ``thin&lt;br/&gt;position" exploits the intersection between a stationary surface and a&lt;br/&gt;moving surface to understand the topology of the entire manfold.&lt;br/&gt;Comparing intersections between two sets of moving surfaces (using the&lt;br/&gt;tools of Cerf theory) can be even more effective as in, for example,&lt;br/&gt;the Gordon-Luecke solution to the knot complement conjecture or the&lt;br/&gt;proposer's work with Rubinstein on explicit bounds for Heegaard&lt;br/&gt;stabilization.&lt;br/&gt;The problems addressed in this proposal have been chosen not solely&lt;br/&gt;for their intrinsic interest but also because the hope is that&lt;br/&gt;techniques developed in their solution would point the way to the&lt;br/&gt;solution of grander problems and, more generally, give insight to the&lt;br/&gt;general structure of knotting phenomena (broadly construed) and the&lt;br/&gt;structure of 3-manifolds, particularly structure that is on the edge&lt;br/&gt;of and interacts with natural questions about 4-manifolds.  An&lt;br/&gt;underlying theme of this proposal is that there is much to be learned&lt;br/&gt;about knot theory and the theory of 3-manifolds via a geometric&lt;br/&gt;approach that is more flexible than differential geometry but more&lt;br/&gt;structured than simple combinatorics.  This medium ground is&lt;br/&gt;characterized by a use of thin position arguments, in which sweep-outs&lt;br/&gt;of 3-space by level planes or sweep-outs of 3-manifolds by Heegaard&lt;br/&gt;surfaces can reveal structure that might be difficult to find by other&lt;br/&gt;techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the most basic observations about the world around us, apparent&lt;br/&gt;almost from our birth, is that it is 3-dimensional.  So it is of&lt;br/&gt;interest to understand objects with this property: anyone living in&lt;br/&gt;the object would see their world as 3-dimensional.  Such objects are&lt;br/&gt;called 3-manifolds, and the broad goal of this research proposal is to&lt;br/&gt;increase our understanding of them.  Three-manifolds support&lt;br/&gt;interesting phenomena.  One of these phenomena is knotting, in which a&lt;br/&gt;simple object like a garden-hose (or a string of DNA) can be&lt;br/&gt;maneuvered so that its positioning in space is quite complex.  More&lt;br/&gt;generally, objects like chemical molecules can be put in a 3-manifold&lt;br/&gt;in extraordinarily complex ways if one thinks of their parts as made&lt;br/&gt;of rubber which can be knotted and interweaved.  Tools which are being&lt;br/&gt;developed to understand 3-manifolds help us understand knotting and,&lt;br/&gt;conversely, understanding knotting helps us understand 3-manifolds.&lt;br/&gt;One success of this ongoing research program is the proposer's&lt;br/&gt;solution (with Abigail Thompson) of the graph-planarity problem: There&lt;br/&gt;is a simple criterion, algorithmic in execution, which determines&lt;br/&gt;whether a knotted graph in 3-space (e.  g. a chemical molecule) can be&lt;br/&gt;isotoped to lie in a plane, and so in fact is unknotted.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
