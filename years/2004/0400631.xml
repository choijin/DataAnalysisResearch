<AbstractNarration>In this project, the PI will study the actions of Lie groups and their discrete&lt;br/&gt;subgroups from ergodic-theoretic point of view. Note that only few results&lt;br/&gt;about statistical properties of orbits of large nonamenable groups are known.&lt;br/&gt;A part of this project addresses the question about the distribution of&lt;br/&gt;orbits of lattices in Lie groups acting on homogeneous spaces. The methods,&lt;br/&gt;which utilize the equidistribution properties of unipotent flows (due to Ratner&lt;br/&gt;and others), apply to a large variety of natural actions of lattices. Since&lt;br/&gt;the methods based on the Ratner theory do not provide effective estimates&lt;br/&gt;on the rate of convergence, it is intended to develop a different approach&lt;br/&gt;that gives effective error terms. The expected results of the proposal have&lt;br/&gt;several potential applications to number theory. In particular, we plan to&lt;br/&gt;investigate distribution of values at integer points of systems consisting&lt;br/&gt;of linear and quadratic forms. Another direction of research is the study&lt;br/&gt;of mixing properties of large groups of automorphisms of nilmanifolds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main objective of this project is to investigate distribution of orbits&lt;br/&gt;of large discrete and continuous groups of motions on various spaces.&lt;br/&gt;Questions about asymptotic distribution of families of mathematical objects&lt;br/&gt;appear in many different areas of mathematics: ergodic theory, number theory&lt;br/&gt;(e.g., distribution of prime numbers), geometry (e.g., distribution of closed&lt;br/&gt;geodesics on a compact surface), PDE (e.g., distribution of eigenvalues of the&lt;br/&gt;Laplace operator), and others. When a family of the objects exhibits very&lt;br/&gt;complicated behavior, statistical properties of this family provide important&lt;br/&gt;insights into its structure. In this project, we use methods of the theory of&lt;br/&gt;dynamical systems to derive results in number theory on the distribution of&lt;br/&gt;integer points. Our study uncovers promising interplay between ergodic theory&lt;br/&gt;and number theory simultaneously enriching both of these areas of research.&lt;br/&gt;This subject and its connections with many other branches of mathematics&lt;br/&gt;provide an excellent introduction for graduate as well as undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;students to active research and can be used for presentations accessible to&lt;br/&gt;audiences of different levels.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
