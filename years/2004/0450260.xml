<AbstractNarration>Arrangements of genes along the chromosomes are often conserved after hundreds of millions of years of divergence in vertebrates, but comparisons of the Arabidopsis sequence to partial gene orders of other angiosperms (flowering plants) sharing more recent common ancestry have yielded conflicting results. This difference may be due largely to the propensity of angiosperms for chromosomal duplication and subsequent 'diploidization', evolutionary mechanisms with profound consequences for comparative biology.  This project will advance knowledge of the ~200-million year course of angiosperm evolution, tracking changes in gene repertoire and organization that contribute to plant biodiversity. Better understanding of the history of angiosperm duplication will be of importance both by improving basic knowledge of botanical diversity, and also in using burgeoning genomic information from botanical models in the improvement of many leading crop plants that have large genomes which are difficult to study and therefore less-well characterized.  Key deliverables include information about gene repertoire and arrangement that adds new dimensions to angiosperm comparative biology, and will be web-available in formats readily used by others. This project provides training opportunities at both pre- and postgraduate levels. The research and education infrastructure will be improved by Web-based dissemination of deliverables valuable to present and future US and international initiatives. Together with a NSF GK-12 program at UGA, this project will develop and implement new research-based educational materials, with specific focus on biodiversity. Materials developed with the GK-12 program will be suitable for broad dissemination to enhance scientific understanding by the public, directly and via museums, nature centers, and similar institutions. This research is closely tied to strong outreach programs with a successful history of engaging under-represented groups.</AbstractNarration>
