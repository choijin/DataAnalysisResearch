<AbstractNarration>-The Disaster Research Center (DRC) at the University of Delaware, with the financial support of the National Science Foundation, is pleased to announce a two-day conference titled "Disaster Research in the Social Sciences: Lessons Learned, Challenges, and Future Trajectories." The conference will highlight interdisciplinary and international perspectives in the field of disasters and will allow us to focus on: 1) the growth and development of the field of disasters, from the perspective of the Social Sciences; 2) the theoretical, methodological, and public policy contributions of the field of disasters; 3) lessons learned and best practices that have emerged from this field of research; and 4) future trajectories or opportunities for Social Science research in the field of disasters. An important outcome of the conference will be the development of a disaster research agenda focusing on cutting edge issues. The proposed conference will take place on April 30 and May 1, 2004 at the University of Delaware.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The conference will include leading scholars and researchers in the field of disasters and will allow us to discuss substantive, theoretical, and methodological issues and concerns relevant to the field and to generate new research initiatives that will contribute to strengthening and increasing our understanding and contributions of the field of disaster research. Important, critical, and substantive issues that will be discussed in the conference include: growth and development of disaster research in the Social Sciences; theoretical and methodological contributions and challenges in disaster research; impact of disaster research for practitioners; the role of multidisciplinary research in the disaster field; developing an international disaster research agenda; the role of research centers in training researchers; funding disaster research and priorities for the future in a post 9/11 environment; the major research areas and issues that need to be developed and explored in the next 5 to 10 years at the national and international level; and establishing collaborative research initiatives across disciplines and geographical boundaries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The DRC was the first Social Science research center in the world devoted to the study of disasters, so it is appropriate and timely that a conference of such magnitude will take place at the University of Delaware at this particular historical moment for the DRC and the field of disaster studies. The aforementioned conference will not only provide a stimulating intellectual environment but it will also provide an opportunity to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the University of Delaware's Disaster Research Center (DRC) and to examine the impact and contributions of the Center to the field of disaster research both nationally and internationally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; For further information on this conference, contact Havidan Rodriguez (DRC Director) or Tricia Wachtendorf (Conference Coordinator) at (302) 831-6618.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
