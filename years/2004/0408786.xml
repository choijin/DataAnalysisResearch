<AbstractNarration>Professor Hans Christian Andersen of Stanford University is supported by an award from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program to carry out research in which improved theoretical methods for understanding the glass transition are developed.  Three interrelated approaches are taken, all of which make combined use of a formally exact diagrammatic theory and simulations which are used to test predictions of this diagrammatic theory.  The three approaches to understanding the glass transition include:  development of accurate approximate kinetic theories for the determination of time correlation functions of atomic liquids in the low temperature equilibrium liquid and slightly supercooled liquid regimes; the development of lattice models for liquids and polymers; and the study of the inhomogeneous nature of relaxation toward the glass transition in simple lattice models.  This theoretical research is important for understanding the glass transition, since critical slowing down occurs as the transition is approached, making simulations difficult or impossible, and requiring the development of better analytical theories.  The research is expected to have a broad impact on several technologies including supercooled liquids, colloidal solutions, phase ordering and granular media.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
