<AbstractNarration>This proposal is for development of an effective hp-adaptive First-Order&lt;br/&gt;System Least-Squares (FOSLS) method for nonlinear partial differential&lt;br/&gt;equations (PDEs) that may exhibit singularities and other non-smoothness &lt;br/&gt;properties. The general FOSLS methodology is already a powerful tool for&lt;br/&gt;the solution of PDE-based problems in science and engineering. One of its&lt;br/&gt;main advantages is that it can be used to transform a given set of&lt;br/&gt;equations into a loosely coupled system of scalar equations that can be&lt;br/&gt;treated easily by multilevel finite elements. The reformulation is done&lt;br/&gt;by recasting the equations as a least-squares principle associated &lt;br/&gt;with a carefully derived first-order system. Another advantage of FOSLS is&lt;br/&gt;that the associated functional itself provides a natural sharp local error&lt;br/&gt;estimator, which can be employed for effective adaptive refinement. In&lt;br/&gt;previous work, the FOSLS methodology was developed and analyzed for&lt;br/&gt;problems that include linear elasticity, linear transport, and&lt;br/&gt;incompressible fluid dynamics. Under standard H2-type smoothness&lt;br/&gt;assumptions on the original PDE, FOSLS has been proved theoretically &lt;br/&gt;and numerically to exhibit optimal finite element and multigrid&lt;br/&gt;convergence  properties. However, two principal difficulties currently&lt;br/&gt;prevent FOSLS from being applied effectively to more complicated problems:&lt;br/&gt;nonsmooth solutions and nonlinearity. The project aim is to develop an&lt;br/&gt;adaptive weighted-functional coupled with adaptive nested iteration&lt;br/&gt;schemes to treat these difficulties. The goal is to obtain a scheme that&lt;br/&gt;can solve complex nonlinear PDE systems with a total cost equivalent to a &lt;br/&gt;small number of relaxation steps on the finest grid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Successful completion of this project will enhance our ability to model&lt;br/&gt;complex physical processes on high-end computing platforms. In particular,&lt;br/&gt;this project addresses computational models of coupled fluid/structure&lt;br/&gt;interactions that occur, for example, in biomechanical systems such as&lt;br/&gt;blood flow in compliant vessels. Other areas that could potentially&lt;br/&gt;benefit from this project are aerodynamics, astrophysics, geophysics and&lt;br/&gt;meteorology. As modern computer architectures become more complex,&lt;br/&gt;harnessing 10s of thousands of processors working together on a single,&lt;br/&gt;complex problem, it becomes even more important to develop optimal&lt;br/&gt;numerical algorithms. Successful completion of this project will widen the&lt;br/&gt;class of problems for which optimal algorithms exist.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
