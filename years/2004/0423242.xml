<AbstractNarration>"Building IT Skills among Inner City Youth in North Philadelphia through Development of a Community Geographic Information System" is a three-year, youth-based ITEST project proposed by Temple University.  The project will provide 90 at-risk high school students, including women, Hispanic and African Americans, with 120 contact hours of instruction per year in information technology, spatial analysis and cartographic and design skills through their creative involvement in developing a community-based Geographic Information System.  A total of 270 students will participate over the three-year duration of the project.  The year-round project will include five hours of weekly instruction for twelve weeks per semester and three two-week intensive summer programs of four hours per day.  Instruction during project activities will be provided in both English and Spanish.  Parents and family members will be involved throughout the instructional period.  The project collaborators include the Asociacion Puertorriquenos en Marcha (APM) Rising Sun Avenue Community Technology Center, School District of Philadelphia, Delawarevalley.org, Forward and Beyond Program of Harrison Campus Compact, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Temple and Philadelphia Association of Community Development Corporations.</AbstractNarration>
