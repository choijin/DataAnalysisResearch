<AbstractNarration>Abstract for award  DMS-0402044 of Ramakrishnan   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The general theme of this proposal is the study of the ubiquitous cusp&lt;br/&gt;forms in various contexts. The four specific problems proposed deal with the&lt;br/&gt;arithmetic, analytic, geometric and group theoretic&lt;br/&gt;aspects of these fundamental objects. To elaborate, the first problem asks&lt;br/&gt;if certain four dimensional Galois representations attached to cusp forms&lt;br/&gt;are irreducible, and such results are unknown in dimensions bigger than 3.&lt;br/&gt;The second problem deals with obtaining *exact* averages of twisted L-values&lt;br/&gt;of holomorphic cusp forms, and the ensuing implications for class numbers&lt;br/&gt;and a diophantine question. The third problem suggests that in special but&lt;br/&gt;pervasive instances (like for the Delta function), there should be&lt;br/&gt;Calabi-Yau varieties which geometrically realize the associated motives and&lt;br/&gt;hence  the L-functions, which encode the statistical properties of Frobenius&lt;br/&gt;traces. The fourth problem is concerned with the *-selfdual representations&lt;br/&gt;of reductive groups G admitting involutions *, and asks for a study of a&lt;br/&gt;certain sign attached to cusp forms on G.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will investigate certain mysterious and deep relations&lt;br/&gt;Between automorphic functions, which are continuous and pulchritudinous, and&lt;br/&gt;discrete objects like the integers and their building blocks, namely the&lt;br/&gt;prime numbers, which exhibit haunting statistical properties. Automorphic&lt;br/&gt;functions encode enchanting symmetries occurring in nature like the&lt;br/&gt;waveforms on a disk. The discrete tones therein have alluring arithmetical&lt;br/&gt;meanings. Often mathematicians and physicists build generating functions&lt;br/&gt;out of discrete collections of numbers, and the pressing problem is to know if&lt;br/&gt;these functions admit hidden symmetries, that is, if they are describing&lt;br/&gt;the tones of automorphic functions. If they do, then miraculous benefits emerge.&lt;br/&gt;Exploiting them is a worthy endeavor, and there are many gold mines yet to be discovered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
