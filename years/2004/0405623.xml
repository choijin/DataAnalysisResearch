<AbstractNarration>This project involves problems in geometric group theory and spaces of non-positive curvature with a focus on Artin groups &lt;br/&gt;and Garside groups.   Artin groups span a wide range of groups including braid groups, free groups, and free abelian groups. &lt;br/&gt;The first part of the project concerns automorphism groups of right-angled Artin groups. These are finitely generated groups &lt;br/&gt;whose presentations involve only commutator relations between generators. By varying the number of commutator relations, &lt;br/&gt;right-angled Artin groups may be viewed as "interpolating" between free groups and free abelian groups. The automorphism &lt;br/&gt;groups of free groups have been the focus of much research in recent years. They have been shown to have much in common &lt;br/&gt;with linear groups, in particular with the automorphism groups of free abelian groups.  This project aims to put these &lt;br/&gt;results in a broader context by studying the automorphism group of a general right-angled Artin group. The key idea is to &lt;br/&gt;construct a contractible space, analogous to Culler and Vogtmann's "outer space", on which the automorphism group acts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second part of the project concerns Garside groups. Garside groups are groups with algorithmic properties similar to &lt;br/&gt;those of braid groups. A Garside structure on a group gives a very powerful tool for studying the combinatorial and geometric &lt;br/&gt;properties of the group. This approach has been used extensively in the study of finite type Artin groups. While no such &lt;br/&gt;structure exists for infinite type Artin groups, it appears that something close to a Garside structure may exist for at &lt;br/&gt;least some of these groups. The project will consider various generalizations of Garside groups and their properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Symmetries of geometric objects have been studied since ancient times and have played an important role in many areas of &lt;br/&gt;mathematics and the sciences. They form the model for the abstract mathematical notion of a "group". Groups arise in nearly &lt;br/&gt;every field of mathematics. While not all groups occur naturally as symmetry groups, it is always possible to construct&lt;br/&gt;geometric objects on which a given group acts as symmetries. In recent years, this interplay between groups and geometry &lt;br/&gt;has been increasingly exploited to understand various types of infinite groups. A particularly interesting class of groups &lt;br/&gt;that lends itself to such techniques are the "braid groups".  The n-strand braid group, as the name suggests, encodes the &lt;br/&gt;different ways that a set of n strings can be braided.  It also describes the different ways that a collection of n particles&lt;br/&gt; can move around in a plane. Braid groups have applications to topology, mathematical physics, and cryptography.  &lt;br/&gt;Another fundamental class of groups are the "free groups". These groups form the foundation for studying algorithmic and &lt;br/&gt;combinatorial properties of groups in general. In this project we will study a large class of groups, known as Artin groups, &lt;br/&gt;that includes the braid groups, the free groups, and many others.  The project aims to reach a better understanding of Artin &lt;br/&gt;groups by studying geometric objects associated with them, as well as searching for new algorithmic techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
