<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of this project is to carry out detailed theoretical and experimental investigation of&lt;br/&gt;acoustic waves propagating in thin piezoelectric plates. By thin we mean plates whose thickness h is much&lt;br/&gt;less than the acoustic wavelength  . The main tasks that will be undertaken during the course of this&lt;br/&gt;project include: (1) Theoretical analysis of plate wave propagation in a number of useful materials such as&lt;br/&gt;quartz, lithium niobate, lithium tantalate, potassium niobate, langasite, langatate, etc. The aim of this&lt;br/&gt;analysis is to identify materials and crystal cut/propagation directions that can provide large values of&lt;br/&gt;electromechanical coupling coefficient K 2 together with zero or low values of TCD (temperature&lt;br/&gt;coefficient of time delay) and PFA (power flow angle). Results obtained from theoretical calculations will&lt;br/&gt;be experimentally verified. (2) Theoretical and experimental investigation of the influence of a thin film of&lt;br/&gt;arbitrary conductivity deposited on the surface of a plate wave device. (3) Measurement of mechanical and&lt;br/&gt;electrical properties of liquids using plate waves and development of a system for identifying liquids based&lt;br/&gt;on their electrical properties. (4) Development of techniques to fabricate devices on plates as thin as a few&lt;br/&gt;micrometers (um) and integration of the resulting acoustic device with silicon substrate, and (5)&lt;br/&gt;Investigation of plate wave propagation in the presence of a biasing electric field and use of this work to&lt;br/&gt;realize devices with electronically tunable characteristics.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The research proposed in this project will produce major advances in the field&lt;br/&gt;of acoustic wave sensors. Devices based on acoustic waves in piezoelectric solids are currently receiving&lt;br/&gt;much attention for use as chemical and biological sensors. A number of different types of acoustic waves&lt;br/&gt;have been investigated for sensor applications. At present, best performance is obtained by using surface&lt;br/&gt;acoustic waves (SAWs) for sensing in the gas or vapor phase, and shear horizontal surface acoustic waves&lt;br/&gt;(SH-SAW) for sensing in the liquid phase. Sensors based on thin plate waves can provide following&lt;br/&gt;important advantages over SAW and SH-SAW sensors. (i) A number of chemical and biological sensors&lt;br/&gt;are based on detecting the change in mass on the sensor surface. For the same operating wavelength, the&lt;br/&gt;mass loading sensitivity of a thin plate device can be greater than that of a SAW or SH-SAW device by&lt;br/&gt;more than a factor of 10. (ii) Acoustic waves in thin plates can provide values of coupling coefficient K 2&lt;br/&gt;that are 5 to 10 times greater than K 2 of SAWs and SH-SAWs. This will produce corresponding increase in&lt;br/&gt;the sensitivity of chemical and biological sensors which operate by detecting changes in electrical&lt;br/&gt;properties of the bio(chemical) coating. (iii) The energy of a plate wave is present on both surfaces of the&lt;br/&gt;plate. Thus one can enclose one side of the senor to protect it from environmental attack while allowing&lt;br/&gt;wave interaction at the other surface. (iv) The thin plate device can be integrated with silicon substrate&lt;br/&gt;which can contain the electronic circuitry associated with the sensor. This will greatly reduce size and cost&lt;br/&gt;of the overall sensor package while simultaneously improving its reliability.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Various educational activities will form an important and integral part of this&lt;br/&gt;project. These include: (1) Hands-on-mini course for junior and senior year high school students, (2)&lt;br/&gt;Seminar and laboratory course for freshman students in our engineering college, (3) Opportunity for&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate students to participate in research through the REU program, (4) Establishing partnerships&lt;br/&gt;with high school teachers through the RET program, and (5) Graduate student mentoring. In selecting&lt;br/&gt;student and teacher participants, special efforts will be made to seek qualified candidates from groups&lt;br/&gt;underrepresented in science and engineering. As a result of previous NSF grants, the PI has mentored&lt;br/&gt;eight REU students, out of which two were female students and two were male students belonging to&lt;br/&gt;groups currently underrepresented in science and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;Successful completion of the work proposed in this project will lead to the development of fully&lt;br/&gt;integrated, low cost, high performance sensors. Sensors play an important role in all facets of our lives&lt;br/&gt;such as environmental monitoring, pollution control, counter terrorism measures, biomedical devices, etc.&lt;br/&gt;The research proposed in this project has many beneficial effects for society and will contribute towards&lt;br/&gt;improving the quality of our lives, health, and environment.</AbstractNarration>
