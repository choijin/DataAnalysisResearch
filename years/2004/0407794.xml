<AbstractNarration>To make STEM education available to the Yup.ik residents of the Y-K Delta, we propose to do the &lt;br/&gt;following to establish an academic program that effectively trains Alaskan Natives for STEM &lt;br/&gt;careers and bridges these students to the main campuses in Alaska: &lt;br/&gt;- A suite of proven models will be utilized. These models include (1) the Treisman model for &lt;br/&gt;effective methods of teaching mathematics, (2) the ANSEP model for recruitment,retention &lt;br/&gt;and matriculation, (3) the ESP (Emerging Scholars Program) model for retention and &lt;br/&gt;guidance, and  (4) the TRIO model for recruitment and intensive course delivery. &lt;br/&gt;- The models will be modified and combined to most effectively serve the Yup.ik students in the &lt;br/&gt;Y-K Delta. For instance, elements of the Treisman model and the ANSEP model will be &lt;br/&gt;directed at recruiting and training non-traditional and under-prepared students as well as &lt;br/&gt;Yup.ik students with strong academic records. This program will broaden the scope of &lt;br/&gt;recruitment and retention beyond what has previously been done in other programs. &lt;br/&gt;- An integrated program of new course offerings in mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology &lt;br/&gt;and information technology will be developed at KuC. This suite of courses will give students &lt;br/&gt;options in the programs they enter at KuC, will enable students to receive two years of STEM &lt;br/&gt;education at KuC before matriculating to the four-year campuses at Fairbanks and &lt;br/&gt;Anchorage, and will allow them to locally receive professional certifications and associate &lt;br/&gt;degrees with emphasis in STEM areas. &lt;br/&gt;- using modified forms of the TRIO/Talent Search and the ANSEP models, both non-traditional &lt;br/&gt;and high school students will be recruited. Summer intensive camps will be offered to involve &lt;br/&gt;students in science, technology and mathematics. One-month intensive courses in &lt;br/&gt;mathematics, science and computer technology will be offered in order to give prospective &lt;br/&gt;college students stronger backgrounds in these areas before enrolling in college. Students &lt;br/&gt;will also participate in TALPA, where they design and build their own computer. The purpose &lt;br/&gt;of these summer intensives is to create interest in and excitement about STEM careers. &lt;br/&gt;- The summer intensives are followed by distance-delivered videoconference courses to high &lt;br/&gt;school students to keep them involved in the program and to continue their STEM training. A &lt;br/&gt;number of distance-delivered courses in ITS will also be used for this purpose.  &lt;br/&gt;- In conjunction with the summer intensives and recruitment activities, the ESP and ANSEP &lt;br/&gt;faculty will engage in a proactive advising and guidance effort to involve the students in &lt;br/&gt;college activities, build cohort groups, a strong sense of community among the students, and &lt;br/&gt;improved student self image. The advising center and STEM faculty will likewise maintain &lt;br/&gt;contact with high school students. &lt;br/&gt;- Upon enrolling in KuC, students continue to receive advising, guidance and rigorous STEM &lt;br/&gt;training, and they continue to work within their cohort groups. Bridging will be accomplished &lt;br/&gt;when they matriculate to the four-year campuses.</AbstractNarration>
