<AbstractNarration>Engineering-Mechanical (56)  The project is adapting and implementing selected design-build-test (DBT) activities in fluid-thermal systems, heating ventilation and air-conditioning from projects developed at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Colorado State University and the University of Idaho.  Thermal science curriculum are being reformed with changes to three required lecture and laboratory courses in such a way that the contents of a stand-alone mechanical engineering laboratory course is integrated with lectures through the execution of design, build, and test (DBT) activities. Two DBT course modules are being developed, one in heat exchangers and the other in scaled building air-conditioning systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Structure and methods being employed include the following. (1) A hands-on experience is being used to provide students with a better understanding of the abstract concepts discussed in lectures by establishing a clear linkage to industrial applications through Design Build and Test (DBT) projects.  (2) The adaptation is enhancing students' learning by providing them with open-ended design problem experiences in the mid-stage of their engineering degree program.  (3) Improved comprehension of the thermal-fluid contents is being achieved through practical application and immediate, relevant implementation. (4) DBT activities are enhancing students' critical thinking skills by requiring the students to make decisions that directly affect the outcomes of the process. (5) The process is fostering a cooperative learning environment and is providing a strong sense of accomplishments for the students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The evaluation process is assessing (1) how well the DBT approach equips students to apply mathematics, science, and engineering to thermal-fluid systems design, (2) students' ability to function within teams to develop, professional and ethical responsibility, and (3) how well the reformed curriculum contributes to an increase in student's interests in thermal/fluid subjects, retention, and recruitment of prospective students, and in particular, underrepresented classes of students.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
