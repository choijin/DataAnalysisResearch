<AbstractNarration>The 3rd Duke Mathematical Journal Conference will be held at Duke&lt;br/&gt;University Friday, April 23 through Sunday, April 25, 2004. The goal of&lt;br/&gt;the conference is to bring young mathematicians together for a weekend of&lt;br/&gt;high quality mathematics. There will be talks by eight leading young&lt;br/&gt;mathematicians on diverse subject areas which are regularly represented in&lt;br/&gt;the journal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prior to the Conference, speakers will distribute introductory material&lt;br/&gt;related to their talks via the conference web site. All talks will be&lt;br/&gt;videotaped and made available on the Web, along with the speakers' notes.&lt;br/&gt;This will benefit the participants as well as the broader mathematical&lt;br/&gt;community. The conference will also benefit the mathematical community in&lt;br/&gt;the south-eastern US by providing a high-quality mathematical experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
