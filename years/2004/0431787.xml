<AbstractNarration>Recent years have seen the advent of DNA-based computation, as well as the development of a&lt;br/&gt;DNA nanotechnology that produces objects, robust devices and periodic arrays. We propose to&lt;br/&gt;combine these areas, by using a robust 2-state DNA device and DNA array assembly techniques&lt;br/&gt;to prototype a programmable finite state machine capable of performing simple computations.&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to produce a system that is programmable, produces an output and is reusable.&lt;br/&gt;We exploit connections between Wang tiles, finite state machines (transducers) and com-&lt;br/&gt;putable functions. The main idea uses DNA TX molecules to represent transducer transitions&lt;br/&gt;and a sequence of 2-state DNA devices to program the input. Once the input is programmed,&lt;br/&gt;the computation of the transducer is obtained solely by DNA self-assembly. Further more, iter-&lt;br/&gt;ations and composition of transducers is also possible and hence all computable functions can&lt;br/&gt;be obtained.&lt;br/&gt;The project is composed of two major tasks,&lt;br/&gt;1. To simulate computation by a finite state machine with output by a single assembly of&lt;br/&gt;input molecules and TX transition molecules.&lt;br/&gt;2. To obtain transducer computation with a programmale input by DNA 2-state devices and&lt;br/&gt;TX molecules.&lt;br/&gt;Intelectual Merit. The project prototypes a nanomachine that is potentially programmable&lt;br/&gt;and produces an output that can serve as an input in a new device or as a template for orga-&lt;br/&gt;nization and growth of nanostructures used in nanoelectronics. The proposed machine has a&lt;br/&gt;potential for an algorithmic control of this growth. Theoretically, the design of the machine and&lt;br/&gt;the need for encoding (locally and globally) that is error correcting will lead to development of&lt;br/&gt;new techniques in algorithmic pattern design.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact. Research in DNA-based computation relies on many disciplines, such as&lt;br/&gt;computer science, DNA chemistry, nucleic acid enzymology, thermodynamics and molecular&lt;br/&gt;physics. Few individuals enter in to it with adequate preparation. We will attempt to provide&lt;br/&gt;some remedy for this problem during the course of this project. The graduate, undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;and high school students who participate in this work will be uniquely trained and will be&lt;br/&gt;prepared as unique interdisciplinary research scientists. Three graduate students (two at New&lt;br/&gt;York University and one at the University of South Florida) will receive graduate training&lt;br/&gt;through this award. They will meet with each other, and become familiar with the thinking and&lt;br/&gt;methodologies of their opposite colleagues in the other university. In addition, we will include&lt;br/&gt;an undergraduate in the project, to gain experience in combining computer science with DNA&lt;br/&gt;nanotechnology. We aim to include a high school student in the parts of the work for which&lt;br/&gt;they are eligible (e.g., computation and experiments not entailing the use of radiation).&lt;br/&gt;Besides their own nanotechnological and mathematical disciplines, the PI and the co-PI are&lt;br/&gt;prominent members of the DNA-based computation community. Both facets of this commu-&lt;br/&gt;nity recognize that it is converging with structural DNA nanotechnology. In recognition of&lt;br/&gt;this interdisciplinary phenomenon, the PI and the co-PI are involved in founding (as president&lt;br/&gt;and treasurer, respectively) the \International Society for Nanoscale Science, Computation and&lt;br/&gt;Engineering" with a goal to facilitate communication among the members of the participating&lt;br/&gt;communities, and to recognize and promote the careers of the younger members, by offering&lt;br/&gt;them recognition and a forum for their ideas.</AbstractNarration>
