<AbstractNarration>This dissertation examines how the structure of party systems affects the stability  of  presidential  coalitions  in  Latin  America.    Scholars  believe  that  the  incoherent  and  unstable party systems in several  Latin American countries contribute to poor  governance,  economic instability, and the fragility of democracy in the region.  This  dissertation seeks to explain how regional interest differences within countries affect the  dimensions of conflict and the stability of coalitions in their party systems.  It will show  that although conditions conducive to the aggregation of local and regional interests into  stable  parties  or  multiparty  coalitions  exist  in  some Latin American  countries,  they  are  absent in others.  Although we have a theoretical expectation that in seeking to control  government,  politicians  and  the  interests  they  represent  will  form  long-lived,  majority  parties or coalitions, this dissertation will argue that for some types of regional interests  aggregated into regional parties and for presidents, short coalitions often make political  sense.  Regional parties that care most about pork for their districts and policies  orthogonal to the main left-right policy dimension can only meet their constituents. needs  by becoming part of the president's  coalition.  &lt;br/&gt;Consequently, they compete fiercely for  places in coalitions of any ideological coloration.  This competition tends to drive down  the  price  presidents  have  to  pay  to  attract  coalition  partners  and  to  lead  to  coalition  instability as different parties jockey for places.   In the empirical investigation of this argument, the researchers expect to find that  the presence of parties seeking region-specific and distributive policies is associated with  shorter presidential coalitions, even after taking into account different institutional and  historical factors that might influence coalition building.  &lt;br/&gt;The research will involve both  in-depth  examinations  of  social  and  electoral  data  at  the  sub-national  level  in  some  countries and cross-national empirical analyses for most of Latin America in the current  democratic period. The  investigation will measure the extent of variation in the vote  shares parties receive in different regions of each country, and identify  the types of  interests  represented  by  regionally-based  parties.    It  will  use  census  and  other  socio- economic data to map local interests onto vote shares for different kinds of parties; data  on the ideological positioning  and policy  goals  of parties to show that  some regional  parties do not fit onto the standard left-right policy dimension; and data on the length of  presidential cabinets, legislative coalitions, and alliances across second-round presidential  elections to show that regionalized party systems are associated with shorter coalitions.     &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:&lt;br/&gt;The  results  of  this  dissertation  project  will  give  political  scientists  a  better  understanding of the electoral landscape in Latin America and the conditions under which  narrow, regionally-based parties survive to play an important role in national politics in  some of these countries.  These findings will address the relationship, or trade-off,  between broad or diverse representation and stable government in the context of highly  unequal and territorially heterogeneous societies.      &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
