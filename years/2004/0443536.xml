    <AbstractNarration>With an NSF "Small Grant for Exploratory Research", Dr. Amelia Clark will conduct a brief field season of archaeological research in South Africa. She will visit the site of Holley Shelter, located in KwaZulu Natal Province, determine whether any intact archaeological sediment is present and if so, map its stratigraphy. Slumped material will be removed and a protective sandbag wall constructed. The site was excavated by an amateur archaeologist in the 1940s and the results never published. Although Holley Shelter is known to contain a long cultural sequence, because of the crude excavation techniques originally employed necessary detail is lacking. It is also unknown whether original sediments, said to remain after the excavation was completed are still intact since slumping (to an unknown degree) is possible. Dr. Clark has obtained landowner permission to work at the site and in this first step, she will conduct an assessment which will permit her to determine whether future research is feasible and, if so, how it may best be designed. She will utilize this opportunity to examine other relevant collections.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of Dr. Clark's longer term research is to gain insight into the processes which lead to the emergence of behavioral modern humans. Because, paleontological and genetic evidence indicate that the transition to the biologically modern species occurred in sub-Saharan Africa and archaeological data suggest that the behavioral transition took place there as well, much research has focused on the appropriate time period in this region of the world. Relevant material has been recovered in KwaZulu Natal and additional evidence has the potential to clarify what is still a poorly understood picture. If Holley Shelter does still contain intact archaeological bearing deposits additional research at the site which employs current technology and precise three dimensional recording of all artifacts has the potential for a high scientific payoff.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will also further the career development of a young scientist at a small undergraduate institution.</AbstractNarration>
