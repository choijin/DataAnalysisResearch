<AbstractNarration>Strogatz&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many populations of biological oscillators can exhibit remarkable&lt;br/&gt;collective behavior.  Despite differences in their individual&lt;br/&gt;natural frequencies, the oscillators spontaneously synchronize to&lt;br/&gt;a common frequency.  Examples include chorusing crickets,&lt;br/&gt;fireflies that flash in unison, and synchronous firing of cardiac&lt;br/&gt;pacemaker cells.  In several other branches of science and&lt;br/&gt;technology, one would like to imitate nature's success at&lt;br/&gt;designing networks that can synchronize themselves.  For&lt;br/&gt;instance, a semiconductor laser array generates greater&lt;br/&gt;collective power when it synchronizes, but such phase-locked&lt;br/&gt;operation is notoriously difficult to achieve in practice.  The&lt;br/&gt;PI and his students study the dynamics of oscillator networks,&lt;br/&gt;using mathematical methods of dynamical systems theory,&lt;br/&gt;bifurcation theory, and statistical mechanics, along with&lt;br/&gt;numerical simulation.  One project investigates a peculiar&lt;br/&gt;mathematical phenomenon that was recently discovered in a model&lt;br/&gt;of cellular oscillators communicating with one another through&lt;br/&gt;the exchange of a signaling molecule.  Three additional projects&lt;br/&gt;venture into areas where oscillator theory has rarely been&lt;br/&gt;applied, namely molecular genetics, stochastic analysis, and the&lt;br/&gt;interplay of human behavior and civil engineering.  The goal in&lt;br/&gt;each case is to answer a mathematically fascinating question that&lt;br/&gt;is important in the real world.  Specifically: (1) How can one&lt;br/&gt;build the analog of a multicellular biological clock, using&lt;br/&gt;synthetic gene circuits?  (2) Can a precise biological clock be&lt;br/&gt;made by synchronizing many imprecise components, and is this what&lt;br/&gt;takes place in our own circadian pacemakers? (3) What caused&lt;br/&gt;London's Millennium Bridge to wobble on opening day?  Each of&lt;br/&gt;these projects enlists the collaboration of a top experimentalist&lt;br/&gt;in the relevant field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Networks of oscillators arise throughout science and technology&lt;br/&gt;and are ubiquitous in nature: lasers arrays work better when they&lt;br/&gt;oscillate synchronously, structures such as buildings and bridges&lt;br/&gt;can be endangered by synchronous oscillation, synchronous firing&lt;br/&gt;of cardiac pacemaker cells keeps hearts beating.  The&lt;br/&gt;investigator mathematically explores the behavior of networks of&lt;br/&gt;oscillators, studying how networks synchronize themselves.  &lt;br/&gt;Benefits are expected for the understanding of how rhythmically&lt;br/&gt;active cells work together in tissues and organs; for the&lt;br/&gt;characterization of the potentially dangerous ways that crowds of&lt;br/&gt;pedestrians can inadvertently cause footbridges to shake; and for&lt;br/&gt;spin-offs to technological applications involving arrays of&lt;br/&gt;oscillators, such as lasers, microwave oscillators, and&lt;br/&gt;superconducting Josephson junctions.  By training three graduate&lt;br/&gt;students through the research opportunities offered here, this&lt;br/&gt;project also helps to develop human resources that are vital to&lt;br/&gt;our nation's success in science and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
