    <AbstractNarration>DMS-0405255&lt;br/&gt;Title: Geometric properties of the Ricci flow&lt;br/&gt;P.I.: Peng Lu (University of Oregon)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The P.I. will study the geometric properties of the Ricci flow in&lt;br/&gt;dimension bigger than three from three aspects. The first one is about&lt;br/&gt;the Ricci flow on manifolds with positive isotropic curvature. We want&lt;br/&gt;to work out a classification of closed 4-manifolds with positive&lt;br/&gt;isotropic curvature. The second one is about the Ricci flow on&lt;br/&gt;cohomogeneity one manifolds. One question is to explore when&lt;br/&gt;nonnegativity of sectional curvature is preserved and when the&lt;br/&gt;sectional curvature becomes positive. Another question is to explore&lt;br/&gt;when Hamilton and Ivey's pinching theorem will hold. The third one is&lt;br/&gt;about the relation between the Ricci flow and quantum field theory;&lt;br/&gt;especially we will focus on the duality property of the Ricci flow&lt;br/&gt;with symmetry. We will look for mathematical applications of new ideas&lt;br/&gt;in physics which are related to the Ricci flow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The Ricci flow is a very important mathematical field and has the&lt;br/&gt;potential to solve very challenging problems relating to the geometric and&lt;br/&gt;topological properties of spaces of dimensions three and four.&lt;br/&gt;Recently the fundamental work of Perelman has drawn a lot of attention&lt;br/&gt;to the field. The Ricci flow has a close connection with string&lt;br/&gt;theory; more precisely, Ricci flow is the first order approximation of&lt;br/&gt;the so-called renormalization group flow (RG flow). The proposed study&lt;br/&gt;will improve our understanding of the Ricci flow and demonstrate that&lt;br/&gt;Riemannian Ricci flow is a powerful tool in studying&lt;br/&gt;geometric-topological properties of manifolds of dimension greater&lt;br/&gt;than three. Furthermore we hope the proposed study will improve our&lt;br/&gt;understanding of the RG flow in string theory.</AbstractNarration>
