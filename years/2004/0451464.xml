<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;0451464&lt;br/&gt;PI: Ming L.Wang&lt;br/&gt;University of Illinois-Chicago&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to formulate a US-China Joint Task Force to develop a 5-year collaborative research program in Integrated Structural Health Monitoring comprising of sensors, integrated data acquisition and processing systems and countermeasure decision making system with emphasis on Earthquake and Natural Hazards. Integrated health monitoring of structures, based on advanced sensor technology, will improve structural reliability, longevity, enhance system performance, and improve safety against natural hazards including earthquakes and intentional attacks. The current technology is past the embryonic stage and is now at par to meet the challenges of health monitoring. US has been leading the research and development of new sensor technology and in turn China has been leading in application of sensor technology for monitoring real structures. The task force will integrate the research efforts through strategic collaborated research proposals by both China and US researchers to identify the challenges and key research topics. The final outcome will be a comprehensive plan to accelerate development of integrated health monitoring for civil infrastructure for earthquake engineering. The task force will interface conventional engineering with new technology-based research, educational impact, commercial application of the technology and the expected benefits. This venture will facilitate international student exchange, technology transfer through complimentary research and exchange of research data, educational courses for students and training sessions for engineers, and will actively involve the related industry and government agencies in the activities of integrated health monitoring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
