<AbstractNarration>X-Ray diffraction analysis is essential for the direct and unambiguous determination of the molecular and crystal structure of materials. Nowadays, crystal structure investigations are used in numerous areas of science and technology: analytical, organic, inorganic and organometallic chemistry, biochemistry (in particular, in protein crystallography), solid-state physics, mineralogy, materials and forensic science, and pharmacology. The present project is acquiring an X-ray diffraction X8APEX system (Bruker AXS Inc., USA) and Crystallization System for single crystal growth directly on a diffractometer. This instrumentation will allow us to create a modern teaching analytical and structural research.  The X8APEX system is a product that collected the best features of worldwide Bruker and Nonius development: the most sensitive APEX CCD detector (Bruker), the most precise yet flexible Kappa goniostat (Nonius), and state-of-the-art software. Notable features of this system are high speed data collection, sensitivity of the area detector (which allows work with very small and weakly diffracting samples), the opportunity to work with unstable and low melting samples due to low temperature system, and simplicity of application.  &lt;br/&gt;They are studying structure-property relations in several classes of objects such as nonlinear and electro-optical materials, propellants, minerals and bioactive compounds. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;X-Ray diffraction analysis is used to determine the structure of materials. These investigations are used in numerous areas of science and technology: chemistry, biochemistry physics, mineralogy, materials and forensic science, and pharmacology. We are updating our x-dffraction instrumentation through the acquisition of newer instrumentation that fosters ease of use, rapid data acquisition, sensitive detection systems and  state-of-the-art software. These capabilities will let us work with materials which are often difficult to study, including  small and weakly diffracting samples, as well as unstable and low melting samples.  This will allow us to determine structure-property relations in several classes of objects such as nonlinear and electro-optical materials, propellants, minerals and bioactive compounds.</AbstractNarration>
