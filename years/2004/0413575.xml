<AbstractNarration>0413575&lt;br/&gt;Ripley&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant will support a technical position in the Stable Isotope Research Facility (SIRF) at Indiana University over a three-year period.  Duties of the research technician will include: 1) training of all users of laboratory facilities, 2) maintenance of mass spectrometers and associated gas preparation systems, 3) development of new analytical techniques, and 4) analyses of non-routine samples, especially those produced by laser ablation methods. The SIRF houses four stable isotope ratio mass spectrometers and a variety of associated on-line sample preparation devices including a laser fluorination system for sulfur isotopic analyses, high-temperature combustion furnaces and related gas chromatographic systems for carbon and hydrogen isotopic analyses, elemental analyzers for sulfur, carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen analyses, water-CO2 equilibration and water to hydrogen conversion devices, and an automated carbonate-CO2 preparation system.  In addition to on-line peripheral systems The SIRF contains several traditional vacuum extraction systems.  These include a CO2 laser fluorination system, a conventional BrF5 extraction line, SO2 lines for the preparation of large standard samples for both EA and dual inlet analyses, high- and low-temperature sequential carbon extraction lines, a system for the extraction of inclusion fluids and gases, and chromatographic systems for the isolation of various sulfur species.  Technician support is essential to ensure that this lab continues as a first-rate national center for stable isotopic analyses and training.  Over the past 24 months more than 30 visiting researchers have utilized the SIRF laboratory facilities.  The development of new analytical techniques, particularly those aimed at reducing sample size, is critical for advancing our understanding of important earth processes.  A dedicated technician provides invaluable support for faculty and student research, and plays a pivotal role in the development of analytical skills that are essential for tomorrow's researchers.  The research technician in this position will also supervise part-time, project specific, laboratory technicians who are supported through individual research grants (e.g. NSF, NASA, DOE).&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
