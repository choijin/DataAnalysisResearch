<AbstractNarration>Skeel&lt;br/&gt;0406516&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator and his colleagues organize an international,&lt;br/&gt;multidisciplinary workshop on computational methods for macromolecular&lt;br/&gt;modeling.  The goal of this workshop is to assess the state of the art&lt;br/&gt;in the development of algorithmic tools for simulation of large&lt;br/&gt;molecules.  Molecular simulation is now a standard tool for studying&lt;br/&gt;vast plethora of chemical processes ranging from applications in&lt;br/&gt;nanotechnology to the identification and prediction of biomolecular&lt;br/&gt;structure and function.  To date, many challenges have been addressed&lt;br/&gt;in an incomplete manner, and there is a continuing demand for high&lt;br/&gt;quality algorithms and supporting mathematical theory for high&lt;br/&gt;performance computations.  The principal topics of the meeting are&lt;br/&gt;algorithms for force evaluation, integration, optimization, and&lt;br/&gt;sampling; methods for structure prediction, reaction paths, free&lt;br/&gt;energy profiles and conformational dynamics; modeling of force fields&lt;br/&gt;and implicit solvents; and multiscale techniques for quantum-classical&lt;br/&gt;and classical-elastic models.  Exchange of information about the&lt;br/&gt;latest results stimulates research progress and avoids duplicate&lt;br/&gt;efforts, especially because there are infrequent international&lt;br/&gt;meetings devoted to this topic.  Even more, it makes chemical and life&lt;br/&gt;scientists aware of valuable computational and mathematical&lt;br/&gt;techniques; and at the same time, it makes mathematical scientists&lt;br/&gt;aware of the specific nature of the problems and exposes them to&lt;br/&gt;insights into their solution.  The program for the meeting, including&lt;br/&gt;abstracts and a report of the open discussion, is made available on&lt;br/&gt;the web.  The meeting consists of plenary talks by leading experts,&lt;br/&gt;parallel talks by junior and senior researchers, and a structured&lt;br/&gt;discussion session.  Most of those supported by this grant are junior&lt;br/&gt;researchers or members of underrepresented groups. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Computer simulations can provide information about the geometry and&lt;br/&gt;behavior of biomolecules and other large molecules that is difficult&lt;br/&gt;to obtain experimentally.  Such information is central to&lt;br/&gt;biotechnology, materials science, and nanotechnology.  However,&lt;br/&gt;current computational methods often consume up to weeks of computer&lt;br/&gt;time and are often of limited reliability.  To consider these issues,&lt;br/&gt;the investigator and his colleagues organize the multidisciplinary,&lt;br/&gt;international workshop "Algorithms for Macromolecular Modelling" on&lt;br/&gt;August 18-21, 2004 at the University of Leicester in the United&lt;br/&gt;Kingdom.  The purpose of the workshop is to stimulate research on the&lt;br/&gt;construction of yet faster and more reliable methods for&lt;br/&gt;implementation in simulation software.  This is best achieved by&lt;br/&gt;combining the expertise of mathematical scientists with the physical&lt;br/&gt;insights of chemical and life scientists.  This workshop is almost&lt;br/&gt;unique in the emphasis that is gives to both the needs of the science&lt;br/&gt;and the mathematical details of the simulation software.  The meeting&lt;br/&gt;consists of plenary talks by leading experts, parallel talks by junior&lt;br/&gt;and senior researchers, and a structured discussion session.  This&lt;br/&gt;project supports travel for United States participants in the&lt;br/&gt;workshop; most of those supported are junior researchers or members of&lt;br/&gt;underrepresented groups.  The results of the workshop are disseminated&lt;br/&gt;through a dedicated website.  In addition, the collected scientific&lt;br/&gt;articles by the invited speakers will be published in Springer&lt;br/&gt;Verlag's Lecture Notes series in Computational Science and Engineering&lt;br/&gt;(LNCSE). &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
