    <AbstractNarration>In this project, a scanning electron microscope (SEM) with energy dispersive x-ray analysis (EDX) will be acquired as the anchoring tool in a new characterization center. The Materials Characterization and Metrology Center (referred to as [MC]2 ) in the Chemical and Materials Engineering Department at San Jose State University, will provide characterization capabilities to the Department and the Colleges of Engineering and Science. Faculty and students will use the instrument for undergraduate and graduate (MS level) research projects, including work in semiconductor processing, microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) development, biosensors development, neurobiology research, nanocomposites and nanowires growth. In addition, the microscope will be used for a variety of engineering and science lab classes as well as outreach activities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A large number of research projects already being conducted by SJSU personnel will be impacted by this facility. Based on the university's location in Silicon Valley and the networks with Stanford Nanofabrication Facility, NASA Ames Research Center, IBM Almaden Research Center and many other local companies, students and faculty are engaged in significant research projects from nanotechnology to microelectromechanical devices to biological applications. The broader impact of the work includes activities through which the career and college choices are affected for hundreds of high school and community college students every year who visit SJSU and participate in Open House, Discover Engineering Camp and the Workforce Development Institute. The impact of improved facilities on campus will be in expanded training opportunities for a large number of engineering students, including many ethnic minority students.</AbstractNarration>
