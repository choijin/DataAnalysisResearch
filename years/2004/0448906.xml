<AbstractNarration>Recent advances in a variety of technologies and applications call for improved performance and&lt;br/&gt;reliability, while exacerbating the complexity and uncertainty of systems and their surroundings.&lt;br/&gt;Although classical control theory already allows for a high degree of machine automation, a&lt;br/&gt;renewed interest in systems that display intelligent behavior is emerging across disciplines. The&lt;br/&gt;proposed research will develop a novel adaptive control approach that approximates the nonlinear&lt;br/&gt;control law by a sigmoidal neural network, and optimizes its performance on line, subject to&lt;br/&gt;actual plant dynamics. By combining approximate dynamic programming and integral quadratic&lt;br/&gt;constraints, it can be shown that the neural network controller is characterized by the same&lt;br/&gt;closed-loop stability and robustness guarantees as classical H-infinity controllers. Ensuring that&lt;br/&gt;these properties are preserved during adaptation will make the adaptive design viable for&lt;br/&gt;applications where safety is a leading concern, such as, reconfigurable aircraft control.&lt;br/&gt;As part of the proposed research, the adaptive control approach will be demonstrated not only&lt;br/&gt;through numerical simulations, but also through experiments. The first testbed will consist of a&lt;br/&gt;cantilevered beam with piezoelectric devices used as disturbance and control sources. In the&lt;br/&gt;experiments, the effectiveness of the adaptive controller for reducing the vibration of the first two&lt;br/&gt;natural modes will be tested and compared to that of controllers with parameters held fixed.&lt;br/&gt;After considering this low-dimensional system, the approach will be implemented to design an&lt;br/&gt;adaptive flight controller based on the model of an experimental fly-by-wire Raytheon Bonanza&lt;br/&gt;aircraft. The flight controller will be tested on a piloted simulator developed by an experienced&lt;br/&gt;research group at Wichita State University (WSU). Subsequently, the PI will work with the WSU&lt;br/&gt;group and Raytheon Aircraft Company on interfacing the control software with the on-board&lt;br/&gt;flight computer, and on testing it on the Bonanza through a set of experimental flights.&lt;br/&gt;Research and education on control theory and practice will be integrated by designing a set of&lt;br/&gt;experiments for undergraduate and TIP high-school students that employ the following testbeds: a&lt;br/&gt;vibrating cantilevered beam, an acoustic enclosure, and a flapping micro-aerial vehicle. The&lt;br/&gt;broader impact of this project is the creation of initiatives that expose students from K12 through&lt;br/&gt;graduate school to advanced control research and experiments being conducted in the aerospace&lt;br/&gt;industry and at NASA. By leading undergraduates and TIP students through these experiments,&lt;br/&gt;the PI's graduate students will become important role models for a diverse and gifted group of&lt;br/&gt;youngsters.</AbstractNarration>
