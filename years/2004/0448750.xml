<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT for CAREER proposal DMS-0448750:  Rational points on&lt;br/&gt;varieties and non-abelian Galois groups&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Principal investigator:  Jordan S. Ellenberg&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Institution:  University of Wisconsin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator proposes to address an ensemble of problems in&lt;br/&gt;arithmetic geometry, centered on the problem of describing the&lt;br/&gt;distribution of rational points on varieties over number fields.  The&lt;br/&gt;study of rational points is, on the one hand, passed down to us from&lt;br/&gt;the very beginning of number theory; on the other hand, the present&lt;br/&gt;state of the art in this extremely active area involves ideas from a&lt;br/&gt;wide variety of subjects, including etale cohomology, methods of&lt;br/&gt;analytic number theory, and the complex algebraic geometry of moduli&lt;br/&gt;spaces of morphisms.  In the first project, the investigator and his&lt;br/&gt;colleagues will continue their investigation of well-known conjectures&lt;br/&gt;on distribution of rational points and distribution of discriminants&lt;br/&gt;of number fields.  In the second project, the investigator will study&lt;br/&gt;the arithmetic of towers of curves; rational points in such towers&lt;br/&gt;seem to be intimately related with objects of non-abelian Iwasawa&lt;br/&gt;theory, a subject which has enjoyed an explosion of interest in the&lt;br/&gt;last five years.  The proposed projects will involve a great deal of&lt;br/&gt;collaboration with researchers from every part of number theory and&lt;br/&gt;algebraic geometry, and should provide many opportunities for graduate&lt;br/&gt;students and postdoctoral fellows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The foundational problem of number theory is this: find all solutions&lt;br/&gt;in rational numbers to an equation.  For instance, one can ask for&lt;br/&gt;solutions of the Pythagorean equation: for which rational numbers x,y,&lt;br/&gt;and z is it the case that the square of x plus the square of y equals&lt;br/&gt;the square of z?  The Pythagorean equation has been well-understood&lt;br/&gt;for centuries; but many others, like Fermat's equation, present -- to&lt;br/&gt;say the least! -- more serious difficulties, and most equations are&lt;br/&gt;presently beyond our current ability to analyze.  In recent years, the&lt;br/&gt;subject of "rational points", or the analysis of solutions of&lt;br/&gt;equations, has been taking shape as a subject of its own, drawing&lt;br/&gt;ideas and techniques from many different parts of mathematics.  The&lt;br/&gt;investigator proposes several research projects in the area of&lt;br/&gt;rational points.  Because this area of research combines classical,&lt;br/&gt;easy-to-state problems with advanced methods and opportunities for&lt;br/&gt;experimentation, it is very well-suited for fledgling mathematicians.&lt;br/&gt;The investigator will launch a research program for students at&lt;br/&gt;Madison Memorial High School, and will expand the scope of the&lt;br/&gt;Wisconsin Talent Search; the aim will be to develop in Wisconsin an&lt;br/&gt;infrastructure for mathematical exploration, enrichment and research&lt;br/&gt;in secondary school, which will have enough momentum to continue&lt;br/&gt;beyond the duration of the present award.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
