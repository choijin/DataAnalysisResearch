<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to aid and expedite the development of optimally designed&lt;br/&gt;nanoscale double-gate (DG) FinFETs for integrated circuit (IC) applications beyond the gatelength&lt;br/&gt;scaling limit (Lg &lt; ~45nm) of today's conventional, or classical CMOS technologies.&lt;br/&gt;Although FinFET technology is related to conventional MOSFET technology, the nonclassical&lt;br/&gt;DG device is quasi-planar with the channel and source/drain extensions formed in an ultra-thin&lt;br/&gt;vertical silicon (Si) fin. Thus, the device processing is complicated because of uncertainties in&lt;br/&gt;how dopant impurities diffuse in such thin fins, and the device design is complicated because of&lt;br/&gt;complex physics underlying the electrostatics and carrier transport in such thin fins. The research&lt;br/&gt;will address these complications in both device processing and device design, as well as project&lt;br/&gt;performances of nanoscale-FinFET CMOS. It will be based in large part on a physics-based&lt;br/&gt;compact model (UFDG) for generic DG MOSFETs, having a small number of process-based&lt;br/&gt;parameters that relate directly to the device structure as well as the underlying physics. The&lt;br/&gt;process/physics basis of UFDG renders it quasi-predictive and, when implemented in a circuit&lt;br/&gt;simulator, capable of projecting nonclassical CMOS performance and its sensitivity to expected&lt;br/&gt;fluctuations in the fabrication process. The research will comprise three stages, all of which could&lt;br/&gt;necessitate UFDG upgrades. First, UFDG, supplemented by a suite of numerical device&lt;br/&gt;simulators, will be used for inverse modeling of FinFETs fabricated at Freescale Semiconductor&lt;br/&gt;(formerly part of Motorola) to learn how to effectively dope the Si fins, e.g., the source/drain&lt;br/&gt;extensions, and how to characterize doping profiles in the fins. Second, UFDG and the&lt;br/&gt;supplemental tools will be used to optimally design FinFETs, e.g., with regard to gatesource/&lt;br/&gt;drain underlap (and bias-dependent Leff &gt; Lgate) and its control of short-channel effects&lt;br/&gt;and the Ion/Ioff ratio. Third, UFDG/Spice3 will be used to project CMOS performances with&lt;br/&gt;optimal FinFET designs. Technological support from Freescale will aid, verify, and demonstrate&lt;br/&gt;the optimal designs.&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the research is reflected by its two main contributions: (1) physical&lt;br/&gt;insights and guidance regarding the optimal design and fabrication of nanoscale FinFETs,&lt;br/&gt;including experimental demonstration, and (2) a reliable physics-based compact model that could&lt;br/&gt;be used for future design of CMOS circuits comprising nanoscale FinFETs, in addition to aiding&lt;br/&gt;the device technology development. The broader impacts of the research will be on the&lt;br/&gt;education of students and engineers in the area of nonclassical nanoscale device technologies and&lt;br/&gt;physics, with emphasis on FinFETs but with a broad basis for application to other, potentially&lt;br/&gt;viable IC technologies that can be scaled beyond the limit of conventional CMOS. New graduate&lt;br/&gt;courses will be defined based on the research. And, by promoting the continual advancement of&lt;br/&gt;nanoscale IC technologies, the semiconductor industry and its customers will be impacted&lt;br/&gt;positively.</AbstractNarration>
