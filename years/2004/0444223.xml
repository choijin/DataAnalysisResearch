    <AbstractNarration>This award provides renewed support for the Mycological Collection of the American Type Culture Collection. The collection presently maintains about 48,000 fungal strains representing over 7,600 species and 1,500 genera. The collection provides samples of its collection to researchers and educators at a modest charge. The Mycological collection's activities are to acquire, authenticate, preserve, produce, develop and distribute fungi, information, technology, intellectual property and standards for the advancement, validation, and application of scientific knowledge in the US and worldwide. The broader impacts include promoting discovery through the consistent provision of authenticated microorganisms, related products, and collaborative expertise to researchers and educators, as well as the provision of a patent repository with worldwide access. It seeks to enhance the quality and authenticity of its cultures with additional strain data generated by ATCC staff, and by the external research work of depositors, collaborators and other users of the collection.</AbstractNarration>
