<AbstractNarration>A foliation F  of a manifold M is a regular decomposition of the space &lt;br/&gt;into connected submanifolds, usually with some assumptions that the &lt;br/&gt;decomposition is smooth, and the decomposition is uniform -- either &lt;br/&gt;there are no singular strata, or the singular strata themselves have a &lt;br/&gt;foliated structure.  The breadth of the study of foliations includes &lt;br/&gt;all dynamical systems, an immensely broad topic in itself, so truly &lt;br/&gt;classifying all foliations is quite impossible. The goal of this &lt;br/&gt;project is to investigate three approaches to classification: 1) &lt;br/&gt;classify foliations via categorical (in the sense of Lusternik and &lt;br/&gt;Schnirelmann) decompositions and other  "foliated cell" structures;   &lt;br/&gt;2) classify foliations up to homotopy of their transverse Haefliger &lt;br/&gt;structure;  3) classify foliations in terms of the ergodic theory and &lt;br/&gt;asymptotic properties of their leaves.  The PI's study of the relations &lt;br/&gt;between the second and third of these topics -- dynamical systems and &lt;br/&gt;ergodic theory, and geometric and  topological invariants of group &lt;br/&gt;actions and foliations -- has been ongoing for more than 20 years with &lt;br/&gt;support of the NSF, and resulted in many publications and advances in &lt;br/&gt;the field.  In the past three years, there have been further decisive &lt;br/&gt;advances in each topic. The study of Lusternik and Schnirelmann &lt;br/&gt;category of foliations, and its related ideas, is a very new field, &lt;br/&gt;with great potential for advances.  The fundamental connections between &lt;br/&gt;LS category theory and Morse theory, motivate the study of the &lt;br/&gt;connections between their foliated versions, and the classification of &lt;br/&gt;transverse Haefliger structures. Success with this part of the proposed &lt;br/&gt;research  would result in truly fundamental new understanding of the &lt;br/&gt;structure of foliations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study of foliations of manifolds began as a subject approximately &lt;br/&gt;fifty years ago.  The concept arises very naturally in many geometric &lt;br/&gt;and topological problems, so it is not surprising that understanding &lt;br/&gt;properties of foliations  has become a fundamental aspect of the study &lt;br/&gt;of many other subjects in geometry, topology,  dynamical systems,  &lt;br/&gt;analysis and   various areas of  applied and theoretical physics.  The &lt;br/&gt;intellectual merit of the proposed activity includes advancing our &lt;br/&gt;understanding of the structure of foliations,  and  developing new &lt;br/&gt;techniques with broad applications in many fields. Success with this &lt;br/&gt;research project will not just be measured by solving the proposed &lt;br/&gt;problems, but also in opening the field up with new questions. The &lt;br/&gt;broader impact resulting from the proposed activity includes enhanced &lt;br/&gt;training of undergraduate and graduate students in mathematics, &lt;br/&gt;collaborative research projects with postdoctoral investigators, and &lt;br/&gt;international collaborations promoting research in mathematics.   The &lt;br/&gt;PI intends to continue working with graduate students and postdocs on &lt;br/&gt;projects related to this proposal, and to promote the field via &lt;br/&gt;conference talks and via the internet.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
