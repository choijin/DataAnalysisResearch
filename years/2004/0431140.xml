<AbstractNarration>Designing practically efficient parallel algorithms with rigorously &lt;br/&gt;analyzed run time guarantees seems to be difficult for a large class &lt;br/&gt;of problems, commonly known as irregularly structured problems. The &lt;br/&gt;solutions for such problems typically depend on run time workload &lt;br/&gt;monitoring and dynamic load balancing, and the run time is often &lt;br/&gt;critically dependent on the particular instance of the problem being &lt;br/&gt;solved with no easy way to guarantee optimal, worst-case run times. &lt;br/&gt;The goal of the proposed research is to design theoretically rigorous &lt;br/&gt;and practically efficient parallel algorithms for selected irregular &lt;br/&gt;applications and to develop software to demonstrate their effectiveness. &lt;br/&gt;Research will also be conducted in developing distributed tree data &lt;br/&gt;structures and software libraries to support these and other irregular &lt;br/&gt;applications. Three important classes of applications will be studied:&lt;br/&gt;grid and particle based methods in scientific computing, sequence &lt;br/&gt;alignment problems in computational biology, and computing aggregates &lt;br/&gt;on multidimensional data cubes in data mining. The work in scientific &lt;br/&gt;computing will be focused on providing spatial data structure support &lt;br/&gt;for problems such as molecular dynamics, adaptive mesh refinement &lt;br/&gt;and multigrid methods. Several computationally intensive irregular &lt;br/&gt;problems in sequence homology detection will be studied including&lt;br/&gt;spliced sequence alignments for gene discovery, multiple sequence &lt;br/&gt;alignments to discover protein motifs and full genome comparisons for &lt;br/&gt;comparative genomics. The third application area is computation of&lt;br/&gt;aggregates on multidimensional data. Using techniques from computational&lt;br/&gt;geometry, efficient parallel algorithms for computing aggregates and &lt;br/&gt;answering queries on sparse, multidimensional data sets will be developed.&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to discover common underlying themes to provide a unifying &lt;br/&gt;way to address seemingly disparate problem areas. For example, spatial &lt;br/&gt;distribution of the data or the geometrical structure of the problem &lt;br/&gt;domain is the source of irregularity for most of the problems considered. &lt;br/&gt;Similarly, tree data structures are often the backbone of parallel &lt;br/&gt;algorithms for many irregularly structured problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the proposed research include fundamental&lt;br/&gt;contributions to solving irregularly structured problems, a major &lt;br/&gt;theme of research in parallel processing. Student participation in&lt;br/&gt;research is pursued using multiple strategies - graduate students &lt;br/&gt;through direct funding under the project, undergraduate students &lt;br/&gt;via senior design projects, female students through Iowa State's Women&lt;br/&gt;in Science and Engineering program, and minority students through&lt;br/&gt;collaboration with a minority serving institution.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
