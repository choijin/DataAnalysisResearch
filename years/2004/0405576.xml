<AbstractNarration>This project proposes to examine the causes and effects of quantum tunneling of the magnetic moment in single molecule magnets. Quantum tunneling of the magnetic moment of Mn12-acetate was first reported in 1996, but its mechanism is still uncertain. This project will use a time-domain terahertz spectroscopy to probe a collection of these molecules during the tunneling process in order to provide a link between the local environment of the molecules and the tunneling probability. In a separate experiment, the process of relaxation will be observed through the observation of the THz pulse emitted when the molecules are suddenly heated above the blocking temperature, and it is anticipated that superradiance will be observed. This research award supports undergraduate research both directly through research stipends and indirectly through bringing this exciting research project to a liberal arts college. The involvement of undergraduate students in research increases the likelihood that they will pursue advanced degrees in science and will contribute to our nation's scientific infrastructure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quantum tunneling is one of the hallmarks of quantum mechanics; its occurrence in a material guarantees that this material's properties cannot be explained by classical mechanics alone. In the twentieth century, the properties of very small quantum mechanical systems like atoms became fairly well understood. Now physicists are attempting to understand what happens when quantum mechanics becomes important for larger systems. This project hopes to expand our understanding of quantum mechanical tunneling in the material Mn12-acetate, in which clusters of atoms behave as nanoscale magnets that can tunnel from one orientation to another. Besides being of fundamental scientific interest, this line of research may also lead to denser memory storage for computers or even to quantum computers. These possible future applications make these experiments particularly exciting for undergraduate physics students.
