<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;Purpose and Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is the systematic development of a mathematical theory for&lt;br/&gt;Aeroelasticity drawing on Abstract Functional Analysis -- in particular nonlinear Aeroelasticity&lt;br/&gt;-- centered on the canonical problem of flutter: the instability endemic to aircraft at high enough&lt;br/&gt;air speed in the subsonic range, M &lt; 1. In particular this would mean the development of&lt;br/&gt;mathematical models for aeroelastic phenomena of interest on their own and also explore&lt;br/&gt;analytically the design of feedback controllers -- including self-straining actuators, "intelligent&lt;br/&gt;controllers" for Flutter Boundary Expansion.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;We should point out that while aircraft wings (including UAV's) are the primary domain of the&lt;br/&gt;theory, there is a new emerging area of application: Alternate Sources of Energy such as Wind&lt;br/&gt;Turbines -- where the aeroelastic stabilization of the blades is an increasingly important issue.&lt;br/&gt;Longer blades are apparently more efficient but reducing weight implies higher flexibility, just as&lt;br/&gt;with UAV's.&lt;br/&gt;Specific Tasks: First Year&lt;br/&gt;Analytical study of the effect of nonzero angle of attack and nonzero camber on flutter speed as a&lt;br/&gt;function of Mach number, especially in the transonic range -- a currently unsettled problem. This&lt;br/&gt;would mean in particular studying the linearized version of the nonlinear aeroelastic equation,&lt;br/&gt;leading to generalization of the Possio Integral Equation. In turn we will need to study the root&lt;br/&gt;locus problem for the corresponding convolution-evolution equation, including the performance&lt;br/&gt;of self-straining actuator models -- still using the Goland cantilever beam model for the wing.&lt;br/&gt;Specific Tasks: Second Year&lt;br/&gt;Extend the theory to where the structure is a uniform thin plate rather than a beam so that we can&lt;br/&gt;consider controls on the leading and/or trailing edge of the wing. We could then investigate self-straining&lt;br/&gt;actuators -- piezo-strips chordwise as well as spanwise, eliminating ailerons. For a&lt;br/&gt;high-aspect-ratio wing we could still work with typical-section aerodynamics -- so that the&lt;br/&gt;nonlinear aerodynamic theory we have developed can be used without additional effort.&lt;br/&gt;Specific Tasks: Third Year&lt;br/&gt;Extend the aeroelastic theory to finite wings finally eliminating the high-aspect-ratio constraint.</AbstractNarration>
