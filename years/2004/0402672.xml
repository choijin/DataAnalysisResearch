<AbstractNarration>Engineering NEC (59)  The Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute (SIPI), a national Indian community college, is developing a model for engineering technology and engineering transfer programs that will be reproducible and applicable to other locations with significant Indian populations.  By employing articulation agreements with a wide range of four and two-year institutions, national laboratories and industry, SIPI is providing lower division courses in engineering and in engineering technology allowing participants to go directly into the workforce or continue with baccalaureate programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ASEET's comprehensive program design encompasses curriculum development, faculty recruitment, professional development, community outreach, student recruitment, student retention, and career development for the transitions between high school and 2- and 4-year colleges. &lt;br/&gt;SIPI's ASEET program is:&lt;br/&gt;1. Improving Native American student proficiency in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics through the development and revision of science-based academic programs and course offerings.&lt;br/&gt;2. Motivating pre-college Native American students to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics by offering seminars, short courses, and workshops onsite and through distance education, engineering survey courses, directed learning experiences and internships as part of SIPI's pre-engineering degree program.&lt;br/&gt;3. Improving science, technology, engineering and mathematics instruction through professional development opportunities and curriculum review and revision.&lt;br/&gt;4. Continuing to build Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute's capacity to develop world-class science and technology knowledge and skills for the technological workplace. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additionally, SIPI is assisting other tribal colleges in establishing similar programs. Faculty members from other tribal colleges are being encouraged to serve as visiting or adjunct faculty and receive training in the methodology developed at SIPI.  These faculty members are helping to develop teaching materials and methods to evaluate the effectiveness of the pedagogy and curriculum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
