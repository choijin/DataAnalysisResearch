<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT - 0414319&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the potential for high power density and efficiency, fuel cells hold tremendous&lt;br/&gt;promise for future portable, automotive and stationary applications. Among fuel cell types, the&lt;br/&gt;strongest candidate for portable applications is the direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC), while the&lt;br/&gt;hydrogen polymer electrolyte fuel cell (H2 PEFC) is the strongest candidate for stationary and&lt;br/&gt;transportation applications. The minute length scales and complex materials in these fuel cells&lt;br/&gt;present many unique and challenging physicochemical issues. In particular, two-phase flow&lt;br/&gt;effects through the thin-film porous carbon fiber gas diffusion layers (GDLs) present a major&lt;br/&gt;microfluidic management bottleneck for achieving high power density and stability. The GDL is&lt;br/&gt;a critical component and functions to deliver reactant to, and product away from, the electrodes&lt;br/&gt;where electrochemical reaction occurs. If product transport through the GDL or flow channels is&lt;br/&gt;insufficient, reactant mass transport will be restricted, limiting performance. For example, CO2&lt;br/&gt;gas production at the anode of the DMFC can block transport of liquid methanol solution to the&lt;br/&gt;reaction site. At the cathode of the DMFC and H2 PEFC, liquid water from electrochemical&lt;br/&gt;reaction, electro-osmotic drag and diffusion can severely limit performance by flooding the&lt;br/&gt;cathode, starving it of oxygen. In both the DMFC and H2 PEFC, there is a complex two-phase&lt;br/&gt;flow challenge to manage the transport of reactants and products through the thin-film porous&lt;br/&gt;GDL and in the flow channels. As a result, the naturally hydrophilic GDLs are typically tailored&lt;br/&gt;by addition of hydrophobic material during processing. To date, the fraction of hydrophobic&lt;br/&gt;additive is determined through inefficient trial-and-error testing. The existing literature has also&lt;br/&gt;followed a phenomenological approach and has yet to yield any clear rationale or fundamental&lt;br/&gt;knowledge of the basic transport processes of bubbles and liquid droplets through the GDL, at the&lt;br/&gt;interfacial boundaries between the GDL and the flow channel, or in the flow channels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We propose to initiate an experimental and analytical study of the two-phase flow of gasphase&lt;br/&gt;bubbles and liquid-phase droplets in reactant flow channels and thin-film porous media&lt;br/&gt;with tailored wetting properties. We will use high-speed microfluidic flow visualization&lt;br/&gt;techniques and a model fuel cell to experimentally quantify parameters such as bubble/droplet&lt;br/&gt;shape, detachment size, transport rate, distribution, and liquid saturation in the porous material as&lt;br/&gt;a function of operating conditions. Analytical models will then be developed to describe the&lt;br/&gt;bubble/liquid droplet dynamics and validated using the novel data obtained from a highly&lt;br/&gt;instrumented fuel cell. The ultimate goal of this research is to provide, for the first time, design&lt;br/&gt;theory based on fundamental understanding that can be used to engineer fuel cell materials and&lt;br/&gt;empower microfluidic management for next-generation fuel cell systems. This would represent a&lt;br/&gt;significant leap in understanding of one of the most critical areas currently limiting fuel cell&lt;br/&gt;development and would impact portable, stationary, and automotive fuel cell design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of our integrated approach to research and education are to: 1) create a&lt;br/&gt;physical and intellectual infrastructure for addressing a multidisciplinary technical junction in the&lt;br/&gt;design of next-generation hydrogen or methanol polymer electrolyte fuel cells; 2) train graduate&lt;br/&gt;and undergraduate students in physical/chemical science fields highly relevant to current national&lt;br/&gt;needs; 3) integrate cutting-edge research results directly into three established courses at Penn&lt;br/&gt;State and enable supported graduate students to present material in the undergraduate courses; 4)&lt;br/&gt;expand the role for fuel cell and microfluidic research programs at PSU in undergraduate and&lt;br/&gt;graduate recruiting process; and 5) provide significant opportunities for undergraduate/graduate&lt;br/&gt;students to interact with industry through existing and future Electrochemical Engine Center&lt;br/&gt;industry collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
