<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;This proposal aims to address some of the most fundamental and challenging issues in the field of nonlinear&lt;br/&gt;control. The main objectives are to develop nonsmooth feedback design approaches achieving global stabilization,&lt;br/&gt;adaptive regulation and output tracking, via measurable signals, for a significant class of nonlinear systems with&lt;br/&gt;unstabilizable/undetectable linearization, which cannot be dealt with by any smooth feedback, even locally. Nonsmooth&lt;br/&gt;feedback designs ofer the potential to overcome certain topological obstacles that cannot be addressed by smooth&lt;br/&gt;controls, for example, to globally stabilize a nonlinear system that is not stabilizable by any linear or smooth state&lt;br/&gt;feedback, because the linearized system has uncontrollable modes associated with eigenvalues on the right-half plane.&lt;br/&gt;The basic research components of this proposal are to design nonsmooth partial state or output feedback controllers&lt;br/&gt;that achieve global strong stability and do so in a robust fashion, that is, in a manner which is not sensitive to&lt;br/&gt;perturbations and parametric uncertainties in the system.&lt;br/&gt;The other focal points of this proposal will be the development of a new output tracking theory for inherently&lt;br/&gt;nonlinear systems by measurement feedback. The objective is to make the controlled plant track a desired reference&lt;br/&gt;signal. A key feature of the classical servomechanism theory is the ability to absorb the effect of modeling errors and&lt;br/&gt;to secure asymptotic tracking in the presence of uncertainties. A nonlinear analogue of these robustness properties was&lt;br/&gt;developed via center manifold theory, under the assumption that the linearized system is controllable and observable,&lt;br/&gt;at least partially. However, little result is known on the output regulation of nonlinear systems whose linearization&lt;br/&gt;is unobservable and uncontrollable. Our preliminary analysis suggests that a new formulation to the nonlinear reg-&lt;br/&gt;ulator problem is needed. Indeed, some dramatic examples in the proposal indicate that while asymptotic output&lt;br/&gt;tracking is usually not possible, even locally, practical output tracking is achievable. One of important components&lt;br/&gt;of this project will be to establish a general theory for global practical output tracking of nonlinear systems with&lt;br/&gt;uncontrollable/unobservable linearization, in the presence of nonlinear parameterization.&lt;br/&gt;The theoretical research will be complemented by several novel applications. In particular, the nonsmooth control&lt;br/&gt;theory to be developed will be used to address diffcult control problems including output feedback stabilization of&lt;br/&gt;underactuated mechanical systems and output tracking/regulation of antagonistic biomimetic actuation systems, by&lt;br/&gt;nonsmooth measurement feedback.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merits: This program will not only provided a general framework for the control of nonlinear systems&lt;br/&gt;with uncontrollable/unobservable linearization by nonsmooth measurement feedback, but also make a fundamental&lt;br/&gt;contribution to a number of important and challenging open problems such as output feedback stabilization, output&lt;br/&gt;tracking and regulation, for genuinely nonlinear systems that cannot be controlled by existing smooth synthesis tech-&lt;br/&gt;niques. The proposed research will yield new insight, advance the state-of-the-art of nonsmooth control theory, and&lt;br/&gt;further facilitate the development of nonsmooth design methods and their applications for a large class of inherently&lt;br/&gt;nonlinear systems.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The proposed research will have enormous impact on developing a new generation of nonlinear&lt;br/&gt;control technologies, with emphasis on the development of computationally efficient and practically feasible nonsmooth&lt;br/&gt;control tools and algorithms, for critical biomedical control applications and for achieving high-performance operation&lt;br/&gt;of engineering systems (e.g. mobile robots, underactuated mechanical systems, and biomimetic or biologically-inspired&lt;br/&gt;systems). Applications of the nonsmooth control methods to biomimetic systems have the potential to overcome some&lt;br/&gt;fundamental diffculties in designing biologically-inspired robots (e.g. cockroach-like hexapod robots), functional elec-&lt;br/&gt;trical stimulation muscles, and other man-made devices whose embedded control systems can function autonomously&lt;br/&gt;in the real world, thus improving significantly performance of the first generation biomimetic systems. The outcomes&lt;br/&gt;of this program are envisioned to provide new avenues for a significant improvement of operability and efficiency&lt;br/&gt;of engineering and biologically-inspired systems, to create commercial or biomedical application opportunities, and&lt;br/&gt;eventually to result in economic benefits.&lt;br/&gt;1</AbstractNarration>
