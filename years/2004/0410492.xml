<AbstractNarration>Social Psychology (72),  Cognitive Psychology (73)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Commercial media and communication technologies are the primary means people use to receive and transmit information about their cultures. However, there are few opportunities for undergraduates to investigate the processes by which children and adults use and acquire knowledge from various media sources.  This project is establishing the first media psychology research laboratory at an undergraduate college.  The lab provides resources for undergraduates to conduct research not only on media effects on users' attention, attitudes, beliefs, and knowledge, but also on the usability of media technologies.  Our development plan has two specific aims.  First, we are creating new media research activities in three psychology laboratory courses (Cognitive Psychology, Human Factors and Engineering Psychology, and Advanced Social Psychology).  Second, we are providing advanced students with the tools necessary to conduct research on usability and media effects in student-directed research and honors projects.   To offer these research experiences we are employing eye-tracking workstations, digital video editing equipment, event-logging analytic software, and a continuous response measurement system.  To assess the impact of the laboratory on students understanding of usability and effects research, the evaluation plan combines standardized testing and interviews conducted by professional usability engineers and media researchers.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
