<AbstractNarration>This project awards 20 scholarships of $3,125 per year for 4 years to full-time undergraduate and graduate financially disadvantaged talented students to follow a challenging program in mathematics and computer science. It sustain the gains made in building graduate program by a previous CSEMS grant; supports mathematics and computer science students in the newly formed Honors College; and increases the number of minority individuals employed in the fields of mathematics and computer science. It includes student research experience; participation in departmental colloquia; provides internships for students in banks, hospitals, and industry; and increases the number of well-prepared African American and Hispanic students who successfully compete for admission to graduate programs in mathematics and computer science. The project includes a built in strong support system that enables students to handle the rigors of the program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: The program continues a successful previous CSEMS project and extends it into new areas with the University Honors Program. Forums for intensive informal interaction between faculty and students are designed to bring out latent talents in students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact: Graduates of the program are hired in area high schools and colleges, and impart the philosophy of teaching mathematics and the culture of success in the program to their students and colleagues.</AbstractNarration>
