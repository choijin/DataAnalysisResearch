<AbstractNarration>The proposed research touches on both theoretical computer science and artifcial intelligence (AI).&lt;br/&gt;In particular, the techniques of theoretical computer science will be applied to two significant&lt;br/&gt;problem areas in AI: knowledge representation and machine learning. Certain forms of knowledge&lt;br/&gt;representation are extremely important for AI applications. Some, such as conjunctions of Horn&lt;br/&gt;clauses, have been studied from AI's earliest days; others, such as decomposable negation normal&lt;br/&gt;form (DNNF), are relatively new. This project will study the computational complexity aspects of&lt;br/&gt;these and other forms of knowledge representation, and formal learnability results for them.&lt;br/&gt;Knowledge representation is interesting because the choice of representation determines the ease&lt;br/&gt;or difficulty of various tasks that an intelligent agent must perform, such as reasoning or planning.&lt;br/&gt;The representations of interest for this research include various forms of propositional logic, ranging&lt;br/&gt;from disjunctive normal form to DNNF, and various more powerful logics, such as modal logics,&lt;br/&gt;some forms of predicate logic, and probabilistic description logic. This proposal includes a variety&lt;br/&gt;of problems and approaches, unified by recurring themes drawn from combinatorics and logic.&lt;br/&gt;One main goal of the proposed work is to advance the understanding of several aspects of im-&lt;br/&gt;portant knowledge representation formalisms. This includes answering questions on expressiveness&lt;br/&gt;for both basic formalisms such as disjunctive normal forms and decision trees, and also for recent&lt;br/&gt;formalisms such as DNNFs. It also includes determining the complexity of handling exceptions in&lt;br/&gt;different formalisms, which is both a practical problem and is also closely related to some questions&lt;br/&gt;on the efficient learnability of the representations. The proposed work will include a probabilistic&lt;br/&gt;analysis of the important reasoning technique of Horn approximations, in order to identify situ-&lt;br/&gt;ations when the method can be expected to work efficiently in spite of examples demonstrating&lt;br/&gt;its worst-case behavior, and an analysis of the possibilities for compiling a knowledge bases into a&lt;br/&gt;more efficient form having short resolution proofs of its consequences.&lt;br/&gt;Another goal of the project is to obtain a better integration of the learnability aspect of the&lt;br/&gt;different knowledge representation formalisms into the emerging comparative theory of knowledge&lt;br/&gt;representation. This line of research includes making new progress on old, well established problems,&lt;br/&gt;such as learning Horn sentences, the further study of recently introduced problems, such as revising&lt;br/&gt;Horn sentences, and the exploration of representations that have not been studied yet from the point&lt;br/&gt;of view of learnability, such as modal logics. Work is also proposed on the exclusion dimension, a&lt;br/&gt;promising recent notion, in both propositional and predicate logic.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: The proposal addresses several key issues in knowledge representation&lt;br/&gt;and learning: expressiveness, efficient manipulation, efficient reasoning, and efficient learning and&lt;br/&gt;revision, in propositional, predicate, and modal logic. The proposal builds on the previous re-&lt;br/&gt;search results of the proposers, which includes the development of new approaches to logic learning&lt;br/&gt;and theory revision, and their technical expertise in computational learning theory, computational&lt;br/&gt;complexity theory, combinatorics and logic, leading up to a comprehensive, in-depth study of core&lt;br/&gt;problem areas of artificial intelligence, emphasizing the interactions between the different aspects.&lt;br/&gt;The proposers have initial results in several of the suggested research directions.&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact: The rapid increase in both the amount of, and the inherent complexity&lt;br/&gt;of data greatly increases the importance of expressive knowledge representation formalisms that&lt;br/&gt;are suitable for efficient manipulation, reasoning, automated acquisition and revision. Symbolic&lt;br/&gt;knowledge representation formalisms based on propositional, predicate, modal and other logics&lt;br/&gt;form an indispensable component in a large number of applications. Understanding the complexity&lt;br/&gt;obstacles in these applications, and identifying possible avenues for circumventing them, is a crucial&lt;br/&gt;component of further development.</AbstractNarration>
