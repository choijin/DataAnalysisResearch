<AbstractNarration>A collaboration between the University of California, Irvine (UCI) Schools of Physical and Biological Sciences, the UCI Department of Education, four regional school districts, and two regional community colleges is providing the necessary infrastructure to recruit, train, and provide professional support for future mathematics and science teachers preparing to teach in high-need school districts in the Orange County, California region. The UCI Noyce Scholarship Program builds on the infrastructure provided by a UCI Math and Science Partnership project to provide a comprehensive continuum of teacher preparation programs and strategies that achieve objectives for teacher recruitment, preparation for teaching success, and nurturing a commitment to teaching in a high-need district. Approximately fifty three one-year scholarships are being awarded over a four year period to: a) prospective secondary math and science teachers who are UCI STEM majors in their senior and final undergraduate year, and b) single subject math and science preservice teacher candidates enrolled in the UCI fifth-year credential program. At least two senior year scholarships per year are identified for UCI STEM majors who have transferred to UCI from a partner community college. Scholarship recipients fulfill their teaching commitment in partner schools districts where they have had previous apprentice teaching experiences, and where they benefit from new teacher induction programs and professional development opportunities. The program is developing strategies and conditions for preparing and nurturing STEM majors for success in secondary teaching in high-need regional school districts with diverse student populations. One strategy is to provide a continuum of coherently linked preparation and professional support experiences, in pre-credential, credential and induction phases, that develop subject matter and pedagogic knowledge, teacher growth through reflective inquiry, and leadership potential. Another strategy is to create collaborations between the university, regional community colleges, and regional high-need school districts, in order to provide a continuum of experiences to develop aspiring teachers' knowledge about and commitment to a school district and its community, teachers, and diverse student population.  Undergraduate baccalaureate programs in mathematics and the sciences, combined with state-approved undergraduate subject matter preparation programs, provide the foundation of subject matter knowledge that is critical for the teaching success of scholarship recipients. Similarly, the UCI undergraduate educational studies minor and the Teacher Credential Program provide the necessary foundations of pedagogical knowledge and practice that scholarship recipients need. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
