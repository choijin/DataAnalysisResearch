    <AbstractNarration>Many animal cells have the ability to crawl or glide over&lt;br/&gt;long distance on a surface. For decades, scientists have been&lt;br/&gt;trying to understand the mechanics of such movement. This is&lt;br/&gt;important because cell movement is fundamental to many important&lt;br/&gt;biological processes such as the formation and development of an&lt;br/&gt;embryo, wound healing, and proper functioning of the immune&lt;br/&gt;system. The investigator and colleagues develop a mathematical&lt;br/&gt;model of cell movement based on well established physical and&lt;br/&gt;biological principles. With such a model, testable prediction&lt;br/&gt;about any particular aspect of cell movement that is being&lt;br/&gt;modeled can be made. One can also examine the contribution of&lt;br/&gt;each sub-process of cell movement by altering the appropriate&lt;br/&gt;parameters in the model, something which is not possible to do by&lt;br/&gt;experiments. A good mathematical model can help cell biologists&lt;br/&gt;better understand the principles of cell movement which will in&lt;br/&gt;turn help doctors and people in the medical field improve their&lt;br/&gt;treatment of certain types of diseases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Existing models of cell motility are either one-dimensional,&lt;br/&gt;meaning that they only focus on a vertical strip in the middle of&lt;br/&gt;the cell, or they are spatially discrete models. A&lt;br/&gt;one-dimensional model is inadequate because the cell can only&lt;br/&gt;have length but no shape. It is also known that certain protein&lt;br/&gt;filaments, which are cross-linked to form the cytoskeleton of the&lt;br/&gt;cell that is responsible for cell movement, are oriented&lt;br/&gt;differently at different parts of the cell. A spatially discrete&lt;br/&gt;model is difficult to analyze mathematically because of the large&lt;br/&gt;number of equations involved. The model the investigator and his&lt;br/&gt;colleagues develop is a two-dimensional continuum model that&lt;br/&gt;requires more sophisticated analytical and computational&lt;br/&gt;techniques. Methods of study involve biological experiments to&lt;br/&gt;determine the movement of cell boundary, development of the&lt;br/&gt;mathematical model using mechanics principles, analytical and&lt;br/&gt;numerical studies of the resulting equations, and comparisons and&lt;br/&gt;reconciliations of the analytical, numerical and experimental&lt;br/&gt;results.</AbstractNarration>
