    <AbstractNarration>This research involves the development, installation, and &lt;br/&gt;verification of a collection of error control codes that &lt;br/&gt;are employed across base stations to vastly improve the &lt;br/&gt;performance of public safety radio systems (i.e. those &lt;br/&gt;used by police officers and firefighters). In particular, &lt;br/&gt;recent events have demonstrated the stringent demands placed &lt;br/&gt;on public safety radio systems in times of extreme crisis. &lt;br/&gt;Such systems must handle high-priority delay-sensitive voice &lt;br/&gt;transmissions that often need to be broadcast to a large number &lt;br/&gt;of receivers over the challenging wireless communications channel. &lt;br/&gt;The wireless channel can introduce significant signal fading, and &lt;br/&gt;the narrowband frequency allocations and current collection of &lt;br/&gt;single-antenna base stations in public safety radio systems &lt;br/&gt;make it difficult to combat the effects of such fading using &lt;br/&gt;previously considered techniques. Employing a single error &lt;br/&gt;control code across multiple base stations can improve the &lt;br/&gt;broadcast to a group of system users in the area, but there &lt;br/&gt;are a number of technical barriers to such an approach. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fundamental problem is that, because of the large geographical &lt;br/&gt;area covered by the transmitting base stations, the relative time &lt;br/&gt;of arrival at the receiver of signals from different base stations &lt;br/&gt;can vary greatly, and, since the application is partial broadcast, &lt;br/&gt;no amount of relative transmission timing can remedy such. The &lt;br/&gt;research team has demonstrated that many standard space-time &lt;br/&gt;schemes lose diversity versus signal fading in such a situation; &lt;br/&gt;however, the team is developing families of codes that are robust &lt;br/&gt;to this offset, thus preserving diversity against fading across the &lt;br/&gt;coverage area. These codes are termed "macroscopic space-time &lt;br/&gt;codes," which, in addition to being developed, are being verified &lt;br/&gt;on the OpenSky testbed of partner M/A-COM, Inc.</AbstractNarration>
