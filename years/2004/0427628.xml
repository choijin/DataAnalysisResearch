<AbstractNarration>Progress in a wide range of ocean research and applications depends upon the prompt and dependable availability of ocean information products. The field of physical oceanography has matured to a point where it is now conceivable to combine numerical models and observations via data assimilation in order to provide ocean prediction products on various spatial and time scales. As a result, many nations have begun large-scale efforts to provide routine products to the oceanographic community. The Global Ocean Data Assimilation Experiment (GODAE) provides  a  framework for these efforts,  i.e., a global  system of observations, communications,  modeling,  and assimilation that  will deliver regular, comprehensive  information  on the state of  the oceans, in a  way that  will  promote  and engender wide utility and availability of this resource for maximum benefit to the community. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific  objective of the school is to  form/motivate the  young scientists  and professionals that will  be  the  principal movers and users of  operational oceanographic outputs in the  next  10  years. Specifically, in order for good science to be performed, one needs to understand the limitations of the products that are made available to the community at large. The lectures will present these limitations as well as emphasize the following two themes: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) How can science benefits from an operational environment? &lt;br/&gt;2) What are the limits of ocean prediction systems? of predictability? &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Leading scientists from around the world will brought together to summarize the present knowledge in ocean modeling, ocean observing systems, and data assimilation to present an integrated view of oceanography.  In addition to formal lectures, shorter talks by experts in the field will expose the participants to a wide range of applications. Attendees will also have the opportunity to present their work via poster sessions. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  &lt;br/&gt;The societal benefit will be an increased knowledge of the marine environment and ocean climate, predictive skills for societal, industrial, and commercial benefit and tactical and strategic advantage, as well as the provision of a comprehensive and integrated approach to the oceans. The lecture notes will be reviewed by the attendees and will be published as a proceedings volume. Graduate students, post-doctoral fellows and beginning investigators will receive additional training in ocean data assimilation.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
