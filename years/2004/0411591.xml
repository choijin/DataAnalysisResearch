    <AbstractNarration>The last two decades have seen increased globalization of commerce and flight of engineering, manufacturing, and IT jobs from the U.S. It is more critical now than ever to innovate technologies, products and services that provide new fuel to the engines of our national economy. A workshop is planned to determine how to best meet industry and educational needs in engineering design through research in this changing environment. &lt;br/&gt;This award provides support for a workshop to be held March 26-29, 2004 in North/Central Arizona (Phoenix/Scottsdale locale). The objectives of the workshop are a) to review the past 25 years activities in research in design theory and its impact on product design and engineering education to date, b) to forecast technological developments and changes in social, business, and environmental factors that may have profound effects on future product development, and c) to formulate a strategic plan for engineering design research based upon lessons learned and expectations of the globalization of product development. The 2-1/2 day workshop will be organized by a Steering Committee that represents the broad engineering design community focused on product realization. Potential participants will submit position papers and 40-45 invitees will be selected based upon their potential to contribute to one or more of the objectives of the workshop. This is appropriate to assure that the many different perspectives and threads of research are represented as the future directions for engineering design research and education are discussed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of the workshop will be published on a website and on a CD for public dissemination. The previous workshop, held a decade ago, produced a substantive report that provided key recommendations to NSF and the community at that time. It is expected that similar outcomes will be realized from this workshop. This time, however, the community is being challenged to not only benchmark where we are now and immediate future needs, but to look out to the 2030 horizon with vision.</AbstractNarration>
