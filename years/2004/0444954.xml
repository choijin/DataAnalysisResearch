    <AbstractNarration>EarthScope and associated activities will provide a wealth of data &lt;br/&gt;from a wide range of disciplines about how Earth.s crust deforms on a wide range of &lt;br/&gt;spatial and temporal scales. Interpreting these data in terms of the underlying processes &lt;br/&gt;requires model-based inference. In order to gain better understanding of earth processes, &lt;br/&gt;as well as to address adequately the high quality data that are increasingly becoming &lt;br/&gt;available from geodesy, paleoseismology, stress measurements, and seismology, it is &lt;br/&gt;crucial that substantial effort be devoted to improving our models. While in the short &lt;br/&gt;term (important for siting of instruments, and guiding development of more sophisticated &lt;br/&gt;approaches), we can make significant progress with relatively simple models; ultimately &lt;br/&gt;a large-scale computational effort is needed in order to do justice to the data. We plan a &lt;br/&gt;three-day workshop at Los Alamos, Aug. 16-19, 2004, with formal discussion periods, but &lt;br/&gt;also with significant time to conduct hands-on work. The main objective will be to address the issues relating to meshing complex geologic problems. This workshop is open to all interested members of the EarthScope modeling community; by holding it at LANL, we can take advantage of local expertise in meshing and solving large FEM problems.</AbstractNarration>
