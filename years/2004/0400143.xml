<AbstractNarration>The objective of the proposed work is a systematic investigation of Electromagnetic Forming (EMF) of aluminum alloys, which is expected to: a) understand the mechanisms for the experimentally observed increased ductility in aluminum, b) establish the modeling capability required for the design of realistic such processes and c) educate students in this new research area and disseminate the knowledge created in the most efficient way.&lt;br/&gt;The approach has a theoretical and an experimental component and involves Industry - University collaboration. The novel element of the proposed work is the modeling of the fully coupled thermo-mechanical and electromagnetic problem with large strain, viscoplastic and inertia effects included. Modeling capability is an indispensable ingredient for the design of EMF processes, since, unlike the design of standard sheet forming operations (which are currently highly developed due to the use of specialized commercial FEM packages), the design of EMF processes is presently non-existent due, in good measure, to the lack of appropriate coupled-physics models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact and Benefits of the work: EMF technology is an environmentally friendly, flexible and cost-effective method of implementing high-velocity sheet metal forming that has considerable advantages over conventional techniques. It is an advanced technology that is finding an increasing number of automotive and aerospace applications. The work is expected to benefit the field by providing predictive capability for realistic EMF processes through the formulation of the fully coupled problem and the development of reliable numerical solution algorithms, backed by experimental validations. The existing collaboration in this research area between Alcoa and GM (who provided the seed funding for the preliminary work reported here) and Michigan, provides a natural network for the dissemination of the knowledge created, while the students will work in both academic and industrial environments.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
