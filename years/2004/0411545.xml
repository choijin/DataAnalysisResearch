<AbstractNarration>With NSF support, Alcorn State University will build upon effective practices developed during a previous HBCU-UP award to further strengthen science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) instruction.  Undergraduate STEM students will expand significantly their participation in research conducted both on- and off- campus. During the summer following their freshmen year, student participants will acquire analytical skills in mathematics and communication and learn basic laboratory research techniques. Through the sophomore year, students will continue research training through the use of technology enhanced instructional strategies.  In the summer following their sophomore year, students will engage in faculty-supervised research at a partner research institution.  Additional research training is provided throughout the balance of students' undergraduate experience. During their junior and senior years, students also serve as peer-tutors to STEM freshmen and sophomores.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the project lies in the advancement of the knowledge base concerning STEM undergraduate teaching and learning emphasizing both the theoretical and practical aspects of research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the project lies in the enhanced participation of under-represented minorities in STEM disciplines and the national STEM workforce that will result from the Alcorn State University HBCU-UP project.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
