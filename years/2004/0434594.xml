    <AbstractNarration>This award provides partial support of the 2004 Gordon Conference on Bioanalytical Sensors to be held at Queen's College, Oxford University, July 4th-9th, 2004. Efforts to develop new or improved bioanalytical sensors have focused on two main themes. One is the creation of sensors that transduce biomolecular recognition events into an electronic signal; the amplitude or other properties of the signal can then be used as a measure of the presence and amount of the molecules participating in the recognition event. These sensors require the marriage of biological molecules or cells with electronic platforms. The other main theme is the use of sensors to advance our understanding living systems, including cells, organs, and whole organisms. Sensors of both types have become important in areas as diverse as environmental monitoring and clinical medicine. This year's conference will address single molecule detection, the use of nano- and mesoscale materials in sensor construction, and complex macromolecular and cellular interactions. Speakers will present the latest advances in enzyme, antibody, and receptor-based biosensors, DNA chips and protein arrays, optical sensing, and nano- and microfluidics. This is the first time the conference has been held outside the US and, as a result, increased participation by non-US researchers is expected The funds provided by the award will be used to cover the cost of travel and conference fees for young scientists (students, postdoctoral fellows, and assistant professors) active in the field of bioanalytical sensors who a) will participate in the conference as an invited speaker or presenter of a contributed poster and b) would otherwise be unable to attend the conference.</AbstractNarration>
