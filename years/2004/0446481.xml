<AbstractNarration>HRD 04-46481&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB) proposes to host a workshop for postdoctoral fellows as part of a series of FASEB Career Developmental Seminars and Workshops. The workshop goal is to support postdoctoral fellows in career development planning through their learning best practices for developing an Individual Development Plan (IDP). FASEB targets the IDP as the framework to allow a structured planning process to identify professional development needs, focus career objectives and facilitate the realization of goals (long- and short-term). This activity is intended to engage both the post-doctoral fellow and the PI/scientist in the mentoring process, with phases including self-assessment, an exploration of career opportunities (suitable to the fellow), and writing and implementing the plan. The activity is intended to build career success through ensuring satisfactory project progress and engaging effective mentoring.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
