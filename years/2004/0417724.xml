<AbstractNarration>The proposed effort is a synthesis of theory and observations of the&lt;br/&gt;oceanic internal wavefield.  The work proposed is a truly&lt;br/&gt;collaborative effort: the analysis of oceanic observations to ground&lt;br/&gt;truth new theoretical descriptions of internal wave dynamics.  The&lt;br/&gt;theoretical work proposed involves the use of a novel Hamiltonian&lt;br/&gt;formalism for the internal wave field, recently developed by the&lt;br/&gt;PI's. This has already been shown to include the high--frequency&lt;br/&gt;component of the celebrated Garret--Munk spectrum as an exact&lt;br/&gt;statistically stationary solution, as well as to account for much of&lt;br/&gt;the observed spectral variability. It is proposed to develop a&lt;br/&gt;selection principle, based on a combination of wave turbulence and&lt;br/&gt;asymptotic analysis, to determine how each oceanic realization of this&lt;br/&gt;variability is tied to the local nature of the forcing and&lt;br/&gt;dissipation, as well as to the latitude dependence of the Coriolis effect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Water in the ocean abyss is denser than water at the surface.  This&lt;br/&gt;density stratification permits a class of waves within the ocean&lt;br/&gt;interior, called internal waves. These waves are apparent as the&lt;br/&gt;distortion of density surfaces, and their wave-like properties are due&lt;br/&gt;to the restoring force of gravity.  Internal waves are one of the&lt;br/&gt;major player in ocean dynamics, as they can propagate over big&lt;br/&gt;distances, interact with each other and other major players in the&lt;br/&gt;ocean, like vorticity and currents, internal waves break and mix&lt;br/&gt;water. While involved in this complex dynamics, internal waves&lt;br/&gt;redistribute mass, momentum, energy and tracers in the ocean.&lt;br/&gt;Understanding internal waves is a key element to understanding climate&lt;br/&gt;variability, especially over long time periods.  The most difficult&lt;br/&gt;piece of this puzzle is the interaction of internal waves.  The investigators&lt;br/&gt;have already contributed significantly to the understanding of&lt;br/&gt;nonlinear internal wave interactions by demonstrating the existence of&lt;br/&gt;an infinite family of statistically stationary solutions for the&lt;br/&gt;internal wave spectrum, of which the celebrated Garrett and Munk&lt;br/&gt;spectrum is a member.  Now they propose to investigate whether&lt;br/&gt;particular members of this infinite family are more likely than&lt;br/&gt;others, as well as quantify the effects of interaction of internal&lt;br/&gt;waves with other key players in the ocean.  This research will be&lt;br/&gt;aided by the ongoing analysis of oceanic data sets and will contribute&lt;br/&gt;crucial missing components to the theory of ocean mixing, weather and,&lt;br/&gt;ultimately, climate.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
