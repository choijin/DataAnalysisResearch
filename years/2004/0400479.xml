<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;Title: Scalable Decentralized Control over Ad Hoc Sensor-Actuator Networks&lt;br/&gt;Summary: This project studies the extent to which ad hoc networks of sensors and actuators&lt;br/&gt;may be used to implement large-scale feedback control systems. Dense ad hoc networks suffer from&lt;br/&gt;significant capacity limitations that suggest scalability may only be achieved if we restrict ourselves&lt;br/&gt;to localized network traffic patterns. Moreover, such sensor-actuator networks have a large number&lt;br/&gt;of clients sharing the same communication channel, so that contention between different clients will&lt;br/&gt;greatly reduce the amount of data that can be streamed between sensors and actuators. Maintain-&lt;br/&gt;ing specified levels of overall control system performance in such a non-deterministic environment is&lt;br/&gt;extremely challenging and we feel that it can only be achieved if we adopt a cross-layer approach in&lt;br/&gt;which application (i.e., control) algorithms and networking protocols are intimately aware of each&lt;br/&gt;others capabilities and limitations. This project investigates fundamental relationships between&lt;br/&gt;control system performance and network quality-of-service (QoS). The project will use these rela-&lt;br/&gt;tionships to develop decentralized control algorithms and supporting network middleware services&lt;br/&gt;that can guarantee application (control) performance over extremely large ad hoc sensor-actuator&lt;br/&gt;networks. The intellectual merit of the proposed work lies in its precise characterization of the&lt;br/&gt;way in which network middleware impacts control system performance. The project will demon-&lt;br/&gt;strate these algorithms and services on a physical testbed in which a spatially-distributed physical&lt;br/&gt;plant is controlled in a decentralized manner over an ad hoc radio (RF) network of embedded&lt;br/&gt;processors.&lt;br/&gt;The project's broader impacts will be felt through its impact on undergraduate education at&lt;br/&gt;Notre Dame as well as through on-going collaborations with civil, environmental, and mechanical&lt;br/&gt;engineering researchers both in and out of Notre Dame. In particular, the project's proposed testbed&lt;br/&gt;will be tied to undergraduate courses in electrical and mechanical engineering, thereby providing&lt;br/&gt;students with a novel opportunity to contribute to an on-going research program. Moreover we&lt;br/&gt;are collaborating with civil/environmental engineers to develop sensor-actuator networks that can&lt;br/&gt;address the combined-sewer overfow (CSO) problem faced by a number of municipalities across&lt;br/&gt;the Midwest and Eastern United States. The results from this project have the potential to reduce&lt;br/&gt;anticipated costs associated with solving the CSO problem. The results from this project will&lt;br/&gt;therefore have a broad societal impact extending well beyond the immediate project objectives.</AbstractNarration>
