<AbstractNarration>AST-0452758&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION: Ohio State University&lt;br/&gt;PI: Andrew Gould&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: Microlensing Theory and Galactic Astrophysics  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Andrew Gould at Ohio State University will undertake several projects related to microlensing, as it applies to galactic astrophysics.  Among the projects are investigations of degeneracies in the microlens parallax, in order to allow for proper interpretation of all microlensing parallax measurements, and studies of degeneracy between close-binary and wide-binary models of binary microlensing events.  Additionally, new codes to allow for detailed modeling of finite-source effects will be developed, in order to provide for proper interpretation of high-magnification events.  Another project will involve the construction of a new catalog of 100,000 halo stars, to probe halo parameters and substructure.  Training of graduate students in this research area will be among the broader impacts of this work.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
