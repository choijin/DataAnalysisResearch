<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;This award is for partial support a conference on Harmonic Analysis, Ergodic Theory and Probability.  A classic example of the interplay among these topics is the use of harmonic analysis to prove convergence results for ergodic averages.  Recently, there has been a great deal of interplay between these two fields, including major advances on several open problems. This interplay touches upon subjects of active interest in probability theory, such as martingales, Bernoulli convolutions and random polynomials. Seemingly unrelated advances in these fields that were reached independently in the past few years have several joint features and the proposed conference will elucidate these relations. The conference aims to make these advances better known and discuss open problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the meeting is to expand research activities in these closely related fields, bringing together researchers in different areas to solve similar problems and strengthening the cooperation between groups working in different physical locations. We plan to especially encourage women, underrepresented minorities, junior mathematicians and graduate students to attend and a significant portion of the budget is devoted to this.   &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
