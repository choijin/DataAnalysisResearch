<AbstractNarration>NSF Proposal DEB-0430132&lt;br/&gt;Philips&lt;br/&gt; A survey of the insects of the Upper Guinean Forests&lt;br/&gt;in Ghana with systematic studies on spider beetles and dung beetles&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The Upper West African Guinean forests are considered one of 25 biodiversity&lt;br/&gt;hotspots in the world and are a vital refuge and region of high species&lt;br/&gt;endemicity.  Knowledge of insect diversity in this habitat is poor relative to&lt;br/&gt;that found in other threatened areas in the tropics.  There is extreme urgency&lt;br/&gt;for an insect survey in the Upper Guinean forests because this ecosystem is more&lt;br/&gt;threatened and is disappearing more quickly than most other global hotspots.&lt;br/&gt;Severe pressure on these forests results from some of the highest human&lt;br/&gt;population growth rates, most intensive logging, and rampant bushmeat hunting&lt;br/&gt;found anywhere in the world.  The main goals of this project are: 1) to conduct&lt;br/&gt;an intensive survey of insects in the Guinean forests of Ghana and two&lt;br/&gt;additional areas in savannah and sub-sahalian regions, using a wide variety of&lt;br/&gt;collecting techniques, resulting in the collection of a large diversity of&lt;br/&gt;invertebrate groups previously unavailable to systematists; 2) to develop and&lt;br/&gt;rehabilitate a host country authoritative reference collection thereby creating&lt;br/&gt;a national insect collection and integrating it into the global systematics&lt;br/&gt;community; 3) to educate and train students and collaborate with scientists from&lt;br/&gt;Ghana (University of Ghana (Legon), Centre for Scientific and Industrial&lt;br/&gt;Research, and The Ghana Wildlife Society) and students from Western Kentucky&lt;br/&gt;University on insect sampling techniques, biodiversity studies, and insect&lt;br/&gt;curation providing much needed scientific systematic expertise in Ghana; 4) to&lt;br/&gt;partner with The Ghana Wildlife Society and other organizations and individuals&lt;br/&gt;by providing web accessible databases with identification keys and images of&lt;br/&gt;spider beetles and dung beetles and all available biological information on the&lt;br/&gt;group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The intellectual merit of this proposal is to ultimately better understand&lt;br/&gt;the biodiversity of these poorly studied and highly threatened forests by&lt;br/&gt;providing large numbers insect samples for study to improve insect taxonomy and&lt;br/&gt;classifications, the cornerstone of biology, while they still exist.  This work&lt;br/&gt;will also result in knowledge on the diversity and evolution of two main target&lt;br/&gt;groups: 1) the spider beetles which are arguably the most poorly known group of&lt;br/&gt;African beetles, and 2) the dung beetles that are still very poorly known and&lt;br/&gt;studied.  The latter group is also ecologically unstudied in this region and is&lt;br/&gt;of great interest because of the complex communities and behaviors exhibited.&lt;br/&gt;They are also indicative of ecosystem health and hence extremely useful to&lt;br/&gt;conservation organizations.  The broader impacts include a better understanding&lt;br/&gt;of African tropical forest biodiversity, its evolution, ecology, and&lt;br/&gt;biogeography.  Additionally, the vital aspect of student training, developing a&lt;br/&gt;systematics infrastructure in Ghana, partnering with the primary conservation&lt;br/&gt;agency in this country, and creating web accessible information on insects will&lt;br/&gt;lead to better education of citizens of Ghana and the United States and&lt;br/&gt;hopefully protection of the irreplaceable natural heritage of biodiversity in&lt;br/&gt;the Upper Guinean forests of West Africa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
