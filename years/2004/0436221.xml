<AbstractNarration>CUNY Queens College seeks to provide K-12 students, parents, pre-service and classroom teachers, school administrators, other educators, and the general public with information promoting the best practices toward implementing gender-equitable science education.  Core material about equitable teaching practices in science, mathematics, technology, and engineering will be drawn from the PI's experience with five evaluated science education programs over ten years.  Resource materials include curricula, research findings, and professional development methods.  An interactive website will make resources available nationally.  A teacher-authored quarterly newsletter will communicate reports of action research.  A publication series will feature current research on gender equity and science education.  A book will synthesize teacher research and academic research.  In addition, K-12 educators will be invited to a 3-day Summer Institute.  A "What Works" conference will provide an annual culminating event with attendees from the national community.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Regionally, New York City pre-service and in-service teachers, as well as school administrators will be invited to attend a 3-day Summer Institute designed to further equitable teaching practices that enhance student achievement.  At the local level, in New York City Region 3, Queens Borough teachers and school administrators and community-based organizations will hold one-day symposia to focus on innovative strategies that promote gender equity in and out of the classroom. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit. The proposed project disseminates findings and methods developed across five successful experimental programs (all variations of "Sisters in Science") that yielded detailed curricula and evaluation methods.   The PI, as Queens' College Dean of Education, has the endorsement of the New York City Public Schools Region 3 to provide professional development workshops for credit to teachers in 75 schools serving 125,000 students.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts.  The project brings together educators and researchers in order to address gender inequalities that exist within the educational system.  It will impact areas of national concern:  the need to foster gender-equitable and inclusive practices in K-12 schools, the need to promote science and mathematics achievement for all students, awareness of model approaches to professional development in gender-equitable education, raised awareness and discussion of the need for change in policies, and, ultimately, the need to broaden the participation of females in science-based careers. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
