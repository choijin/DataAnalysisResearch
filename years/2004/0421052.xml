<AbstractNarration>Proposal No.     CTS-0421052&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:   T. Huang, Lafayette College&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant will facilitate the purchase of instruments to enhance undergraduate research projects and expand the pedagogical capabilities in the area of nano-scale surface science at Lafayette College.  A multi-mode scanning probe microscope (SPM) and a profile analysis tensiometer will be acquired.  The combination of these two instruments will allow investigation of a variety of interfacial phenomena at the air-liquid, liquid-liquid, liquid-solid and air-solid interfaces. The tensiometer will be used to examine the micro-rheology and dynamics of ultrathin films (both modified and unmodified) at the air-liquid and liquid-liquid interfaces.  The SPM has atomic force, scanning tunneling, and electrochemical capabilities and will be used to study biologically- and chemically-modified surfaces at the liquid-solid and air-solid interfaces.  As research tools, the new instruments will foster interdisciplinary collaborations between the engineering disciplines and chemical sciences, and enable faculty members in the Chemistry and Chemical Engineering departments to further their research and to provide additional research opportunities for undergraduate students.  As pedagogical tools, the instruments will be used in classroom laboratory settings as a platform to discuss current trends and topics in interface science and nanotechnology and to offer students hands-on experience and training with state-of-the-art instrumentation.  In an effort to better educate and train students and prepare them for future careers in the scientific and technology sector, Lafayette is exploring the possibility of offering a Nanotechnology Minor within the engineering and physical science departments.  Because nanotechnology is a broad area of research that encompasses almost all the scientific fields, Lafayette College will utilize current faculty expertise in surface science and biologically- modified surfaces and concentrate on becoming a leader in undergraduate research in nanoscale surface science. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
