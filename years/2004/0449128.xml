<AbstractNarration>Abstract for: &lt;br/&gt;Model-Based Simulation of Wind Turbine Inflow Turbulence and Design Loads: An Integrative Plan&lt;br/&gt;for Research and Learning, CMS  0449128&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: Lance Manuel, University of Texas, Austin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An understanding of the spatial structure of the three-dimensional inflow wind velocity field is important&lt;br/&gt;for the safe design of wind turbines. Current attempts at characterizing this inflow turbulence in design&lt;br/&gt;guidelines are overly conservative and have not been developed following field studies of turbine&lt;br/&gt;performance and simultaneous recording of associated wind conditions (because such tests are expensive).&lt;br/&gt;Also, today's guidelines recommend design loads based on inflow coherence spectral models that have&lt;br/&gt;been shown to be inconsistent with measurements, especially for spatial separations on the order of rotor&lt;br/&gt;diameters and smaller. Moreover, the design guidelines do not employ turbine aerodynamic and structural&lt;br/&gt;dynamic response simulations of sufficiently long durations to match the desired return periods (on the&lt;br/&gt;order of 20 years) typical for ultimate and fatigue limit states. Clearly, there is a need for more field test&lt;br/&gt;programs and efficient modeling procedures to accurately describe the inflow and turbine response so as to&lt;br/&gt;arrive at more accurate design loads.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The proposed career development plan addresses each of the issues raised. First, it offers a novel untried&lt;br/&gt;approach to characterizing the inflow turbulence random field by extracting spatially preferred "modes"&lt;br/&gt;that describe the inflow using empirical orthogonal decomposition of wind velocity statistics and spectra&lt;br/&gt;derived directly from newly available field measurements. Second, it offers an efficient procedure to make&lt;br/&gt;more realistic the possibility of carrying out long-duration aerodynamic simulations for turbine response&lt;br/&gt;while utilizing the decomposition of the inflow structure. Finally, it proposes a framework, based on&lt;br/&gt;structural reliability and response surface concepts, for deriving design loads by combining inflow&lt;br/&gt;characterization with turbine response statistics conditional on inflow.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed plan blends the use of extensive field data with simulation studies in addressing an&lt;br/&gt;important problem that could lead to more economical wind turbine designs and sustain the continued&lt;br/&gt;harvesting of wind as a renewable energy source.&lt;br/&gt;To summarize, at the heart of the proposed research plan are, in order, the following tasks:&lt;br/&gt;(i) development of efficient modeling techniques for characterizing the random spatial structure of&lt;br/&gt;wind inflow using field data - this will yield principal orthogonal preferred spatial "modes" that&lt;br/&gt;optimally describe the wind field;&lt;br/&gt;(ii) characterizing turbine response for the preferred spatial turbulence modes identified in (i) using&lt;br/&gt;turbine aerodynamic simulations; and&lt;br/&gt;(iii) establishing a probabilistic (structural reliability-based) framework that integrates (i) and (ii) to&lt;br/&gt;permit derivation of design ultimate and fatigue loads using simulations long enough to&lt;br/&gt;realistically reflect return periods on the order of 20 years.&lt;br/&gt;Research, education, and outreach activities that relate to this plan are outlined in this proposal.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;An important point that needs to be made is that despite the tremendous growth in wind energy in the U.S.,&lt;br/&gt;our nation is seriously short of trained engineers in this field and routinely has to seek technical/consulting&lt;br/&gt;assistance from Western Europe. This needs to change, and this career development plan will present some&lt;br/&gt;ideas the PI has to provide such training opportunities to our undergraduate and graduate students including&lt;br/&gt;internship opportunities that will be facilitated by this plan, K-12 involvement, and curriculum&lt;br/&gt;enhancements that the PI has planned. This research study will, it is expected, offer a learning experience&lt;br/&gt;as well for individuals of various backgrounds: graduate and undergraduate research assistants, middle/high&lt;br/&gt;students and teachers, and university students in the PI's undergraduate engineering statistics course and in&lt;br/&gt;a planned graduate wind engineering course. Details related to these activities are outlined in this proposal.&lt;br/&gt;Two significant entities that have expressed their support for the success of this plan include&lt;br/&gt;(a) Sandia National Laboratories, who will provide the field data for the efforts outlined and will also&lt;br/&gt;provide summer research internship positions to five undergraduate minority students; and&lt;br/&gt;(b) the PI's institution's Equal Opportunity in Engineering (EOE) program, who will facilitate the&lt;br/&gt;involvement of an underrepresented/minority student in this research.&lt;br/&gt;Letters of commitment from both these organizations are included in the "Supplementary Documents"&lt;br/&gt;section of this proposal outlining their support.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
