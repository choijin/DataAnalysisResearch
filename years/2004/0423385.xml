<AbstractNarration>This is the fourth stage of the Arctic LTER (ARC) located at the Toolik Lake Field Station, Alaska, where the ecology of tundra, streams, and lakes is studied to understand controls on ecosystem structure and function within the long-term goal of predicting the effects of environmental change. Research has been ongoing at the station since the 1970s, with the LTER project focusing on the biogeochemical components of a series of connected streams and lakes that collectively flow into and affect Toolik Lake, as well as the adjacent headwaters region of the Kuparuk River. Extensive variability exists among the various terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems in the study area, but all are linked via water and materials transport. The goal for this next phase of ARC is to understand changes in the Arctic system at catchment and landscape scales through enhanced knowledge of these linkages and interactions. Research will identify and quantify intra- and inter-system linkages, determine controls of the linkages and how they will be affected by a changing environment, and predict how the entire landscape will respond to environmental change. A suite of biogeochemical studies will target the interactions among the component terrestrial, stream, lake ecosystems within this landscape. Short-term studies will focus on specific materials to better understand inputs, climate drivers and transformations of materials. Long-term studies will investigate effects of changes in species composition, temperature, light and nutrients on four types of tundra and the effects of nutrient loading and climate variability. Lake studies will focus on landscape-to-lake linkages to understand controls of terrestrial patchiness on productivity patterns in lakes. Researchers will also examine in-lake processes and their relations to watershed inputs of nutrients and dissolved organic matter. Objectives are to measure pelagic and benthic production and coupling, illucidate food web structures, and determine how watershed-stream-lake linkages regulate transformations in water chemistry and patterns of productivity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts center around the use of ARC research results to address the important societal goal of predicting responses of Arctic ecosystems to environmental change. Data and insights will be provided to Federal and State officials regulating the development of oil and gas on the Alaskan North Slope. A collaborative undergraduate/graduate course will be held for two weeks in the summers, with undergraduate students trained in the field along with graduate students from ten universities. The MBL's Science Journalism Course facilitates journalist visits to Toolik Lake. The ARC LTER Schoolyard project involves a majority of Native Alaskan students. K-12 students conduct and observe local field experiments similar to those at Toolik Lake. Finally, participating ARC scientists actively engage students, residents and local community officials in the region by presenting volunteer lectures on science topics.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Intellectual Merit:  The arctic region has warmed significantly over the past 30 years and arctic lands and freshwaters are already changing in response.  Satellite views show a general "greening" of the arctic landscape as the tundra vegetation changes.  Measurements on the ground show increases in plant abundance and changes in animal abundance.  There are also changes in amounts of greenhouse gases released from the tundra over large regions such as the North Slope of Alaska.  Working at one site in northern Alaska since 1975, the Arctic LTER project and its predecessors have followed the effects of climate change by measuring such things as plant and animal abundances in tundra and freshwater ecosystems.  The project has also carried out experiments by making small changes in temperature and the nutrients reaching tundra, lake, and stream ecosystems.  With these experiments, that in many ways anticipate the future, the project scientists gain understanding of the long-term changes that may happen at this research site.  The goal of the project for 2004-2010 was: "To understand changes in the arctic system in river-basins and large landscapes through knowledge of the linkages and interactions among ecosystems."  Major findings include:  The discovery that high concentrations of the greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide and methane, dissolve in groundwater and are transported to streams and rivers and then are released to the atmosphere.  This key process was missing from our previous carbon budgets in arctic landscapes.  This finding has led to similar discoveries in ecosystems around the world. Continuous addition of a rare type of nitrogen to streams, a method for measurement of nitrogen cycling in flowing waters, was first developed at the Arctic LTER and is now used throughout the world to find out about what happens to pollutant nitrogen released to streams from farms and cities.   Because photosynthesis by tiny algae in surface water is low in arctic lakes, the fish that are a major food for native peoples must depend on the photosynthesis by algae living on the bottom of shallow lakes.   Small amounts of phosphate added to streams to raise the concentration by 300 parts per billion revealed an unexpected sensitivity of the species diversity of arctic streams.  Even tiny changes in nutrients change the whole ecosystem from one based on algae attached to rocks in the stream to one based on a thick cover of moss.  Arctic plant ecology in the 20th century focused on plant adaptation to the physical environment: cold temperatures, light, and soil moisture.  Our discovery that only low levels of nutrients were available in soil and that plants competed for nutrients, water, and light has transformed our approach to arctic plant ecology.. The discovery that tundra plants derive much of their N supply from a beneficial relationship (symbiosis) between plant roots and fungi (mushrooms) has transformed our understanding of nutrient cycling and nutrient limitation for tundras and forests, worldwide. Warming of the Arctic is causing increasing thawing of permanently frozen ground; the result is the creation of sinks and slumps in the land surface that are hot spots of erosion, of release of nutrients into rivers, and of decomposition of ancient organic carbon.    Broader Impacts: The scientific impacts of this research are much broader than improvement of our ability to predict the future of arctic ecosystems in Northern Alaska.  First, long-term change is of broad theoretical and empirical interest in ecology. The landscape near Toolik Lake, Alaska is an excellent model system for analysis of how ecosystems change at different rates and in different places, and much of what we have learned about the Arctic is relevant in other types of ecosystem.  Second, our work at Toolik Lake provides a detailed view of how responses of tundra and freshwater ecosystems to climate change can actually feed back on the factors that originally caus...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
