    <AbstractNarration>Title: Implementation of a Self-Evaluation Indicator System and&lt;br/&gt;Academic Indicator Report for NSF's HBCU-UP &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Systemic Research, Inc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HRD - 0400932&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: Jason Kim&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Systemic Research, Inc. will continue the implementation of a Self-Evaluation Indicator System (SEIS) and Academic Indicator Report (AIR) for the National Science Foundation's (NSF) Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP). Systemic Research has successfully completed a 24 month grant (11/1/01 - 10/31/03), "Development and Implementation of an Indicator Monitoring System for NSF's Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program" (HRD-0136117) to design, develop, and implement SEIS and AIR.&lt;br/&gt;SEIS is an instrument designed to collect both quantitative and qualitative progress indicators, and AIR presents both HBCU-UP individual institutions' and overall progress report based on SEIS. Each year Systemic Research will develop and deliver a customized annual SEIS instrument to each individual HBCU-UP site, host a SEIS workshop, compile collected SEIS data to produce AIR, conduct two site visits to gather additional information to publish case stories, and manage the SEIS web management system and HBCU-UP Open Forum. Other activities will include presentations at NSF PI/PD meetings, and participating in the HBCU-UP National Research Conference.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The customized SEIS will provide common measures of performance across all HBCU-UP projects while considering uniqueness of each institution. The site visits and case stories will identify best practice models. Systemic Research will provide comprehensive technical assistance to HBCU-UP sites regarding academic indicator management and evaluation capacity building through numerous workshops, site visits, and on-going communication. Individual institutions' AIRs will be returned to the respective institutions for their on-going project review.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;For wide dissemination and broad impact, all publications will be available in three different formats; printed copy, CD-ROM, and web-based publications. The AIR overall progress report, program highlights, and case stories will be disseminated nation-wide. Systemic Research will provide technical assistance to both implementation and planning HBCU-UP grantees. The program impact and best practice models will be disseminated to the HBCU community, higher education institutions, education and research communities, other stakeholders and federal agencies.</AbstractNarration>
