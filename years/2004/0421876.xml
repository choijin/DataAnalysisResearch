<AbstractNarration>The American Chemical Society has partnered over the past several years with NSF, EPA, and other federal funding agencies to support an annual Green Chemistry and Engineering Conference. The topic of this meeting focuses on the design, development, and implementation of chemical processes and products that reduce or eliminate the use and generation of hazardous substances in a way that is both feasible and economically viable.  Green chemistry and engineering are important tools in preventing pollution at the source and in providing solutions to long-term global challenges.&lt;br/&gt;Student scholarships will be provided by this NSF funding for participation in the 8th Annual Green Chemistry and Engineering conference on June 28-30, 2004 at the National Academies in Washington, DC.  The theme of the meeting is "Green Chemistry and Engineering:  The Business Imperative for Sustainability."  The program will emphasize the business case for green chemistry and engineering.  Case studies will highlight innovations in green chemistry and engineering that have been successfully implemented and will explore what needs to be done to further the adoption of these technologies in business. Topics involving fundamental scientific and engineering advances related to green chemistry will be presented by faculty and student participants.   Technical talks will be given in such areas as alternative solvents, catalysis, and benign synthesis and processing.  &lt;br/&gt;A diverse group of students from geographical locations across the United States has received scholarships through NSF funding to attend these meetings.  Over 90% of the students have been involved in oral or poster presentations.  Students have an excellent opportunity to learn about the newest research developments in their areas, dialog with other academic, industrial, and governmental researchers, and advance their participation in professional societies.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
