<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research develops theory and techniques for monitoring and diagnosing faults, hazards or, more gener-ally,&lt;br/&gt;functional changes in dynamic systems and networks, under limited and possibly corrupted information. We present&lt;br/&gt;a unifying and multifaceted approach to this problem that decomposes the large body of fault diagnosis research into six&lt;br/&gt;topics: (i) deterministic fault diagnosis, (ii) model-based probabilistic diagnosis, (iii) adaptive and sequential diagnosis,&lt;br/&gt;(iv) distributed system-level diagnosis with communication constraints in wired/wireless networks, (v) fault diagnosis&lt;br/&gt;via distributed belief propagation algorithms, and (vi) model-independent diagnosis. The research team will leverage&lt;br/&gt;its expertise in the areas of fault diagnosis, sequential detection, system-level diagnosis, distributed control, modeling,&lt;br/&gt;analysis and performance evaluation, applied probability, graph theory, belief propagation and model reduction to the&lt;br/&gt;problem of detecting, identifying and localizing faults and abnormalities in dynamically evolving environments. Beyond&lt;br/&gt;intellectual value, the research program proposed will have broader impacts in a variety of ways.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: Networks and networked systems are increasingly solidifying their roles as building blocks of the&lt;br/&gt;nation's economic and social foundation. Numerous emerging commercial, governmental, medical, military and security&lt;br/&gt;applications are vitally dependent on these systems, creating a growing need for ensuring that these critical infrastructures&lt;br/&gt;are reliable and trustworthy in spite of malicious or non-malicious disruptions. Building trustworthy networked systems&lt;br/&gt;using off-the-shelf components and software presents a significant hurdle that needs to be overcome in order to exploit the&lt;br/&gt;full potential of networked systems. The proposed project outlines a synergistic and comprehensive approach for scalable&lt;br/&gt;methodologies for diagnosing faults, adversarial behavior and threats in complex systems and networks, under uncertain&lt;br/&gt;information and possibly in the presence of communication errors and constraints. The successful completion of this&lt;br/&gt;project will make a substantial and timely contribution to the National Priority Area of National and Homeland Security&lt;br/&gt;(NHS) because of its ramifications in the monitoring, testing, and reliable and secure operation of networked systems,&lt;br/&gt;communication networks, and complex digital systems. The development of distributed algorithms for fault diagnosis&lt;br/&gt;and the resulting overall enhancement of distributed systems in ways that make them more reliable also contributes&lt;br/&gt;to the National Priority Area of Advanced Science and Engineering (ASE). The integration of data models, distributed&lt;br/&gt;algorithms, system dynamics, control and decision making is aligned with the technical focus area of data, models and&lt;br/&gt;communications (dmc), and the development of critical support mechanisms for reliable operation of complex dynamic&lt;br/&gt;systems and networks is aligned with the technical focus area of integration of computing (int).&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The intellectual merit of this proposal lies in the synergistic and comprehensive exploration of dif-ferent&lt;br/&gt;dimensions within the broad area of detection and identification of faults or, more generally, abnormal behavior in&lt;br/&gt;complex dynamic systems and networks. The ultimate goal is to develop appropriate models and innovative distributed&lt;br/&gt;algorithms that integrate and unify techniques from a number of diverse disciplines, including fault diagnosis in discrete&lt;br/&gt;event systems, detection and estimation, graph theory and optimization, distributed system-level diagnosis, belief propa-gation,&lt;br/&gt;model reduction and information theory. Apart from advancing the forefront of the various individual approaches&lt;br/&gt;to diagnosis, the overarching theme is the integration of these ideas into a well-defined approach that achieves the ad-vantages&lt;br/&gt;of both deterministic and probabilistic methodologies via scalable models and algorithms. While extending the&lt;br/&gt;frontiers in the broad area of fault diagnosis in complex dynamic systems and networks, this research will at the same&lt;br/&gt;time leverage the applicability of these techniques to the design of test platforms for experimenting with distributed fault&lt;br/&gt;diagnosis in ad-hoc mobile networks and fault localization in indoor sensor networks.&lt;br/&gt;Educational Impact and Outreach: The main educational goals of this program are two-fold: (i) To develop courses&lt;br/&gt;and educational materials that discuss systematic approaches for algorithms and architectures for fault diagnosis and&lt;br/&gt;tolerance in complex systems and networks. For example, Web-based lectures on special topics of interest will be&lt;br/&gt;established for practicing engineers in the field; a senior/graduate level course on this topic will be developed; a central&lt;br/&gt;Web-page will be maintained at the University of Illinois to disseminate new results within the members of the team as&lt;br/&gt;well as to the broader scientific and research community. (ii) To continue to actively recruit and mentor participants from&lt;br/&gt;underrepresented groups in our respective research programs.&lt;br/&gt;1</AbstractNarration>
