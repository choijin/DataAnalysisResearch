<AbstractNarration>The proposed workshop will provide a forum that promotes the interaction of researchers in the areas of wavelets and splines. While the study of spline functions is a well established subject of investigation, which has become an interdisciplinary research area during the past three or four decades, the subject of wavelets was born only about twenty years ago. However,  the only known  compactly supported functions with analytical formulation that generate a multiresolution approximation are the cardinal B-splines. Furthermore, the B-spline refinement symbols play the central role in the construction of Daubechies' wavelets, by assuring the convergence of certain infinite products that constitute the Fourier transform of the Daubechies scaling functions and the order of smoothness of these functions, as building blocks of the MRA's. This close relationship between splines and wavelets is the root of the need for the interaction between these two interdisciplinary areas of mathematical research. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This conference on the interaction between wavelets and splines will bring together the leading experts of these two fields to exchange ideas, assess the state-of-the-art, and define the trends of future research problems that benefit both interdisciplinary areas. What is more important is that such a conference will be greatly beneficial to the young reserchers and the under-previleged groups, who would have very limited opportunities, if any at all, to interact with the leading experts of both subjects under the same roof. This proposed concerence will take place in the University of Georgia from 16-19, 2005.</AbstractNarration>
