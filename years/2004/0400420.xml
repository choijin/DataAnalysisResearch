<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Wolf&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator proposes seven intertwined research projects, all on the &lt;br/&gt;interface between group theory and geometry.  For the most part these &lt;br/&gt;proposals are geometrically motivated approaches to specific problems in &lt;br/&gt;modern harmonic analysis connected to the representation theory of semi-&lt;br/&gt;simple Lie groups.  The first is an approach to construction and analysis &lt;br/&gt;of singular unitary representations of real reductive Lie groups, in two &lt;br/&gt;steps: (i) geometric construction of those representations, as Frechet &lt;br/&gt;space representations on cohomology of homogeneous vector bundles over &lt;br/&gt;flag domains, and (ii) transforming the representation space to a space of&lt;br/&gt;functions on a Stein manifold defined by a system of differential equations,&lt;br/&gt;by means of a double fibration transform (the complex Penrose transform &lt;br/&gt;is a particular case) from the flag domain to its linear cycle space.  The &lt;br/&gt;second project is an approach to construction and analysis of unitary and &lt;br/&gt;other representations for a class of infinite dimensional Lie groups, the &lt;br/&gt;direct limits of finite dimensional Lie groups, especially strict direct &lt;br/&gt;limits of finite dimensional real and complex reductive Lie groups, both &lt;br/&gt;in the analytic category and in the algebraic category.  The third project &lt;br/&gt;is to complete the investigator's work on the Harish-Chandra Schwartz space &lt;br/&gt;of a general semisimple Lie group, by synthesizing structural analyses of &lt;br/&gt;the relative Schwartz spaces.  The investigator's fourth project is to &lt;br/&gt;extend the notion of Dirac cohomology to a notion of partial Dirac&lt;br/&gt;cohomology so that it applies to all the representations of a semisimple&lt;br/&gt;Lie group that appear in the Plancherel formula.  The fifth project is to&lt;br/&gt;extend the investigator's isospectral group method from the setting of &lt;br/&gt;spherical space forms to the setting of locally symmetric Riemannian spaces.&lt;br/&gt;The sixth project is to investigate certain restrictions of discrete series&lt;br/&gt;representations to a class of subgroups of great geometric interest.  And,&lt;br/&gt;seventh, the investigator will continue his development of a method for &lt;br/&gt;direct reading of the character and growth properties (asymptotics) of &lt;br/&gt;admissible representations of finite dimensional real reductive Lie groups &lt;br/&gt;from the basic data that specify their construction on cohomology spaces of &lt;br/&gt;homogeneous vector bundles over flag domains.  One goal here is to do this &lt;br/&gt;in such a way that is directly applicable to the first and second projects.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These seven research projects all depend on the use of symmetry to clarify&lt;br/&gt;analytic (and in one case geometric) problems.  Traditionally symmetry&lt;br/&gt;considerations are used to simplify matters by decreasing the number of&lt;br/&gt;variables, but here they are used to enable the use of insight, tools and&lt;br/&gt;results from geometry and analysis.  The symmetries are embodied in group &lt;br/&gt;theory, which is the algebraic abstraction of the notion of symmetry.  But &lt;br/&gt;modern Lie group theory incorporates classical analysis (calculus, &lt;br/&gt;differential equations...) and is closely tied to the geometry (Riemannian, &lt;br/&gt;symplectic, Kaehler, ...)  of the configurations on which the groups act as &lt;br/&gt;symmetries.  An important aspect of this synthesis of geometry and analysis &lt;br/&gt;is a geometric form of quantization that is particularly well suited to the &lt;br/&gt;sorts of finite dimensional groups considered in several of the projects.  &lt;br/&gt;This geometric quantization, originally inspired by physics and developed &lt;br/&gt;in some detail by mathematicians, has in turn been very useful in a variety &lt;br/&gt;of settings in mathematics and physics.  This is very much the case in six &lt;br/&gt;of the seven projects, where the geometric quantization is combined with &lt;br/&gt;modern differential geometry to understand various analytic problems.  This &lt;br/&gt;is especially evident in the first and fourth projects, whose objectives &lt;br/&gt;can be viewed as a sort of dequantization.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
