    <AbstractNarration>The Nelder-Mead ``simplex'' method, first published in 1965,&lt;br/&gt;is one of the world's most popular techniques for unconstrained&lt;br/&gt;minimization of nonlinear functions without using derivatives;&lt;br/&gt;Nelder-Mead lies at the heart of hundreds, probably thousands,&lt;br/&gt;of scientific and engineering applications that involve&lt;br/&gt;optimization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The virtues of the Nelder-Mead method include simplicity of&lt;br/&gt;description and implementation, and excellent ``best case''&lt;br/&gt;behavior, especially in achieving rapid improvement with&lt;br/&gt;a relatively small number of function values. Its flaws&lt;br/&gt;include stagnation or failure, typically slow and painful.&lt;br/&gt;And, despite almost 40 years of widespread use, its&lt;br/&gt;fundamental nature remains unclear and even mysterious.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research aims to improve understanding of&lt;br/&gt;the Nelder-Mead method in both theory and practice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No theoretical convergence results for the original&lt;br/&gt;Nelder-Mead method were obtained until 1998, and its&lt;br/&gt;known theory today is limited (to dimensions one and&lt;br/&gt;two) as well as relatively, perhaps unavoidably, weak.&lt;br/&gt;It is almost embarrassing that the mathematical and&lt;br/&gt;convergence properties of this nearly ubiquitous, seemingly&lt;br/&gt;simple method are not fully settled. In attempting to&lt;br/&gt;produce the needed theory, the proposed research will apply&lt;br/&gt;tools like discrete dynamical systems and characterization of&lt;br/&gt;geometric properties, which are nonstandard in analysis of&lt;br/&gt;unconstrained optimization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since non-derivative optimization methods have been&lt;br/&gt;developed in the last 15 years that possess essentially&lt;br/&gt;complete theories, one might wonder why it is worthwhile&lt;br/&gt;to study the Nelder-Mead method. The reason is that,&lt;br/&gt;despite its lack of known theoretical underpinnings,&lt;br/&gt;Nelder-Mead very often produces a good enough answer&lt;br/&gt;more rapidly than its competitors. But Nelder-Mead does&lt;br/&gt;not consistently work well---its performance is sometimes&lt;br/&gt;excellent, sometimes terrible---and the reasons for this&lt;br/&gt;variation have not been examined in detail. A second part&lt;br/&gt;of the proposed research is to explore what happens (and&lt;br/&gt;why) to the method on a large, carefully selected set of&lt;br/&gt;test problems. A hope is that ``Nelder-Mead-like'' methods&lt;br/&gt;will emerge that retain the flavor and desirable properties&lt;br/&gt;of the original but overcome its worst flaws.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Given the popularity of the Nelder-Mead method, the result&lt;br/&gt;of the research should be improved non-derivative optimization&lt;br/&gt;methods that are capable of reliably solving a variety of&lt;br/&gt;scientific and engineering problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator was one of the first to prove&lt;br/&gt;theoretical results about the original Nelder-Mead method&lt;br/&gt;and to focus attention on the Nelder-Mead method, which&lt;br/&gt;was scorned or ignored for many years by the mainstream&lt;br/&gt;optimization community. While at Bell Labs, she gained&lt;br/&gt;practical experience by implementing the Nelder-Mead&lt;br/&gt;method in a successful product (the ``WISE'' tool for&lt;br/&gt;wireless system design).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because the Nelder-Mead method is easy to visualize and&lt;br/&gt;explain, it is an obvious candidate for Web-based dissemination&lt;br/&gt;of animations and explanatory material that can be used in&lt;br/&gt;graduate and undergraduate education, as well as by&lt;br/&gt;practitioners, in science, engineering, and medicine.</AbstractNarration>
