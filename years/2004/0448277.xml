<AbstractNarration> From the very early years of computer science it has been clear that&lt;br/&gt;computational problems vary greatly in difficulty, ranging from easy to&lt;br/&gt;moderately hard to intractably hard to outright unsolvable.  &lt;br/&gt;Computational complexity theory is the branch of computer science that&lt;br/&gt;seeks to rigorously and mathematically study the inherent difficulty of&lt;br/&gt;computational problems, measured as the amount of a certain resource (or&lt;br/&gt;resources) required for their solution, and organize problems into&lt;br/&gt;classes based on their inherent difficulty.  Examples of relevant&lt;br/&gt;resources include processing time, storage space and inter-computer&lt;br/&gt;communication.  Communication complexity involves the latter&lt;br/&gt;resource and asks how many bits must be communicated between different&lt;br/&gt;computers to solve a problem whose input is split between these&lt;br/&gt;computers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is plenty of intrinsic interest in communication complexity,&lt;br/&gt;because of the large variety of Internet-driven applications where it is&lt;br/&gt;relevant. In addition, over the last decade and a half, communication&lt;br/&gt;complexity has been emerging as an area that unites many seemingly&lt;br/&gt;disparate areas of theoretical computer science some of which do not&lt;br/&gt;directly involve communication; examples are circuit complexity, query&lt;br/&gt;complexity, quantum computing, algorithmic game theory, optimization and&lt;br/&gt;distributed computing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In recent years, information theory has proved itself to be a powerful&lt;br/&gt;tool in the study of communication complexity, and therefore in the&lt;br/&gt;various other areas of complexity theory that communication impacts. I&lt;br/&gt;have already explored this theme in my recent work and was an author of&lt;br/&gt;a recent paper that formally introduced the concept of information&lt;br/&gt;complexity and described its relation to communication complexity.&lt;br/&gt;Other subsequent work of mine has applied information theoretic&lt;br/&gt;techniques to prove theorems about communication complexity and applied&lt;br/&gt;these theorems in turn to explore the inherent difficulty of problems&lt;br/&gt;not directly involving communication.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main goal of this project is to continue this line of work in two&lt;br/&gt;ways. First, I shall continue to develop and extend what I call the&lt;br/&gt;information complexity framework and attempt to apply it to models of&lt;br/&gt;computation where it hasn't yet been applied successfully. A noteworthy&lt;br/&gt;subgoal of the first goal will be to use this framework to understand&lt;br/&gt;the limitations of quantum computation. Second, I shall seek to study&lt;br/&gt;certain concrete problems in communication complexity that have known&lt;br/&gt;connections to other areas of complexity theory. Two specific areas I&lt;br/&gt;shall focus on are (1) the complexity of data stream computations and&lt;br/&gt;(2) circuit complexity, with an emphasis on the power of shallow&lt;br/&gt;circuits. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
