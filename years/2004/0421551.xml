<AbstractNarration>Understanding,  predicting,  and  preventing  collapse  have  always  been  major  objectives  of  earthquake &lt;br/&gt;engineering.  Collapse is the main source of injuries and loss of lives.  Thus, it constitutes an engineering &lt;br/&gt;limit  state  that  needs  to  be  predicted  in  order  to  evaluate,  in  a  probabilistic  format,  the  life  safety &lt;br/&gt;performance level, which is of primary societal concern.  In the context of earthquake risk management, a &lt;br/&gt;process  is  needed  that  permits  a  rigorous  assessment  of  the  probability  of  collapse  to  make  informed &lt;br/&gt;decisions in the best interest of society.  In the context of earthquake resistant design, this process needs &lt;br/&gt;to be simplified so that the engineering profession can use engineering techniques, which are based on &lt;br/&gt;parameters  such  as  strength,  stiffness,  and  ductility  (deformability),  to  derive  structural  properties  that &lt;br/&gt;comply with specified targets for a required level of collapse safety, or a tolerable probability of collapse. &lt;br/&gt;This project will address both contexts.  It will provide a methodology and reliable data for predicting a &lt;br/&gt;critical mode of collapse, namely that associated with sidesway instability in which an individual story (or &lt;br/&gt;a series of stories) displaces sufficiently so that the second order P-delta effects fully offset the first order &lt;br/&gt;story  shear  resistance  and  dynamic  instability  occurs,  i.e.,  the  structural  system  loses  its  gravity  load &lt;br/&gt;resistance.  Prediction of this mode of collapse is a challenging problem because structural components &lt;br/&gt;will deteriorate in strength and stiffness before the collapse limit state is reached, and great uncertainties &lt;br/&gt;are associated with the description of the seismic input and of the parameters that control the response of &lt;br/&gt;structures close to collapse. &lt;br/&gt;The methodology will  be  based  on  a  combination  of  analytical  and  experimental  simulations,  with the &lt;br/&gt;former being carried out at Stanford University and the main effort of the latter, a shaking table collapse &lt;br/&gt;test of a model of a steel structure, being carried out at the NEES facility at the University at Buffalo.  &lt;br/&gt;The  outcomes  of  the  proposed  research  will  be  (a)  a methodology  for  predicting  sidesway  collapse of &lt;br/&gt;deteriorating structural systems, (b) an extensive database on deterioration properties of structural steel &lt;br/&gt;and  reinforced  concrete  components,  including  uncertainty  measures  accounting  for  modeling  and &lt;br/&gt;material uncertainties, (c) incorporation of component deterioration models in the OpenSees platform, (d) &lt;br/&gt;documentation of a comprehensive collapse experiment with data that covers the range of response of a 5-&lt;br/&gt;story steel frame structure from elastic behavior to incipient collapse, (e) a methodology for computing &lt;br/&gt;the  probability  of  sidesway  collapse  that  accounts  for  hazard,  ground  motion,  and  structural  (material, &lt;br/&gt;modeling) uncertainties, and (f) engineering recommendations for design for collapse safety. &lt;br/&gt;Intellectural Merit.  The proposed research will lead to seminal advances in understanding and predicting &lt;br/&gt;sidesway collapse of structures subjected to severe earthquakes.  The major challenges are to account for &lt;br/&gt;deterioration in structural behavior in combination with P-delta effect, and for the uncertainties inherent &lt;br/&gt;in ground motion description and in modeling the behavior of the components that control the dynamic &lt;br/&gt;response at large inelastic deformations (or at small deformations in the case of brittle elements).  These &lt;br/&gt;challenges imply extensive modeling efforts at the component and structure level and the incorporation of &lt;br/&gt;reliability  concepts  in  assessing  collapse  safety  of  structures.    Another  major  challenge  will  be  the &lt;br/&gt;planning and execution of a shaking table collapse experiment, whose main purpose is to demonstrate that &lt;br/&gt;collapse  prediction  indeed  is  feasible.    The  research  involves  an  integrated  approach  of  physical &lt;br/&gt;simulations at a NEES site shaking table and computational simulations on the OpenSees platform, while &lt;br/&gt;fully utilizing the simulation, visualization, and collaboration tools of the NEESgrid. &lt;br/&gt;Broader  Impacts  on  Earthquake  Engineering  Research  and  Practice.  The  research  is  motivated  by &lt;br/&gt;professional  needs to  provide  adequate  and consistent  collapse  safety  in  new  designs  and to  assess  the &lt;br/&gt;collapse  hazard  of  existing  structures.   These  needs  require  the  filling  of  knowledge  gaps  that  exist  in &lt;br/&gt;regard to data and tools and the understanding of collapse phenomena.  The impact of the proposed work &lt;br/&gt;on  research  and  practice  will  be  the  development  of  databases,  advanced  deterioration  models,  and &lt;br/&gt;computational tools that will make it feasible to predict the collapse safety of complex structures and will &lt;br/&gt;permit  more  rational  allocation  of  resources  in  the  context  of  performance-based  seismic  risk &lt;br/&gt;management.    The  impact  will  be  felt  in  the  academic  environment  in  teaching  and  research,  in &lt;br/&gt;engineering design offices, and in organizations concerned with risk management.</AbstractNarration>
