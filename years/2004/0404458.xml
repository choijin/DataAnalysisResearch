<AbstractNarration>This proposal was received in response to Nanoscale Science and Engineering Initiative, NSF 03-043, category NIRT (Nanoscale Interdisciplinary Research Team).  A new nanoscale manufacturing technique - nanoscale electromolecular lithography (NEL) is designed for the fabrication of nanoscale patterns on self-assembled molecular resists by using an electric mask.  In this project, the merits of high-speed and scalable top-down engineering techniques will be combined with high-resolution bottom-up self-assembly processes to create a practical, reliable, and robust nano-manufacturing technique for general application.  Molecules will be designed and synthesized with specific recognition elements to direct the formation of low-defect, self-assembled molecular monolayers into pre-programmed patterns.  A planar NEL mask with nanoscale conductive patterns will be brought into electrical contact with the molecular resist, and an electric field will be applied locally to the molecules.  The patterns on the masks will be transferred to the molecular resist by an electrochemical "stamping" process in which the electric field either cleaves a portion of the molecule from the surface or breaks the crosslinks between the molecules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The essence and the recent explosion of nanotechnology research can be traced directly to advances in the ability to manufacture small nanostructures - as small as ten thousandth the diameter of a human hair reproducibly, reliably, and robustly.  Although a wide range of nano-manufacturing techniques has been developed, they all have different intrinsic problems and limitations.  This NIRT project plans to create a practical, reliable, and robust nano-manufacturing technique by using electric field generated by small patterns on a mask to write patterns on molecular resists.  The advances anticipated from the interdisciplinary efforts are at the pioneering forefronts of chemistry, electrochemistry, and engineering.  Given the expertise of the team, there is a plan to apply NEL to the fabrication of nanoscale molecular electric circuits and nanoscale chemical/bio sensors. The confluence of fundamental studies on a problem with commercial potential is the perfect avenue to educate students in state-of-the-art-techniques so that they will become skilled in the advanced practices of their fields.  Additionally, the team will support and expand the current efforts of UCLA researchers to introduce high school students to nanotechnology.</AbstractNarration>
