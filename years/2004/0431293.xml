<AbstractNarration>PROPOSAL NO.:   CTS-0431293&lt;br/&gt;PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATORS:  KARL DREWS&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION:   NATIONAL INST. OF AEROSPACE ASSOCIATES  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FOURTH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON TURBULENCE AND SHEAR FLOW PHENOMENA&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Partial funding is provided for the Fourth International Symposium on Turbulence and Shear Flow Phenomena (TSFP) to be held in Williamsburg VA on June 27-29, 2005.  NSF support will defray the cost of the conference and pay partial travel expenses for graduate students and young researchers.  The workshop is co-funded by NASA Langley Research Center, Office of Naval Research and Air Force Office of Scientific Research, as well as through exhibitors and publishers fees.  The intellectual merit of the symposium involves primarily the exchange of technical information in the important field of turbulent fluid flow.  The Turbulence and Shear Flow Phenomena symposia bring together specialists from fields of turbulence and shear flow phenomena that are of important current topical interest.  The topics emphasized include modeling, measurement and simulation of complex turbulent and transitional flows, environmental and geophysical turbulent flows, multiphase and reacting flows, and biological and biomedical flows.  The size and scope of the symposium is ideally suited for technical exchanges among participants.  The broader impacts of the proposal are as follows.  The Turbulence and Shear Flow Phenomena Symposia in the past have encouraged and have been fortunate to be able to support young investigators in participating in the symposia.  TSFP4 will continue that policy and will use the support form the NSF to partially fund that effort.  The location of the TSFP4 symposium in the mid-Atlantic region of the United States provides the opportunity to impact a large number of such young investigators. The consortium of schools associated with the National Institute of Aerospace (NIA) further enhances ability to reach a broad potential list of contributors, which includes North Carolina A &amp; T State University.  In addition to the proceedings provided to each participant at the time of the symposium, it is customary to select papers presented at the symposium for possible publication in a special issue of an archival journal.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
