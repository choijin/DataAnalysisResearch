<AbstractNarration>                      Abstract&lt;br/&gt;CAREER: Spectral Properties of Hot and Dense QCD Matter (Ralf Rapp) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More than 99% of the mass of matter around us is concentrated in atomic&lt;br/&gt;nuclei, which are made of protons and neutrons. The elementary building&lt;br/&gt;blocks of these (and other ``hadrons") are believed to be (almost)&lt;br/&gt;massless ``quarks" and ``gluons".  However, quarks and gluons have never&lt;br/&gt;been observed in isolation, and their strong interaction is responsible&lt;br/&gt;for generating the masses of the hadrons. The origin of these phenomena&lt;br/&gt;is among the main questions in modern nuclear physics. Under extreme&lt;br/&gt;conditions of temperature and density, hadrons are expected to dissolve&lt;br/&gt;into a new state of matter, the ``Quark-Gluon Plasma", which probably&lt;br/&gt;existed in the early universe a few microseconds after its birth. One of&lt;br/&gt;the key objectives in Dr. Rapp's research plan is to investigate how&lt;br/&gt;hadrons change their spectral properties (such as masses and decay&lt;br/&gt;widths) in hot and dense matter, and how this relates to phase changes&lt;br/&gt;into a Quark-Gluon Plasma. His calculations will be applied to&lt;br/&gt;experiments at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider at Brookhaven&lt;br/&gt;National Laboratory, where gold nuclei are collided at high energy to&lt;br/&gt;recreate, for a short moment, the Quark-Gluon Plasma. To meet the&lt;br/&gt;challenge of identifying signatures of this transient state, Dr. Rapp&lt;br/&gt;will evaluate decay products of unstable particles allowing access to&lt;br/&gt;modifications of their spectral properties. He will pursue similar&lt;br/&gt;approaches to electron scattering experiments off nuclei at Jefferson&lt;br/&gt;Laboratory, as well as to cold dense quark matter which could prevail in&lt;br/&gt;compact stellar objects, so-called neutrons stars.  In addition, Dr.&lt;br/&gt;Rapp will build a vigorous educational program for graduate and&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate students, including continued engagement in the NSF-funded&lt;br/&gt;REU site at the Cyclotron Institute. He will endeavor to broaden the&lt;br/&gt;general interest and education in modern nuclear science via a&lt;br/&gt;``Saturday Morning Physics" program at Texas A&amp;M University for high&lt;br/&gt;school students from a greater area around College Station, which is&lt;br/&gt;particularly suitable to enhance the involvement of minority groups, and&lt;br/&gt;to improve prospective undergraduate enrollment in physics.</AbstractNarration>
