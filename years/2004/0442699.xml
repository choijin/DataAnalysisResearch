<AbstractNarration>October 16-18, 2004, marks the second annual conference of the Interstate Network of Science Programs Integrating Research and Education (INSPIRE) on the University of Southern Mississippi Hattiesburg campus.  This regional conference offers opportunities for the best and brightest undergraduate students in polymers, materials science, and biomaterials science to present their research and their learning experiences with other students and faculty members.  The INSPIRE conference spotlights the most creative and disciplined science students by providing a forum for them to share their research.  Students will be motivated to continue their scientific endeavors by being exposed to research that their peers are performing, and will compete for awards that recognize academic excellence.  Interactions among students and faculty with similar research interests will lead to long-term networking opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the activity include providing an avenue for undergraduates throughout the United States to present their research to their peers.  In addition, the conference offers opportunities for peer interaction, increased self-esteem, refinement of presentation and interpersonal communications skills, and, having the option of participating in professional development workshops.  Intellectual merit components include the sharing and distribution of scientific research among students and faculty from different academic institutions nationwide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
