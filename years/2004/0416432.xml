<AbstractNarration>Elston&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The principal investigator and his colleagues organize the&lt;br/&gt;2004 Gordon Research Conference on Theoretical Biology and&lt;br/&gt;Biomathematics.  The format of the conference is nine formal&lt;br/&gt;sessions, each beginning with an introduction to the field by the&lt;br/&gt;session chair followed by two or three invited talks. In addition&lt;br/&gt;to the formal sessions, there are two afternoon poster sessions.&lt;br/&gt;The session chairs and invited speakers consist of both&lt;br/&gt;established leaders and energetic new investigators who are at the&lt;br/&gt;forefront of quantitative biology.  Consistent with tradition, a&lt;br/&gt;wide variety of topics ranging from spatial modeling in ecology to&lt;br/&gt;biological molecular motors are represented at the conference. &lt;br/&gt;This breadth of topics, which includes biological phenomena&lt;br/&gt;ranging from the molecular level up to the whole organism,&lt;br/&gt;reflects the theme of this year's conference, "multi-scale&lt;br/&gt;biology."  Invited speakers are selected based on their expertise&lt;br/&gt;and accomplishments, while trying to balance gender and minority&lt;br/&gt;representation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The primary goal of this conference is to bring together&lt;br/&gt;established and young investigators from the field of quantitative&lt;br/&gt;biology to share new approaches and discuss advances in this&lt;br/&gt;exciting and rapidly growing area.  The relatively small number of&lt;br/&gt;attendees and informal format of the meeting provide an ideal&lt;br/&gt;setting for germinating new scientific collaborations. This&lt;br/&gt;multidisciplinary conference is crucial for identifying new&lt;br/&gt;challenges and directions in the rapidly growing field of&lt;br/&gt;theoretical biology.  Many graduate students and postdoctoral&lt;br/&gt;fellows are attending this year's meeting.  Therefore, the&lt;br/&gt;conference serves to increase the number of scientists working in&lt;br/&gt;areas of quantitative biology.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
