<AbstractNarration>Earl Wagener, Clemson University, is a Discovery Corps Senior Fellow for the 2004-2005 academic year. Wagener will enhance the graduate and undergraduate experience by facilitating the transition to industrial careers. This project includes a semester-long course covering core research and development career skills, prioritization of research activities, commercialization processes, project value analysis, intellectual property, and job performance reviews. During the second semester, selected graduate and undergraduate students (and their advisors) with interest in industrial careers will also participate in a unique evaluation of their research projects using industrial critical value metrics. In addition, Vice President-level industrial Research and Development leaders will participate in one-day seminar/project evaluation/consulting sessions. This Discovery Corps Senior Fellowship is supported by the Division of Chemistry and the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Discovery Corps Fellowship Program is a pilot program seeking new postdoctoral and professional development models that combine research expertise with professional service.  Discovery Corps Fellows leverage their research expertise through projects that address areas of national need. Their projects enhance research capacity and infrastructure and contribute to workforce development and job creation.  The Discovery Corps Program supports both Postdoctoral Fellows and Senior Fellows.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
