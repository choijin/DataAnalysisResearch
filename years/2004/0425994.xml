<AbstractNarration>OISE 0425994&lt;br/&gt;Krishna Reddy, University of Illinois at Chicago&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This award supports an U.S.-Korea research collaboration involving Professor Krishna Reddy and a graduate student of the University of Illinois at Chicago and Dr. Ji-Won Yang and others of the National Lab for Environmental Remediation of the Korea Advanced Institute of Science &amp; Technology (KAIST). They propose to develop an innovative integrated electrokinetic-bioremediation technology to remediate heavy metal contamination in soils. The Korean team has conducted extensive research on soil and groundwater remediation technologies and has expertise on bioremediation of contaminated soils. They will study biological transformation of heavy metals in conjunction with the use of electrokinetics as delivery system. The PI has extensive research experience with in-situ remediation of contaminated sites and in particular with electrokinetic remediation of soils; he will focus on the electrokinetic aspects of the technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scientific Merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heavy metal contamination is prevalent at numerous sites in the United States and Korea. The specific objectives of the proposed research are (1) investigate biological transformations of heavy metals in soils, (2) investigate electrokinetic transport of nutrients and microorganisms in soils, and (3) investigate biological immobilization of heavy metals in soils through electrokinetically enhanced biostimulation and bioaugmentation. Several fundamental aspects of this technology for the removal of toxic hydrophobic organic compounds from soils are being addressed under Professor Reddy's current NSF research support from the Division of Civil and Mechanical Engineering. CMS-0100073. These objectives will be accomplished by laboratory experiments: (1) to characterize microbial transformation of heavy metals in soils; (2) to assess electrokinetic delivery of nutrients and microbes under different soil conditions; and (3) to investigate efficiency of integrated electrokinetic-enhanced bio-immobilization of heavy metals in different soil conditions. The experimental results will be utilized to develop guidelines for the design and implementation of field-scale systems and to assess long-term implications of the treatment technology. The combined relevant expertise of the US and Korean researchers will facilitate successful completion of the proposed research. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Electrokinetic bio-immobilization has great potential to remediate contaminated sites under difficult subsurface conditions. Numerous sites in the United States and in Korea are contaminated with toxic heavy metals and they require urgent cleanup to protect public health and the environment. Employing natural biological processes is finding widespread public support. Unfortunately, most contaminated sites suffer from the poor bioavailability and mobility of contaminants, as well as increased toxicity. The proposed research will determine the ability of this process to immobilize heavy metals. It also establishes a new collaboration between US and Korean researchers and brings together the relevant expertise to develop an innovative hazardous waste site cleanup technology. Integrated electrokinetic-bioremediation technology has potential to be a simple, efficient and cost-effective in-situ technology to remediate contaminated sites in many countries. Being an in-situ method, this technology can reduce site disturbance during remedial operations, thereby eliminating contaminant exposure of the surrounding environment and the public. Korean participation will be supported by the Korean Science and Engineering Foundation (KOSEF). This project will provide international research training and experience to the PI and to a U.S. graduate student. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
