<AbstractNarration>Bacteria use cell-cell signaling to regulate many physiological functions.  In most cases the process involves the production, release, and detection of extracellular signaling molecules.  While universal signaling themes exist, variations in the design of the extracellular signals, the signal detection apparatuses, and the biochemical mechanisms of signal relay have allowed cell-cell signaling systems to be exquisitely adapted for their varied uses.  Recent studies show that bacterial cell-cell communication occurs both within and between species, and furthermore, that it plays a major role in enabling bacteria to create complex community structures.  Funding is requested to provide partial support for American scientists participating in the second conference sponsored by the American Society for Microbiology entitled "Cell-Cell Communication in Bacteria," to be held in Banff, Alberta, Canada from July 24-27, 2004.  Topics will include i) the production and detection of signals, ii) signaling during development, iii) signaling during pathogenesis and symbioses, iv) inter-generic and inter-kingdom signaling, v) signaling themes from higher organisms, and vi) theoretical approaches to modeling signaling networks.  Inviting scientists that work on higher organisms, will aquaint bacteriologists with eukaryotic chemical signaling paradigms, and will allow them to explore common features that exist in all chemical signaling systems.  By inviting theoretical physicists and mathematicians interested in modeling cell-cell communication circuits, the meeting will provide a venue for much needed interaction between experimental biologists and theoreticians.</AbstractNarration>
