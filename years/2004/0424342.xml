<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;The subject of active measurement is described here in the context of a type of measurement&lt;br/&gt;processes that has become common in engineering and physics, both at the macro scale&lt;br/&gt;and at the nano scale. Active measurement, or active sensing as it may also be called, is&lt;br/&gt;often used to extend the capabilities of sensors having limited dynamic range or the need&lt;br/&gt;for a sequence of preparatory steps. We focus on a class of problems of the type that arise&lt;br/&gt;in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy where the sample must be exposed to&lt;br/&gt;an excitation and the signal-to-noise ratios are very unfavorable. In this setting it often&lt;br/&gt;happens that the measurements must be repeated and averaged over long periods of time&lt;br/&gt;if one is to get a useful result. When these problems are conceptualized as problems of&lt;br/&gt;minimizing the error variance, an unusual range of diffculties present themselves reflecting&lt;br/&gt;the nonlinear nature of the problem. These are the subject of this proposal.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: It is argued here that in a number of areas the basic insights and&lt;br/&gt;mathematical algorithms needed to obtain the most useful conclusions from an existing&lt;br/&gt;experimental apparatus are not yet available. In some cases we can conceptualize the&lt;br/&gt;problem by saying that in the case of stochastic processes, further improvements in the&lt;br/&gt;estimation process depend on determining how to best control the equation governing the&lt;br/&gt;error variance as it shows up in the Kalman-Bucy fiter equations. It is argued here, perhaps&lt;br/&gt;for the first time, that active control of this variance is akin to controlling a certain type&lt;br/&gt;of nonlinear systems in that non commutative effects are of critical importance. In this&lt;br/&gt;proposal we explore this idea in the context of NMR problems and find that when used in&lt;br/&gt;connection with a carefully designed mode selection process it is possible to increase the&lt;br/&gt;signal to noise ratio significantly. We also argue that these questions are best addressed in a&lt;br/&gt;somewhat broader context and the proposal seeks to place them in their natural generality.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The motivation for this work is firmly rooted in real world con-&lt;br/&gt;siderations. For example, for years it has been felt that the problem of determining the&lt;br/&gt;structure of individual proteins is of fundamental importance in understanding a wide&lt;br/&gt;range of diseases and the design of their treatments. NMR spectroscopy is the main tool&lt;br/&gt;for determining protein structure but the current methods are hampered by the fact that&lt;br/&gt;the evidence they provide is noisy and indirect. The current methods for designing the&lt;br/&gt;NMR pulses and processing the resulting data have been developed from experience and&lt;br/&gt;insight, backed up by an excellent understanding of the basic physics of nuclear spin. What&lt;br/&gt;is not well supported by theory is the subsequent signal processing and the interplay be-&lt;br/&gt;tween pulse design and signal processing. An important aspect of this work is to address&lt;br/&gt;this problem and thus make the process of protein structure determination faster and more&lt;br/&gt;accurate. We also point out that there is under development a new nanometer measure-&lt;br/&gt;ment tool that combines aspects of the atomic force microscope with NMR and which is&lt;br/&gt;may also provide a useful window on key questions in protein structure determination.&lt;br/&gt;1</AbstractNarration>
