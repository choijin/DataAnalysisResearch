<AbstractNarration> UTTC has a regional service area and plays a prominent role in professional &lt;br/&gt;development for ND and the BIA. UT-PASS proposes to create a STEM student support system starting &lt;br/&gt;with a Summer Pathways Institute (SPI) a month-long intensive STEM student skill-building program, a &lt;br/&gt;Tribal Environmental Science AAS, Action Research throughout the STEM courses, and improvement in &lt;br/&gt;UTTC.s STEM faculty.s content knowledge and teaching practices. This grant integrates the Peer Led &lt;br/&gt;Team Learning process into STEM instruction. Integration is achieved by professional development and &lt;br/&gt;assistance from the PLTL Facilitator. Andragogical practices encompass state-of-the-art math, science, &lt;br/&gt;and technology instruction and adult learning concepts. UT-PASS faculty work hand in hand with STEM &lt;br/&gt;students and general education instructors to provide enhanced STEM courses at UTTC. Peer teaching &lt;br/&gt;and mentoring are fundamental to this application. Teachers will be trained and then train other &lt;br/&gt;teachers.in pyramidal manner. UT-PASS employs the expertise of regional research institution faculty to &lt;br/&gt;support and mentor STEM faculty. Classroom resources including probeware, software, computers and &lt;br/&gt;printers will be purchased by the grant. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;UT-PASS proposes to educate the whole person employing intensive year-round student support for &lt;br/&gt;STEM students beginning with the SPI. Additionally, the emphasis on research affords the UT-PASS &lt;br/&gt;students ample opportunity to actively research issues important to them or their home reservations. &lt;br/&gt;Intensive and long-term staff development assures UTTC STEM faculty has access to adult learning &lt;br/&gt;principles, content knowledge and teaching methodologies. This staff development and student support &lt;br/&gt;system ensures that UT-PASS students successfully complete the Tribal Environmental Science or other &lt;br/&gt;STEM degree, and either matriculates into a four-year degree program or are hired in the field of &lt;br/&gt;environmental studies.</AbstractNarration>
