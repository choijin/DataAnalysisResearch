<AbstractNarration>Abstract: 0405978 P Lamm, Michigan State University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inverse Problems and their Applications: Deterministic and Statistical Methods for Variable Local Regularization  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project the principal investigator plans to develop&lt;br/&gt;theoretically-sound methods for the practical selection of variable&lt;br/&gt;regularization parameters as part of local regularization methods for&lt;br/&gt;inverse problems.  The PI first proposes to undertake a deterministic&lt;br/&gt;approach to the problem of variable parameter selection via the&lt;br/&gt;coordination of local discrepancy principles and under the assumption&lt;br/&gt;that some local information about data error-level is available.&lt;br/&gt;Parts of this work will entail wavelet-based approximations used in&lt;br/&gt;conjunction with the local regularization ideas. In addition, the PI&lt;br/&gt;plans to study a statistical parameter estimation idea currently being&lt;br/&gt;tested by researchers working on the problem of detecting ozone levels&lt;br/&gt;in the atmosphere, and to give these ideas the theoretical basis they&lt;br/&gt;are currently lacking.  There is hope that powerful new methods for&lt;br/&gt;the selection of variable local regularization parameters, methods not&lt;br/&gt;requiring information about local noise-levels in the data, will&lt;br/&gt;emerge from this work.  As part of the project the PI plans to apply&lt;br/&gt;this new class of methods to the ozone detection problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inverse problems occur widely in many applications, including problems&lt;br/&gt;of biomedical imaging (CT scans and X-rays), image reconstruction&lt;br/&gt;(from satellites or other sources), the detection of ozone levels in&lt;br/&gt;the atmosphere, and geophysical exploration.  While classical methods&lt;br/&gt;exist for for solving such problems, classical methods are often very&lt;br/&gt;inefficient and lead to overly expensive solution techniques.  A&lt;br/&gt;second disadvantage of classical solution methods can be seen in&lt;br/&gt;imaging applications where reconstructed images may have blurred edges&lt;br/&gt;and inadequately detailed features.  The PI has been working to&lt;br/&gt;address these difficulties with the development of new solution&lt;br/&gt;methods based on the ideas of local regularization. The use of these&lt;br/&gt;newer methods can lead to a significant decrease in cost for the&lt;br/&gt;solution of a wide class of practical inverse problems, with improved&lt;br/&gt;resolution of detailed features of solutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
