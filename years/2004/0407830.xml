<AbstractNarration>Computer Science (31)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We define visual learning for science and engineering as the use of images and animations to enable and enhance learning at all levels. These visual learning methods are: opening up new ways of problem solving; providing new ways to think about science and engineering; and enhancing the education and practice of science and engineering &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Visual learning is important in engineering and science because problems are increasingly complex, and visual thinking gives us the ability to understand relationships and behavior in complex situations. Students must learn to think visually and communicate their ideas visually to peers and the general public. However, most science teachers and students know little about visual communication capabilities and techniques, and they can cause misunderstanding through the misuse of shapes, colors, and animation. This is compounded by cultural differences in how students from different parts of the world react to shapes, colors, and other visual representations. Since collaborations are important for gaining further insights into scientific phenomena, learning to understand how other cultures interpret images and communicate visually is often vitally important. McGrath and Brown co-chaired the first interdisciplinary workshop on Visual Learning in Science and Engineering in 2002. Conclusions were that visual thinking is crucial to the future of learning in science and engineering, that a visual language can communicate most effectively in some situations, and that all science and engineering students should have exposure to creating visualizations. This project addresses these conclusions and elaborates on more specific goals and implementation. Further globalization of this work is also essential to obtain the Asian experience. This project refines the ideas from the 2002 workshop and merges them with new views. The resultant white paper is expected to influence future curricula in science and engineering. Both investigators have vast experience in organizing workshops and writing technical reports that are high quality and professional, yet easily read and understood.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
