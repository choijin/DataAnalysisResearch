<AbstractNarration>This  Small  Business  Innovation  Research (SBIR) Phase  I project will  develop  a  micro/nano  fluidic proteomic  platform  for  pathogen  detection  and  identification. The  system  is  based  on  the  use  of high-resolution, two-dimensional (2-D) protein separations in disposable microfluidic chips to generate protein expression maps which may be used to identify biomarker patterns unique to specific pathogens. Effective technologies for the early detection and identification of biological warfare agents are of critical and growing importance. The novel miniaturized  detection  platform  will  be  capable  of  meeting  key  requirements for universal pathogen  detection with the  ability  to  identify  bacterial,  viral,  and  protein toxin  agents in a single detection platform. The system will provide identification within a short 15 minute cycle time, significantly faster than  comparable  microarray  technologies.  Furthermore,  it  will  not  employ  biologically  active reagents for its operation and will not require a priori knowledge of which pathogens may be present in a sample.  If  successful, the proposed technology  will  provide  a  unique  solution  for  rapidly  identifying environmental  pathogens,  with  benefits  for  a  wide  range  of  field-deployable  applications.  Further miniaturization employing nanoscale detection channels with confocal scanning microscopy will enable protein profiling at the single molecule level for ultra-sensitive early pathogen detection. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;In addition to the need for improved pathogen detection for antiterrorism applications, there are over two million emergency response personnel located at over 90,000 public health and safety facilities who are effectively  on  the  front  lines  of  homeland  defense,  and  who  will  directly  benefit  from cost-effective technologies  to  quickly  detect  or  dismiss  potential  biowarfare  threats.  It  is  particularly vital  for  these personnel  to  have  access  to  detection  tools  capable  of  broad  spectrum  pathogen  detection  without  the need  for  priori  knowledge  of  which  pathogens  may  be  present.  In  addition,  rapid,  accurate bacterial identification is critically important in applications outside of biowarfare defense. Industries which will benefit  from  these  developments  include  disease  diagnosis,  prediction  of  emerging  health  hazards, monitoring  potential  food  contamination,  and  bioprocess  regulation.  Furthermore,  the  technology in this effort will offer benefits to the biopharmaceutical industry as a proteomics tool for biomarker identification and drug discovery. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
