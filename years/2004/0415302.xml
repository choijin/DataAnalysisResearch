<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;AST 0415302&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Magnetic fields control the inconstant Sun. The key to understanding solar variability and its direct impact on the Earth rests with understanding all aspects of these magnetic fields. This is the ?dark energy? problem of solar physics since the magnetic fields lie beyond the resolution limits of current solar telescopes, are obscured by Earth's atmosphere, or hidden by the glare of the solar disk in the outer solar atmosphere. The Sun provides the laboratory where crucial properties of non-linear dynamics in highly ionized magnetic plasma can be observed and understood, and models can be tested and refined. The technology now exists to resolve and measure the Sun?s magnetic fields and how they control the solar atmosphere. All aspects of the Advanced Technology Solar Telescope (ATST) design are optimized to study these fields in our astrophysical backyard.  With it, we will understand the life cycle of magnetic fields, how they are born by dynamo mechanisms, evolve by convective and explosive phenomena, and dissipated by resistive and reconnective magnetic events.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ATST will be a 4-m aperture, off-axis solar telescope with integrated adaptive optics, low-scattered light, infrared, coronagraphic, and polarimetric capabilities. It will resolve the essential, fine-scale magnetic features and their dynamics that dictate the varying release of energy from the Sun?s atmosphere. The ATST design is optimized (throughput, scattered light and instrumental polarization properties) to make vector magnetograms down to its diffraction limit (0.03 arcseconds at 500 nm). Its collecting area, which is a factor of 16 greater than today?s solar telescopes, will provide the sensitivity to measure both weak fields and rapidly evolving stronger fields. It has a factor of 64 greater collecting area than the largest existing coronagraph, and will provide the sensitivity and coronagraphic capability needed to measure the weak, fine-scale coronal magnetic fields. The new technologies, and our increased awareness of what we know we must learn, make ATST the necessary and logical successor to the solar telescopes built in the 1960s and 1970s, and is a natural complement to space missions such the Solar Dynamics Observatory, STEREO, and Solar Orbiter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ATST offers tremendous opportunity for the training of students and recruitment of post-docs and faculty in solar physics who will become users of the ATST and the instrument builders and theoreticians of the future. ATST plans to establish a strong synergy with the education and outreach programs at the collaborating institutions, including programs for the K-12 classroom, internships, public outreach through tours, hands-on exhibits, and displays. The ATST program has and will continue to actively involve large segments of the US and international solar physics community, helping to strengthen solar astronomy programs at universities and national centers.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The 4m Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST) will be the most powerful solar telescope and the worldÆs leading ground-based resource for studying solar magnetism that controls the solar wind, flares, coronal mass ejections, and variability in the SunÆs output.  The Sun is the most important astrophysical object to humanity. It uniquely interacts with earth, driving processes in the terrestrial climate, as well as the environmental conditions in space around earth (space weather), which can profoundly impact out planetÆs communications, civil infrastructure, economies and biology. To investigate and ultimately understand and predict solar activity, we need to observe and model the physical processes throughout the solar atmosphere on their intrinsic spatial and temporal scales. The science needs drive a design that supports diffraction-limited imaging and spectropolarimetry of all atmospheric layers from the photosphere to the corona over a range of wavelengths from the visible to the infrared.  The DKIST is a facility designed to provide these critical capabilities and lead to profound improvements in our understanding of solar magnetism. The funding from AST-0415302 provided the resources to complete the designs of the fundamental components of this facility as well as advance the fabrication of the principal subsystems.  The DKIST, directly and in combination with other space- and ground-based instruments, will address many long-standing questions that encapsulate the physics of solar activity and variability that we still donÆt understand but have a good chance of answering in the next few decades with the proper observational and theoretical tools. These questions are:  What heats the solar corona, making the Sun a variable X-ray star? How does the magnetized solar plasma accelerate the solar wind? What triggers solar mass ejections, converting pent up magnetic energy to magnetized clouds of plasma traversing the interplanetary space? How is energy stored and released in solar flares? What role does the ubiquitous magnetic flux play in the solar dynamo process, leading to cyclic variation of magnetic activity?   The study of the Sun guides astronomers in their investigations of other stars, and was a major aspect of solar physics touched on by the New Worlds, New Horizons (NWNH) decadal survey.  As stated in NWNH (pp. 61, 64), "to understand the lives of stars and the role they play in cosmic evolution we must understand the roles of mass loss, rotation, and magnetic fields in stellar evolution."  Magnetic fields play a role in both mass loss and rotation, and they also play a role in the evolution and destiny of life around stars through control of the radiation environment to which planets are subjected.  The latter touches on the habitability of planets (NWNH, p. 37).  A goal of the proposed NSO CA program is to understand the role of solar magnetic fields on all of its various scales using the DKIST and synoptic assets.  Solar physics has entered a new age in which the coupling of advanced instrumentation and detailed modeling are challenging what solar physicists think they know about the Sun and the solar processes that affect life on Earth and govern interplanetary space.  The DKIST will be the worldÆs most advanced and capable solar telescope, reaching far beyond the limitations of current telescopes to study magnetic fields on the Sun as small as 25 km in size. Such resolution will allow solar physicists for the first time to observe the interactions of the starÆs convective envelope with magnetic fields and the possible generation of magnetic fields in a "turbulent dynamo" process that has been theorized but never observationally confirmed. The DKIST will be the first high-resolution solar telescope to include the capability to observe the SunÆs elusive and superheated outer atmosphere or "corona", normally seen from the ground only during solar eclipses. This capability will allow scientists to explore the ph...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
