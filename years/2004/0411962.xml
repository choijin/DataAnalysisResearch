<AbstractNarration>The PI will study major problem in random matrix theory and their&lt;br/&gt;applications.  One question is what mathematical abstractions are&lt;br/&gt;responsible for the universality of random matrix theory formulas.&lt;br/&gt;The PI will investigate whether a certain stochastic Hermitian &lt;br/&gt;operator will yield new insights.  This point of view allows the study &lt;br/&gt;of general beta formulas beyond the traditional beta=1,2, and 4&lt;br/&gt;available in much of classical random matrix theory.  As part of &lt;br/&gt;this project we will produce software for random matrix integrals,&lt;br/&gt;Jack polynomials, and orthogonal polynomials of matrix argument.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Random matrix theory is becoming increasingly important as the formulas&lt;br/&gt;that were obtained in this once esoteric field are now finding&lt;br/&gt;application in areas as far reaching as array processing, numerical&lt;br/&gt;analysis, computational complexity, and traditional fields of &lt;br/&gt;mathematics and physics including combinatorics, integrable-systems,&lt;br/&gt;and so many other fields. This is randomized "linear algebra."&lt;br/&gt;The random matrix techniques developed today will become important&lt;br/&gt;tools for scientists and engineers in the coming decade.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
