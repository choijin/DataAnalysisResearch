<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;This proposal consists of several projects, each of which will increase our ability to interpret future data on physics beyond the standard model. &lt;br/&gt;The first part concerns the connection of Supersymmetry with Higgs physics. &lt;br/&gt;Also predictions are made of what type of experimental results will be found if physics is described by a Higgless extension of the Standard Model as well as by a grand unified SO(10) model. In these models, loop corrections will be calculated which will effect theCP phases, including both CP violating and CP conserving but large possible effects. These effects will be important in analyzing data. The PI will also analyze in these models physics in the Higgs sector, rare B decays, electric dipole moments, the muon g-2, and dark matter (by considering the thermal equilibrium relic density).</AbstractNarration>
