<AbstractNarration>What explains the variation in party influence in different legislatures?   What  mechanisms are responsible, and to what degree, for observed levels of  partisanship in  floor  voting?    Are  variations  in  preference  homogeneity  within  the  parties  key,  per  conditional party  government theories (Aldrich  and Rohde, 2001)?   Are variations in  agenda control institutions key, per procedural cartel theory (Cox and McCubbins 2004)?   Are parties simply unimportant (Krehbiel 1993)?  Most studies posing such questions in  the American  context focus on Congress; but the contemporary Congress exhibits  relatively  little  institutional  or  preference  variation  over  the  postwar  period  typically  studied, when compared to the amount of such variation at the state level.      This project seeks to exploit several advantages offered by studying state legislatures.   State  legislatures  exhibit  considerable  variation  in  both  their  internal  agenda-settting  institutions  and  their  roll  call  voting  patterns.    Thus,  they  offer  a  potentially  attractive  sample through  which the role of  agenda-setting institutions in bringing about  .party  influence. can be examined.  Furthermore, state legislatures offer .natural experiments.  in  the  form  of  partisan  ties,  which  have  occurred  with  some  frequency  of  late.    By  studying the impact of partisan ties, and the institutional adaptations associated with them,  on roll call voting, this project will investigate the institutional basis of party influence in  state legislatures.   NSF  funding  will be used to  travel to state  capitals  and collect the  necessary roll call data and/or to interview legislators and staffers involved in negotiating  or implementing power-sharing agreements.  &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit  The  burgeoning  literature on party  influence  over  roll  call  voting  in  the  states  has  paid  relatively little attention to the institutional sources of such influence.  While the debate  in Congress has increasingly focused on the role of agenda-setting institutions in bringing  about the observed party influence, the lack of institutional variation within the postwar  Congress has hampered resolution of theoretical debates.  The states offer  a natural  laboratory in which agenda-setting institutions vary considerably, both across space and  time.  Likewise, although partisan ties have been relatively common in state legislatures,  they have  received little scholarly attention, either in themselves or in their possible  consequences.  This project seeks to fill these gaps.  &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact  As the first comprehensive study of the power-sharing agreements that have been struck  in  state  legislatures  undergoing  partisan  ties,  this  research  may  shed  some  light  on  features of those agreements that .work. and others that have been less effective, in the  view of the participants (state legislators and staff) themselves.   &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
