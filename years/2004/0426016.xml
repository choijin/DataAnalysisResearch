<AbstractNarration>The Theory:  Research into Practice&lt;br/&gt;The primary objective of this project--Using TIMSS Videos to Improve Learning of Mathematics-- is to support the integration of high-quality research findings into mathematics educational practice by working to make the mathematics lessons more manageable and useful to all members of the teacher professional continuum:  mathematicians, IHE mathematics educators, K-12 mathematics educators and professional developers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Actual Meeting:  Who, What, When and Where&lt;br/&gt;The objective will be accomplished through a four-day work session at the Wingspread Conference Center in Racine, Wisconsin, during which 24 mathematicians, higher education mathematics educators, and K-12 mathematics educators will analyze the 28 public release mathematics lessons.  Working in teams, the group will come to consensus in identifying video clips that illustrate quality and coherent mathematics teaching and learning.  The data collected during the work session will be used to develop a guide, tentatively called the "TIMSS 1999 Video Study Guide:  Mathematics," to accompany the TIMSS 1999 public release mathematics lessons.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
