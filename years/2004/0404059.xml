<AbstractNarration>This objective of this research is to develop a highly exploratory &lt;br/&gt;non-lithographic approach to fabricate room-temperature single-electron &lt;br/&gt;transistors based on chemically synthesized metallic nanoparticles of &lt;br/&gt;controllable sizes and shapes. The approach is based on controlled &lt;br/&gt;manipulation and assembly of colloidal nanoparticles assisted by a &lt;br/&gt;nonuniform electric field. The proposed approach is unique in that the &lt;br/&gt;nanoparticles are used to form not only the central conducting islands &lt;br/&gt;which allow room-temperature operation, but also metallic interconnects to &lt;br/&gt;connect the central islands to conventional structures without the need of &lt;br/&gt;high-resolution lithography. The approach also allows for the fabrication &lt;br/&gt;of suspended single-electron transistor structure, which may address the &lt;br/&gt;problem of random background charges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The proposed work could lead to true breakthroughs in the &lt;br/&gt;fabrication technology of practical single-electron devices, which are &lt;br/&gt;identified in the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors as &lt;br/&gt;possible alternatives to metal-oxide-semiconductors field-effect &lt;br/&gt;transistors, which will soon run into fundamental physical scaling limits, &lt;br/&gt;for future memory and logic applications. The project will also provide the &lt;br/&gt;students with excellent research and educational opportunities in &lt;br/&gt;nanoscience and nanotechnology. The highly interdisciplinary nature of the &lt;br/&gt;research will result in broad training of students. The research project is &lt;br/&gt;well suited for undergraduate students at all levels to participate. &lt;br/&gt;Particular effort will be made to involve minority students.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
