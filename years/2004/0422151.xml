    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop technology for prevention of nozzle wear in abrasive water jets, which limits the lifetime and accuracy of jet cutting, and currently requires entrainment of abrasives downstream of the nozzle in a larger mixing tube. The method consists of a porous nozzle surrounded by a reservoir containing high viscosity lubricant pressurized by the same pump that drives the slurry in the nozzle. The lubricant is forced through the porous walls by the pressure difference generated due to the high-speed slurry flow, and creates a thin film, which protects the nozzles' interior walls. Pilot tests have successfully reduced the nozzle wear by more than an order of magnitude. Two systems are being developed: A Porous Lubricated Mixing Tube (PLMT) that can be retrofitted into existing commercial systems, and a Porous Lubricated Abrasive Suspension Jet (PLAS-Jet) with premixed particles prior to injection. The latter enables operation at lower pressures, and cutting of harder materials with smaller jets (micro-machining). Extensive cutting and nozzle wear tests during Phase II will optimize the nozzle material, geometry and manufacturing procedures, and will determine the lubricant properties and injection rate. Other components will also be improved including the particle and lubricant feed systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact (commercial potential) of the proposed technology will be abrasive water jets that can be utilized for cutting and machining of sheet metal, ceramics and composites by diverse users, ranging from small machine shops to the automotive and aircraft industries. Wear of the mixing tube in present systems adversely affects all the applications of jet cutting by limiting the lifetime of the nozzle and accuracy of the cut, by causing machine-down time, and by preventing commercial applications of micro-jets. A PLMT retrofitted with minimal investment into the thousands of abrasive jet systems already in the market will greatly reduce these adverse effects. The PLAS-Jet with premixed particles has several additional advantages that reduce the cost and extend the applications of jet cutting technology. Cost reduction results from the lower pressure required for achieving the same cutting effect (e.g. 10000 vs. 50000 PSI), the more efficient use of the abrasives, and the less frequent replacement of nozzles. The lower pressures also simplify the development of compact portable systems for remote applications in hazardous environments, such as during decommissioning of nuclear plants, and for military applications, e.g. removal of mines and other obstacles. Furthermore, unlike mixing tubes, the PLAS-Jet diameter can be reduced to levels enabling expansion of jet cutting to precision micromachining.</AbstractNarration>
