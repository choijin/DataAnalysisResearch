<AbstractNarration>The NSF Mathematics Teacher Preparation Program is developing a teacher education program in secondary mathematics in the Los Rios Community College District (LRCCD) that is fully articulated with the single-subject mathematics blended teacher preparation program at California State University Sacramento (CSUS).  Project partners include CSUS and four K-12 districts:  Elk Grove Unified School District, Sacramento City Unified School District, San Juan Unified School District, and Folsom Cordova Unified School District.  The three major goals of the project are to increase the number, quality, and diversity of prospective secondary mathematics teachers in preprofessional programs at LRCCD, to strengthen their preparation in mathematics, and to provide opportunities for them to explore teaching as a career, in general, and mathematics, in particular. These goals are being achieved through student recruitment into careers in teaching mathematics, development of the single-subject mathematics blended teacher preparation program at the LRCCD, and implementation of programs to support students as they articulate into the CSUS single-subject mathematics blended teacher preparation program. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
