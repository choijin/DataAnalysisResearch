    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PROPOSAL NO.: CTS-0439666&lt;br/&gt;PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATORS: MINAMI YODA&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION: GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SGER: NOVEL NEAR WALL THERMOMETRY TECHNIQUES WITH SUBMICRON RESOLUTION&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an exploratory research program for the development of a technique for measuring fluid temperature to within 100 nm of the wall of a micro-channel. The goal is develop and demonstrate a technique using Dual-Field Fluorescence Thermometry to measure water temperature with 100 micron resolution and within 100 nm from the wall in a micro-channel flow. The intellectual merit of the proposed activity is to enable the non-intrusive measurement of wall temperature in micro-scale devices such as micro-channels with high spatial resolution. Although the technique in principle measures temperature in the fluid, the proximity of the measuring volume (100 nm from wall) is such that the wall temperature can be accurately implied from the near wall fluid temperature. There are currently no proven ways to accurately measure the wall temperature in small-scale internal flows. If successful, the proposed techniques will increase the diagnostic capabilities for analyzing and developing non-isothermal cooling devices such as micro-channel heat sinks. Availability of this new diagnostic tool will have a broad impact on research and application of micro-scale devices that are non-isothermal. Examples principally include devices for cooling high powered electronic processors. Up to now, thermal measurements in internal micro-channel flows have been non-existent. Future development of efficient highly localized cooling solutions for electronics cooling requires improved understanding of these types of flows and the proposed technique adds an important tool to the available diagnostics. The PI is developing a 12-hour introduction to micro- and nano-fluidics to be taught in a 4th year course in applications of fluid mechanics. Results of this project will be included in the proposed course.</AbstractNarration>
