<AbstractNarration>Proposal DMS-0400643&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Mathematical analysis of vortex sheet and &lt;br/&gt;water wave motion&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: Sijue Wu, University of Michigan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The vortex sheet problem serves as a prototype for the evolution of&lt;br/&gt;vorticity in fluid flows. One can think for example of the wake of an &lt;br/&gt;airfoil as a typical problem&lt;br/&gt;of this type. This problem can be described by the incompressible Euler &lt;br/&gt;equations, where&lt;br/&gt;the initial vorticity is ideally a finite Radon measure supported on a &lt;br/&gt;curve. The issue is to determine&lt;br/&gt;the evolution of this curve. A further assumption that the vortex sheet &lt;br/&gt;remains a&lt;br/&gt;curve at a later time leads to the Birkhoff-Rott equation. The PI's &lt;br/&gt;initial study&lt;br/&gt;shows that a vortex sheet&lt;br/&gt;in general can not be a curve of reasonable regularity. On the other &lt;br/&gt;hand, Delort's result shows that vortex sheet&lt;br/&gt;fits as a weak solution of the Euler equation (for initially &lt;br/&gt;non-negative vorticity). However weak&lt;br/&gt;solutions seem to be a class too big to describe the&lt;br/&gt;specific nature  of the vortex sheet evolution. The proposed research &lt;br/&gt;focuses on further pin point the&lt;br/&gt;nature of the vortex sheet evolution, through studying similarity &lt;br/&gt;spiral solutions, understanding the viscosity effects and&lt;br/&gt;the evolution of vortex layers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Water wave is one of our most familiar experiences in daily life.  A &lt;br/&gt;mathematical description&lt;br/&gt;is the incompressible, irrotational Euler equation, defined in the &lt;br/&gt;moving water domain. Study of  water&lt;br/&gt;wave can be traced back to more than 150 years, in which the PI &lt;br/&gt;recently established&lt;br/&gt;  the well-posedness of the problem locally in time, that is, the wave &lt;br/&gt;will evolute&lt;br/&gt;without breaking for a finite time period, from&lt;br/&gt;any initially non-self intersecting wave surface. The proposed research &lt;br/&gt;focuses on the large time behavior:&lt;br/&gt;the global existence of smooth solutions, the wave breaking-- the &lt;br/&gt;mechanisms that cause the&lt;br/&gt;wave breaking and breaking profiles. The proposal is to initiate from &lt;br/&gt;existing theories on limit equations.&lt;br/&gt;Through comparisons of the full water wave equation with the limit &lt;br/&gt;equations, the&lt;br/&gt;PI aims at developing enough&lt;br/&gt;machinery and understanding&lt;br/&gt;that lead to further research with greater generality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will further our understanding of the nature &lt;br/&gt;phenomena such as the water wave&lt;br/&gt;motion and wave breaking,  the mixing of fluids, separation of boundary &lt;br/&gt;layers, generation of&lt;br/&gt;sounds and coherent structures&lt;br/&gt;in turbulence models. It will have a direct impact on the science and &lt;br/&gt;technology that influence our daily life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
