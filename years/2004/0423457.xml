    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to advance a wafer-bonding technique, called the transmission laser bonding, to be reliable and applicable for packaging of microelectromechanical devices. The approach is to use both experimental and numerical schemes to study the physical and chemical phenomena in the bonding region during and after bonding at micro- and nano-scale levels. Using characteristics of laser and the associated optical properties, the technique can efficiently bond a transparent wafer, such as glass, to an opaque substrate, such as silicon, by laser melting of a thin layer near the interface.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the successful accomplishment of the proposed research, the potential cost saving and quality enhancement on microdevice packaging will be significant. Since packaging cost represents more than fifty percent of the total device cost, the proposed research should be extremely important to the associated industry. Currently, the applications of these microdevice products have been extended from the traditional automotive and aerospace sectors to many emerging markets, including consumer electronics, biomedical, and information; the products should have major impact directly or indirectly on people's daily life. Furthermore, the knowledge base gained from the proposed investigation can greatly improve the fundamental understanding of many areas involved, including the surface and materials sciences, mechanics, heat transfer, and fluid flow, as well as the bonding technology as a whole. The proposed approach should educate students to have sound basic knowledge with good balance between fundamental research and application in studying packaging.</AbstractNarration>
