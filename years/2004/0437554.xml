<AbstractNarration>OIA-0437554&lt;br/&gt;Stine&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will provide funds for the National Academy of Science (NAS) to conduct a study that examines federal programs and policies related to advanced research instrumentation. In particular the study will provide a general overview of instrumentation that falls between NSF's Major Research Instrumentation Program and Major Research Equipment.  The work will be performed by an expert committee under the oversight of the NAS' Committee on Science, Engineering, and Public Policy (COSEPUP). The study will contribute to the decision-making process at NSF and should be useful to other federal agencies involved in making significant investments in advanced instrumentation across all fields of science and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
