<AbstractNarration>     In this Focused Research Group project the investigators&lt;br/&gt;study the behavior of a class of soft materials characterized by&lt;br/&gt;strong coupling of electrical, optical, and mechanical properties. &lt;br/&gt;Such materials, which include some liquid crystals and elastomers,&lt;br/&gt;can be used to develop ultra-fast switches for video display --&lt;br/&gt;based on electro-optical coupling -- and miniature sensors and&lt;br/&gt;actuators -- based on the electro-mechanical coupling.  One goal&lt;br/&gt;is to determine the conditions that enhance the combined effects&lt;br/&gt;of the soft-elasticity modes of elastomers and their ferroelectric&lt;br/&gt;response by application of external electric fields.  In these&lt;br/&gt;studies the investigators combine mathematical analysis, modeling,&lt;br/&gt;computer simulations, physical experiments, and application of the&lt;br/&gt;three-dimensional visualization techniques.  These mathematical&lt;br/&gt;problems are analytically modeled by highly nonlinear elliptic,&lt;br/&gt;parabolic, mixed hyperbolic-parabolic and stochastic systems of&lt;br/&gt;partial differential equations, including the equations of&lt;br/&gt;nonlinear elasticity, viscoelastic flow, and Maxwell's equations&lt;br/&gt;of electrodynamics.  Partial differential equation methods for&lt;br/&gt;phase transitions, modeling, and numerical tools such as spectral&lt;br/&gt;methods and adaptivity to simulate the solutions are among the&lt;br/&gt;techniques employed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The project is a comprehensive effort towards modeling and&lt;br/&gt;development of soft matter actuator and sensor devices used in a&lt;br/&gt;vast array of applications, including ultra-fast optic and video&lt;br/&gt;switching, artificial muscles, biological membranes, and&lt;br/&gt;filaments.  Increase of switching speeds and size reduction of the&lt;br/&gt;device are two relevant technological goals at the heart of the&lt;br/&gt;investigation.  One type of materials to investigate, liquid&lt;br/&gt;crystal elastomers, can be thought of as rubber networks that&lt;br/&gt;require very little energy to be deformed along special&lt;br/&gt;directions.  This property, coupled with the efficient response of&lt;br/&gt;the material to electric fields, may offer optimal ingredients for&lt;br/&gt;developing high speed devices able to provide very large&lt;br/&gt;mechanical deformations with the application of electric or&lt;br/&gt;magnetic fields of small magnitude.  These are highly desirable&lt;br/&gt;properties, for instance, in the design of artificial muscles for&lt;br/&gt;robots.  The investigators carry out the studies by combining&lt;br/&gt;mathematical analysis, computer simulations, and physical&lt;br/&gt;experiments.  Use of three-dimensional visualization techniques is&lt;br/&gt;important in both conducting the work and disseminating the&lt;br/&gt;results.  Many of the problems present modeling challenges that&lt;br/&gt;call for a synergistic effort of mathematicians and physicists.  A&lt;br/&gt;central principle in this endeavor is close cross-disciplinary&lt;br/&gt;interaction among the applied and numerical analysts and the&lt;br/&gt;physicists of the group.  A major component of the project is the&lt;br/&gt;interdisciplinary training of post-docs and graduate students,&lt;br/&gt;including the organization of a summer school, development of new&lt;br/&gt;courses, and summer research opportunities for undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;students.  Interdisciplinary conferences, group workshops, and&lt;br/&gt;seminars devoted to the FRG project at each institution are also&lt;br/&gt;planned.</AbstractNarration>
