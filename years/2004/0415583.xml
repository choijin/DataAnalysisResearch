<AbstractNarration>People experience a "regulatory fit" when they pursue a goal in a manner that sustains  their initial orientation toward the goal. For example, when people have a promotion orientation toward a goal as something they hope or aspire to attain, then pursuing that goal in an eager manner (i.e., seeking out all means of advancement) will sustain that orientation and produce an experience of fit. In contrast, when people have a prevention orientation toward a goal as a duty or obligation they must fulfill, then pursuing that goal in a vigilant manner (i.e., being careful not to make mistakes) will sustain that orientation and produce an experience of fit. Previous research has found that regulatory fit (e.g., promotion/eager; prevention/ vigilant) makes people "feel right" about what they are doing, and this experience transfers value to both the goal pursuit itself and to other objects evaluated later. Non-fit (e.g., promotion/vigilant; prevention/eager) makes people "feel wrong" about what they are doing. The studies in this grant investigate for the first time the implications of the fit experience for the outcomes associated with interpersonal negotiation. The grant studies will explore the implications of regulatory fit for central variables in negotiation: (a) buyer vs. seller roles; (b) reservation point vs. aspiration point; (c) demand vs. expand processes; (d) acceptance vs. rejection responses; and (e) knowing vs. developing one's BATNA (Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement). It is predicted that regulatory fit will enhance not only the contractual benefits of the negotiation (e.g., financial agreements) but also the relationship between the negotiation partners. For example, greater value from the negotiation should be created by emphasizing expand over demand processes, acceptance over rejection responses, and developing over knowing one's BATNA when negotiators have a promotion orientation, whereas the reverse should be true when negotiators have a prevention orientation. Negotiation successes or failures contribute significantly to people's quality of life. By discovering  how regulatory fit can contribute to successful agreements and positive feelings for negotiation partners (e.g., spouse, friend, teacher, boss), negotiation outcomes could be improved in the future that would enhance quality of life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
