<AbstractNarration>Linguistic research has demonstrated that there are two major classes of human languages: spoken languages and the naturally-evolved signed languages of Deaf communities. The TISLR ("Theoretical Issues in Sign Language Research") conferences have been the most important international venue for discussion and presentation of results on the linguistics and psycholinguistics of signed languages. The increasingly international focus of the TISLR meetings-specifically, the focus on crosslinguistic, crosscultural work-is crucial in the study of signed languages. With National Science Foundation support, complete American Sign Language (ASL)-to-English and English-to-ASL interpretation will be provided at the TISLR conference in Barcelona (September 29-October 2, 2004), the 8th in a series of meetings that stretches back to the first TISLR conference held at the University of Rochester in 1986. This project seeks to ensure that the linguistic research reported at the Barcelona TISLR meeting is fully accessible to American researchers who are themselves Deaf signers. This project will also enable adequate interpretation into English of scholarly presentations by Deaf scholars from the U.S. and much of Canada, and will foster informal interactions between Deaf scholars and hearing scholars who do not know ASL.  Lastly, this project will provide travel support for up to 8 Deaf graduate and undergraduate students to attend the TISLR meeting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By providing interpretation into ASL, this project provides necessary infrastructure for the American scientific community that is exploring linguistics of signed languages.  This project will also grow that scientific community by creating new opportunities for the participation of Deaf students at an international research conference. The Deaf are a historically underrepresented group in American science.  By enabling the participation at TISLR of Deaf students in linguistic and psycholinguistic research, the participation of native and near-native signers of ASL in linguistic research will be fostered. Lastly, linguistic research on signed languages and on how they are acquired by children makes a fundamental contribution to practice in deaf education. In this instance, scientific research and educational practice are closely linked.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
