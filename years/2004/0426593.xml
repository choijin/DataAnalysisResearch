<AbstractNarration>The general dilemma facing many healthcare organizations is a lack of integration between clinical processes through the use of information technology. One of the major contributing factors of the problem is the resistance of healthcare professionals towards the adoption and integrated use of information systems and information management technologies, such as (CPOE) computerized physician order entry systems, (EMR) electronic medical record systems, electronic prescription (e-prescribing) technology systems, Pocket PCs, Tablet PCs, and Personal Digital Pens. Such information technologies could help to significantly decrease medical errors and reduce costs while improving the quality of healthcare delivery. The integration of clinical processes and information technology (IT) is imperative in improving healthcare quality in America.  The benefits of adopting information technology to improve patient care would seem to be obvious, and yet many healthcare professionals remain remarkably resistant. Previous research suggests that technology adoption models that work well in business environments do not explain the technology adoption process and the resistance to technology adoption in the healthcare industry. Certain healthcare specialties (in particular physicians and radiologists) are more resistant to information technology adoption for clinical purposes than others despite the potential economic and quality of care benefits and despite the fact that they may readily use information technology for personal reasons. Approaching the problem from two new perspectives (social networks and persuasion and social influence) and combining a small in-depth case study with a larger survey in multiple locations will provide new insights into this paradox.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Researchers will be working with both healthcare and IT professionals to develop practical guidelines for the development and implementation of integrated medical information systems delivered with new information technology in clinical environments. The researchers will devise a set of interventions and guidelines for IT deployment designed to improve healthcare professionals' participation and ultimately the quality of care provided. These guidelines will be integrated into a set of Best Practices that will be shared with hospitals to help improve healthcare professionals' participation, with developers of healthcare information technology systems and with the individuals who would be responsible for the implementation and evaluation of such systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
