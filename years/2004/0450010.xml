<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;Scanlon's work integrates arithmetic, geometry and logic via a&lt;br/&gt;model-theoretic study of natural mathematical structures.  Specifically,&lt;br/&gt;Scanlon investigates the theory of compact complex analytic manifolds from&lt;br/&gt;a model theoretic point of view and extends this research to related&lt;br/&gt;geometric objects.  In developing the theory of jets of differential&lt;br/&gt;equations, Scanlon hopes to discern the fine structure of dependence on&lt;br/&gt;solution sets to partial differential equations of infinite differential&lt;br/&gt;dimension and to present a unified treatment of differential Galois theory&lt;br/&gt;for such equations.  Scanlon plans to refine the study of enriched valued&lt;br/&gt;fields and to draw out the Diophantine consequences of these results.&lt;br/&gt;Scanlon works, as well, on purely logical issues and will continue&lt;br/&gt;developing the theory of thorn-independence with an eye towards eventual&lt;br/&gt;applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scanlon's work integrates arithmetic, geometry and logic.  Definable sets,&lt;br/&gt;namely those sets definable within a fixed formal language, are principal&lt;br/&gt;objects of study in model theory and this special emphasis has been&lt;br/&gt;instrumental in the success of the model-theoretic approaches to number&lt;br/&gt;theory, algebra and analytic geometry.  Scanlon works to tighten the&lt;br/&gt;connection between logical and geometric methods and to find mathematical&lt;br/&gt;interpretations of theorems in logic.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
