<AbstractNarration>An important and visible trend in empirical science today is&lt;br/&gt;the increasing prevalence of large data sets that contain from thousands to&lt;br/&gt;hundreds of millions of measurements.  Examples include data sets arising&lt;br/&gt;from high throughput measurement techniques such as gene expression arrays,&lt;br/&gt;proteomics and computer network monitoring.  While the analysis of large&lt;br/&gt;data sets is important to scientists, it is often outside the realm of&lt;br/&gt;classical statistical methods, and frequently presents new conceptual and&lt;br/&gt;computational challenges.  The funded research has two principle parts.  In&lt;br/&gt;the first, the investigators are studying the application of a relatively&lt;br/&gt;new development in the field of Data Mining, known as subspace clustering,&lt;br/&gt;to the exploratory statistical analysis of high dimensional data.  In the&lt;br/&gt;second, the investigators are applying ideas from Statistics and Probability&lt;br/&gt;to the development of new subspace clustering methods, and to rigorous&lt;br/&gt;mathematical analyses of their results.  Research is being carried out in&lt;br/&gt;the context of ongoing collaborations with biological scientists, and is&lt;br/&gt;being incorporated in software that will be used by the collaborating&lt;br/&gt;scientists to identify and assess significant sample-variable&lt;br/&gt;associations in a variety of large data sets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An important and visible trend in empirical science today &lt;br/&gt;is the increasing prominence of large data sets that contain from&lt;br/&gt;thousands to hundreds of millions of&lt;br/&gt;measurements.  Examples include data sets arising from high throughput&lt;br/&gt;measurement techniques such as gene expression arrays, proteomics and&lt;br/&gt;computer network monitoring.  Whereas small to moderate data sets typically&lt;br/&gt;have more samples than measurements, in large data sets it is common to have&lt;br/&gt;more measurements than samples, so-called ``high dimension and low sample&lt;br/&gt;size''.  The investigators are studying the application of data mining&lt;br/&gt;methods known as subspace clustering to the exploratory analysis of high&lt;br/&gt;dimensional data.  Subspace clustering identifies distinguished sample&lt;br/&gt;variable interactions (submatrices) in a given data matrix.  Unlike standard&lt;br/&gt;two-way clustering, the sample and variable sets for different clusters can&lt;br/&gt;overlap.  The investigators are investigating the noise sensitivity of&lt;br/&gt;existing subspace clustering algorithms, and are developing and&lt;br/&gt;implementing new subspace clustering methods for average based selection&lt;br/&gt;criteria that are better suited for applications where noise is present.&lt;br/&gt;As an application of these methods, they are using subspace clusters to&lt;br/&gt;classify high dimensional data.  Using a variety of tools from combinatorial&lt;br/&gt;probability, the investigators are also developing a rigorous theoretical&lt;br/&gt;framework in which multiple testing and the statistical significance of&lt;br/&gt;subspace clusters can be addressed.  The funded research is being carried out&lt;br/&gt;in the context of ongoing collaborations with biologists and computer&lt;br/&gt;scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
