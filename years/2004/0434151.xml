<AbstractNarration>The proposed scope of work for the next 4 years is focused primarily on&lt;br/&gt;better defining the role and organization of a future fully developed CIDER&lt;br/&gt;Institute (Cooperative Institute for Deep Earth Research) (see&lt;br/&gt;http://www.deep-earth.org/ for further details).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Following on the successful CIDER summer program held at the Kavli Institute of&lt;br/&gt;Theoretical Physics in Santa Barbara, CA from July 13 to August 6, 2004,&lt;br/&gt;the institute will hold three CIDER summer programs, in 2006, 2007 &lt;br/&gt;and 2008 respectively. Each program will last 3 weeks and  comprise &lt;br/&gt;overlapping "tutorial"  and&lt;br/&gt;"research workshop" parts. The tutorial part will involve 30 graduate students&lt;br/&gt;  and post-doc's, who will stay for the whole duration of the program, and 10&lt;br/&gt;instructors, who may stay for 2 or 3 weeks. The research workshop part will&lt;br/&gt;also involve about 15 more senior participants. Each summer program will be&lt;br/&gt;organized around a specific interdisciplinary theme and will be held at or&lt;br/&gt;close to an academic institution. The 2006 program will be held at the&lt;br/&gt;Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics (KITP) in Santa Barbara, CA, on the&lt;br/&gt;theme: "Constraints on the fluxes of mass, heat and chemicals in the &lt;br/&gt;mantle, with a&lt;br/&gt;particular focus on the upper mantle and transition zone". Location and&lt;br/&gt;themes for the subsequent two workshops will be determined in coordination&lt;br/&gt;with the CIDER Steering Committee.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The CIDER (Cooperative Institute for Deep Earth Research) summer programs were motivated by a need to improve cross-education among researchers and students in different disciplines of earth sciences to help advance our understanding of a fundamental question that has remained unanswered since the acceptance of the theory of plate tectonics 40 years ago: why does the earth have plate tectonics and  what is the driving mechanism?
