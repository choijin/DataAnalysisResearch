<AbstractNarration>Chemistry (12)&lt;br/&gt;In 1998, a pilot program in which chemistry and physics majors were exposed to semiconductor processing, integrated circuit fabrication, and device characterization was begun. The goal of the new curriculum was to prepare physics and chemistry majors for constructive participation in an industrial internship program, and ultimately for productive careers in the semiconductor manufacturing industry. The program clearly illustrated to the students the means by which basic chemistry and physics are essential to the preparation of integrated circuits. This pilot program was an overwhelming success, partly indicated by the fact that all student participants were offered permanent positions as process engineers by semiconductor companies located in Oregon. An essential component of this new program is the laboratory that is providing hands-on exposure to technologically important techniques not traditionally covered in undergraduate physics or chemistry curricula. The funds from the NSF-CCLI program are allowing the further development of this laboratory by the addition of a mask aligner, probe stations, and other measurement equipment. The project shares with the Division of Undergraduate Research the goal to prepare students for the technological workplace and to provide more effective linkages between higher education and industry. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
