<AbstractNarration>Chemistry (12) A gas chromatograph/ mass spectrometer (GC/ MS) is used to expand and enhance laboratory experiences in organic, instrumental, environmental and physical chemistry laboratory courses as well as in undergraduate research projects. A series of original problem- based experiments and experiments adapted from the literature increase in complexity as students progress from organic through physical chemistry laboratory courses. The experiments vary in the amount of procedural detail provided to the students. Initially, complete procedures are provided. In upper level experiments, a problem- based approach is taken where students are presented a problem and required to research the literature, develop a method for analysis and work as a team to obtain a solution. This approach develops independent problem-solving skills needed to address the many complex analytical issues facing society. Where appropriate, experiments are related to current real-life problems, such as environmental and energy-related issues. The rationale for this approach is that students become more interested and excited about laboratory experiments if they can relate their assignments to current industrial practices rather than performing cookbook-type experiments. This redirection in laboratory experiences equips graduates to meet the challenges of industry and graduate schools. In addition, this project provides future middle school and high school teachers in the institution's chemistry education program with examples of discovery-based learning topics related to environmental issues.</AbstractNarration>
