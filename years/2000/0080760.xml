<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to integrate Si-based tunnel diodes with CMOS and SiGe HBT&lt;br/&gt;technology to demonstrate circuits which exhibit higher circuit speed, reduced&lt;br/&gt;component count, and lowered power consumption, and which extend CMOS on the&lt;br/&gt;Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) Roadmap without a linewidth reduction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project would establish an integrated program by involving universities&lt;br/&gt;(Delaware and Rochester Institute of Technology) and government research laboratories&lt;br/&gt;(Naval Research Laboratory) with the goal of making the first Si-based tunnel diode&lt;br/&gt;integrated circuit. The research will focus on simple tunnel diode circuits which combine&lt;br/&gt;Si-based tunnel diodes with CMOS and SiGe HBT technology. The work will be&lt;br/&gt;synergistic with another project (NSF-ITR) involving Michigan, Delaware, NRL and RIT&lt;br/&gt;which proposes to study the new circuits enabled by this technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposed project focuses upon developing integration recipes with CMOS and&lt;br/&gt;HBTs. This body of work includes: studying the back-end thermal budget for&lt;br/&gt;unmetalized CMOS to withstand tunnel diode processing; finding appropriate cleaning&lt;br/&gt;etchants which prepare the surface for MBE overgrowth while being benign to the pre-existing&lt;br/&gt;CMOS; develop selective etchants to remove unwanted poly-crystalline MBE&lt;br/&gt;growth atop the CMOS; perform MBE overgrowth into pre-defined windows atop&lt;br/&gt;source/drain implants; examine possible emitter/base junction displacement with tunnel&lt;br/&gt;diode overgrowth; develop selective etchants to mesa etch the TD atop the HBT&lt;br/&gt;structure; and realize some simple tunnel diode transistor circuits. The Si-based tunnel&lt;br/&gt;diodes have already been developed (NSF CAREER- Berger, DARPA- Ultra&lt;br/&gt;Electronics) and are currently being optimized (NSF GOALI-Berger, NRL and&lt;br/&gt;Raytheon). SiGe HBT integration will be performed by Delaware and by the NRL team,&lt;br/&gt;who have considerable experience in the growth and fabrication of SiGe HBTs. For this&lt;br/&gt;proposed project, Dr. Phillip Thompson at NRL will perform the MBE growths,&lt;br/&gt;Delaware will perform tunnel diode and SiGe HBT fabrication and testing, and RIT will&lt;br/&gt;perform the CMOS fabrication.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strong interaction between the University of Delaware, the Naval Research Laboratory&lt;br/&gt;and Rochester Institute of Technology will foster open discussion and dialogue. This&lt;br/&gt;proposal seeks to bring together circuit designers, semiconductor device engineers and&lt;br/&gt;CMOS technologists for the sole purpose of realizing tunnel diode/transistor circuits on a&lt;br/&gt;Si platform. Undergraduate research and student training will play a significant role at&lt;br/&gt;Delaware through existing and anticipated NSF REU supplements and at RIT through&lt;br/&gt;their student-run CMOS factory and RIT's senior thesis projects. RIT's budget includes&lt;br/&gt;an undergraduate researcher. The cross-disciplinary work and site visits to NRL research&lt;br/&gt;labs will enhance the educational process.</AbstractNarration>
