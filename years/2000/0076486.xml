<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;0076486&lt;br/&gt;Atwater&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant will help develop quantitative electrostatic force scanning probe &lt;br/&gt;microscopy.  The project includes modification of a commercial ultrahigh &lt;br/&gt;vacuum scanning probe microscope and development of new electrostatic force &lt;br/&gt;microscopy simulation software.  The program comprised both ultrahigh &lt;br/&gt;vacuum electrostatic force microscopy measurements and development and &lt;br/&gt;testing of finite element electrostatic simulation software describing &lt;br/&gt;tip-sample interactions, including van der Waals and electrostatic force &lt;br/&gt;contributions .  This will enable more quantitative understanding of &lt;br/&gt;nanometer-scale charge distributions and low mobility electronic &lt;br/&gt;transport.  The immediate scientific use for the instrument will be in a &lt;br/&gt;collaborative Caltech/Bell Labs/NASA-JPL multi-investigator research &lt;br/&gt;program aimed at probing charge injection and storage in silicon &lt;br/&gt;nanoparticle structures for nonvolatile memory applications.  Information &lt;br/&gt;and software needed to perform quantitative EFM will be disseminated to the &lt;br/&gt;materials research community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Electrically insulating thin films are critical and ubiquitous components &lt;br/&gt;of electronic devices such as integrated circuits and micromechanical &lt;br/&gt;devices.  Trapping of electronic charge, whether by design or as an &lt;br/&gt;unintended effect, is a common characteristic of insulating thin films.  It &lt;br/&gt;is desirable to be able to quantitatively measure the extent of and &lt;br/&gt;mechanisms for charge trapping in order to better understand the &lt;br/&gt;performance and reliability of insulating thin films.  Scanning probe &lt;br/&gt;microscope techniques such as electrostatic force microscopy have opened a &lt;br/&gt;new vista in the understanding charge trapping in insulators because they &lt;br/&gt;enable measurement at nanometer-scale spatial resolution and total charge &lt;br/&gt;sensitivity down to the single electron level.  To date, such electrostatic &lt;br/&gt;force microscopy measurements have been used as a qualitative but not a &lt;br/&gt;quantitative tool for understanding charge trapping in insulators.  This &lt;br/&gt;project aims to put the electrostatic force microscopy method on a firm &lt;br/&gt;quantitative foundation, through a combination of measurements and &lt;br/&gt;development of simulation software needed for quantitative &lt;br/&gt;understanding.  The results will be applied to characterize charge trapping &lt;br/&gt;in nonvolatile floating gate memory device materials containing &lt;br/&gt;semiconductor nanocrystals.  These materials and the devices made with them &lt;br/&gt;are very promising candidates for the next-generation of ultradense, &lt;br/&gt;low-power nonvolatile "flash" memory chips like those now used widely in &lt;br/&gt;portable electronic devices such as wireless telephones, pagers, electronic &lt;br/&gt;cameras and personal digital assistants.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
