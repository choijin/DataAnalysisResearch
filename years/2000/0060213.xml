    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project tests feasibility of a novel cost-efficient process for manufacture of monodispersed spherical micron-sized metal powders. Whereas there exist today various methods for making uniform sized particles, they are either unsuited to high -melting point materials, unperfected at sizes below 100 gm, slow or very expensive. Commercial spherical gas-atomized powders are available, but have wide size distributions. We propose to demonstrate liquid metal pressurization and perturbation of flow through a plate containing multiple high-speed drop-forming nozzles by means of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). The objective is a system suitable for use at high temperatures (&lt;=2000C) permitting continuous feed (vs. batch processing), no moving parts, no high-pressure reservoir of liquid metal and high productivity. The research includes analysis, design, construction, and testing of MHD pressurization and perturbation equipment and the nozzle plate. The Phase I goal is production of uniform drops of low melting point metals using MHD and a multiple nozzle array. In Phase II, the process will be extended to accommodate high temperature and increased throughput in a complete bench-top system producing "monospheres" of cobalt and iron. This technology offers a means of producing significant quantities of desirable monospheres at commodity prices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary customers for powders manufactured by the process innovated herein are Powder Metal parts producers, initially by Metal Injection Molding and Hot Isostatic Pressing. By serving as uniform substrates for coating, the uniform particles will improve the ability to produce consistently alloyed and dense parts cost-competitively. Among many other markets are filters, catalysts, new magnetorheological fluids and biomedical uses. Initial markets exceed $15 million and the potential market in ten years exceeds $100 million.</AbstractNarration>
