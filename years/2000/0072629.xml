<AbstractNarration>0072629&lt;br/&gt;King&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This goal of this project is to develop a framework that can be used to &lt;br/&gt;design spatially distributed control systems.  Specifically, the outcome of &lt;br/&gt;this project is to provide a methodology to optimally place sensors and &lt;br/&gt;actuators and to construct practical reduced order controllers.  The &lt;br/&gt;approach is based on a unique combination of computational mathematics &lt;br/&gt;and distributed parameter control theory. The framework is based on an &lt;br/&gt;integral representation of the optimal feedback control that arises from the &lt;br/&gt;solution of the infinite dimensional control problem. Computation of the &lt;br/&gt;kernel of the integral (feedback functional gain) may be accomplished by &lt;br/&gt;solving a numerical approximation of the infinite dimensional algebraic &lt;br/&gt;Riccati equation. However, this approach is intractable for even the two &lt;br/&gt;dimensional heat equation on a fairly coarse grid. The approach proposed &lt;br/&gt;herein is based on the use of computational methods to directly solve &lt;br/&gt;Chandrasekhar partial integro-differential equations for functional gains.  &lt;br/&gt;Recent results on the smoothness and support of these functional gains can &lt;br/&gt;then be exploited to optimally place sensors and actuators.  Moreover, &lt;br/&gt;initial studies show how the gains can also be used to design robust low-&lt;br/&gt;order compensators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The motivation for this work comes from the need to have efficient, &lt;br/&gt;practical controllers for complicated physical systems. The focus of the &lt;br/&gt;proposal is the development of an approach that is applicable to a wide &lt;br/&gt;variety of areas ranging from materials processing to flow control.  In &lt;br/&gt;applications from such areas, there are several issues of primary &lt;br/&gt;importance that must be addressed. Among these are where to place &lt;br/&gt;sensors to obtain accurate measurements to be used by the controller, what &lt;br/&gt;to measure, where to place actuators (which implement the control), and &lt;br/&gt;how to design the controller so that the system is controller in real-time. &lt;br/&gt;Typically, the issues with respect to sensors and actuators are solved &lt;br/&gt;through engineering intuition. However, the mathematical framework that &lt;br/&gt;we propose gives specific answers to these questions. Moreover, it &lt;br/&gt;provides motivation for real-time control which is nearly optimal (in the &lt;br/&gt;sense that the design comes from the solution to a mathematical &lt;br/&gt;optimization problem) and is robust, which means that it is effective in the &lt;br/&gt;presence of disturbances, or dynamics which may have been neglected in &lt;br/&gt;designing the controller.  The potential benefits of this work are enormous. &lt;br/&gt;It would be applicable to complicated (and varied) problems such as &lt;br/&gt;stabilizing vibrations arising from shuttle docking at the space station, &lt;br/&gt;reduction of drag in aerospace vehicles, and optimal control of &lt;br/&gt;semiconductor manufacturing. It would provide a systematic approach to &lt;br/&gt;reduced order controller design, eliminating much of the guesswork that &lt;br/&gt;currently takes place.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
