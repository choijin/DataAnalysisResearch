<AbstractNarration>Petar M. Djuric&lt;br/&gt;Project Summary&lt;br/&gt;Signal processing is an area that already plays a significant role in the current GSM and IS-95 systems.&lt;br/&gt;This role will only increase in the projected third generation wireless communications, and in fact, the&lt;br/&gt;success in implementing these systems will strongly depend on the ability of the signal processing methods&lt;br/&gt;to resolve the new technical problems that will emerge with it. The underlying technology of the third&lt;br/&gt;generation systems will be based on the wideband CDMA (WCDMA) modulation scheme. In the core&lt;br/&gt;of this technology will be sequential signal processing algorithms with abilities to capture fast-changing&lt;br/&gt;characteristics of transmission channels very quickly and to exploit known system information optimally.&lt;br/&gt;The significant advances of latest CDMA signal processing methods notwithstanding, it is clear that the&lt;br/&gt;requirements for much lower bit error rates than in current systems will markedly increase the demands on&lt;br/&gt;signal processing capabilities of sequential algorithms for WCDMA signals. Additional challenge arises due&lt;br/&gt;to complexities that are a result from the need to handle high data rates and users with high mobility. Since&lt;br/&gt;the communication channels will be rapidly time varying, the signals will undergo quick attenuations and the&lt;br/&gt;new algorithms on channel estimation and tracking, channel equalization, interference rejection, and RAKE&lt;br/&gt;receiver adaptations must have extremely fast convergence rates. The objective of the proposed research is&lt;br/&gt;to develop algorithms that will meet the challenges of this new technology.&lt;br/&gt;The basic methodology for the proposed processing of WCDMA signals will be based on particle filters, which recently have gained much attention for their potential in handling nonlinear and non-Gaussian&lt;br/&gt;models. The underlying principle used in the design of such filters is the representation of the posterior&lt;br/&gt;distribution of state variables (the unknowns of the system) by a set of particles (samples). Each particle&lt;br/&gt;is given an importance weight so that the set of particles and their weights represent a random measure&lt;br/&gt;that approximates the desired posterior distribution. The particles may also represent means of density&lt;br/&gt;functions, usually Gaussians, in which case the particles have additional variables, the covariances of the&lt;br/&gt;Gaussians. As new information becomes available, these particles propagate recursively through the state&lt;br/&gt;space and their weights are modified using the principles of Bayesian theory. There are several ways of&lt;br/&gt;applying particle filters including sampling-importance-resampling, mixture Kalman filtering, and Monte&lt;br/&gt;Carlo and Metropolis-Hastings importance resampling. These approaches have their advantages and disad-&lt;br/&gt;vantages in performance, and impose different demands for real-time implementation. In the proposal, new&lt;br/&gt;schemes will be studied that naturally combine the best features of the existing schemes, and tailor them&lt;br/&gt;for processing of WCDMA signals. Not only will the new schemes be able to replicate or surpass the best&lt;br/&gt;possible performance of the known methods, but they will also be general enough to provide foundations for&lt;br/&gt;development of new task specific schemes.&lt;br/&gt;Four important topics will be investigated. The first is the examination of fundamental schemes for&lt;br/&gt;propagation of state particles. This issue is critical for two important reasons: (a) it aspects the performance&lt;br/&gt;of the algorithm and (b) it subsumes the implementation, which although parallelizible, is in some cases too&lt;br/&gt;computationally demanding and therefore not too practical. The second topic is task specific and is related&lt;br/&gt;to multiuser detection and channel estimation as well as exploitation of the physical characteristics of the&lt;br/&gt;channel and the base station/mobile asymmetry for development of improved algorithms. The third one&lt;br/&gt;is examination of the flexibility of the proposed methodology and the interaction of the various algorithms&lt;br/&gt;and tasks in order to improve their performances and robustness. Finally, the fourth topic will be related to&lt;br/&gt;investigation of computational requirements, and structures that would allow for real-time use.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
