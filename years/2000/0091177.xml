<AbstractNarration>Temperature controls plant growth and development and is ultimately one of&lt;br/&gt;the most significant factors limiting crop productivity.  As temperature&lt;br/&gt;goes above or below a plant's optimal range plant growth is affected.  The&lt;br/&gt;effects of temperature and methods for reducing damage by both high and low&lt;br/&gt;temperature has been the topic of a Gordon Research Conference every other&lt;br/&gt;year for a little over 10 years.  In 2001 this conference will be held&lt;br/&gt;again so that researchers can share the latest research in this field.  The&lt;br/&gt;topics to be covered in the conference were selected from topics suggested&lt;br/&gt;by previous participants and past chairs of this conference.  In addition,&lt;br/&gt;the co-chairs searched recently published papers to see where interesting&lt;br/&gt;work was being reported.  Two general themes emerged.  Past participants&lt;br/&gt;wanted to hear about genomic approaches to studying temperature stress and&lt;br/&gt;they wanted to hear about industry efforts.  One of the most important&lt;br/&gt;outcomes from a Gordon Conference is the interaction between early career&lt;br/&gt;and more established scientists.  This is of benefit both to the early&lt;br/&gt;career scientists, who become known in the field, and to the established&lt;br/&gt;scientists, who hear new ideas and innovative research that might otherwise&lt;br/&gt;have trouble getting noticed.  At this conference one session will be set&lt;br/&gt;aside for presentations from early career scientists.  Speakers for this&lt;br/&gt;session will be selected from among those applying to present posters.&lt;br/&gt;Winners will receive funding from this grant to allow them to attend this&lt;br/&gt;conference.  The winners will be announced at least three weeks ahead of&lt;br/&gt;the meeting giving winners time to prepare talks.  The competition will be&lt;br/&gt;announced on the meeting web site and in an email message to everyone who&lt;br/&gt;attended the last two conferences.  The conference vice chair will be&lt;br/&gt;responsible for selecting the winners and working with the winners to help&lt;br/&gt;make the most of this opportunity. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
