<AbstractNarration>The research goal of this POWRE award is to obtain the equipment and training necessary to apply molecular biological methods to research in the applicant's laboratory. These new skills and methodologies will complement, expand, and enhance research activities in environmental microbiology and will enable the applicant to explore new lines of research inquiry. Molecular biological methods will be applied to current research that investigates the biodegradation of ozone-depleting halomethanes and the biodegradation of carcinogenic polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). 16S rDNA gene analyses will be used to determine the phylogeny of halomethane- and PAH-degrading cultures. PCR will be used to amplify 16S rDNA and functional genes from total community DNA extracted from natural populations and enrichment cultures. Clone libraries will be constructed and clones will be analyzed using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). The PCR products will be grouped based on their RFLP patterns, and representative clones from each group will be sequenced and analyzed. In an iterative process, primer synthesis will be refined, as needed based on sequence results. The applicant will learn needed skills and in the process identify and characterize bacteria that mediate biodegradation of halomethanes and PAHs. Presently, there are no researchers at the University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science (UM/RSMAS) that apply molecular biological methods to environmental microbiology. However, a RSMAS colleague, Dr. Jack Fell, has graciously volunteered to oversee the applicant's training. Dr. Fell's laboratory uses molecular techniques to study yeast, but has the expertise to mentor the application of molecular techniques to bacterial studies. Dr. Goodwin plans to teach these methods to her students and thus provide them with experience that will advance their future careers. This opportunity will aid the scientific advancement of both the applicant and her students. Incorporating these methods into the applicant's laboratory will foster collaboration with other researchers, thus enhancing Dr. Goodwin's scientific prominence within her academic setting and field.</AbstractNarration>
