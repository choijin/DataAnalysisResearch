    <AbstractNarration>"Periodic Phenomena in Cataclysmic Binaries"&lt;br/&gt;AST- 0098254&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Small telescopes are the instrument of choice for variable star photometry which, by its nature, requires synoptic observations covering long time bases. Such facilities are largely unavailable at major observatories and increasingly, amateur observers are doing work of this nature with small telescopes. A number of factors have accelerated this trend. (1) Cheaper telescopes. (2) Cheaper two-dimensional detectors. (3) Sophisticated software that is readily available. On the other hand, the major observatories are becoming more specialized with only scarce, and mostly shared time being available on large telescopes with expensive instrumentation. The PI has assembled a worldwide network of small photometry telescopes to provide the photometry for cataclysmic variable stars. Understanding these stars requires measuring the orbital periods of these binary stars along with period changes when they occur. Up-to-date ephemerides are essential when spectroscopic observation with large telescopes are being planned. During the course of this award, the PI will supervise a team of graduate and undergraduate students who will carry out the reductions and evaluations of the data provided by the worldwide amateur network. In addition, he will lead the analysis and publication of the results as they become available.</AbstractNarration>
