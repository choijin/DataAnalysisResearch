<AbstractNarration>0099710&lt;br/&gt;Starrett&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, a plan is outlined to continue the efforts of the Student Meeting Activities Subcommittee of the Power Engineering Education Committee of the IEEE Power Engineering Society (PES) to promote student interest in the power engineering field by sponsoring electrical engineering students from US universities to attend the IEEE PES annual Winter Meeting to be held in Columbus, Ohio.  The goal of this project is to provide an opportunity for students to be exposed to the most recent developments in design, operation, construction, and research in the power engineering field.  This is a particularly critical time for power engineering as the industry undergoes significant change due to the restructuring of the traditional utility structure.  The career opportunities for students interested in power engineering are many and varied; the program offers student several opportunities to interact with practicing engineers from utilities, vendors, manufacturers, and consulting firms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
