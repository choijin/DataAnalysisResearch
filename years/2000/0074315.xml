<AbstractNarration>    The investigator studies connections between knot complexity&lt;br/&gt;and polygonal knot spaces, and develops effective methods to&lt;br/&gt;quantify and and characterize knots.  The project involves&lt;br/&gt;computation and software development as well as analysis and&lt;br/&gt;experiments.  With colleagues and students, the investigator&lt;br/&gt;explores relationships between various experimental measurements&lt;br/&gt;of complexity of knots in physical materials, such as DNA and&lt;br/&gt;polymers, and mathematical characterizations of knot complexity.&lt;br/&gt;Previously defined functions, such as energies and rope-length,&lt;br/&gt;are compared to new quantities, such as measurements of the&lt;br/&gt;convex hull and of a "smallest" box containing the knot, to&lt;br/&gt;capture various spatial characteristics.  These quantities&lt;br/&gt;predict the types of knots that are encountered as one moves&lt;br/&gt;through knot space.  They also are used to understand changes&lt;br/&gt;that occur in small and large-scale knotting in polygonal knot&lt;br/&gt;space as a result of perturbations.&lt;br/&gt;     From DNA replication to unraveling one's garden hose,&lt;br/&gt;knotting and tangling are a part of many physical systems.  Some&lt;br/&gt;knots are easier to tie (i.e. less complex), and thus more likely&lt;br/&gt;to occur in these situations.  How does one quantify the&lt;br/&gt;complexity of a knot?  What measurable attributes fully explain&lt;br/&gt;the complexity of a mathematical knot (i.e. a closed loop in&lt;br/&gt;space)?  Mathematicians have defined several functions, called&lt;br/&gt;"knot energies" that quantify the "tangledness" of knots.&lt;br/&gt;Simultaneously, scientists have completed physical experiments on&lt;br/&gt;knots made of real materials, such as DNA and polymers, that&lt;br/&gt;determine other measures of complexity.  To what extent are the&lt;br/&gt;theoretical and experimental quantities related?  Are the&lt;br/&gt;quantities delivering the same information or does each number&lt;br/&gt;reveal something different about the knot?  In particular, can&lt;br/&gt;one use these functions to create more realistic physical models&lt;br/&gt;of DNA?  In this project, the investigator, colleagues, and&lt;br/&gt;students explore the quantification of knot complexity and its&lt;br/&gt;relation to spaces of polygonal knots by integrating theory with&lt;br/&gt;computer simulation.  Previously defined theoretical measures,&lt;br/&gt;such as energies and rope-length, are compared to new quantities,&lt;br/&gt;such as the surface area and volume of the convex hull, to&lt;br/&gt;capture various spatial characteristics related to the knot.&lt;br/&gt;Physical experiments and computer simulations are performed and&lt;br/&gt;statistical analysis applied to understand their interrelations.&lt;br/&gt;These quantities also predict the types of knots that are&lt;br/&gt;encountered as one moves through polygonal knot space and&lt;br/&gt;explains changes that occur in small and large-scale knotting as&lt;br/&gt;a result of perturbations.  This provides scientists with a&lt;br/&gt;better understanding of the mathematical models that are&lt;br/&gt;currently employed and suggest refinements to improve these&lt;br/&gt;models.</AbstractNarration>
