<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: Yinlun Huang &lt;br/&gt;Institution: Wayne State University&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 0091398&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Automotive coating operations involve paint applications of several thin layers.  The topcoat, including basecoat and clearcoat, is most critical to the durability and appearance of vehicle coatings.  In operation, very thin defect-free topcoats should be uniformly applied, layer by layer on the entire vehicle surface.  In practice film uniformity is often poor and various defects may appear in the coatings, due to improper paint spray, drying and curing.  It is unclear how paint spray parameters, spray booth air condition, paint rheological properties, and oven radiative and convective parameters are related to film topology, solvent evaporation, crosslinking reaction and defect generation.  Process control is essentially open loop to coating quality; and, energy efficiency and paint material consumption are often higher than expected.  This research is therefore the development of a systematic methodology for planning and controlling paint application for such systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main focus will be on (i) the establishment of cause/effect relationships between process and performance parameters, and (ii) the development of system optimization strategies that can determine the optimal settings of spray, drying and curing parameters as a function of operational mode.  The PI plans to develop integrated, plant wide models using various modeling technologies, and a two-layered hierarchical optimization strategy using large-scale systems theory.  The work will be done in collaboration with the Ford Motor Company and DuPont Automotive Company.  The experimental tests will be performed in their simulation labs and then a Ford plant.  The end product should be a systematic methodology and a computer-aided tool for process analysis and operation improvement that may be applicable to other than automotive-coating processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wayne State University has the largest minority population among all non-HBCU's in the U.S.  This project will provide valuable training for some of these students with exposure to local industries and thus potential future professional job opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
