<AbstractNarration>Economics (82)  In recent years there has been growing concern that economics is lagging behind other disciplines in implementing instructional innovations that actively engage students in the learning process. In response, this project is adapting Just- in- Time Teaching (JiTT) techniques originally developed for physics education for use in introductory economics courses. JiTT techniques combine the use of Web- based exercises with active- learning pedagogy to provide a dynamic learning environment that makes students collaborators in the learning process. [See Gregor Novak, E. Patterson, A. Gavrin, and W. Christian, "Just-in-Time Teaching: Blending Active Learning with Web Technology," Prentice Hall, 1999.] Students complete exercises on the Web and turn them in a few hours before class; faculty then organize the classroom session around students' responses just prior to class. Excerpts from students' submissions are presented during the class as the basis for lecture topics and are also used to develop collaborative exercises that teams of students work on during classroom sessions. This two- pronged approach leads to better student preparation for class, greater participation in classroom discussion, instantaneous feedback for instructors, and improved student study habits. We are building a model for JiTT application in a traditional Principles of Economics sequence that features 25 modules of lecture/ discussion topics, warm- up exercises, economic puzzles, and collaborative in- class activities. By implementing JiTT techniques in introductory economics courses we hope to achieve four related objectives: (1) improving learning in undergraduate economics courses through increased emphasis on active- student learning activities, (2) developing effective strategies for integrating use of the Web in an active- student learning environment, (3) increasing the academic success of minority students in economics, and (4) fostering changes in teaching practices in economics. The development, implementation, evaluation, and dissemination of JiTT materials for introductory economics courses is being carried out by experienced faculty members at Glendale Community College (GCC) and North Carolina A&amp;T State University (NCAT), institutions serving unique educational missions and diverse student populations. In addition to developing JiTT materials for classroom use and testing the effectiveness of JiTT techniques in our classes, we are in the process of developing a JiTT in Economics Web site at NCAT. The Web site will eventually include a description of the JiTT strategy, links to JiTT use elsewhere, a complete compilation of the 25 modules we develop, workshop presentations, and our research findings and recommendations. To encourage broader adoption of JiTT strategies in economics, we are publicizing the materials on this Web site and presenting our findings through presentations at workshops and professional meetings, as well as through economic education listservs to which we belong.</AbstractNarration>
