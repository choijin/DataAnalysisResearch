<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project explores the feasibility of using a newly invented novel materials joining process based on electromagnetic theory as a reliable and economic method to weld tubular structures.  The project will conduct research and engineering that will address the following critical technical hurdles for the commercial implementation and dissemination of the new welding technology: (1) A comprehensive understanding and characterization of the process; (2) An effective methodology for design and optimization of the system apparatus and welding procedure; (3) Special weld head design and manufacturing to allow for quick loading and unloading the workpiece in the production environment; (4) Industrial system prototyping for an automated welding system that can be integrated in automotive assembly line, and (5) Process and performance specifications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The successful development of such technology would revolutionize the assembly process of the hydroformed tubular structures in automotive chassis and space frame applications.  It will also promote the hybrid automotive body structure design that uses both aluminums and steels, and enable joining of different materials such as titanium to superalloys for aerospace and electronic applications. A new multi-million dollar/year specialty tube joining process is expected in about 5 years. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
