<AbstractNarration>The purpose of this project is the generation of data and analysis leading to proper analysis, material characterization, and field implementation of highway embankments reinforced using shreds from recycled waste tires.  The project includes four distinct phases: (1) analytical framework, (ii) material characterization, (iii) field feasibility demonstration, and (iv) educational modules.  The analytical component pursues the development of a generic desighn methodology for stability evaluation of embankments reinforced with tire shreds.  Tire shreds will be treated as discrete reinforcing elements in the proposed analytical framework.  The material characterization component involves a comprehensive shear strength testing program of tire shreds-soil specimens.  This experimental program will evaluate the response of tire shredsoil composites to varying dosages of tire shreds, shred geometries, and soil characteristics.  the field feasibility demonstration involves construction of a full-scale prototype embankment reinforced with shredded tires in order to address field constructibility and performance aspects of the proposed technology.  Contruction of the permanent embankment will take place in the premises of a collaborating company that will provide the physical space, materials, and construction equipment for the field component of this research.  Finally, the educational component involves the compilation of educational modules that will integrate the proposed research into geoenvironmental engineering instruction and into ongoing outreach minority programs.  The proposed effort seeks implementation of comprehensive material characterization, analysis, and field demonstration components in order to establish the basis for a "green reinforced soil design" in which the reinforcement inclusions are not made from nonrenewable polymeric materials (i.e. geosynthesis) but from recycled waste products.</AbstractNarration>
