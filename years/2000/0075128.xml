<AbstractNarration>This project is funded by the Interdisciplinary Grants in the Mathematical Sciences program, with both research and educational components. The principal investigator proposes to substantially broaden his background in industrial engineering, specifically in manufacturing system design,  to build an interdisciplinary research program on computational geometry and optimization problems in manufacturing. He plans to study and apply mathematical methods to a variety of problems in the design of manufacturing &lt;br/&gt;systems, primarily those involving the setting and evaluation of tolerances, and the routing of automated machinery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will spend the 2000-2001 academic year in the Industrial Engineering Program at the University of &lt;br/&gt;Cincinnati.  In addition to collaborating with the members of the Computer-Aided Manufacturing Laboratory, he plans to develop a better understanding of Industrial Engineering by teaching undergraduate courses in the IE program, participating in its senior-level Design Clinic, and participating in graduate courses.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of this project are twofold.  On the research side, the PI expects to develop an ongoing working relationship with the CAM laboratory, with results disseminated in both the mathematical and industrial engineering literatures, as well as directly to industries.  On the educational side, the PI will bring the experiences gained back into the Mathematics Department, and assist in the development of its Industrial Mathematics program.  The possibility may also arise for the creation of interdisciplinary courses &lt;br/&gt;between the two departments at the graduate level.  This IGMS project is jointly supported by the MPS Office of  Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) and the Division of  Mathematical Sciences (DMS).</AbstractNarration>
