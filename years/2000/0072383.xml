    <AbstractNarration>0072383&lt;br/&gt;Rosenthal&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mathematically, convolutional codes can be viewed as linear systems over &lt;br/&gt;a finite field. The study of these codes requires a good understanding of &lt;br/&gt;the algebraic representation of linear systems. The proposed project &lt;br/&gt;therefore addresses a number of issues in mathematical systems theory and &lt;br/&gt;in coding theory. The main objectives of the proposal are: 1. New &lt;br/&gt;methods for constructing convolutional codes with a large free distance &lt;br/&gt;and a relatively small degree. 2. New techniques to tackle the decoding &lt;br/&gt;problem of convolutional codes in an algebraic manner. 3. An &lt;br/&gt;investigation of the class of low density parity check convolutional codes &lt;br/&gt;which constitutes a natural generalization of the class of low density parity &lt;br/&gt;check codes. For this project it is the ultimate goal to algebraically &lt;br/&gt;construct low density parity check convolutional codes whose encoding &lt;br/&gt;and decoding complexity is `near linear' and whose performance is `near &lt;br/&gt;capacity'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Convolutional codes are used in the data transmission of many &lt;br/&gt;communication systems. Applications range from airborne satellite &lt;br/&gt;transmission systems to terrestrial telephone lines. Most pictures &lt;br/&gt;transmitted from deep space involve in one way or another some encoding &lt;br/&gt;with a convolutional code. It is the goal of the proposed research to &lt;br/&gt;construct new powerful convolutional codes which can be efficiently &lt;br/&gt;encoded and decoded. Having such new codes would have several &lt;br/&gt;benefits. First and for all it would allow the construction of smaller and &lt;br/&gt;more energy efficient transmission devices which are still capable of doing &lt;br/&gt;reliable data communication. The research project will necessitate a &lt;br/&gt;mathematical investigation into the algebraic structure of convolutional &lt;br/&gt;codes. As it was outlined in the proposal this mathematical research could &lt;br/&gt;also lead to a new cryptographic protocol.</AbstractNarration>
