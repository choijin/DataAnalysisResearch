    <AbstractNarration>PROJECT SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;This award provides partial support for the Gordon Conference on Glycobiology&lt;br/&gt;scheduled for March 4-9, 2001 at the Sheraton Harbortown Resort, Ventura, CA. The&lt;br/&gt;previous conference was held at the same venue on February 21-26, 1999. This was a highly&lt;br/&gt;successful conference and, in keeping with earlier conferences, demand for places&lt;br/&gt;outstripped supply and the 150 delegate places were quickly filled. The Gordon Conference&lt;br/&gt;on Glycobiology is the main venue for presentation and discussion of current and future&lt;br/&gt;directions in the field of glycobiology. By bringing together scientists whose skills span&lt;br/&gt;a wide range of disciplines including chemistry, cell biology, genetics, developmental&lt;br/&gt;biology and bioinformatics, these conferences consistently lead to new insights, new&lt;br/&gt;interactions, new collaborations, and new research directions.&lt;br/&gt;The 2001 Glycobiology Gordon Conference will build on the successful&lt;br/&gt;traditions of previous conferences whilst taking account of the many exciting new avenues&lt;br/&gt;of glycobiological research which are being opened up by the information emanating from&lt;br/&gt;Genome Projects. For example, once the amino acid sequences of the several hundred&lt;br/&gt;thousand proteins that make up a human being are known, scientists will be faced with the&lt;br/&gt;awesome challenge of understanding their functions and learning how post-translational&lt;br/&gt;events such as glycosylation contribute to human health and disease. Glycobiologists will&lt;br/&gt;play key roles in the post-genomics era and the 2001 Gordon Conference is well timed to&lt;br/&gt;facilitate inter-disciplinary collaborations essential to the successful exploitation of&lt;br/&gt;genomic information of relevance to glycobiology.&lt;br/&gt;The main themes of the conference will be: (i) structural glycobiology with special&lt;br/&gt;emphasis on technological developments and new information pertaining to&lt;br/&gt;lectin-carbohydrate recognition; (ii) the impact of genomics on glycobiology; (iii)&lt;br/&gt;discoveries from knockout mouse experiments; (iii) glyco-immunology; (iv) reproductive and&lt;br/&gt;developmental glycobiology; (v) neuro-glycobiology; (vi) glycoconjugates as therapeutic&lt;br/&gt;agents. Since glycopolymers are important in a wide range of biological and pathological&lt;br/&gt;systems, this multi-disciplinary approach should appeal to a broad spectrum of&lt;br/&gt;investigators.</AbstractNarration>
