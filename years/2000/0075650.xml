    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;00-75650&lt;br/&gt;Fisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Integrating linkages among aquatic and terrestrial landscape elements&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is designed to determine where in complex landscapes important chemical transformations of various ecological materials occur. Studies will follow water from the time it falls as rain along its path from small rivulets to large streams. These pathways include landscape features such as upland soils, intermittent and permanent streams, and stream side (riparian) zones populated by mature trees. Increases or decreases in materials transported between landscape patches will be related to production, release, or retention within patches. The PIs will perform this research in the Sonoran desert of Arizona, an ecosystem that responds dramatically to variation in climate, especially rainfall and temperature. Emphasis will be on the movement of nitrogen, which is increasing in landscapes worldwide due to human activity. Results of this research will aid in identifying and managing critical ecosystem components for maintenance and enhancement of water quality.</AbstractNarration>
