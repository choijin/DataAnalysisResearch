<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project is expected to result in a biosensor based instrument that can reliably and economically capture and measure airborne endotoxin in-situ with better specificity than existing assay methods.  Airborne endotoxin has been identified as a major health hazard to both humans and animals in many agricultural and industrial settings.  Endotoxins in the environment primarily enter the body through the lung and are difficult to clear.  This contributes to the development of respiratory disorders.  Regulation of human endotoxin exposure has not been possible to this point since no quick, reliable system exists to measure airborne endotoxin in the field. Current methods of measuring airborne endotoxin involve collecting dust samples in a sterile filter and sending them to a laboratory for analysis.  The results of the analysis take weeks to receive and have poor specificity to endotoxin.  The proposed instrument is expected to provide a more accurate, specific, rapid, and reliable alternative to existing assays for detecting airborne endotoxin in the range of 0.01 mg/m 3 to 20 mg/m 3.  Measuring endotoxin levels and subsequent modification of airflow will minimize human endotoxin exposure, and lead to improvement in the respiratory health of workers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A biosensor to detect airborne endotoxin will have commercial applications to protect human health in areas such as livestock confinement and processing facilities, produce storage and processing facilities, cotton processing facilities, waste management facilities, and air quality monitoring of office buildings.  Since endotoxin also represents a threat to the health of livestock, particularly swine and poultry, the animal/veterinary sciences market is also expected to be significant.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
