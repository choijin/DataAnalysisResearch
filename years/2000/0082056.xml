<AbstractNarration>The problem of numerical robustness and geometric consistency is well known&lt;br/&gt;in many areas of computational science. The issue is that inexact computer arith-&lt;br/&gt;metic leads to incorrect and inconsistent geometric conclusions (for example, is a&lt;br/&gt;point inside or outside a triangle). While computers are getting faster, software&lt;br/&gt;is not getting more robust. Indeed, the trend is towards more nonrobustness. We&lt;br/&gt;propose a new computational paradigm to reverse this trend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Robustness is often seen as an all-or-nothing proposition. Our new paradigm&lt;br/&gt;consists in viewing robustness as a computational resource, to be traded off against&lt;br/&gt;other resources such as speed. Each program defines a certain robustness-speed&lt;br/&gt;trade-off curve; we want to be able to run the program at any point along this&lt;br/&gt;curve. This proposal will develop the technology to make this capability effcient&lt;br/&gt;and easily accessible to all programmers. As a result, any programmer can produce&lt;br/&gt;nearly ordinary C/C++ code which can be run robustly. The implications of this&lt;br/&gt;paradigm are wide ranging, and will bring the fruits of robustness research into&lt;br/&gt;mainstream computing.&lt;br/&gt;We propose to (1) conduct basic research to support this new computing&lt;br/&gt;paradigm, (2) to create the technology and software tools to achieve this paradigm,&lt;br/&gt;and (3) to explore the applications of fast and usually robust algorithms in algo-&lt;br/&gt;rithm design. For (1), we will focus on effciency issues such as novel root bounds,&lt;br/&gt;incremental computation, guaranteed absolute precision for elementary functions.&lt;br/&gt;For (2), we expect to significantly extend the power, efficiency and usability of our&lt;br/&gt;Core Library and include capabilities such as symbolic perturbation. Finally an&lt;br/&gt;example of (3) concerns the general problem of checking of geometric structures and&lt;br/&gt;their applications in new efficient geometric algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;We propose to apply our robustness techniques and software to two significant&lt;br/&gt;applications in which nonrobustness problems are well-known:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Mesh Generation: we will construct the first fully robust mesh generator which&lt;br/&gt;will be deployed in a major ow solver system, Cart3d.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Geometric Modeling: we will build a robust geometric modeler which will be&lt;br/&gt;the first such system that is precision-sensitive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal involves international collaboration with Professor Mehlhorn's&lt;br/&gt;Algorithms and Complexity Group at the Max-Planck Institute of Computer Sci-&lt;br/&gt;ence in Germany. Our domestic collaborator are Michael Aftosmis from NASA&lt;br/&gt;Ames Research Center (on mesh generation) and Shankar Krishnan from AT&amp;T&lt;br/&gt;Research Laboratories (on geometric modeling).</AbstractNarration>
