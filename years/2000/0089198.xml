    <AbstractNarration>This proposal will fund the planning of Modeling Across the Curriculum, a major program on the use of computer-based modeling on student learning and inquiry skills in secondary science. The goal of the planning grant is to develop detailed partnerships, research design, and organizational and technical plans needed for a successful large-scale longitudinal study.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Modeling Across the Curriculum project will conduct a longitudinal study of the impact of highly interactive modeling tools and associated learning materials on secondary level student science problem solving, reasoning, and performance on standardized tests. The program, a large-scale collaboration integrating software and curriculum development, and significant data analysis tasks, will build on smaller-scale studies of the educational value of using, modifying, and building interactive computer-based models when supported with appropriate materials and teacher professional development. In addition, it will afford a unique opportunity to combine prior developments into a coherent curriculum multi-year strand with a common format and set of tools. A detailed analysis of the reliability, validity, and appropriateness of measures will be conducted in two urban partner schools and then will expand to include approximately 50 districts nationwide.</AbstractNarration>
