<AbstractNarration>Biological Sciences (61) Chemistry (12) Due to the nature of doing molecular biology at a primarily undergraduate institution, there are several challenges faculty face in providing students with the training they need to compete successfully for jobs in the growing biotechnology industry and the training required to perpetuate this knowledge to future generations. These challenges include limited funding, space, and time. This project supports the development of a shared interdisciplinary molecular facility that will be used in undergraduate and graduate level courses in Chemistry and Biological Sciences, individual student research projects, and summer research experiences for talented middle school children. The facility enables the integration of state-of-the-art molecular techniques into the curriculum of over 14 courses at the California State University, Sacramento (CSUS) including those for prospective K-12 teachers. Over 52% of the students at CSUS are represented by minorities. Additionally, most of the CSUS students are "non- traditional" - in their mid to late 20s, and work an average of 25 hours a week while attending college. Use of this facility enables CSUS students, through course-centered, inquiry-based projects, to learn cutting- edge technological methods that significantly raises their preparation for entry into careers in biotechnology and science education. The project is an adaptation of a similar facility developed with NSF support at California Polytechnic State University, and adapts research methods from the primary research literature.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
