<AbstractNarration>How does a single cell divide to become two cells? This is a fundamentally important and&lt;br/&gt;yet unsolved biological question. In prokaryotes, this essential cellular process is&lt;br/&gt;initiated and directed by the tubulin-like FtsZ protein, which forms a polymeric ring,&lt;br/&gt;called the Z-ring, at the division site during the initial stages of cytokinesis. The&lt;br/&gt;Z-ring then contracts, persisting at the leading edge of the invaginating cytoplasmic&lt;br/&gt;membrane throughout the division process.&lt;br/&gt;FtsZ is present in the three major biological kingdoms-bacteria, archaea, and&lt;br/&gt;organelles.in eukaryotes. Because very little is known about cell division or cellular&lt;br/&gt;organization in the archaea, the goal of this research program is to gain insight into the&lt;br/&gt;mechanism of archaeal cell division and how FtsZ coordinates this process. Halobacterium&lt;br/&gt;salinarum is the system of choice to study FtsZ-based cell division in the archaea for&lt;br/&gt;several reasons. First, relatively sophisticated genetic and cytological tools, such as a&lt;br/&gt;salt-resistant green fluorescent protein (GFP), have been recently developed for this&lt;br/&gt;organism. Second, H. salinarum grows at convenient temperatures in air, and thus can be&lt;br/&gt;cultivated without any special equipment. Third, its complete genome sequence has&lt;br/&gt;recently been completed, making H. salinarum the best archaeon in which to apply&lt;br/&gt;functional genomics. Fourth, H. salinarum harbors five copies of ftsZ: ftsZ1 and ftsZ2&lt;br/&gt;are highly similar to ftsZ orthologs from other species, whereas the other three are more&lt;br/&gt;divergent but are nevertheless clearly ftsZ homologs. This unprecedented complexity&lt;br/&gt;promises to reveal interesting and novel aspects of FtsZ function. Fifth, despite the&lt;br/&gt;potential complexity of FtsZ interactions, there are no other homologs of bacterial cell&lt;br/&gt;division proteins in this organism (which is also true for other archaea). This, along&lt;br/&gt;with the presence of a relatively simple S-layer instead of a peptidoglycan cell wall,&lt;br/&gt;suggests that cell division in H. salinarum may be more streamlined than that of the&lt;br/&gt;bacterial model systems and therefore potentially easier to solve. Finally, the rod shape&lt;br/&gt;and relatively large size of H. salinarum cells greatly facilitates cytological analysis.&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of this project are to (i) define the roles of the five FtsZ&lt;br/&gt;homologs, in particular the two most conserved copies, in H. salinarum cell division; (ii)&lt;br/&gt;understand what regulates assembly and placement of the Z-ring in H. salinarum, with&lt;br/&gt;potential candidates including the two MinD homologs present in the proteome; and (iii)&lt;br/&gt;identify other factors involved in cell division and in a potentially novel cytoskeleton&lt;br/&gt;in this organism. These objectives will be addressed by construction of gene knockouts,&lt;br/&gt;protein overexpression and purification, assays for GTP binding and hydrolysis,&lt;br/&gt;self-assembly measurements, and in vivo protein localization and quantitation using GFP&lt;br/&gt;fusions and immunodetection. These studies should make a major contribution to&lt;br/&gt;our understanding of cell division mechanisms, protein targeting and dynamics, and&lt;br/&gt;cellular organization of archaea, and should complement studies of cell division in&lt;br/&gt;bacterial and organellar model systems. Moreover,  genome sequence of H. salinarum,&lt;br/&gt;coupled with its accessibility, affords a timely opportunity for students to develop an&lt;br/&gt;in-depth research project on the cell biology of an archaeon.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
