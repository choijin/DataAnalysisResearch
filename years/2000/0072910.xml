<AbstractNarration>  Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project involves interdisciplinary research in which algorithmic&lt;br/&gt;approaches are developed to design and analyze adaptive experiments. An&lt;br/&gt;adaptive (sequential) design is one whose characteristics change in&lt;br/&gt;accordance with information arising from the ongoing experiment, as &lt;br/&gt;opposed to classical statistical designs where such characteristics are&lt;br/&gt;set in advance and remain fixed throughout. Adaptive designs have a wide&lt;br/&gt;range of application in clinical trials, destructive testing, behavioral&lt;br/&gt;ecology, computer performance prediction, adaptive control, etc., where&lt;br/&gt;they have the potential to reduce the expenditure of experimental &lt;br/&gt;``resources'' such as time, money, or quality of life. Unfortunately,&lt;br/&gt;adaptive designs are difficult to analyze and optimize. Exact analytic&lt;br/&gt;solutions are rarely available, and thus, historically, such designs have&lt;br/&gt;been predominantly approached via asymptotic methods and ad hoc&lt;br/&gt;approximations. Computationally, adaptive designs require significant&lt;br/&gt;time and space that has often made exact calculations infeasible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will expand the size and scope of solvable problems by&lt;br/&gt;developing new computational approaches for creating and evaluating&lt;br/&gt;designs and utilizing state of the art computational facilities.&lt;br/&gt;Attention is directed to problems that are important in applications,&lt;br/&gt;with a major emphasis on supplying researchers greater flexibility in&lt;br/&gt;modeling their statistical and cost objectives. For many of these&lt;br/&gt;problems, exact optimality will be unattainable, and thus techniques for&lt;br/&gt;producing near-optimal designs will also be pursued. Several of these&lt;br/&gt;techniques are based on optimizing smaller or simpler problems and&lt;br/&gt;extrapolating their solution structure to larger or more complex&lt;br/&gt;problems. This compliments analytical, asymptotic work and provides new&lt;br/&gt;insights into the structure of solutions. In other cases, a shift from&lt;br/&gt;serial algorithms to parallel ones will be used to address the&lt;br/&gt;additional complexity.</AbstractNarration>
