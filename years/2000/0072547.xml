<AbstractNarration>DMS-0072547&lt;br/&gt;Yuan-Pin Lee&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quantum cohomology is a deformation of usual cup product&lt;br/&gt;of ordinary cohomology ring of a smooth projective variety X.  Similarly quantum K-theory is a deformation of ordinary &lt;br/&gt;K-ring of X.   In their study of Gromov--Witten K-theory, &lt;br/&gt;Professor Lee and his collaborators have found some interesting relations to other fields in mathematics and physics including algebraic geometry, integrable systems, representation theory &lt;br/&gt;and quantum geometry.  These investigations also naturally lead &lt;br/&gt;to further investigations of Gromov--Witten theory itself.  The &lt;br/&gt;main focus of this project will be on quantum cohomology, quantum K-theory and their relations to discrete KdV hierarchies, Toda lattices, and enumerative geometry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gromov-Witten theory is a new subject that lies within the&lt;br/&gt;intersection of many traditional branches of mathematics and &lt;br/&gt;theoretical physics.  This theory was originally discovered &lt;br/&gt;within string theory.  Shortly thereafter people found many new applications to mathematics.  Some of these applications solved&lt;br/&gt;problems that, based on traditional methods, were considered to&lt;br/&gt;be very difficult.  The tools used to study Gromov--Witten theory &lt;br/&gt;also involves many fields, including algebraic geometry, topology &lt;br/&gt;and analysis.  Thus, this is a growing new field which exhibits &lt;br/&gt;many rich structures and deserves further investigation&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
