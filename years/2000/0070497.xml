<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI intends to pursue and amplify his investigations of the&lt;br/&gt;relationships between spectral and fractal geometry.  We plan to study the&lt;br/&gt;vibrations of "fractal drums", both "drums with fractal boundary"&lt;br/&gt;(Laplacians on open sets with very irregular boundary) and "drums with&lt;br/&gt;fractal membrane" (Laplacians on fractals themselves).  The proposed&lt;br/&gt;problems are closely connected to Kac's question "Can one hear the shape of&lt;br/&gt;a drum?" and to its beautiful extensions from the "smooth" to the "fractal"&lt;br/&gt;domain by the physicist Michael Berry.  Although the proposed theory is&lt;br/&gt;mathematically rigorous, it is also naturally physically motivated (with,&lt;br/&gt;for example, applications to the scattering of waves by fractal surfaces&lt;br/&gt;and the study of porous media), and has recently drawn some of its impetus&lt;br/&gt;from the use of computer graphics.  Moreover, we propose to use and extend&lt;br/&gt;the theory of "complex dimensions" of "fractal strings" (one-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;drums with fractal boundary)-recently developed extensively by the PI and&lt;br/&gt;Machiel van Frankenhuysen in the research monograph [La-vF2] on "Fractal&lt;br/&gt;Geometry and Number Theory" and motivated in part by the PI's earlier joint &lt;br/&gt;work with Carl Pomerance [LaPo] and Helmut Maier [LaMa] on (direct and)&lt;br/&gt;inverse spectral problems for fractal strings and the Riemann hypothesis-in&lt;br/&gt;order to study the fascinating oscillatory phenomena occurring in the&lt;br/&gt;geometry and in the spectrum of "drums with fractal boundary" and of "drums&lt;br/&gt;with fractal membrane".  ("Complex dimensions" are defined as the poles of&lt;br/&gt;a suitable geometric zeta function.  Further, in [La-vF], a detailed study&lt;br/&gt;of their structure is given, for example, in the case of self-similar fractal strings.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We plan to further develop analysis and spectral theory on fractals and on&lt;br/&gt;regions with fractal boundary, as well as to investigate problems of a&lt;br/&gt;'dynamical nature', of physical significance in condensed matter and solid&lt;br/&gt;state physics; for example, in the study of mechanical or electrical&lt;br/&gt;transport in porous or in random media, as well as of heat diffusions on&lt;br/&gt;fractals and in disordered systems.  We also intend to pursue our&lt;br/&gt;mathematical and computer graphics-aided study ([LaPa], [LaNRG]) of partial&lt;br/&gt;differential equations (PDEs)-such as the Laplace, heat and (linear or&lt;br/&gt;nonlinear) wave equations-on regions with fractal boundary or on fractals&lt;br/&gt;themselves.  According to appealing experiments and interpretations by the&lt;br/&gt;physicist Bernard Sapoval, this work may help understand the formation of&lt;br/&gt;fractal structures (for example, coastlines, trees and blood vessels) in&lt;br/&gt;nature.  In the long term, it is hoped that the tools and results developed&lt;br/&gt;in this project (and in the PI's earlier investigations) will help us to&lt;br/&gt;probe more deeply than has been so far possible the fine geometric&lt;br/&gt;structure of fractals and of related 'objects' occurring in mathematics&lt;br/&gt;and in physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
