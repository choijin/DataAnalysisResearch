<AbstractNarration>The objective of this project is to investigate and evaluate innovative hardware-based approaches to reducing misses in multiprocessor caches due to interference.  Interference between cache lines in a multiprocessor can cause lines to be involuntarily relinquished while they are still in the working set of a computation.  The problem is especially serious for modified lines, which not only account for a large percentage of cache misses, but also incur a high miss penalty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fundamental idea in this research is to record the lines that a cache has given up involuntarily, and use them as prefetching targets.  Simulation studies based on transaction processing and scientific workloads will be carried out to evaluate several algorithms for prefetch selection.  These algorithms include intuitive approaches that take advantage of coherence transactions, as well as more aggressive approaches in which processes that modify a cache line notify other processes to prefetch that line.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
