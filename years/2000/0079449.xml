<AbstractNarration>0079449&lt;br/&gt;Carey&lt;br/&gt; The MuLan Project will develop the instrumentation  needed to&lt;br/&gt;measure the lifetime of the positive muon to  unprecedented&lt;br/&gt;precision, namely, a factor of 20 better than the current world&lt;br/&gt;average.  The muon lifetime fixes the value of the Fermi constant,&lt;br/&gt;which governs the strength of all weak-interaction processes, just&lt;br/&gt;as the fine structure constant governs the strength of all&lt;br/&gt;electromagnetic-interaction processes.   The Fermi constant is one&lt;br/&gt;of the fundamental parameters of the Standard Model of particle&lt;br/&gt;physics.  A low-energy, continuous-wave muon beam at the Paul &lt;br/&gt;Scherrer Institute (PSI) in Switzerland will be modified by a new&lt;br/&gt;beam chopper system in order to create intense, short bursts of&lt;br/&gt;muons, which will stop in thin targets.  A positive muon stopped in&lt;br/&gt;appropriate materials decays as if it were in vacuum.  Such targets&lt;br/&gt;will be surrounded by a nearly hermetic set of 180 fast-scintillator&lt;br/&gt;timing detectors, each coupled to a state-of-the-art  waveform&lt;br/&gt;digitizer, and all readout by a high-speed data acquisition system. &lt;br/&gt;Online analysis of the nearly 100 terabytes of data will take place&lt;br/&gt;with a small array of fast microprocessors.  &lt;br/&gt; A second use of the instrumentation is in conjunction with an&lt;br/&gt;ongoing effort at PSI to measure the negative muon lifetime in&lt;br/&gt;hydrogen gas.  The negative muon can decay exactly in the same&lt;br/&gt;manner as the positive muon, or in hydrogen it can interact with a&lt;br/&gt;proton by the weak-interaction process known as  "capture."  The&lt;br/&gt;capture rate is predicted very accurately by theory; however,&lt;br/&gt;current experiments, which have various interpretation problems, are&lt;br/&gt;in disagreement with theory by a very significant amount.  If this&lt;br/&gt;disagreement is confirmed, this difference raises the exciting&lt;br/&gt;possibility of pointing to new and unaccounted-for physics.  By&lt;br/&gt;measuring the difference between the positive and negative muon&lt;br/&gt;lifetimes, we will determine the muon capture rate reliably and at a&lt;br/&gt;precision more than four times better than current measurements. &lt;br/&gt;The MuLan timing detectors, beamline and custom electronics are&lt;br/&gt;expected to play a major role in this effort.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
