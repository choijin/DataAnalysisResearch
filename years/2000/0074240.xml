<AbstractNarration>The investigator continues to develop adaptive moving mesh methods&lt;br/&gt;for the numerical solution of time dependent, multi-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;partial differential equations. The research work will be focused&lt;br/&gt;on a new moving mesh method, the moving mesh partial differential&lt;br/&gt;equation approach proposed by the investigator and his collaborators.&lt;br/&gt;The approach has been implemented in one and two dimensions for&lt;br/&gt;generating non-singular structured and unstructured adaptive meshes&lt;br/&gt;and successfully applied to a number of problems. Moreover,&lt;br/&gt;the approach has led to a unifying framework describing previous&lt;br/&gt;methods, providing a new theoretical underpinning, and building&lt;br/&gt;reliable new methods. The objectives of the proposal are to&lt;br/&gt;further improve the efficiency and robustness of the two dimensional&lt;br/&gt;method, to apply it to practical problems, and to implement&lt;br/&gt;the three dimensional method.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is concerned with the development of new computational&lt;br/&gt;methods which are essential to enhance the ability of scientists and&lt;br/&gt;engineers to solve large scale computational problems that are crucial&lt;br/&gt;to our economy, environment, and security. The research is focused on&lt;br/&gt;development of adaptive numerical techniques or mesh adaptation methods,&lt;br/&gt;where the special moving features of the particular problem being solved&lt;br/&gt;are adapted to. Mesh adaptation has recently played an indispensable role&lt;br/&gt;in the numerical simulation of many large-scale problems arising from&lt;br/&gt;science, engineering, and industry, such as those involving shock&lt;br/&gt;waves, boundary layers, ignition propagation fronts, and multi-material&lt;br/&gt;interface. These problems have a distinct common feature, that is, their&lt;br/&gt;solution changes significantly only in a small portion of the physical&lt;br/&gt;domain and the resolution of the solution in this portion dominates&lt;br/&gt;the quality of the whole simulation. Standard (non-adaptive) techniques&lt;br/&gt;often fail to solve these problems because they spend effort evenly on&lt;br/&gt;the entire domain and thus require formidable resources of computer&lt;br/&gt;CPU time and memory to obtain a reasonable degree of resolution.&lt;br/&gt;On the other hand, adaptive mesh methods gain significant economies&lt;br/&gt;by paying most attention to the small portion of the physical domain&lt;br/&gt;where the solution changes most. The moving mesh method under study&lt;br/&gt;is a natural type of adaptive mesh methods which are designed to&lt;br/&gt;capture the moving features of the physical solution.  The method&lt;br/&gt;is suitable for parallel computing and has proven to be an indispensable&lt;br/&gt;tool for use in the simulation of many industrial manufacturing problems.&lt;br/&gt;As an important part of the proposed research project, two specific&lt;br/&gt;applications will be focused on. The first will be the numerical&lt;br/&gt;simulation of chemical transport in groundwater aquifers.&lt;br/&gt;Groundwater supplies much of the water use in the United&lt;br/&gt;States. The wide spread degradation of groundwater quality from&lt;br/&gt;chemical contamination has recently prompted extensive research for&lt;br/&gt;simulating and predicting chemical behaviors in the subsurface.&lt;br/&gt;The application of the moving mesh methods will provide accurate,&lt;br/&gt;efficient, and robust numerical algorithms for simulating chemical&lt;br/&gt;transport in groundwater and therefore for effectively protecting&lt;br/&gt;and managing the groundwater resources. The other application will be&lt;br/&gt;on the analysis of dynamic stall of airfoil for better understanding&lt;br/&gt;the physical mechanisms which cause the unsteady flow&lt;br/&gt;behavior in the high-angle-of-attack flight condition found common&lt;br/&gt;with modern fighter and civil transport aircrafts.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
