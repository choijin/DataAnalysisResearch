<AbstractNarration>Undergraduate students will take part in a three year summer research site&lt;br/&gt;program in the Department of Biological Sciences at Wellesley College, an&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate college for women, which has a strong interest in the&lt;br/&gt;research training of undergraduates.  Applications will be actively&lt;br/&gt;encouraged from Wellesley College Biology, Psychobiology, Biological&lt;br/&gt;Chemistry and Environmental Sciences majors, students from regional&lt;br/&gt;liberal arts colleges and universities, as well as similar institutions&lt;br/&gt;nation-wide.  These students will have a serious interest in gaining&lt;br/&gt;research experience to add to their demonstrated academic talent.  They&lt;br/&gt;will already have shown an ability to think independently and&lt;br/&gt;imaginatively, and will have strong recommendations from knowledgeable&lt;br/&gt;faculty at their own institutions.  Ten participants for each of the three&lt;br/&gt;years will be selected by the PI and the participating faculty.  The&lt;br/&gt;selected students will take part in a lively, instructive, ten week&lt;br/&gt;program.  Under the guidance of their faculty mentor, each student will&lt;br/&gt;participate fully in an active research program.  This will include&lt;br/&gt;everything from pursuing a literature review, to carrying out independent&lt;br/&gt;experimental procedures and observations, and continuing to the analysis&lt;br/&gt;of data and the determination of conclusions.  Each will also prepare and&lt;br/&gt;deliver a presentation of results to the entire program in a weekly&lt;br/&gt;seminar series.  This, along with a series of demonstrations of the&lt;br/&gt;techniques utilized by other laboratories, and a final poster session,&lt;br/&gt;will familiarize each student with the wide variety of active research&lt;br/&gt;programs in the Department.  Throughout the summer seminars and workshops&lt;br/&gt;will be presented by scientists, and field trips will be taken to field&lt;br/&gt;research sites and biotechnology companies. It is expected, based on&lt;br/&gt;previous experience, that participation in this program will have a&lt;br/&gt;significant impact on the future of these undergraduates, as most will&lt;br/&gt;pursue advanced degrees.</AbstractNarration>
