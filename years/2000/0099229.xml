<AbstractNarration>Proposal # HRD-0099229  &lt;br/&gt;Institution: Western Michigan University&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Robert Leneway&lt;br/&gt;Title: "Building Capacity for a National Community College&lt;br/&gt;Collaborative IT E-Learning Support Network for People&lt;br/&gt;with Disabilities"&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  The Education in Information Technology project (EDIT) represents a new partnership of some of the nation's leading informational technology providers in support of people with disabilities.  Western Michigan University and the Association of Rehabilitation Programs in Computer Technology (ARPCT) form a partnership to combine the hardware and software of IBM with the courseware of Smartforce.com to focus on a research initiative.  EDIT will develop an E-learning Internet support network to study the impact of using a collaborative Internet site to increase the educational capacity of community colleges for preparing students with disabilities for information technology related careers.  Ten of 50 ARPCT member programs are already located in community colleges, and efforts will be made to increase this number.  IBM and Smartforce.com have donated over $500,000, in product, support and courseware, to initiate the effort.  This project will develop the site, promote its use, and conduct rigorous research on its impact for assisting community colleges to build their capacity for preparing students with disabilities for information technology related careers.  The effectiveness of community colleges using a national collaborative E-learning site to improve their ability to prepare more students with disabilities will be tested, and results will be disseminated widely. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
