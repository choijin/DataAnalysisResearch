<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; A lacuna of a linear hyperbolic differential operator is a&lt;br/&gt;domain inside the propagation cone where its fundamental     &lt;br/&gt;solution vanishes identically. The study of lacunas for general&lt;br/&gt;hyperbolic equations was initiated by I.G.Petrovsky (1945).&lt;br/&gt;Extending and clarifying his results, Atiyah, Bott and Garding&lt;br/&gt;(1970-73) developed a profound and complete theory for hyperbolic&lt;br/&gt;operators with constant coefficients. In contrast, much less is  &lt;br/&gt;known about lacunas for operators with variable coefficients. &lt;br/&gt;The investigation of this classical problem with a view of&lt;br/&gt;generalizing the Petrovsky-Atiyah-Bott-Garding theory is one of &lt;br/&gt;the primary purposes of my project. In particular, the&lt;br/&gt;efforts will be aimed at resolving the old question of&lt;br/&gt;J.Hadamard on explicit determination of second order analytic&lt;br/&gt;wave operators satisfying Huygens' principle on Minkowski&lt;br/&gt;spaces. Some new conjectures and problems (mostly from Analysis   &lt;br/&gt;and Algebraic Geometry) arising in connection with the theory&lt;br/&gt;of lacunas will be also explored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The study of propagation of waves in continuous media is one of&lt;br/&gt;the fundamental problems in Mathematical Physics with many &lt;br/&gt;important applications in natural sciences and engineering. &lt;br/&gt;Of special interest (both from practical and theoretical point of view) &lt;br/&gt;is the question of when the waves may propagate without diffusion &lt;br/&gt;to allow the possibility of transmitting `clean-cut' (sharp) signals. &lt;br/&gt;Well-studied in homogeneous spaces this question remains largely open &lt;br/&gt;in general. My project aims to develop new mathematical tools &lt;br/&gt;and techniques to investigate this difficult problem in the case of&lt;br/&gt;inhomogeneous and anisotropic media. The results sought are of fundamental&lt;br/&gt;interest and significance in mathematical theory of wave propagation &lt;br/&gt;and may have applications in related physical disciplines including the&lt;br/&gt;theory of electromagnetic and acoustic waves, space communication&lt;br/&gt;technologies, magnetohydrodynamics, crystal optics, etc.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
