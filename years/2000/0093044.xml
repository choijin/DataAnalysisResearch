<AbstractNarration>The design and implementation of a modern microprocessor presents many reliability challenges.  Designers must verify the correctness of large complex systems and construct implementations that work reliably in&lt;br/&gt;varied operating conditions.  The research examines the role that speculative execution could play in improving the quality and reliability of future microprocessor designs. A novel processing paradigm, called&lt;br/&gt;dynamic verification, is proposed that pushes speculation into all aspects of program processing. The approach couples a traditional core processor design with a simple checker processor that verifies its&lt;br/&gt;computation. The resulting core processor design has significant resistance to permanent and transient errors.  The proposed research examines the design of the checker processor, with emphasis on&lt;br/&gt;minimizing its cost and impact on core processor performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The educational component of this work seeks to better prepare the student for coming challenges in computer system design. The VeriSimple Processor tool kit will provide students with a unified computer design&lt;br/&gt;experience, starting with high level design in undergraduate classes, to microarchitectural design in advanced undergraduate classes, and finally research-oriented design in graduate coursework.  The tool kit&lt;br/&gt;will be incorporated into the SimpleScalar tool set (simulator tools developed by the PI) and freely distributed to other institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
