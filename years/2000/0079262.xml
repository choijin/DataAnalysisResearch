    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims at further developing and optimizing the innovative technology for the cost-effective fabrication of dense silicon carbide (SiC) fiber-reinforced molybdenum disilicide (MoSi2) composites with enhanced strength and toughness up to very high temperatures (1400 degrees C). Molybdenum disilicide has very attractive thermal, oxidative, and corrosion resistance properties for applications in turbine engines, burner rigs, hot gas filters, molten metal lances, and heating elements, but is structurally weak. Reinforcement with a mechanically superior second phase material makes MoSi2-based composites serious candidates for such applications if the composites can be processed to net shape cost effectively. The Phase I project demonstrated the feasibility of reaction forming the MoSi2 matrix with controlled amounts of SiC whiskers or particles, which themselves are formed in-situ. Further, several SiC(f)/MoSi2 compositions were developed that are strong, dense, and resistant to pesting. These compositions were developed using a single step process that combines Self-Propagating High-Temperature Synthesis (SHS) of elemental mixtures of Mo, Si, and C with psuedo-Hot Isostatic Pressing (HIP) -- electroconsolidation. Phase II research will demonstrate the near-net shape capability of the process along with the ability to produce robust MoSi2-based composites. Based on design specifications from turbine engine manufacturers, the project will also fabricate prototypes for testing at the end of Phase II. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Immediate commercial use of the SiC(f)-toughened MoSi2 composites can be realized as heating elements, combustion and burner rigs, and molten metal filters. Future applications include uses for aviation and gas turbine engine components, heat exchangers, hot gas filters, and waste incinerators. Other advanced applications include energy storage devices such as ultracapacitors.</AbstractNarration>
