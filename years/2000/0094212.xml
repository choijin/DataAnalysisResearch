<AbstractNarration>These scholarships support low- income students who are majoring in math, computer science, or any engineering discipline. The overarching goal of the program is to help low- income students in the targeted disciplines to successfully complete a stage within the degree program which is documented as a point of unusually high attrition at the Unviersity of Rochester. The program aggressively supports and retains low-income students within the first and second years, leading up to the declaration of the major during the second semester of sophomore year. The Program seeks at least a 50% participation rate for women and members of minority groups. &lt;br/&gt;Unique learning communities of small groups of first and second year students are established in each of the targeted disciplines. Each learning community is guided by a graduate student, and meets weekly for study, enrichment activities, and group- building events. The full group of scholarship recipients meets on a monthly basis with members of the Steering Committee. Each student recieves intensive support services aimed at keeping the student in the major.</AbstractNarration>
