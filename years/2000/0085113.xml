<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;The Hamilton County Department of Education's (HCDE), Mathematics and Science Synergy (MaSS) supports the continuation and expansion of HCDE's efforts initiated through the infrastructure and success of the Chattanooga Comprehensive Partnerships for Mathematics and Science Achievement (CPMSA).  Through MaSS, HCDE will provide "the exemplary mathematics and science education that each child needs and deserves to meet the challenges of the twenty-first century."  MaSS has at its core the development of a cadre of building-level lead teachers of mathematics and science, building-based on-site activities facilitated by district "consulting teachers," and professional development of all educational stakeholders, including guidance counselors, administrators, and community members.  In order to attain the challenging targets for improved student achievement that HCDE has set forth, MaSS delineates six (6) "Essential Components:"&lt;br/&gt;* Intensify the implementation of a district-wide standards-based SMET curriculum, instruction, assessment, and supporting professional development;&lt;br/&gt;* Strengthen the alignment between district policies and MaSS goals;&lt;br/&gt;* Institutionalize a culture of continuous improvement by increasing school and district organizational capacity;&lt;br/&gt;* Broaden parent and community involvement;&lt;br/&gt;* Increase the competency and diversity of the mathematics and science workforce; and&lt;br/&gt;* Employ research as an effective tool in improving the teaching and learning of mathematics and science program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MaSS will support 42,220 students in eighty (80) schools to succeed in a rigorous high-quality standards-based mathematics and science.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
