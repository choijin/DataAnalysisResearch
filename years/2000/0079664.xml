<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt; ***&lt;br/&gt;000079664 (proposal number)&lt;br/&gt;Elke Weber&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent work in decision making has expanded the notion of how people make decisions.&lt;br/&gt;Many researchers now look beyond the rational choice framework used by economists or&lt;br/&gt;the cognitive information integration framework traditionally used by psychologists.&lt;br/&gt;With the expansion of the traditional notion of decision-making as a cost-benefit&lt;br/&gt;analysis, researchers are finding that decision makers act in a variety of ways that&lt;br/&gt;cannot be described in terms of costs and benefits (Beach &amp; Mitchell, 1990;&lt;br/&gt;Gigerenzer, Todd, &amp; Group, 1999; Hammond, 1996; Klein, 1998; Yates &amp; Lee, 1996).  In&lt;br/&gt;some cases, these alternative decision-making modes are even designed to prevent&lt;br/&gt;cost-benefit calculations (March, 1994; Prelec &amp; Hernstein, 1991). Yates and Lee&lt;br/&gt;(1996) coined the term decision modes to describe qualitatively different strategies&lt;br/&gt;for arriving at a decision.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Given the new plurality of views on the ways that people make decisions, it is time to&lt;br/&gt;take a look at the bigger picture and to carefully examine the range of decision modes&lt;br/&gt;that people use.  In the current climate of decision making research, the careful&lt;br/&gt;development of a taxonomy of decision modes will be an important contribution to the&lt;br/&gt;field.  A central objective of the proposed research is to develop a comprehensive&lt;br/&gt;taxonomy of decision modes and a common vocabulary that can be used to identify and&lt;br/&gt;distinguish decision making processes that fall within each mode.  The proposed&lt;br/&gt;taxonomy includes four decision modes, i.e., cost-benefit-based, recognition-based,&lt;br/&gt;affect-based, and reason-based.  Each mode is characterized in terms of its&lt;br/&gt;attentional focus, primary cognitive and affective processes, and mental&lt;br/&gt;representations.  The further development of this decision mode taxonomy will involve&lt;br/&gt;more precisely characterizing the distinguishing attributes of different decision&lt;br/&gt;modes and developing experimental procedures able to demonstrate more unequivocally&lt;br/&gt;the existence of these qualitatively different modes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  A second objective is to establish a better understanding of the factors that&lt;br/&gt;determine when a particular mode will be used and why.  This requires the development&lt;br/&gt;of a model of implicit decision mode selection that is directly related to the&lt;br/&gt;decision mode taxonomy.  Which decision mode is used in a given situation is&lt;br/&gt;hypothesized to depend both on person-centered factors (i.e., cognitive and affective&lt;br/&gt;processes) and on situational factors.  Identifying and characterizing the factors&lt;br/&gt;that influence decision mode selection will be important not only because it is&lt;br/&gt;theoretically interesting to better understand the decision making process, but also&lt;br/&gt;because the selection of one or the other decision mode is hypothesized to influence&lt;br/&gt;the final decision outcome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The proposed research has the potential to integrate existing knowledge about human&lt;br/&gt;motivation, the nature and function of cognitive and affective processes, and mental&lt;br/&gt;representation into an adaptive decision making framework.  The proposed framework is&lt;br/&gt;far broader than its precursors in both its specification of the criteria on which&lt;br/&gt;people are trying to optimize and its specification of the strategies and processes at&lt;br/&gt;people's disposal.   Such a framework has the potential to guide and focus new&lt;br/&gt;research in the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
