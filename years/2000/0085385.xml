<AbstractNarration>0085385&lt;br/&gt;Ledley&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The National Science Education Standards (National Research council 1996) emphasize the importance of students engaging in an inquiry based approach to learning science (Science Content Standard A Science as Inquiry) and of students understanding the concepts and processes that shape our understanding of the natural world (Science Content Standard D Earth and Space Science).  One method of having students learn science through an inquiry approach is to involve them in student and scientist partnerships.  In order to develop a successful student and scientist partnership there are a number of issues that need to be addressed.  The main requirement is that both sides need to benefit from the partnership.  This means that the scientist needs to be able to see the advantage of having students work on his/her project, and the students and teachers need to see that the students contribute to the project and develop the skills in inquiry and the content knowledge in geoscience that are desired.  This project will address both of these issues by developing an Earth System Scientist Network for Student and Scientist Partnerships.  The PIs have identified scientists and will identify others who have projects that would benefit from the help of students, and recruit them to participate in the program.  The scientists will work with the principal investigator, to first completely define their project, determine what role the students would have in the project, and map out the scientific protocols that the students will follow and the background and support materials to facilitate students successfully participating in their project.  The scientists will also work with the principal investigator to identify issues in Earth system science, relevant to their data, that the students and teachers could use as a guide to help develop student's investigative skills and content knowledge in the geosciences.  When the student and scientists partnerships are implemented students would contribute to the investigation that the scientist is conducting; however, if the scope of the project is too large or the content knowledge required too difficult, students will investigate these issues and thus still have the opportunity to develop their inquiry skills and content knowledge in geosciences.  This project will also make use of the opportunity provided by the development of the Digital Library for Earth System Education (DLESE) to facilitate student and scientist partnerships.  DLESE will be a place through which the scientists, students, and teachers will be able to access the data they need and the tools and resources that will facilitate students participating in research, developing their inquiry skills, and increasing their knowledge in the geosciences.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
