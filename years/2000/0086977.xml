<AbstractNarration>EIA-0086977&lt;br/&gt;Jennifer Preece&lt;br/&gt;University of Maryland-Baltimore County&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Special Projects: Student Fellow Support for the ACM Conference on Universal Usability&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On November 16 and 17, 2000 the ACM Conference on Universal Usability is being held in Washington, D.C.  The conference seeks to promote research that will enable the widest possible range of users to benefit from information technologies.  These user groups include ethnic minorities, women, and those who are physically, intellectually, educationally or financially challenged.  The aim of this research is to enable them to participate in communication, online education, online health care, e-commerce and government services via the Internet.  The goal of this project is to support and train students from these designated groups (and others who have strong skills and experience in assisting individuals from these groups) about potential research opportunities in universal usability by involving them in the conference, its planning and the dissemination of ideas and initiatives arising from the conference.  The grant will provide partial support for ten graduate students and ten seniors and juniors to work with the conference committee, participate in planning, attend the conference, disseminate research ideas and develop a web site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
