<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of Alaska Southeast-Sitka Campus (UAS) two-year project to Enhance Rural Access to Advanced Technology Education in Alaska builds on a just completed DUE ATE funded Rural Alaska Environmental Education Project. The project is creating specific comprehensive teaching/learning materials in environmental technology education for rural high schools; developing and supporting active, hands-on teaming in rural settings; and, enhancing distributive teaming in support of the post-secondary environmental technology curriculum at the University of Alaska Southeast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project provides a Rural Technical Educator to develop, supervise, and support job-shadowing, mentoring and on-site technical experiences at local facilities(water and wastewater treatment). The project is also enhancing access to technical resources by developing an interactive CD-ROM for high school students addressing the technology of sanitation and environmental issues. The Rural Technical Educator supports associate degree distance students in the remote villages. The Rural Educator is also supporting rural high school teachers in the use of the newly developed instructional materials and conducting summer institutes for the teachers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
