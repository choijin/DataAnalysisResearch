<AbstractNarration>0080391&lt;br/&gt;Schuster&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description:  This award is for US-India Cooperative Research: Synthesis and Study of Interactions of Organic Ligands with Various DNA Structures through Spectroscopic and DNA Sequencing Techniques.  Professor Gary Schuster of the Georgia Institute of Technology and Indian collaborator Danaboyina Ramaiah of the Regional Research Laboratory (CSIR), Trivandrum will conduct experimental research on the synthesis of a variety of acridine, quinone and perylene derivatives and their interactions with select DNA structures such as hairpins, base bulges, triplexes and G-quadruplexes.  These studies are expected to provide greater understanding of DNA structures, structure-property relationships and develop effective molecular probes for the recognition of nucleic acid structures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scope:  The Georgia Tech group is well regarded for its expertise in photochemical and spectroscopic studies of organic compounds, particularly for interactions of photochemically active compounds with DNA.  The photochemistry center in Trivandrum is highly regarded and among the most productive research centers in India.  This collaboration uses the strengths of both groups to further the understanding of DNA photo-cleavage reactions.  The project is based on a significant collection of preliminary results obtained at Trivandrum and is likely to lead to advances in fundamental knowledge. It may also lead to practical biological and health-related applications in the future.  This award is supported jointly with the Government of India's Department of Science and Technology.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
