<AbstractNarration>The Alaska Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR)&lt;br/&gt;project will feature infrastructure enhancements in three research focus areas as&lt;br/&gt;well as strengthen research competitiveness through S&amp;T planning, outreach&lt;br/&gt;and education, technology transfer, targeted hires and faculty development. The&lt;br/&gt;research focus areas are: Infrastructure and Systems for Cold Regions, which&lt;br/&gt;will consider structures that must function at low temperatures and develop new&lt;br/&gt;construction and engineering strategies; High Latitude Environments&lt;br/&gt;Contaminants Consortium, which will involve engineers, biologists and chemists&lt;br/&gt;developing analytical facilities and expertise to address water, ground and&lt;br/&gt;atmospheric contaminants that accumulate at high altitudes; and Integrative&lt;br/&gt;Approaches to Environmental Physiology which will use physiological&lt;br/&gt;adaptations of Alaskan animals to extreme, highly seasonal environments as&lt;br/&gt;platforms for addressing general physiological questions.&lt;br/&gt;Infrastructure enhancements in these areas build on strengths of the three&lt;br/&gt;participating campuses of the University of Alaska (Fairbanks, Anchorage and&lt;br/&gt;Juneau) and are consistent with on-going program development and strategic&lt;br/&gt;plans. Education and human resource programs will support undergraduate,&lt;br/&gt;graduate and postdoctoral students. Partnerships with colleges and rural high&lt;br/&gt;schools having predominantly native student populations will be expanded.&lt;br/&gt;Outreach to the Alaska business community and state agencies will provide&lt;br/&gt;opportunities for planning and development of the state's science and&lt;br/&gt;engineering capacity. The infrastructure improvements will greatly enhance the&lt;br/&gt;range and depth of research projects and improve the state's research&lt;br/&gt;competitiveness.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
