<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;There are three major barriers to increasing female involvement in science, mathematics, and technology:  1) inequitable treatment of females in classrooms, 2) lack of self-confidence, and 3) lack of successful mentors.  The WE*CAN (women Engineers * Changing Attitudes Now) grant will address these barriers through extensive modeling, direct teaching, and mentoring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In WE*CAN grant there are four objectives and ten activities which will address engineering and gender equity concerns.  The objectives include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) mentoring young women from elementary school to undergraduates,&lt;br/&gt;2) informing young women about engineering careers and providing them opportunities to experience engineering activities,&lt;br/&gt;3) informing teachers, counselors, and parents about engineering and gender equity issues, and,&lt;br/&gt;4) disseminating information about gender equity and engineering through the WE*CAN program and future WE*CAN activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The activities included in this grant are as follows:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) establishing a WE*CAN mentoring program,&lt;br/&gt;2) establishing a WE*CAN web page,&lt;br/&gt;3) presenting information about the field of engineering while modeling gender equity to K-12 groups,&lt;br/&gt;4) teaching engineering to elementary students in the Super Saturday program,&lt;br/&gt;5) teaching engineering to middle school students in the Summer Camp for Academically Talented Students (SCATS) program,&lt;br/&gt;6) conducting a WE*CAN engineering day&lt;br/&gt;7) creating an all female team for the BEST (Boosting Engineering, Science and Technology) robotic competition,&lt;br/&gt;8) teaching elementary girls in an engineering enrichment program,&lt;br/&gt;9) providing a workshop for teachers and counselors in the field of engineering and gender equitable teaching and counseling strategies, and&lt;br/&gt;10) disseminating information at conferences and events about gender equity and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Participants from the first grade through the university level will experience a hands-on and minds-on approach to the field of engineering in gender equitable environment.  Participants will experience support through the WE*CAN mentoring program.  A strong focus will be placed on mentoring young women as a way on increasing self-esteem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several activities in the WE*CAN grant are integrated with existing programs in an attempt to make the seeds of this program sustainable in future years&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
