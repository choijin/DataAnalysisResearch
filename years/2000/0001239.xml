<AbstractNarration>0001192 Meigs&lt;br/&gt;0001239 Spotila&lt;br/&gt;That feedbacks potentially exist between climate change, erosion, and crustal deformation has focused attention on the topography of active orogenic systems.  Studies of linkages between deformation, denudation and topographic development are complex, and have primarily utilized fluvial rather than glacial systems.  Glaciated regions have a characteristic topographic form that is distinct from that of fluvial terrains, however basic relationships such as how mean topography relates with patterns of rock uplift are essentially unknown for landscapes dominated by glacial erosion.  This project will investigate the long-term consequences of glacial erosion for topography, exhumation and deformation by study of the Chugach/St. Elias Range, Alaska, an actively deforming glaciated orogenic belt.  Results will enable testes of how deformation and glaciation have influenced orogenic topography over the last few million years.  A better understanding of the role of glaciers in mountain system will provide a more complete context for the analysis of ancient collisional belts in the rock record.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
