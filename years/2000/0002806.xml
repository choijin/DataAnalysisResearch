<AbstractNarration>     Biological functions are dictated by the shapes and movements of macromolecules.  Understand and modulating biological systems therefore requires the ability to determine the structures and dynamics of macromolecules in solution.  To facilitate such studies, the University of Utah has recently built and staffed a new Center for Biomolecular Nuclear Magnetic Resonance.  The Center provides NMR resources for research groups studying structural aspects of HIV assembly, RNA biochemistry, DNA transcription, chromatin organization, natural product chemistry, metalloprotein function, intracellular signaling, protein folding and macromolecular trafficking.  NMR Center management is provided by two co-directors, who oversee a lab manager and a service technician.  Management polices are evaluated on a semi-annual basis by a faculty advisory committee to ensure that the facility runs efficiently and equitably.&lt;br/&gt;     This award supports the purchase of a Varian INOVA 600 NMR spectrometer to be housed in the Center.  Biomolecular structure determinations currently being performed will benefit greatly from the increased sensitivity and dispersion realized in increasing the available field strength from 500 to 600 MHz, as well as with the new state of the art electronic and hardware capabilities of the INOVA 600. &lt;br/&gt;     The bulk of the NMR instrument time will be allotted to four major and six minor user groups who are drawn from seven different academic departments at the University of Utah.  Thus, in addition to its utility as a research instrument, the INOVA 600 NMR spectrometer will facilitate training in structural biology for a large group of graduate students and postdoctoral associates doing research in many different aspects of the biomedical sciences.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
