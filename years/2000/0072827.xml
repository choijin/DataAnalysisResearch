<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal concerns parameter estimation methodology for an&lt;br/&gt;important class of statistical models.  These models, which we refer&lt;br/&gt;to as ``generalized hierarchical models'' (GHMs), have proven to be&lt;br/&gt;extremely useful in a wide range of scientific endeavors.  Specific&lt;br/&gt;examples of applications that have appeared in the scientific&lt;br/&gt;literature include: the impact of passive smoking, changes in voting&lt;br/&gt;behavior, clinical trials for a treatment for epilepsy, social surveys&lt;br/&gt;of households in rural China, sheep cloning experiments, the&lt;br/&gt;estimation of animal abundance and the analysis of multivariate&lt;br/&gt;survival data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A general purpose algorithm for estimation called EM&lt;br/&gt;(expectation-maximization) is particularly suited to the GHM setting.&lt;br/&gt;However, implementation the algorithm is complicated because it often&lt;br/&gt;involves the calculation of intractable multi-dimensional integrals.&lt;br/&gt;Two methods for dealing with these integrals that have received some&lt;br/&gt;attention recently are Monte Carlo EM (MCEM) and Stochastic&lt;br/&gt;Approximation EM (SAEM).  Both methods involve replacing intractable&lt;br/&gt;integrals by Monte Carlo approximations.  Unfortunately, applications&lt;br/&gt;of the these Monte Carlo fitting algorithms to GHMs can often take&lt;br/&gt;hours or even days to converge.  This has limited their widespread use&lt;br/&gt;so far.  The situation will no doubt improve with the availability of&lt;br/&gt;faster computers.  However, the development of much faster algorithms&lt;br/&gt;would accelerate this process tremendously.  Hence, the proposed&lt;br/&gt;research concerns a detailed comparison of the MCEM and SAEM&lt;br/&gt;algorithms with a view towards substantially improving their&lt;br/&gt;performance.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
