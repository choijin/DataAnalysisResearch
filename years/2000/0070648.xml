<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This mathematical research focuses on problems for nonlinear&lt;br/&gt;equations of Monge-Ampere type and also for homogenization of&lt;br/&gt;linear and nonlinear equations. For Monge-Ampere type equations,&lt;br/&gt;the problems concentrate on the study of geometric properties of&lt;br/&gt;their solutions and regularity. In particular, a question proposed&lt;br/&gt;is to establish Holder regularity of derivatives of generalized&lt;br/&gt;solutions for an equation that appears in geometric optics for the&lt;br/&gt;synthesis of reflector antennas. The methodology that will be used&lt;br/&gt;to solve this set of problems is using appropriate maximum&lt;br/&gt;principles, localization and nonlinear variants of the&lt;br/&gt;Calderon-Zygmund decomposition. Concerning homogenization, we&lt;br/&gt;developed an abstract scheme that yields convergence in $L^p$&lt;br/&gt;spaces of correctors for a large class of equations and&lt;br/&gt;systems. We propose to investigate the validity of results of the&lt;br/&gt;same nature for problems of homogenization in perforated domains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This mathematical research is in the field of partial differential&lt;br/&gt;equations, linear and nonlinear. These equations are the principal&lt;br/&gt;classical tool of the applications of mathematics to the physical&lt;br/&gt;world. The project has a strong connection with Harmonic Analysis&lt;br/&gt;in Euclidean space, a subject that has flourished during the&lt;br/&gt;second half of the twentieth century and that has become an&lt;br/&gt;indispensable tool to provide qualitative and quantitative&lt;br/&gt;information about the solutions of partial differential equations.&lt;br/&gt;The problems proposed in the first part are motivated from the&lt;br/&gt;engineering problem of construction of reflector antennas. The&lt;br/&gt;second part of the project is related with the description of the&lt;br/&gt;behavior of transmission of heat or electricity in materials with&lt;br/&gt;periodic structure such us polymers, crystals and layered media.&lt;br/&gt;In particular, we are interested in obtaining accurate&lt;br/&gt;approximations of the solutions that describe these phenomena.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
