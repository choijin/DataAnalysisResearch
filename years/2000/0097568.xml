    <AbstractNarration>This award provides funds for a Field School in Biocultural Anthropology at &lt;br/&gt;the University of Notre Dame. The program will engage a diverse &lt;br/&gt;pool of talented undergraduates in an experiential learning &lt;br/&gt;environment that immerses them in anthropological method and theory. &lt;br/&gt;Using the large Byzantine St. Stephen's skeletal collection from &lt;br/&gt;Jerusalem as the cornerstone for study, historical and archaeological &lt;br/&gt;information will be synthesized in a biocultural reconstruction of &lt;br/&gt;ancient monastic life. Students will engage in original research to &lt;br/&gt;develop a suite of methodological skills in the sciences and enhance &lt;br/&gt;their capability for collaborative research. They will share in a &lt;br/&gt;field trip program to area research sites, libraries, museums, and a &lt;br/&gt;functioning monastery to gain an understanding of the cultural &lt;br/&gt;parameters affecting human adaptability. Exploration of ethical &lt;br/&gt;issues related to the politics of archaeology, treatment of &lt;br/&gt;artifacts, and repatriation will focus attention on scientific &lt;br/&gt;ethics, an important foundation for future research endeavors. &lt;br/&gt;Finally, a dynamic lecture program delivered by an international team &lt;br/&gt;of scholars in the fields of anthropology, biology, history, &lt;br/&gt;classics, geography, theology, and Near Eastern studies will &lt;br/&gt;crystallize the importance of a holistic approach for studying the &lt;br/&gt;past. The biocultural field school will provide an &lt;br/&gt;intellectually energizing learning experience, which will equip &lt;br/&gt;participants with a suite of talents for viewing their surroundings. &lt;br/&gt;The integration of practical research skills, ethical inquiry, and &lt;br/&gt;the synthesis of disciplinary paradigms for viewing human interaction &lt;br/&gt;will prove useful as students move into graduate or professional &lt;br/&gt;careers in the natural and social sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award contributes to the Foundation's continuing efforts to attract&lt;br/&gt;talented students into careers in science through active undergraduate &lt;br/&gt;research experiences.</AbstractNarration>
