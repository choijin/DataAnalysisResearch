    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0071390&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Thomas E. Cecil&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator and his collaborators, Quo-Shin Chi&lt;br/&gt;and Gary Jensen, will study submanifolds of Euclidean space and&lt;br/&gt;the sphere within the context of Lie sphere geometry. Of&lt;br/&gt;particular interest are submanifolds with special curvature&lt;br/&gt;properties. These include isoparametric hypersurfaces, which&lt;br/&gt;have constant principal curvatures, and Dupin hypersurfaces,&lt;br/&gt;which have the property that each principal curvature is constant&lt;br/&gt;along each of its corresponding curvature surfaces. The main&lt;br/&gt;problems to be studied are the classification of isoparametric&lt;br/&gt;hypersurfaces of the sphere with four principal curvatures, and&lt;br/&gt;the classification of locally irreducible Dupin hypersurfaces&lt;br/&gt;with four or six principal curvatures. This research is&lt;br/&gt;primarily local in nature, using the method of moving frames in&lt;br/&gt;Lie sphere geometry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on an important class of surfaces, Dupin&lt;br/&gt;surfaces, which have very special curvature properties. Examples&lt;br/&gt;of Dupin surfaces are planes, spheres, circular cylinders and the&lt;br/&gt;cyclides of Dupin, which have been useful in recent years in&lt;br/&gt;advanced computer-aided design. Dupin surfaces have higher&lt;br/&gt;dimensional analogues which were first studied by the great&lt;br/&gt;French mathematician Elie Cartan in the 1930's and which have&lt;br/&gt;been researched extensively by many mathematicians over the past&lt;br/&gt;thirty years. The goal of the proposed research is to classify&lt;br/&gt;these higher dimensional Dupin surfaces. Another important&lt;br/&gt;aspect of the proposal is the principal investigator's mentoring&lt;br/&gt;work with undergraduate students. Over the period of the grant,&lt;br/&gt;three undergraduate students will be supported by the grant for a&lt;br/&gt;summer of directed independent study in an area related to the&lt;br/&gt;principal investigator's own research. Each of these students&lt;br/&gt;will then write an honors thesis based on this study. In the&lt;br/&gt;past ten years, most of the students who have written honors&lt;br/&gt;theses under the principal investigator's supervision have then&lt;br/&gt;pursued graduate study in mathematics. In this way, the&lt;br/&gt;principal investigator's previous grants have played a&lt;br/&gt;significant role in the education of some of the next generation&lt;br/&gt;of scientists.</AbstractNarration>
