<AbstractNarration>Proposal:  DMS-0071852&lt;br/&gt;PI: David Gabai&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;During the last 100 years there has been tremendous interest in&lt;br/&gt;understanding the topology and geometry of 3-dimensional manifolds.  In&lt;br/&gt;part, because a 3-manifold is (roughly speaking) a mathematical object&lt;br/&gt;modeled on our familiar 3-dimensional environment.  A 3-manifold has the&lt;br/&gt;property that sufficiently small subsets can be parametrized by 3&lt;br/&gt;coordinates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The problem of characterizing the geometry and topology of surfaces, i.e.,&lt;br/&gt;manifolds of dimension 2, was completely answered nearly a century ago.  It&lt;br/&gt;was determined that the only closed orientable connected surfaces are the&lt;br/&gt;sphere, torus, and the multi-holed tori.    Furthermore, such surfaces can&lt;br/&gt;be given geometries of constant curvature, +1 for the sphere, 0 for the&lt;br/&gt;torus, and -1 for the other surfaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although great progress has been made during the last century, the&lt;br/&gt;situation for dimension-3 is not nearly so well understood.  Nevertheless a&lt;br/&gt;conjectural picture for the structure of 3-manifolds emerged almost 25&lt;br/&gt;years ago (by Thurston) and there has been much theoretical and&lt;br/&gt;experimental evidence supporting his conjecture.   The hyperbolic&lt;br/&gt;3-manifolds, i.e. the manifolds of constant -1 curvature, play a central&lt;br/&gt;role in this picture.  In this proposal the PI in collaboration with&lt;br/&gt;various other mathematicians, plan to investigate the structure of&lt;br/&gt;hyperbolic manifolds and the structure of manifolds which are conjecturally&lt;br/&gt;hyperbolic.  In particular they will study the structure of the&lt;br/&gt;diffeomorphism group of hyperbolic 3-manifolds, and the structure of&lt;br/&gt;hyperbolic 3-manifolds of low volume. They will also address whether or not&lt;br/&gt;a closed aspherical, atoroidal, 3-manifold has a Gromov negatively curved&lt;br/&gt;fundamental group.  A positive resolution would imply that a 3-manifold&lt;br/&gt;which is conjecturally hyperbolic, has at least the coarse algebraic&lt;br/&gt;structure of a hyperbolic 3-manifold.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
