<AbstractNarration>Proposal:  DMS-0072429&lt;br/&gt;PI: Robert Myers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract::&lt;br/&gt;Over the years a nice conjectural picture has emerged of the&lt;br/&gt;structure of closed 3-manifolds. It has been shaped by the&lt;br/&gt;geometrization and virtual bundle conjectures of Thurston&lt;br/&gt;and the compactification conjectures of Simon and of Marden.&lt;br/&gt;These imply certain consequences for covering spaces of such&lt;br/&gt;3-manifolds. Closed, orientable, irreducible 3-manifolds with&lt;br/&gt;infinite fundamental group ought to have universal covering&lt;br/&gt;space homeomorphic to Euclidean 3-space. Professor Myers will&lt;br/&gt;continue his work on this problem by ruling out classes of&lt;br/&gt;possible counterexamples through an analysis of group actions&lt;br/&gt;on Whitehead manifolds; he will use a new result which promises&lt;br/&gt;to extend his work on Whitehead manifolds which contain&lt;br/&gt;non-trivial planes to those which do not. More generally,&lt;br/&gt;covering spaces with finitely generated fundamental group ought&lt;br/&gt;to be homeomorphic to interiors of compact 3-manifolds. He will&lt;br/&gt;continue his work on this problem and on the closely related&lt;br/&gt;problem of showing that the same conclusion holds for hyperbolic&lt;br/&gt;3-manifolds with finitely generated fundamental group. Freedman&lt;br/&gt;has reduced the latter problem to a purely topological problem&lt;br/&gt;which seems accessible. Hyperbolic 3-manifolds of finite volume&lt;br/&gt;ought to be finitely covered by surface bundles over the circle,&lt;br/&gt;although very few non-trivial examples of this phenomenon are known.&lt;br/&gt;Myers will attempt to construct more such examples and will explore&lt;br/&gt;the extent to which the desired conclusion is implied by the failure&lt;br/&gt;of the finitely generated intersection property in the fundamental&lt;br/&gt;group. 3-manifolds with cubings of negative curvature ought to&lt;br/&gt;be hyperbolic; Myers will investigate a method for trying to build&lt;br/&gt;hyperbolic structures, trying to determine both its scope and&lt;br/&gt;limitations. Finally, he will attempt to construct small knots in&lt;br/&gt;non-Haken 3-manifolds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Manifolds are spaces which generalize the familiar curves and&lt;br/&gt;surfaces that live in ordinary 3-dimensional space. An n-manifold&lt;br/&gt;locally looks like n-dimensional space; thus a curve is a 1-manifold,&lt;br/&gt;and a surface is a 2-manifold. 3-manifolds are difficult to&lt;br/&gt;visualize but can be described mathematically. Such spaces arise&lt;br/&gt;as models of the universe in general relativity; in this role&lt;br/&gt;they come equipped with geometries, i.e. ways of measuring distances,&lt;br/&gt;angles, and curvature. Conjectures of Thurston, Simon, and Marden&lt;br/&gt;suggest that the members of a large class of 3-manifolds have&lt;br/&gt;particularly nice geometries and can be constructed from the&lt;br/&gt;members of a small set of standard 3-manifolds by identifying&lt;br/&gt;their points in certain ways. Professor Myers will attempt to&lt;br/&gt;verify various important special cases of this conjectural picture.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
