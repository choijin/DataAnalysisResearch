<AbstractNarration>Biological Sciences (61) &lt;br/&gt;Our first- year Biology laboratory is being revised significantly by adapting and implementing "A Computer- Based Laboratory for Teaching Investigative Research in Physiology" (A. M. Smith, NSF- DUE award #9650721). This program uses computers connected to instrumentation for laboratories conducted in an inquiry- based framework. Our adaptation of this approach is to make an explicit link to a faculty research program( s) during each lab investigation. Each laboratory is designed around investigation of a central biological principle. Students are given the time and latitude to design experiments, collect, and analyze data related to understanding that principle and to compare this data to that generated in faculty research laboratories. In redesigning these labs, we are working toward the following goals:1) Increased "biological literacy" among our students, 2) Increased understanding of Science as a Process, 3) Improved student attitudes toward Biology, 4) Increased retention of Biology majors, and 5) Modeling of Inquiry- Based Learning for science education majors. Principles of Biology is a two- semester introductory biology sequence for majors that also enrolls a significant contingent of science education majors. The PI and Co- PI have recently been trained in Inquiry- Based pedagogies through participation in F. I. R. S. T.( Faculty Institutes for Reforming Science Teaching through field stations, NSF award # 9752713). As a result, we have completely changed how we teach our sections of the Principles lecture, from a lecture format to an inquiry- based/ cooperative learning format. Our preliminary data and anecdotal feedback from students convinced us that this style of teaching is effective and exciting for both faculty and students. This project applies these innovative pedagogical techniques to the laboratory. The infusion of faculty research into the student laboratory classes also feeds our growing undergraduate research program by advertising faculty research to students and by including students in faculty research projects from the beginning of their undergraduate careers. Assessment is under the guidance of a national expert, Dr. Ebert- May, Director of the Lyman Briggs School at Michigan State Univ. Assessment is rigorous, tied to the project's goals, and is both formative and summative. It is our long- term goal to provide Inquiry- Based Learning for every science major at the University of Akron. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
