    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the demand for structurally efficient damage-tolerant engineering materials. New and ingenious methods are required to generate novel, application-specific materials, particularly for the service temperatures between 400C and 650C. Metal matrix composites (MMCs), characterized by a metallic alloy matrix (typically aluminum or titanium) reinforced with a second phase ceramic (typically carbides or borides) have emerged as promising candidates offering increased specific strength and modulus, at ambient and elevated temperature at the expense of ductility. The opportunity exists to create novel Non-Equilibrium Metallic Composites (NMCs) using metallic second phase reinforcing constituents, thereby combining the load sharing advantages of MMCs while maintaining the practical service advantages of a totally metallic material. This new class of materials can be created by powder metallurgy, using solid-state diffusion to generate the non- equilibrium structures. Based upon promising preliminary investigations with the titanium- tungsten system, tungsten particle reinforced titanium alloy test bars will be produced for critical microstructural, physical and mechanical property evaluation in this program. It is anticipated that increased specific strength for intermediate service temperature can be achieved without sacrifice in toughness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Non-Equilibrium Metallic Composite materials being investigated in this program could be applied to four major market areas: industrial transportation (engine/automotive), biomedical and aerospace/defense where tailored compositions could offer significant competitive advantage.</AbstractNarration>
