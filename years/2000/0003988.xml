<AbstractNarration>Meat-sharing with close kin and unrelated adults is believed to be one of&lt;br/&gt;the most significant dietary changes to occur in the course of human&lt;br/&gt;evolution. Despite its importance there is no consensus on when, why or how&lt;br/&gt;sharing emerged among ancestral hominids. The problem lies not only in our&lt;br/&gt;inability to confidently identify different sharing behaviors from the&lt;br/&gt;archaeological record, but the lack of a theoretical framework for&lt;br/&gt;understanding how and why sharing operates. With National Science Foundation&lt;br/&gt;support Dr. Karen Lupo and a team of researchers will conduct two seasons of&lt;br/&gt;ethnoarchaeological research on meat-sharing among Bofi foragers. The Bofi&lt;br/&gt;occupy lush forested regions of the Ngotto Forest Reserve in the Central&lt;br/&gt;African Republic and procure most of their food by hunting and gathering.&lt;br/&gt;The research is guided by a larger theoretical context which views sharing&lt;br/&gt;among family and between unrelated adults as fulfilling very different&lt;br/&gt;goals. Provisioning, or sharing among family members, enhances the&lt;br/&gt;survivability of close kin. But sharing with unrelated adults is aimed at&lt;br/&gt;enhancing a hunters social status. The theory predicts that hunters will&lt;br/&gt;vary their choice of prey depending upon their overall goal (provisioning or&lt;br/&gt;status enhancement). The research team will use direct observations,&lt;br/&gt;informant interviews and animal bone collections from different hunters and&lt;br/&gt;their households to test salient aspects of this theory. These techniques&lt;br/&gt;will allow the team to collect quantitative data on what hunters procure and&lt;br/&gt;how much of it is shared and consumed by close family and unrelated adults.&lt;br/&gt;Data collected with these techniques will be used to investigate the&lt;br/&gt;following research questions: 1) Does meat-sharing vary predictably by prey type? If so, what&lt;br/&gt;characteristics predict which prey will be shared with family and unrelated&lt;br/&gt;adults? 2) Do hunters vary their pursuit effort of different types of prey depending&lt;br/&gt;on their overall goal (provision family or enhance status)? 3) What is the material link between different sharing behaviors and the archaeological record?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The importance of this research is far-reaching. This project will be the&lt;br/&gt;first systematic and quantitative study of prey choice and meat-sharing ever&lt;br/&gt;conducted among contemporary foragers. This research will also examine and&lt;br/&gt;identify the links between different sharing strategies, as reflected by&lt;br/&gt;animal bones, and the material record. This latter point is particularly&lt;br/&gt;important for archaeological investigations. The project combines&lt;br/&gt;ethnoarchaeological research with a theoretical framework that will help&lt;br/&gt;explain how and why sharing operates in a contemporary setting. By&lt;br/&gt;extension, it will provide important new insights into the evolution of&lt;br/&gt;sharing among ancestral hominids. Finally, very little is known about the&lt;br/&gt;Bofi foragers. Thus far, only one other study has ever been conducted in&lt;br/&gt;this area. This research will expand current understanding of contemporary&lt;br/&gt;forager ecology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
