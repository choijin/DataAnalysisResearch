<AbstractNarration>This research project addresses the detailed dynamics of photoinduced reactions at well-characterized solid surfaces.  Using angle resolved time-of-flight measurements, Professor Ian Harrison and his students at the University of Virginia are exploring the photoactivation of adsorbates such as N2, CO2, and methane.  With the support of the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program this work provides detailed insight into the mechanisms of small molecule activation at surfaces, with strong implications for the development and improvement of heterogeneous catalytic methods.  Charge transfer excitation of these adsorbed molecules followed by analysis of the desorbed products, allows this group to probe the details of the transition state for photostimulated as well as thermally stimulated surface reactions.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The photoexcitation of adsorbed molecules can be used to probe the dynamics of more common thermally activated processes on surfaces.  This research project uses fast laser excitation of adsorbates, followed by angle resolved measurements of product velocities to provide information about the detailed dynamics of several important small molecule reactions on well-characterized surfaces.  The results of these photodynamic studies are then applied to the understanding of the mechanisms of thermally activated catalytic reactions of considerable importance.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
