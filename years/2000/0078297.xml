<AbstractNarration>0078297&lt;br/&gt;Bernardo&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The action potential is the universal signal in the nervous system throughout the animal kingdom.  Action potentials are very similar in different parts of the nervous system and between different animals.  Information is instead encoded in the temporal pattern of series of action potentials.  Several factors contribute to generating these patterns, among these the diversity of ion channels carrying, potassium (K*) ions (K* channels) is one of the main contributors to shaping neural signals.  A large number of new K* channels have been discovered recently through genetic analysis, and this is likely to increase as the full sequence of the genomes of several animals becomes known.  A major task of future research is to understand the physiological roles of these genes.  This project will study a new K*channel gene, known as Eag2, identified and cloned in the applicant's laboratory.  Eag genes have been introduced into model cells, where they result in the formation properties.  The task is to determine if they have the same properties in their native environment in the brain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To discover the functional roles of Eag channels, experiments are design to explore which brain cells normally express the products of these genes.  Electrophysiological techniques are then used to study their properties in native cells, and their role in shaping neuronal signals.  Preliminary studies suggest that Eag genes are specifically expressed in neurons in the cerebral cortex that are the main recipients of sensory information.  This project will test the hypothesis that Eag channels have crucial functions in regulating whether or not sensory information enters the cerebral cortex and hence in determining states of consciousness.  This study will unravel the function of novel K* channel genes and advance our understanding of the mechanisms by which the brain processes application in discovering the roles of the newly found genes.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
