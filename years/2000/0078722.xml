    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project's goal is a commercial&lt;br/&gt;quality liquid crystal exhibiting V-shaped switching with no hysteresis. This LC will be&lt;br/&gt;used in gray-scale displays and telecommunications optical switches.&lt;br/&gt;Ferroelectric liquid crystals (FLCs), due to their fast switching speed and wide&lt;br/&gt;viewing angle, have inherent advantages over the more commonly used nematic liquid&lt;br/&gt;crystals. However, when used in displays, they have a disadvantage - they generally can&lt;br/&gt;be driven to only two states, on and off. Since displays require intermediate gray states,&lt;br/&gt;FLCs currently attain gray scale by rapidly switching on and off. This project uses a new&lt;br/&gt;type of FLC which, in addition to its speed and viewing angle advantage, also shows&lt;br/&gt;analog switching. This type of material, previously known as a "thresholdless&lt;br/&gt;antiferroelectric", is now known to be an FLC with a linear optical response to applied&lt;br/&gt;field (also known as "V-shaped switching").&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project's objective is to make new liquid crystal compounds and mixtures that&lt;br/&gt;exhibit V-shaped switching. Towards that end, a variety of cores, chiral tails, and achiral&lt;br/&gt;tails, all of which are either known or suspected to promote a de Vries-type smectic A,&lt;br/&gt;have been proposed. About 50 - 100 liquid crystals will be synthesized by combining&lt;br/&gt;these various components. These new LCs will be combined with LCs made in the Phase&lt;br/&gt;I or earlier, giving mixtures that ideally will have not only a de Vries smectic A phase,&lt;br/&gt;but also a wide room-temperature smectic C phase, good low-voltage analog electrooptic&lt;br/&gt;response, good alignability, and fast hysteresis-free switching. An optimal alignment&lt;br/&gt;layer configuration will be determined. The newly formulated mixtures will be placed in&lt;br/&gt;cells containing this alignment layer to give V-shaped switching displays.&lt;br/&gt;This project could be instrumental in advancing our knowledge of the root causes of&lt;br/&gt;V-shaped switching in FLC and, by extension, add insight into the responses of self-assembling molecules to applied forces. In addition, since the interaction of the alignment&lt;br/&gt;layer with the liquid crystal is crucial for V-shaped switching, much more so than for&lt;br/&gt;typical FLCs, this project will provide a better understanding of the alignment layer-LC&lt;br/&gt;interactions.</AbstractNarration>
