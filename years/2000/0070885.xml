<AbstractNarration>   The investigator develops efficient algorithms, as well as&lt;br/&gt;additional techniques and methodologies, that can be used to&lt;br/&gt;solve the noncommutative algebraic components of problems in&lt;br/&gt;analysis and engineering.  The noncommutative algebraic component&lt;br/&gt;of such a problem consists of solving a collection of equations&lt;br/&gt;where each of the variables represents a matrix or bounded linear&lt;br/&gt;transformation.  Solving such problems involves manipulating this&lt;br/&gt;collection of equations until it is amenable to numerical&lt;br/&gt;solution or until the manipulated collection has some desirable&lt;br/&gt;property.  Methodologies based on noncommutative Groebner basis&lt;br/&gt;were developed in a paper by J.  William Helton and the&lt;br/&gt;investigator in 1998 and these techniques are effective for&lt;br/&gt;solving a short list of problems.  Several directions of study&lt;br/&gt;for the current project include removing the need for additional&lt;br/&gt;"invertibility assumptions," removing redundant equations, and&lt;br/&gt;finding appropriate changes of variables.  The new approaches&lt;br/&gt;should widen the range of problems that can be solved.&lt;br/&gt;     Ordinary arithmetic is commutative: 2 times 5 is the same as&lt;br/&gt;5 times 2, and in fact A times B is the same as B times A for any&lt;br/&gt;numbers A and B.  The arithmetic of matrices -- rectangular arrays&lt;br/&gt;of numbers that can represent, for example, the forces on&lt;br/&gt;diferent parts of a bridge or airplane -- is not commutative: A&lt;br/&gt;times B is not always the same as B times A.  The development and&lt;br/&gt;implementation of algorithms for solving collections of&lt;br/&gt;polynomial equations spurred a great amount of activity in&lt;br/&gt;commutative algebra.  In an analogous way, the development of&lt;br/&gt;algorithms and methodologies for solving collections of matrix&lt;br/&gt;equations can have a dramatic impact on solving engineering and&lt;br/&gt;analysis problems that have noncommutative algebraic components,&lt;br/&gt;where the order in which components of the calculation are&lt;br/&gt;arranged can change the answers.  With currently developed&lt;br/&gt;techniques, some computations that arise commonly in engineering&lt;br/&gt;require a considerable amount of time to perform by hand, but can&lt;br/&gt;be done very quickly on a computer.  The development of new&lt;br/&gt;methods for noncommutative algebra should significantly increase&lt;br/&gt;the number and types of problems that can be solved efficiently&lt;br/&gt;with the assistance of computers.</AbstractNarration>
