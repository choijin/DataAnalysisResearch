    <AbstractNarration>DEB-0090638&lt;br/&gt;James R. Garey&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A grant has been awarded to James R. Garey of the University of South Florida to support a symposium entitled "The 'Lesser Known' Protostome Taxa: Evolution, Development and Ecology". The symposium is to be held on January 4, 2001 as part of the Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology (SICB) meeting in Chicago, IL. The purpose of the symposium is to encourage the use and study of animal groups such as onychophorans, nematomorphs and kinorhynchs in research and teaching, and to showcase the importance of broad systematic study of animals. The symposium is timely insofar as these lesser known phyla are becoming important in testing new hypotheses of animal phylogeny, studying the evolution of developmental patterning, and as important organisms in comparative genomics, physiology and ecology. Results of the symposium will be published in the American Zoologist.</AbstractNarration>
