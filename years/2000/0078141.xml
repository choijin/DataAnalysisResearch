<AbstractNarration>The large number of immigrants arriving in the U.S. on a yearly basis continues to raise questions relating to their distribution and assimilation within American society.  Recently, the older notions of assimilation into white, middle class America based upon European experiences early in the 20th century have been questioned, particularly in light of the experiences of Asian and Latin American immigrants.  As an alternative, the segmented assimilation framework developed by Alejandro Portes in 1989 recognizes differential paths of assimilation into American society, hinging upon the context of immigration (i.e., voluntary or forced), reception by the host country, and the resources that immigrants bring with them.  This framework has become an influential hypothesis of immigrant assimilation, but lacks a geographical (spatial) dimension.  Using segmented assimilation as a foundation, this project proposes a spatially segmented assimilation framework, recognizing that differences in the spatial organization of immigrant groups will exist.  Embedded within this proposed framework are three questions.  First, how do settlement geographies differ with respect to national origin, immigrant status, and across metropolitan areas?  Second, what differences are observed between successive arrival cohorts with respect to settlement and assimilation?  Third, do different origin groups follow similar progressions through a generalized settlement system?  The objectives of the research include: the assessment or empirical testing of spatial extensions to the segmented assimilation framework; across-group differences in migration, determinants and assimilation; how the geography of immigrant settlement changes over time by national origin; and, the impact of admission category upon settlement patterns of the foreign-born.  The empirical analysis will study assimilation at the intra- (between city) and inter-metropolitan (within city) scales, focusing upon the twelve largest immigrant groups in the U.S. in 1990.  Data will be drawn from linked 1980 and 1990 Public Use Microdata Samples (PUMS) from the U.S. census, along with data from yearly Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) data. This INS data includes information relating to immigrant status and allows the settlement pattern of groups to be evaluated in non-census years.  The empirical analysis will utilize methods already developed and suitable for migration studies, including descriptive and multivariate techniques and more recent techniques of spatial data analysis.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Immigration and assimilation have received considerable attention within both the academic and political arenas as witnessed by welfare reform in 1996 and California's Proposition 187 in 1994. Underlying these questions is the very timely assimilation debate - what it means, how it is measured, who it is applied to, and its implications and outcomes.  Throwing aside traditional and stereotypical notions of assimilation, the research argues that assimilation into American society will occur differentially over space, time, and by origin group, making it a much more complex process than is currently revealed.  The research will extend knowledge of the spatial assimilation of immigrants by tracing the evolution of the settlement system over space through concurrent census periods while focussing upon particular groups of immigrants rather than the aggregate immigrant population. As such, the spatial detail within the project will be finer than has commonly been achieved in the past.  The research will consequently engage the assimilation debate from both a theoretical and empirical perspective. Linking the 1980 and 1990 census files, as well as using INS data from the 1990s will provide a modest but important temporal dimension and insight into the development of the settlement patterns over time. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
