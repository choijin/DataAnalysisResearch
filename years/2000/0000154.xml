<AbstractNarration> &lt;br/&gt;This grant provides funding for the development of a numerical tool for determining optimal process parameters in bulk forming processes,&lt;br/&gt;such as rolling, extrusion, and forging. The developed numerical tool will determine the optimal process geometry; temperature and speed&lt;br/&gt;that satisfy specified design criteria for a given two-dimensional forming process. An optimization algorithm based on an adaptive arbitrary&lt;br/&gt;Lagrangian-Eulerian finite element formulation for modeling large deformation thermo-elasto-viscoplastic contact problems will be used.&lt;br/&gt;The algorithm will be implemented in the context of an existing advanced computational framework that has tools for mesh generation,&lt;br/&gt;adaptivity, and parallel computing. Experiments involving the extrusion process will also be performed to validate the algorithms&lt;br/&gt;developed. Experimental dies will be manufactured according to the optimal die shapes predicted in this work and tested at the predicted&lt;br/&gt;optimal die speeds. A model press, which can extrude plasticine material marked with a grid, will be used in these experiments to observe&lt;br/&gt;the material flow behavior. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research will lead to improvements in the design of bulk forming processes and new developments in&lt;br/&gt;optimization methods for handling complex nonlinear problems. The primary goal of this work is to determine optimal process geometry,&lt;br/&gt;thermal conditions, and process speed in bulk forming processes that will satisfy typically prescribed design criteria. These design criteria&lt;br/&gt;may include generating a uniform flow of the material, generating a specified material property distribution in the formed product,&lt;br/&gt;minimizing the production time, or minimizing the energy required for the process. Determining the process parameters to achieve these&lt;br/&gt;objectives will help to reduce the cost and improve the quality of the final product in processes such as extrusion and forging. The&lt;br/&gt;proposed work will also contribute to the computational tools and methodologies available for nonlinear optimization problems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
