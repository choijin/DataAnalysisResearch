<AbstractNarration>     With the shrinking size of tetherless computing devices and increasing diversity in capabilities, the value of ubiquitous computing is rapidly becoming real. As these devices proliferate in number, their configuration, management, and organization as ad-hoc networking environments proves to be a challenging research domain. In most scenarios the interaction of these devices enables a broad range of applications. A group of such devices can communicate with each other to achieve a goal specific to the application, i.e., they perform a higher-level task or service by communicating intelligently with each other. This proposal is to investigate and develop a distributed framework for executing complex tasks not by using pre-configured devices but by selecting suitable computing elements based on task requirements and device characteristics. A prerequisite and enabling component for this work is the creation of a set of self-organization protocols for connecting and managing these computing elements with minimal application intervention during the lifetime of the task. Such protocols are referred to as "smart" protocols.&lt;br/&gt;     Existing protocols for organizing devices are constrained by their dependence on available infrastructure&lt;br/&gt;primarily because of the use of directory-based service discovery and are therefore less valuable for a truly ad-hoc computing environment. A key premise of this proposal is that the nature of the task can be exploited&lt;br/&gt;to organize ubiquitous computing devices into logical task based groups. Tasks are then represented by&lt;br/&gt;dependency or task graphs that describe how devices interact with each other. A distributed mechanism is&lt;br/&gt;proposed for constructing and embedding a task graph on a network of computing elements for"\smart" task&lt;br/&gt;execution. Additionally, a task-aware routing protocol for reducing routing delays is proposed. An expected&lt;br/&gt;outcome of this approach is the ease with which larger, more complex services can be composed from smaller&lt;br/&gt;services. These protocols can thus be rapidly deployed in ad-hoc environments enabling new applications in&lt;br/&gt;diverse areas such as smart homes and offices, distributed robotics, sensor networks, large scale distributed&lt;br/&gt;computing, smart battlefields, crisis management, etc.&lt;br/&gt;     Specific tasks of this research are: (1) the development of efficient distributed algorithms for discovery&lt;br/&gt;of suitable devices that can together perform a distributed task from within a sea of tethered or tetherless&lt;br/&gt;devices, and protocols for execution of those distributed tasks; (2) the development of task aware routing&lt;br/&gt;protocols using key link-state information; (3) specification for the use of state augmentation techniques for&lt;br/&gt;handling nomadicity of users and devices as seamlessly as possible; (4) the simulation of the above protocols&lt;br/&gt;using public domain network simulators; and (5) the implementation of a proof-of-concept prototype using&lt;br/&gt;commodity hardware and software.</AbstractNarration>
