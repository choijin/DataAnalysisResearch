    <AbstractNarration>The proposed project aims at the preparation and characterization of low-dimensional materials containing octahedral metal clusters. A systematic study of niobium oxochlorides containing octahedral Nb6L18 (L = C1, O) clusters will be performed to advance fundamental understanding for the correlation between cluster configuration and framework dimensionality. The long-term goal is to identify and understand the structure determining factors, and ultimately make these types of materials by design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal describes in detail a creative and original approach to prepare cluster-based, low-dimensional materials. The methodology to be explored is the modification of octahedral metal clusters to form building blocks with well-defined anisotropic bonding preferences. To achieve this goal a combination of oxide and chloride ligands is used to create anisotropic charge distribution around the octahedral (Nb6) cluster core. A combination of counterions with large difference in their charge-to-radius ratios and, thus, different coordination preferences is used to enhance anisotropic ligand distribution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work will teach art in its field, and support the education of young scientists who participate in this exciting area of the preparation and characterization of materials. Results and knowledge will be disseminated broadly through the literature and in presentations at regional, national, and international conferences. The work addresses strongly the broad scientific and educational mission of the National Science Foundation.</AbstractNarration>
