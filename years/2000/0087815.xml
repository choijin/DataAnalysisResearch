<AbstractNarration>Mathematical Sciences (21)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is improving student learning in precalculus and calculus, providing a foundation for further success and retention in upper level mathematics and science courses, and enhancing student learning outcomes for non-science majors. This addresses four specific problems: (1) limited computer laboratory facilities, (2) low student success rates in precalculus and calculus, (3) low retention of students in mathematics classes, and (4) low enrollment and retention in related science and engineering courses. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall objective of this project is to make majoring in Science, Math, and Engineering (SME) more accessible through improved student learning in precalculus and calculus, thus empowering students to succeed when they transfer to four year institutions. To achieve this objective the mathematics faculty have established the following goals: (1) adaptation and implementation of exemplary educational materials, and proven techniques of previously funded National Science Foundation projects especially the Connected Curriculum Project and the University of Alabama Integrated Mathematics and Science Curriculum; and (2) establishment on one campus of a Mathematics Laboratory in which to use these new materials, thus creating an effective, interactive learning environment, which also provides Internet access for local students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Activities include the following: (1) requiring all students in precalculus and the calculus sequence to enroll in a mathematics laboratory semester hour class designed to complete mathematics laboratory exercises; (2) enhancing faculty professional development by participation in the Duke University Connected Curriculum Project (CCP) workshops and by consultation with The University of Alabama to adopt and implement effective learning strategies; (3) developing of CCP modules in MATHCAD and MATLAB for use in the mathematics laboratory; (4) developing Internet courses; and (5) collaborating with faculty on other campuses of the college to initiate college wide reform of mathematics education.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
