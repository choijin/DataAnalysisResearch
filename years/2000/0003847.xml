    <AbstractNarration>The National Institute of General Medical Sciences, in cooperation with the National Human Genome Research Institute, the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, the Fogarty International Center, and the National Science Foundation, is sponsoring a meeting in Bethesda on September 25-26, 2000, entitled "Community Consultation for the Responsible Collection and Use of Samples for Genetic Research." &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The planned community consultation in September will bring together individuals from a broad range of ethnic and racial groups to provide input on the concept of oversight groups, or to propose alternative mechanisms by which protection can be afforded. It is hoped, in addition, that this meeting will begin a process of educating and sensitizing the scientific community about issues related to genetic research involving identified populations. We expect approximately 60-70 attendees from outside government agencies.</AbstractNarration>
