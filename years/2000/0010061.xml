<AbstractNarration>This project is part of an ongoing effort by a large number of &lt;br/&gt;researchers to develop a quantum gravity theory, which fully &lt;br/&gt;incorporates quantum principles into general relativity and &lt;br/&gt;gravitation.  Many approaches have been proposed over the years; &lt;br/&gt;currently, the two that are widely regarded as the most promising &lt;br/&gt;ones are superstring theory, which emphasizes the relation of other &lt;br/&gt;forces with gravitation, and quantum geometry, which emphasizes the &lt;br/&gt;need to understand the fundamental structure of space and time. &lt;br/&gt;These two approaches may be related to each other and lead to &lt;br/&gt;complementary views of the same theory, but at present they are being &lt;br/&gt;independently pursued.  This project will contribute to the quantum &lt;br/&gt;geometry approach, which uses the Ashtekar variables for general &lt;br/&gt;relativity and "weaves" or networks of points to replace smooth &lt;br/&gt;space.  The goal is to use statistical techniques and computer &lt;br/&gt;simulations to study in detail (i) which combinations of such &lt;br/&gt;networks are the ones we ordinarily observe as smooth space, and (ii) &lt;br/&gt;how large the uncertainties or fluctuations of space are as a result. &lt;br/&gt;While calculations by other researchers have given approximate, &lt;br/&gt;preliminary results on the first part, the techniques that will be &lt;br/&gt;used in this project are unique in enabling us to address the second &lt;br/&gt;one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the point of view of our basic understanding of nature, the &lt;br/&gt;quantum gravity program is often listed as one of the top outstanding &lt;br/&gt;problems today.  Both quantum theory and general relativity are &lt;br/&gt;supposedly applicable to all physical phenomena, and this can only be &lt;br/&gt;true if they are compatible with each other.  We have reason to &lt;br/&gt;believe that, once we understand their connection well, quantum &lt;br/&gt;gravity will have applications in many different areas, similarly to &lt;br/&gt;what happened with quantum theory almost 100 years ago.  The &lt;br/&gt;suggestion has been made, for example, that quantum gravity sets the &lt;br/&gt;ultimate limits for information storage and computation capabilities. &lt;br/&gt;For the time being, however, we need to test the theory with simpler &lt;br/&gt;predictions that can be verified, such as the effect of these &lt;br/&gt;fluctuating "weaves" on particles and radiation that reach us from &lt;br/&gt;distant galaxies across billions of light years.  Successfully &lt;br/&gt;predicting effects such as this one will lead to progress in quantum &lt;br/&gt;gravity, and will also give us a new tool for the analysis of &lt;br/&gt;information from the most distant parts of the universe.  This &lt;br/&gt;project at the University of Mississippi will contribute by helping &lt;br/&gt;develop a reliable working model for the fluctuating weaves that make &lt;br/&gt;up space, as well as using the excellent computational facilities of &lt;br/&gt;the University and helping train students in the use of computational &lt;br/&gt;techniques.</AbstractNarration>
