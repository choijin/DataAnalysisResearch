    <AbstractNarration>0070303&lt;br/&gt;Lindquist&lt;br/&gt;This FASEB Conference on Amyloid and other Abnormal Protein Assembly Processes, aims to bring together cell biologists and clinicians familiar with the biology of abnormal protein deposition, with geneticists, molecular biologist and biophysicists to work toward an understanding of the molecular basis of this phenomenon. This conference will provide a forum to promote increased awareness of protein deposition as a process of biological importance which exhibits significant molecular structure and specificity. The focus is on the molecular basis of protein aggregation and other manifestatons of protein-protein interactions. The speakers will include leaders in these fields as well as young investigators. The format of the FASEB summer conferences enables free exchange of ideas and interaction of participants.</AbstractNarration>
