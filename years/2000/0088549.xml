<AbstractNarration>This proposed research focuses on the materials growth, device design and fabrication, and&lt;br/&gt;applications of a ZnO monolithically integrated tunable surface acoustic wave (MITSAW) chip. The&lt;br/&gt;novel chip integrates acoustic, optical and electrical process' in one material system. It uses tunable&lt;br/&gt;acousto-electric and acousto-optic interaction between surface acoustic waves (SAW) and a two&lt;br/&gt;dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in a ZnO/MgxZn1-xO quantum well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ZnO is a multifunctional material possessing unique electrical, optical, acoustical, and mechanical&lt;br/&gt;properties. The high electromechanical coupling coefficients of piezoelectric ZnO in conjunction with the&lt;br/&gt;low acoustic loss and high velocity of sapphire (Al2O3) offers high frequency and low loss RF&lt;br/&gt;applications. Alloying ZnO with MgO forms the ternary compound MgxZn1-xO, which permits band-gap&lt;br/&gt;tuning from 3.32 eV to 4 eV. ZnO/MgxZn1-xO heterostructures with 2DEG can be integrated with SAW to&lt;br/&gt;create a unique acoustic velocity tuning mechanism. The 2DEG interacts with the lateral electric field&lt;br/&gt;resulting in ohmic loss, which attenuates and slows the surface acoustic wave. This mechanism is used to&lt;br/&gt;tune the acoustic velocity. The high coupling coefficients offered by the ZnO/R-Al2O3 systems allows&lt;br/&gt;velocity tuning up to 1%. Combined with the optical characteristics of the wide and direct band gap&lt;br/&gt;(~3.3eV) semiconductor ZnO and transparent conductive ZnO electrodes, the MITSAW chip can be used&lt;br/&gt;for UV optical signal processing. The proposed MITSAW consists of a ZnO/MgxZn1-xO quantum well&lt;br/&gt;structure grown on a R-plane sapphire (R-Al2O3) substrate using MOCVD. R-plane sapphire is chosen&lt;br/&gt;instead of the popular C-plane substrate, as this substrate provides in-plane anisotropy in the ZnO layer.&lt;br/&gt;By aligning the device parallel to the c-axis of the ZnO film, Rayleigh type surface acoustic waves are&lt;br/&gt;excited, while Love type SAWs are excited when the devices are aligned perpendicular to the c-axis. The&lt;br/&gt;Rayleigh wave mode is suitable for gaseous environment sensing, while the Love wave mode, which has&lt;br/&gt;no vertical wave component, is ideal for liquid environment sensing. The ZnO MITSAW chip also offers&lt;br/&gt;an acoustic-optical dual mode sensing mechanism. Likewise, the optical properties parallel and&lt;br/&gt;perpendicular to the c-axis are different, allowing novel optical devices, such as high contrast modulators,&lt;br/&gt;to be fabricated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The successful development of the ZnO MITSAW chip technology will provide industry with&lt;br/&gt;state-of-the-art new multifunctional chip technologies. It will not only improve the existing devices but&lt;br/&gt;also develop fundamentally new approaches to many important application areas, including&lt;br/&gt;tunable/adaptive communication systems, novel multi-mode tunable chemical and biochemical sensors,&lt;br/&gt;and optical signal processors such as delay lines and multiplexers.</AbstractNarration>
