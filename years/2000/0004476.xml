<AbstractNarration>Proposal # HRD-0004473&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Rutgers University&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Yakov Epstein &lt;br/&gt;Title: "Special Science Teams (S ST) Continue"&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center for Mathematics, Science, and Computer Education (CMSCE) at Rutgers University proposes the expansion, refinement, and institutionalization of Special Science Teams (SST), a model professional development program for teachers of students with special needs.  Previously, SST developed as a model project that integrates exciting hands-on environmental science activities, equity-focused cooperative learning strategies, and physical and pedagogical modifications in an effort to provide teachers with the skills and knowledge necessary to encourage all children in science, regardless of disability.  SST currently targets grades 3-5 teachers (general education teachers, science teachers, and special education teachers), and exists as a self-contained summer institute. Future activities include creation of a model, for-credit course in environmental science for teachers of students with disabilities, while expanding the curriculum to include extensions for teachers of grades K-6.  The first step in insuring that all students have ample opportunities to enjoy science is ensuring that all teachers have the confidence and competence in science themselves.  Unfortunately, elementary school general education and special education teachers rarely have strong science backgrounds.  Traditional college science courses lack the pedagogical strategies needed by teachers, and science education courses lack solid core content.  To fill this gap, SST Continues will provide practicing teachers, as well as prospective teachers, a strong college level environmental science course taught by college faculty, using the newly-developed SST curriculum, that incorporates modifications for students with disabilities as the laboratory experience.  By providing general and special education teachers and future teachers with strong core science content, specific strategies for modifying hands-on activities, and standards-based environmental science curriculum, SST Continues will ensure that students and teachers realize the many possibilities for persons with disabilities. During Year 1of this three-year award, the current SST professional development model will be expanded from grades 3-5 to grades K-6 in order to serve larger audiences.  During Year 2, a credited, one semester course at Rutgers University that combines extensive core content in environmental science with the curriculum and strategies developed in the SST program will be offered.  SST Summer Institute alumni will serve as laboratory instructors for the course.  During Year 3, a course guide which includes lectures, overheads, and assessments for the college-level course in environmental science, in combination with the revised SST laboratory component, will be prepared so that it can be readily disseminated to both community and four-year colleges throughout the nation. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
