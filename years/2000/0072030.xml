<AbstractNarration>The late 1980's marked the advent of a renewed interest in fundamental areas of tribology, sparked by a number of new experimental and theoretical techniques capable of studying the force of friction in geometries which were well defined at the nanometer scale.  This is an individual investigator award to a female PI at the North Carolina State University at Raleigh.  The research project involves the use of one such new technique, namely the quartz crystal microbalance, to probe critical issues of importance to this field, including (1) understanding the chemical and tribochemical reactions which occur in a sliding contact, and (2) understanding the energy dissipation mechanisms associated with friction at atomic length and time scales. If successful, the project will yield the first atomic-scale images of tribochemical reactions (obtained by combining the microbalance with a scanning tunneling microscope), and will also provide an understanding of the basic energy dissipative mechanisms associated with the recently discovered phenomena of superconductivity-dependent friction.  A complimentary educational component includes (1) ongoing participation of undergraduates in the research, and (2) direct dissemination of state-of-the-art information on friction to instructors developing curriculum on the topic, as well as to more general audiences through lectures and written reviews.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;By most recent estimates, improved attention to friction and wear would save developed countries up to 1.6% of their gross national product, or over $100 billion annually in the U.S. alone. It is thus not surprising that the field of tribology (the study of friction and wear) has long inspired interest in the engineering and materials communities. The late 1980's particularly marked a renaissance in fundamental areas of tribology, sparked by a number of new experimental and theoretical techniques capable of studying the force of friction in geometries that were well defined at the nanometer scale. This is an individual investigator award to a female PI at the North Carolina State University at Raleigh.
