<AbstractNarration>: Development, Understanding, and Control of Aligned Nanofiber/Nanotube Polymer Composites for Engineering Applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award supports two main projects devised to shorten the gap between scientific understanding and engineering of nanofiber/nanotube reinforced polymer composites. The first project will focus on the enhancement of properties by nanofiber/tube alignment, where the composite can then be further processed with conventional composite manufacturing technologies providing for high performance structures. This project will be conducted along with studying the effects of the aligned nanofibers/tubes on the morphological, mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties of the developed composites. The second project will center on the study of the rheology involved in the system. The development of relationships between rheological properties (i.e. viscosity and relaxation modulus) and molecular structure, composition, temperature, time, and pressure will promote the understanding of the composite system and will relate it to process optimization.  For the education component, the PI will develop and teach courses and labs in polymer engineering and polymer processing.  A significant component of the education plan will be the supervision and mentoring of undergraduates at UTPA, 85 percent of whom are Hispanics, first generation college bound who have had limited experiences with scientific research. The opportunity to actively participate in cutting edge research will be an invaluable tool for our students and will foster the desire to continue in research careers. An outreach to middle school students exposing them to a "Magic and Science Show" is also part of the education component. It is designed to encourage and stimulate an interest in science, mathematics, engineering, and technology (SME&amp;T) related courses.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
