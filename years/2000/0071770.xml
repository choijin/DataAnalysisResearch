<AbstractNarration>This individual investigator award is to a professor at Brown University for a project that will explore the physics of magnetoelectronic microstructures. For four decades, the operation of semiconductors has been based on the charge properties of electrons. Now, a new type of electronics- magnetoelectronics - has emerged, which utilizes both the electron spin and charge to enable devices performing novel functions. The objective of this project is to understand and solve some outstanding problems in magnetoelectronic microstructures. The research will focus on systems that are composed of a few magnetic domains. In particular the project will include investigations of magnetization reversal processes, and studies of the origins of magnetically induced electric noise and along with the development of methods to suppress this noise. This research will lead to a more comprehensive understanding of magnetism in microstructures. The results should contribute to the technological development of magnetoelectronics, and to the development of the human resources needed in this critical technology.&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;This individual investigator award is to a professor at Brown University for a project that will explore the physics of magnetoelectronic microstructures. This is an important field for the high-tech industries in the new millenium. For four decades, the operation of semiconductors has been based on the charge properties of electrons. Now, a new type of electronics- magnetoelectronics - has emerged, which utilizes both the electron spin and charge to enable devices performing novel functions. Magnetoelectronic devices are increasingly used in areas such as computer information storage, magnetic sensing, communication, and automobiles. The objective of this project is to understand and solve some outstanding problems in magnetoelectronic microstructures. The research will focus on systems that are composed of a few magnetic domains. In particular the project will include investigations of magnetization reversal processes, and studies of the origins of magnetically induced electric noise and along with the development of methods to suppress this noise. This project will lead to a more comprehensive understanding of magnetism in microstructures. The results should contribute to the technological development of magnetoelectronics, which is a critical technology for our Nation's economy. The project will support graduate students, human resources needed for the high-tech industries.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
