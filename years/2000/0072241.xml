<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0072241&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Elizabeth Werner&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI's research deals with questions in affine geometry and&lt;br/&gt;geometric probability of convex bodies as well as with&lt;br/&gt;applications.  A tool of considerable importance in the area of&lt;br/&gt;isoperimetric inequalities is the affine surface area from affine&lt;br/&gt;differential geometry whose classical definition goes back to&lt;br/&gt;Blaschke and involves the curvature function of a smooth convex&lt;br/&gt;body. An important problem in convex geometry was to extend the&lt;br/&gt;notion of affine surface area to all convex bodies. The solution&lt;br/&gt;of this problem has only been completed within the last&lt;br/&gt;decade. At present, many extensions of the affine surface area&lt;br/&gt;exist, several of them discovered by the PI. The new techniques&lt;br/&gt;and ideas developed in the process of these extensions should be&lt;br/&gt;beneficial for other problems, and the PI proposes to apply these&lt;br/&gt;techniques to problems of approximation of convex bodies by&lt;br/&gt;polytopes. These approximation problems have been studied&lt;br/&gt;extensively and find application in many areas of mathematics and&lt;br/&gt;computer science. In one paper, for instance, the PI and her&lt;br/&gt;collaborator proved the surprising result that random&lt;br/&gt;approximation by polytopes (choosing the vertices of the&lt;br/&gt;approximating polytope randomly on the boundary of the body) is&lt;br/&gt;as good as best approximation.  The Gaussian correlation&lt;br/&gt;conjecture in probability and statistics asserts that&lt;br/&gt;origin-symmetric convex sets are positively correlated under the&lt;br/&gt;standard Gaussian measure.  In spite of several partial results&lt;br/&gt;obtained by many researchers within the last years, including the&lt;br/&gt;PI, the conjecture remains undecided.  Optimal estimates for the&lt;br/&gt;tail of the Gaussian distribution obtained in this context by the&lt;br/&gt;PI and her collaborators are also relevant for problems in&lt;br/&gt;mathematical physics (see e.g.Differential Equations and&lt;br/&gt;Mathematical Physics, International Press 2000, p.43-51).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI wants to get an understanding of the structure of convex&lt;br/&gt;sets.  To do so she uses techniques from different areas of&lt;br/&gt;mathematics: analysis, differential geometry, convexity&lt;br/&gt;theory. One wants to understand the structure of such sets as&lt;br/&gt;they appear naturally not only in other branches of mathematics&lt;br/&gt;and mathematical physics, but also in applied areas, like&lt;br/&gt;tomography and image analysis, and computer sciences.  The PI and&lt;br/&gt;her collaborators plan to continue working on problems where&lt;br/&gt;convexity and other areas of more applied mathematics&lt;br/&gt;interact. Currently she is involved in a project related to&lt;br/&gt;quantum computing which uses -among other things- tools from&lt;br/&gt;convexity theory.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
