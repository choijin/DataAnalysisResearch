<AbstractNarration>Frederick R. Cohen&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0072173&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The projects outlined in this proposal are directed toward &lt;br/&gt;the interplay between homotopy theory, group theory, and the &lt;br/&gt;topology of function spaces. Artin's braid group plays a &lt;br/&gt;central role.  The main projects are as follows:  (1) &lt;br/&gt;continuation of a program to finish Barratt's finite exponent&lt;br/&gt;conjecture, (2) computations of the group cohomology for certain discrete groups with varying choices of representations, &lt;br/&gt;(3) a further investigation of the connections between the&lt;br/&gt;cohomology of function spaces, group cohomology, as well&lt;br/&gt;as the connections with the topology of function spaces, &lt;br/&gt;configuration spaces, and hyperplane arrangements, &lt;br/&gt;(4) an analysis of the overlap of properties of homotopy &lt;br/&gt;groups with other structures such as the Lie algebra attached &lt;br/&gt;to the descending central series for Artin's pure braid group, &lt;br/&gt;and the Lie algebra obtained from the higher homotopy groups &lt;br/&gt;of configuration spaces, and (5) a detailed analysis of &lt;br/&gt;certain groups of coalgebra morphisms as well as their &lt;br/&gt;connections to braid groups, and homotopy theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main goals of the projects here involve geometry of &lt;br/&gt;circles moving through space. These circles can be thought &lt;br/&gt;of as the motions of planetary objects in orbit around each &lt;br/&gt;other. The interplay between the geometry of these orbits &lt;br/&gt;occurs in mathematics as well as in mathematical physics.  &lt;br/&gt;Precise information concerning these orbits has provided &lt;br/&gt;fruitful mathematical applications to several subjects. &lt;br/&gt;The ultimate goal of this project is to measure different &lt;br/&gt;quantities in the subject as well as analyzing concrete &lt;br/&gt;useful answers, and computations.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
