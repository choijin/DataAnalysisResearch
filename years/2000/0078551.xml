    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will focus on improving solution growth of Nd and Yb,Pr-doped NaYF4 single crystals. Two alternate techniques are proposed: top seeded solution growth and traveling solvent zone. Phase I results indicate that spectroscopically Nd:NYF is superior to YAG and YLF and as good or better than YVO4 as a laser diode-pumped laser; and that Yb,Pr:NaYF4 is a 1.3 micron emitter with favorable properties for use in telecommunications. In a parallel effort to crystal growth, laser evaluation of NYF will continue through laser tests and by measurements of NYF's thermo-optic properties. In Phase I a very efficient single phase green emitter Yb,Er :NYF phosphor was demonstrated. A second thrust of this Phase II effort will then be to develop synthesis processes of granular doped NYF materials for their use in 2-D and 3-D displays. Combinations of Yb,RE-doped NYF will be prepared to extend the range of colors to red and blue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nd:NYF is seen as a superior material to YLF and YAG for compact diode pumped lasers and an economical alternative to Nd:YVO4 currently used. Yb, Pr: NYF can be used as amplifiers for telecommunications in the important 1.3 micron wavelength range. NYF phosphors, dispersed in plastic hosts can be used in 2 and 3-D transparent displays for head mounted applications such as air traffic control, medicine, autos and aircraft.</AbstractNarration>
