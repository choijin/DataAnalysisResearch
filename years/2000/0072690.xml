<AbstractNarration>Photorealistic image synthesis is one of the most fundamental problems in computer graphics, with&lt;br/&gt;a wide variety of applications. In recent years, tremendous progress has been made in the&lt;br/&gt;simulation of light transport and the resulting lighting effects. Unfortunately, the underlying&lt;br/&gt;material models are, by comparison, primitive and assume that the materials are both pristine and&lt;br/&gt;immutable, even though real materials are neither. This severely limits the range of appearances&lt;br/&gt;that can be produced. This research program will focus on the development of computer graphics&lt;br/&gt;models for materials, which will be suitable for the requirements of image synthesis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the award period, the research will address two key aspects of this problem: (1) Taxonomy&lt;br/&gt;of materials:  a study of a wide variety of materials will be conducted in order to devise a&lt;br/&gt;classification of materials that is appropriate for computer graphics. (2) A measurement device:  a&lt;br/&gt;portable device for measuring surface appearance properties in the field will be designed,&lt;br/&gt;simulated, and eventually constructed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research program will be integrated with a training plan that will afford the postdoctoral&lt;br/&gt;associate a variety of opportunities for professional development.</AbstractNarration>
