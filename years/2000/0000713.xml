<AbstractNarration>0000713&lt;br/&gt;Ammar&lt;br/&gt;Description:  This award is for support of a US-Egypt Workshop on Information Technology to&lt;br/&gt;be held in Cairo, Egypt, March 12-14, 2000.  The Egyptian co-organizer is Dr. Ayman El-Dessouki, President of the Electronics Research Institute in Cairo.  The purpose of the workshop is to address some of the main topics that affect the changes taking place in the area of information technology (IT), which in turn are affecting life in most countries, including the United States and Egypt. The focus in this workshop will be on five areas: 1. Software development. 2. Evolution and trends in e-business. 3. Tele-computing for education and medicine. 4. Internet and information networking. and 5. Mobile/satellite communications.   The workshop participants will contribute to the proceedings, which will highlight areas of research where collaboration would be mutually beneficial.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scope:  This award will support a US-Egypt workshop in an area that is taking on increasing importance in most developing countries.  It has assumed a central place in the developmental efforts in Egypt.  The area is also in the middle of phenomenal expansion in the United States. There are associated issues such as: the global market for the information sector, the pervasive impact on the society in all sectors of activity, the effect on balance of trade for mature economies and for developing countries, and the effect on employment patterns.  The US organizer is a well-known computer scientist with impressive credentials who is also quite familiar with the working scientific community in this field in Egypt.  The Egyptian organizer is the president of the main governmental research organization dealing with this area.  Participants are selected on the US side and on the Egyptian side to represent academia, governmental laboratories and private sector researchers. This proposal meets the INT objective of supporting US-foreign scientific collaboration in areas of mutual benefit.  Funding for this project is provided by the Division of International Programs through the US-Egypt Joint Fund program, and by the Division of Electrical and Communications Systems, the Division of Computer-Communication Research, the Division of Experimental and Integrative Activities, and the Division of Information and Intelligent Systems.</AbstractNarration>
