<AbstractNarration>This study integrates the biomechanics and physiology of animal locomotion.  The link between the mechanics and metabolic cost of walking is poorly understood, particularly in quadrupedal animals.  The overall objective is to understand the biomechanical basis for the metabolic cost of quadrupedal walking.  Specifically, what are the mechanical and metabolic bases for the preferred walking speed and the walk-trot transition speed?  This study will focus on one species, the domestic horse, because it provides a 13-fold adult size range with excellent experimental controls.  The mechanical work and metabolic cost of locomotion will be measured in different sized horses (70 kg to 900 kg) over a range of walking and slow trotting speeds.&lt;br/&gt;Studying an extreme size range of horses will provide unique insight into general mechanisms governing animal locomotion.  Understanding the relationship between body size, preferred speed, and the metabolic cost of walking has important implications for determining the energy budgets of migratory animals and other animals where habitats are reduced and resources are becoming increasingly fragmented.  Furthermore, the biomechanical analyses would provide valuable insight into the neuromuscular control of locomotion and may aid in the design and control of walking robots.  The proposed research will allow for more informed diagnosis and treatment of horses with musculo-skeletal injuries and could improve horse health by providing a broader database to understand the effects of body size on the daily energy requirements in exercising horses.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
