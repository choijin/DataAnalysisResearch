<AbstractNarration>This research studies two interrelated function estimation problems, &lt;br/&gt;nonparametric regression and linear inverse problems, using wavelet &lt;br/&gt;methods via the approach of block thresholding and ideal adaptation &lt;br/&gt;with oracle. The goals are to build a bridge between the traditional &lt;br/&gt;multivariate normal decision theory and the adaptive wavelet function&lt;br/&gt;estimation, and to develop a family of estimators that achieve &lt;br/&gt;simultaneously three objectives: adaptivity, spatial adaptivity, &lt;br/&gt;and computational efficiency. A major innovation and a consistent &lt;br/&gt;theme throughout the research is the use of block shrinkage&lt;br/&gt;methods which include the standard term-by-term thresholding as a&lt;br/&gt;special case. Block thresholding is studied via the approach of&lt;br/&gt;ideal adaptation with oracle. It will be demonstrated that block &lt;br/&gt;thresholding serves as a bridge between the classical normal decision &lt;br/&gt;theory and adaptive wavelet function estimation.  This leads to a &lt;br/&gt;systematic way of developing a coherent set of rate-optimal estimators&lt;br/&gt;with good empirical performance, all of which may be useful in different&lt;br/&gt;estimation problems.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To fully understand why block thresholding works ``better''&lt;br/&gt;than the standard term-by-term thresholding, and more generally,&lt;br/&gt;separable rules, I will explore the connection between adaptability&lt;br/&gt;and information-pooling in general orthogonal series estimation, of&lt;br/&gt;which wavelets are a special case. Preliminary results show that&lt;br/&gt;separable rules lack adaptability; they are necessarily not fully &lt;br/&gt;rate-adaptive. A key to adaptively achieve the exact minimax rate is&lt;br/&gt;information-pooling. I will further carry out research in this topic&lt;br/&gt;and will derive a lower bound on the amount of information-pooling&lt;br/&gt;required for achieving full global adaptivity. These results together &lt;br/&gt;will offer a deeper understanding of the benefit of information-pooling &lt;br/&gt;in nonparametric function estimation, and also serve as a guide for&lt;br/&gt;the construction of fully adaptive estimators. Besides theoretical&lt;br/&gt;investigation, I am also interested in applications of the wavelet &lt;br/&gt;methods. I am collaborating with colleagues on using wavelet methods &lt;br/&gt;for archiving and retrieval of medical images from tomographic databases. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
