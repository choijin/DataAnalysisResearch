<AbstractNarration>     The purpose of  this project is to demonstrate a new paradigm for wireless network services.  The&lt;br/&gt;motivations for this project are the f ollowing:&lt;br/&gt;     (1) Today, wireless service is either local to an institution (as in wireless LANs) or is provided as part of&lt;br/&gt;a regional or national service (as in cellular).  But there could be other models. Individual providers of&lt;br/&gt;wireless service could put up a base station and o er service locally. Users could move among these&lt;br/&gt;providers and select a service based on requirements and prices. Just as we have over 5000 wireline&lt;br/&gt;Internet service providers today, many only serving a small area, we could have wireless coverage&lt;br/&gt;built bottom up.&lt;br/&gt;     (2)Today, we see a restricted range of  wireless devices - a laptop PC with a wireless card, a cell phone&lt;br/&gt;augmented with data capabilities, a highly integrated device such as a pager. There is not an open&lt;br/&gt;market  for new wide-area wireless devices, because such devices today are tightly bound, both&lt;br/&gt;technically and through service contract, to a particular wireless service provider. But there could be a&lt;br/&gt;wide range of  new consumer devices if  the proper interfaces and modules were available.&lt;br/&gt;     For this to work, two things are necessary. First, each of the broad mix of competing wireless services&lt;br/&gt;must be accessible to a wide variety of devices. What is needed is an overall system architecture that&lt;br/&gt;allows cheap, small, low-power consumer-level objects to access a wide variety of technically&lt;br/&gt;incompatible wireless services with ease, using open interfaces. Second, selection of a service among&lt;br/&gt;competing alternatives must be easy. For example, a manual process of selection and entry of a credit&lt;br/&gt;card would be too burdensome to succeed. What is needed is a model for automated dynamic negotiation,&lt;br/&gt;based on rules provided by the users and providers, together with a workable economic model and a&lt;br/&gt;simple micro-payment scheme.&lt;br/&gt;     The goal of this research is to demonstrate two related innovations. The  irst is a framework for&lt;br/&gt;automated negotiation  for access to wireless services. The second is a small hardware device that the user&lt;br/&gt;can carry, a personal router, which contains the necessary wireless transceivers, implements the access&lt;br/&gt;negotiation protocol, and provides a network connection for the other devices and appliances that a person&lt;br/&gt;might choose to carry. By creation of an open interface between this personal router and other devices a&lt;br/&gt;user might carry, an environment can be created for the development of new devices and applications.&lt;br/&gt;     The intellectual merit of this project is embodied in: a) the automated service negotiation framework, b)&lt;br/&gt;experience with systems that use policy constraints to guide automatic configuration; c) the related&lt;br/&gt;protocols for security and billing; d) the demonstration of the new application user interface paradigms&lt;br/&gt;implied by the personal router; and e) identification and definition of the interfaces between this device&lt;br/&gt;and the other consumer devices that can be connected to the Internet using it. The broader impacts are the&lt;br/&gt;possibility of creating a new market model  or wireless service, based on small business investment and&lt;br/&gt;local competition, rather than service provision (only) by large, national-level corporations, and the&lt;br/&gt;development of  an increased understanding of user pricing preference for communication services.&lt;br/&gt;Research that explores technology supporting alternative economic models is not likely to be done in&lt;br/&gt;private industry, and is thus especially appropriate for public-sector support.</AbstractNarration>
