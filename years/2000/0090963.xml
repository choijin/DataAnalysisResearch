<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        This proposal will study neural and behavioral correlates of auditory learning using song in songbirds.  Song learning occurs during a sensitive period early in development, and a song derived from what was learned is produced by male songbirds throughout adult life.  Song is a mode of communication, in which the receiver must be able to decode the message of the sender.  In many species, males sing to females. While much is known of conditions for song acquisition and of the neural system which supports song production in males, little is known of song perception in general and, in particular, of how the brains of females learn about, process and respond to song.  The experiments in this proposal use complementary behavioral, anatomical and functional methods to study the role of early experience in development of song perception and its neural substrate in females.  They also assess whether brain effects of abnormal early experience can be reversed by providing appropriate experience to older animals.&lt;br/&gt;        The experiments will address important issues in neurobiology.  First, does learning during early "sensitive" periods use the same brain mechanisms as later, more conventional learning?  Second, which brain areas are used for complex auditory learning?  Related to this, are the changes in these areas more evident in females than in males (since the females make decisions based on this information that seem more precise than decisions made by males)?  Third, are the effects of this early learning (or lack of it) permanent, or can the information (and the brain areas that store it) be modified later on?  Female songbirds are an ideal system in which to study these issues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
