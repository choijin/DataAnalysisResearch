<AbstractNarration>Elston&lt;br/&gt;0075821&lt;br/&gt;     The broad goal of this project is to gain a mechanistic&lt;br/&gt;understanding of energy transduction in biomolecular transport&lt;br/&gt;processes.  The project focuses on three specific systems: the&lt;br/&gt;bacterial flagellar motor, the motor protein dynein, and protein&lt;br/&gt;translocation systems found in membranes of the endoplasmic&lt;br/&gt;reticulum and mitochondria.  While the biology involved in these&lt;br/&gt;systems is very different, the same mathematical techniques are&lt;br/&gt;applicable for analyzing theoretical models of all three.  To&lt;br/&gt;model these systems requires the use of Langevin or stochastic&lt;br/&gt;differential equations.  The randomness in these equations comes&lt;br/&gt;from two sources, thermal diffusion and chemical kinetics.&lt;br/&gt;Thermal fluctuations are characterized by the diffusion&lt;br/&gt;coefficient, which can be measured experimentally, and many of&lt;br/&gt;the important reaction rates are known from biochemical studies.&lt;br/&gt;In addition to molecular collisions, electrostatic interactions&lt;br/&gt;are the other dominant forces involved in these transport&lt;br/&gt;systems.  If available, structural data are used to determine the&lt;br/&gt;relevant electrostatic potentials.  Once model equations for the&lt;br/&gt;systems have been developed, numerical and analytical techniques&lt;br/&gt;are used to compare their behavior with experimental data.  The&lt;br/&gt;final phase of the analysis is to use the mathematical models to&lt;br/&gt;produce experimentally testable predictions.&lt;br/&gt;     Biological molecular motors are nanometer-sized engines that&lt;br/&gt;use chemical energy to generate force.  A well known molecular&lt;br/&gt;motor is myosin, which is the protein responsible for muscle&lt;br/&gt;contraction.  Other examples include the flagellar motor, which is&lt;br/&gt;used by bacteria for swimming, and dynein, which produces the&lt;br/&gt;force necessary for cilia motion.  The broad goal of this project&lt;br/&gt;is to gain a mechanistic understanding of force generation in&lt;br/&gt;both these systems.  Current experimental techniques are allowing&lt;br/&gt;biophysicists to study molecular motors at the single molecule&lt;br/&gt;level, thereby allowing the mechanical properties of motor&lt;br/&gt;proteins to be measured.  These new physical data in conjunction&lt;br/&gt;with structural data provide the impetus for renewed theoretical&lt;br/&gt;investigations into molecular motor function.  An important reason&lt;br/&gt;for performing a mathematical analysis of force generation is&lt;br/&gt;that it allows a quantitative comparison between experimental&lt;br/&gt;data and model behavior to be made.  The results of such a&lt;br/&gt;comparison not only are important for model validation, but also&lt;br/&gt;can be used to uncover errors in the assumptions underlying the&lt;br/&gt;model.  However, the significance of mathematical modeling goes&lt;br/&gt;beyond model validation and lies in its predictive power.  Once a&lt;br/&gt;theoretical model has been developed that is consistent with&lt;br/&gt;current experimental data, it is straightforward to extend the&lt;br/&gt;analysis to include situations that have not yet been&lt;br/&gt;investigated in the laboratory.  If model predictions are borne&lt;br/&gt;out by experiment, further confidence in the reality of the model&lt;br/&gt;is gained.  For the systems under consideration in this project,&lt;br/&gt;this means a mechanistic understanding of force generation has&lt;br/&gt;been achieved.  From a technological standpoint, the results of&lt;br/&gt;these investigations should be relevant for designing and&lt;br/&gt;fabricating manmade nanomachines.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
