<AbstractNarration>     Network protocols lookup state using a number of data structures for functions such as IP lookups (e.g., tries), bridge lookups (e.g., hash tables), and packet filtering (e.g., Pathfinder).  Network lookups are a key bottleneck for Internet routers today.  As Internet link speeds move to 10 Gbps (OC-192) and 40 Gbps (OC-768), state lookups must complete in tens of nanoseconds.  The researcher  argues in this proposal that solutions to such next generation lookup problems must span a number of areas from algorithms to computer architecture.   The proposal is devoted to investigating such crosscutting issues that arise in the context of next generation network lookups.&lt;br/&gt;     Current lookup technology that uses external DRAM (Dynamic RAM) cannot scale to this speeds; thus&lt;br/&gt;Terabit lookups will require the use of on-chip or off-chip SRAM (Static RAM).  Such memory is limited by either expense or manufacturing process | e.g., on-chip SRAM of 16 Mbits is considered optimistic.  In this proposal, the researcher considers the issues involved in dealing with such state lookups at Terabit speeds using limited fast memory while providing provable guarantees.&lt;br/&gt;     An important issue  considered in this proposal is SRAM memory utilization: if the lookup chip is to provide guarantees about the amount of state (e.g., number of IP prefixes) it can handle, the resarcher shows that the lookup chip must use a memory allocator which can guarantee a provable memory utilization ratio.  However, all conventional memory allocation algorithms (e.g., First Fit, Best Fit, Buddy System) only guarantee poor worst case utilizations:  for example, for requests of size 32 standard allocators can only guarantee a utilization ratio of 1/log2 32 = 20% because of possible fragmention.  The proposal introduces new problem-specific memory allocation schemes that can be tuned to provide worst-case memory utilization ratios close to 100%.  For example, a chip that does IP lookups using the researcher's new allocation schemes can guarantee to handle almost 5 times the number of prefixes that can be handled by a conventional allocator, and yet can allow insert/delete times of around 100 microseconds.  The researcher's&lt;br/&gt;schemes use new algorithms; optimal versions of the researcher's schemes also require new SRAM memory designs that allow shifted access in addition to normal word access.&lt;br/&gt;     The research also proposes to investigate other issues including the interaction of memory allocation with pipelining (i.e., dynamically allocating memory to stages), and the introduction of new lookup primitives that can support accounting and Quality of Service.  For example, the researcher wishes to investigate a novel paradigm for pipelining a trie based on depth rather than height which appears to have a more bounded use of memory.  As a second example,the researcher wishes to investigate the possibility of doing prefix lookups that contain a cost field; such a lookup can be used to update a accumulated cost field per input link.  The proposal seeks to investigate these and other issues that arise when designing Terabit lookups, to search for new mechanisms, and implement, evaluate, and fine-tune the researcher's new ideas.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
