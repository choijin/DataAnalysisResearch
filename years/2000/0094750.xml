<AbstractNarration>The project is fostering individual attention and mentoring leading to graduation and successful employment in the fields of engineering, mathematics and computer science through a National Science Foundation Scholars Program. The primary objectives of the program are to (1) broaden enrollment diversity within these disciplines to include more low- income persons, African Americans, and women (2) increase retention to degree rates in the targeted disciplines (3) strengthen collaborative partnerships with other higher educational institutions and industrial sectors employing graduates in these fields and, (4) improve professional development and career choice opportunities for the targeted low- income students in related fields. Expected outcomes include increased enrollment of low- income, academically talented students in engineering, mathematics and computer science fields, enhanced persistence and performance, successful degree completion and direct application of learned skills in employment. The scholarship program prepares participants for either graduation within two years of entry into the program or attainment of significant achievement within respective areas of discipline. Academic experiences are being enhanced through required participation in seminars and workshops and interaction with faculty mentors and professional peers in related industries. Program activities include individual and group meetings with the Program Director, site visits to regional industries, workshops, seminars, research projects with a faculty mentor and/ or external sponsor, and peer group study sessions. Program success is measured on academic achievement, retention to graduation rates, number and percentage of students passing license examinations, and number gainfully employed upon graduation. Dissemination of program activities are both internal and external via conferences, workshops and outreach initiatives.</AbstractNarration>
