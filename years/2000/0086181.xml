<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;The Sisseton Wahpeton Rural Systemic Initiative, based at the Sisseton Wahpeton&lt;br/&gt;Community College, is in many aspects a continuation of the Tribal Colleges Rural&lt;br/&gt;Systemic Initiative. However, since it is a locally based project, instead of a six-state&lt;br/&gt;effort, we will be able to concentrate on the educational needs of the Lake Traverse&lt;br/&gt;Reservation population to a far greater extent. The ultimate goal of the SWRSI project is&lt;br/&gt;improve the education, particularly in the areas of math and science, of our children&lt;br/&gt;through systemic reform. This is a process that requires the support and dedication of all&lt;br/&gt;the stakeholders in the community. This reform began three years ago with the&lt;br/&gt;introduction of the TCRSI program, with the development and adoption of standards and&lt;br/&gt;increased professional development in research-based curricula. The formation of a&lt;br/&gt;coalition of the local school districts and the establishment of "focal schools" also&lt;br/&gt;occurred. Activities during the TCRSI project are referred to as Phase I.&lt;br/&gt;Phase II will be a more intensive program of systemic reform, with our major&lt;br/&gt;objectives being the increased implementation of research-based curricula and the&lt;br/&gt;development of culturally relevant alternative assessments. These assessments will be&lt;br/&gt;tied to benchmarks established by local and state standards, and correlated to traditional&lt;br/&gt;standardized tests. By this method our schools will be able to develop better teaching&lt;br/&gt;methods based on our students learning styles.&lt;br/&gt;The implementation of research-based curricula is a potential hazard if not&lt;br/&gt;supported by up-to-date and intensive professional development for teachers. When&lt;br/&gt;these programs are introduced without understanding their underlying philosophies, the&lt;br/&gt;curriculum becomes part of the problem. Our second objective is to create a system of&lt;br/&gt;professional development that is curriculum specific, intensive, ongoing, and relevant to&lt;br/&gt;teacher needs. At the same it must be able to overcome the problems of a rural setting,&lt;br/&gt;limited budgets, and high teacher turnover rates. Our strategy to overcome these issues is&lt;br/&gt;to use distant learning technologies, web-based support, and the development of local&lt;br/&gt;experts at SWCC and lead-teachers in the focal schools. Information given at&lt;br/&gt;"traditional" workshops and via video conferencing sessions will be placed on curricula&lt;br/&gt;support web pages available 24 hours a day to our participants. Questions related to the&lt;br/&gt;use of the curricula could be posted with answers being provided by expert consultants or&lt;br/&gt;other classroom teachers. To combat the high teacher turnover rate Internet courses for&lt;br/&gt;training purposes will be developed and maintain by SWRSI and collaborating&lt;br/&gt;institutions. These efforts will directly address the issue of sustainability.&lt;br/&gt;The third objective of the SWRSI project is to increase the level of cooperation&lt;br/&gt;between the individual focal schools and the tribal college. An Administrators&lt;br/&gt;Committee and a Steering Committee (composed of focal schoolteachers, SWCC staff,&lt;br/&gt;and community members) has been formed as one component of this effort. The&lt;br/&gt;professional development activities of SWRSI will attribute to this effort, as each school&lt;br/&gt;will help plan and participate in these joint-training sessions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
