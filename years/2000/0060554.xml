    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project prepares the ground-work for the development of the first commercially available Computational Fluid Dynamics package for a truly grid-free Large Eddy Simulation (LES) of turbulent incompressible vortex dominated flow in complex time-varying geometries. The computational engine is based on the parallel, fast multi-pole implementation of a Lagrangian vortex-boundary element method. Turbulence is accounted for via LES, using a Lagrangian dynamic Smagorinsky sub-grid scale model. The method is: (1) fully grid-free in the fluid domain, (2) free of numerical diffusion, (3) inherently solution-adaptive, and (4) capable of modeling inhomogeneous unsteady wall-bounded turbulent flow. To this end, two new ideas will be developed during Phase I: A grid-free method for predicting diffusion with variable-viscosity, which is a pre-requisite for LES modeling; and a non-diffusive vortex merging strategy to curb the proliferation of particles and maintain long-time accuracy. These will then be incorporated into the Lagrangian vortex element method to demonstrate the salient features of grid-free vortex-based LES modeling of turbulent flows, using the prototypical example of the evolution of an initially perturbed infinite-Reynolds-number vortex ring in free space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The software is ideal for simulation and analysis of complex turbulent flow phenomena. This includes vortex breakdown, (massive) flow separation, vortex shedding, transient jets in cross-stream, wake-body interaction, high-swirl flow, etc. All are associated with the design of advanced flow control mechanisms used, for example, to reduce flow-induced noise and vibration, and to improve lift/drag performance at reduced energy consumption rates. Examples are flow over bluff bodies such as ground or under-water vehicles; in engines; in/around rotating machinery such as pumps and fans; helicopters; or in data storage units with rotating and moving parts.</AbstractNarration>
