<AbstractNarration>This project concentrates primarily on the investigation of&lt;br/&gt;mathematical problems that arise in the study of molecular quantum&lt;br/&gt;mechanics. The nuclei in a molecule have large masses. Consequently, their&lt;br/&gt;motion is approximately described by classical mechanics. By comparison,&lt;br/&gt;electron masses are very small, and electrons adjust their quantum&lt;br/&gt;mechanical states rapidly in response to the much slower motion of the&lt;br/&gt;nuclei. This intuition is the basis for Born-Oppenheimer approximations.&lt;br/&gt;Professor Hagedorn, his graduate students, and his collaborators will&lt;br/&gt;study situations where Born-Oppenheimer approximations are not&lt;br/&gt;sufficiently accurate to describe all the phenomena of interest. For&lt;br/&gt;example, they plan to develop accurate "surface hopping models" to include&lt;br/&gt;the possibility of electrons making quantum mechanical transitions. Models&lt;br/&gt;of this type have been proposed in the chemistry and physics literature,&lt;br/&gt;but they have not been derived from first principles. The main goal of&lt;br/&gt;this project is rigorously to derive and implement such a model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Motion of electrons and nuclei in molecules are well described by&lt;br/&gt;solutions to the Schrodinger equation. No one has ever solved the&lt;br/&gt;Schrodinger equation for a molecule, and our theoretical knowledge of&lt;br/&gt;chemistry and molecular physics has come from approximations to solutions.&lt;br/&gt;The principal goals of this project are to study the several commonly used&lt;br/&gt;approximations and to develop improved approximations that will be useful&lt;br/&gt;to chemists and physicists. In addition to theoretical understanding,&lt;br/&gt;potential uses of this basic research are the synthesis of new chemical&lt;br/&gt;compounds, the design of new catalysts, or the design of new drugs.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
