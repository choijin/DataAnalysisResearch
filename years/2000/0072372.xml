<AbstractNarration>DMS-0072372&lt;br/&gt;Jon Pitts&lt;br/&gt;Huai-Dong Cao&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides partial support for graduate students, &lt;br/&gt;postdoctoral researchers, junior faculty, and persons from under-represented groups to attend the semi-annual Texas &lt;br/&gt;Geometry and Topology Conference.  The conference is designed &lt;br/&gt;to enhance the research and educational atmosphere of the &lt;br/&gt;community of geometers and topologists in Texas and the &lt;br/&gt;surrounding states.  The conference has three specific goals.  &lt;br/&gt;First the conference is committed to bring researchers of national &lt;br/&gt;and international stature to the area to discuss their research &lt;br/&gt;and to interact with mathematicians from this geographic region.  Second the conference makes it possible for the community of &lt;br/&gt;geometers and topologists from Texas and surrounding states (a &lt;br/&gt;huge geographic region) to meet and share mathematics on a regular&lt;br/&gt;basis, which both stimulates individual research and generates productive cooperative efforts between schools.  Third the &lt;br/&gt;conference is committed to the strengthening and enrichment of the mathematics personnel base. There will be six conferences over three years, hosted by major universities in Texas: &lt;br/&gt;2000-2001: Rice University (fall), Texas Christian University (spring)&lt;br/&gt;2001-2002: University of Texas (fall), Texas Tech University (spring)&lt;br/&gt;2002-2003: Texas A&amp;M University (fall), University of Houston (spring)&lt;br/&gt;In addition, two universities (University of Texas at Arlington, University of Texas at Dallas) will assist in the conference at Texas Christian University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Texas Geometry and Topology Conference has been held spring and fall since its founding in 1989, a total of 23 times to date.  The roster of mathematicians who have participated in the conference includes many of the most influential geometers and topologists in the world.  Each conference specifically tailors its program to reflect recent developments in important areas of geometry and topology. Information about upcoming conferences as well as the mission and history of the conference is always available at http://www.math.tamu.edu/research/workshops/TGTC/index.html.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
