    <AbstractNarration>Through the unique partnering of Engineering and Education Graduate Fellows, Columbia University's School of Engineering and Applied Science, Teachers College, Barnard College, and New York City School Districts will create a comprehensive model of teacher recruitment and education that is a&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;significant departure from traditional pre-service and in-service teacher training programs. The long-term objective of this program is to create a sustainable teacher-training model that significantly infuses technology- competent teachers into urban school systems.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed fellowship project has as its major goal to develop a unique pre-service and in-service teaching model that has the following program elements:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;o the creation of an innovative, interdisciplinary education program that seamlessly integrates new educational technologies into their curriculum and capitalizes on a large pool of technology-savvy undergraduate and graduate engineering, science, math, and education students;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;o the collaboration of Columbia University's Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science (SEAS), Barnard College, and Teachers College (TC) with Community School Districts and High Schools in Harlem to share institutional resources, experience and expertise;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;o the organization of parallel college and secondary school technology environments for the training of teachers in academic and real world school settings;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;o the development and organization of curriculum modules in the sciences and mathematics that enable the full use of computer technology and the Internet to foster learning through self-directed study and group project applications; and&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;o the demonstration and assessment of the impact a technology-integrated learning environment has on secondary students' science and math knowledge and skills.&lt;br/&gt;The project's concept is to build the infrastructure and formal mechanisms required to develop the technology and pedagogical skills of graduate and undergraduate engineering, science, and math students to prepare them for careers in urban secondary schools systems. Engineering and Education Graduate Fellows, as partners, will be responsible for the creation of educational technology laboratories located at Columbia and School District #5, the development of technology-enhanced curriculum modules in support of secondary school student learning in science and math, direct mentoring of secondary school students, and the supervision of undergraduate teaching students during a junior year technology-focused field experience. Throughout the project, the fellows will participate in a series of special workshops and mentoring experiences to support the development of their teaching knowledge and skills.</AbstractNarration>
