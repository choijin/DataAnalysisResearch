<AbstractNarration>The design and implementation of a national computing systems grid has become a&lt;br/&gt;reachable goal for both computer and computational scientists. In order to better use this&lt;br/&gt;suite of resources, consisting of geographically disperse machines, instruments, and data&lt;br/&gt;storage, better scheduling and resource management techniques are needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project  concentrates on the issue of matching the requirements of an application&lt;br/&gt;to the capabilities of a resource or set of resources on the grid. This is often referred &lt;br/&gt;to as determining the affinity of an application for a resource. The research will formalize&lt;br/&gt;the folklore currently used in order to increase the accessibility of the grid to those&lt;br/&gt;application scientists that have less experience than current users. Work will&lt;br/&gt;continue in the development of  a language specification to describe both applications&lt;br/&gt;and resources as needed today, but with the extensibility needed for future applications as&lt;br/&gt;well. This will then be used as an indexing structure into a case-based reasoning expert&lt;br/&gt;system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project also has an extended educational portion to it. As a part of the effort to&lt;br/&gt;expand Northwestern's Computer Science education in the systems area and a cross-school&lt;br/&gt;initiative, we plan to offer a course in experimental systems using ideas in parallel&lt;br/&gt;distributed scheduling as the basis for a larger view into practical systems,&lt;br/&gt;experimentation, and teamwork. This project-oriented class will be focused around&lt;br/&gt;teaching students about current parallel distributed scheduling efforts and applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, a new seminar series will be started  featuring women researchers in&lt;br/&gt;computer science to help encourage female students to continue with careers in computer&lt;br/&gt;science.</AbstractNarration>
