<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;In recent years experimental methods have become an indispensable component of&lt;br/&gt;economic research. Laboratory experiments are used to test economic theory, to discover&lt;br/&gt;the properties of alternative institutional rules, and to assist in the design of new market&lt;br/&gt;institutions. A few examples are the design of the FCC spectrum auctions, the design of a&lt;br/&gt;new market institution for matching medical interns with hospitals, and the design of new&lt;br/&gt;market institutions for the deregulated allocation of electrical power.&lt;br/&gt;Laboratory experiments in economics and game theory rest on the premise of&lt;br/&gt;"transference", or"parallelism:" the assumption that the behavior of subjects in the&lt;br/&gt;laboratory will be the same as the behavior of people in the actual strategic encounters&lt;br/&gt;that the experiments are designed to help us understand. If laboratory subjects behave&lt;br/&gt;differently, for whatever reason, this would present a challenge for experimental&lt;br/&gt;research: theory that failed in the laboratory might perform well in the field, or vice-versa;&lt;br/&gt;the properties of a trading rule in the laboratory might be different from its&lt;br/&gt;properties in the field; and trading rules designed in the laboratory, and which work well&lt;br/&gt;there, may perform poorly in the field.&lt;br/&gt;Recent evidence suggests that the behavior of people with expertise in certain kinds of&lt;br/&gt;strategic situations may be different than the behavior of people who are "inovices," as&lt;br/&gt;laboratory subjects typically are, with little or no experience in the given strategic&lt;br/&gt;context. This evidence includes recent research by Walker and Wooders in which leading&lt;br/&gt;professional tennis players were found to make strategic decisions that were more in&lt;br/&gt;accord with the theory of strategic behavior than the decisions of laboratory subjects who&lt;br/&gt;had no prior experience in the strategic situation.&lt;br/&gt;The research project consists of experiments designed to study whether, and how, the&lt;br/&gt;strategic behavior of experts differs from the behavior of less experienced and less expert&lt;br/&gt;decision makers. The experiments will be conducted primarily on the World Wide Web,&lt;br/&gt;and they will be designed specifically to provide for the development and identification&lt;br/&gt;of varying levels of expertise and the means to identify differences in behavior that are&lt;br/&gt;associated with differing levels of expertise.&lt;br/&gt;The results of this research promise to provide a better understanding of the role of&lt;br/&gt;expertise in strategic behavior and of the strategic contexts in which parallelism can be&lt;br/&gt;expected to hold, and to help identify the settings in which Web-based experiments are&lt;br/&gt;superior and those in which laboratory experiments are likely to be superior.</AbstractNarration>
