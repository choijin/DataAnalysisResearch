<AbstractNarration>0093649&lt;br/&gt;Ehrman&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Much recent progress has been made towards the development of techniques for the controlled synthesis of nanoparticles.  A need now exists for methods of creating functional materials from nanoparticles while preserving their small grain size.  In this project, a hybrid high temperature particle synthesis/low temperature interconnection process will be developed for production of mechanically strong porous films.  With this process, porous films will be produced with no grain growth, thus preserving properties associated with nanoparticle size.  The initial focus will be on porous films of titania, with applications to photovoltaic materials and chemical sensors.  This general technique may also be applicable to the production of porous films of many other materials such as silica or tin oxide.  &lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;The research component will lead to an improved understanding of the mechanisms of particle transport and processing/structure/property relationships for nanoparticle-based materials.  This will be integrated with the educational component through the development of an undergraduate elective in the area of particle science and technology, and by incorporating numerical methods used for this research into the required graduate level transport phenomena course, in the form of project-based team activities.  Outreach activities will consist of visits to high schools and junior high schools in Washington, D.C., as these students are now able to attend the University of Maryland as 'in state' students.  These visits are directed towards increasing the number and diversity of qualified applicants to the College of Engineering, and towards increasing the awareness of chemical engineering as a career option.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
