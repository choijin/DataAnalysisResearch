<AbstractNarration>Title:  Free probability theory and problems in operator algebras&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical description: The project involves study certain von Neumann algebras and&lt;br/&gt;C*-algebras using the techniques of free probability theory.  Some of the&lt;br/&gt;problems on von Neumann algebras to be considered are the isomorphism problem&lt;br/&gt;for free group factors, as well as related classification problems for&lt;br/&gt;amalgamated free products of von Neumannn algebras and for type III von Neumann&lt;br/&gt;algebras arising as free products with respect to non-tracial states.&lt;br/&gt;Regarding C*-algebras related to free products, the project is to study&lt;br/&gt;properties like simplicity, stable rank and pure infiniteness, and to attempt&lt;br/&gt;to find Voiculescu's topological entropy of certain automorphisms of them.  In&lt;br/&gt;a different direction, the project involves the study of commutators of&lt;br/&gt;elements from ideals of infinite type II von Neumann algebra factors; in&lt;br/&gt;particular, to characterize which elements are commutators in terms of, for&lt;br/&gt;instance, generalized singular numbers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical description: In the mid 1980's, Voiculescu discovered (or&lt;br/&gt;created, depending on your perspective), a new sort of probbility theory&lt;br/&gt;which is quite analogous to usual probability theory, except that the&lt;br/&gt;usual notion of independence is replaced by freeness, which is exhibited&lt;br/&gt;by certain noncommuting random variables.  In fact, freeness is related&lt;br/&gt;to and inspired by the combinatorics of free groups, which are groups&lt;br/&gt;with "maximal noncommutativity."  In the last decade and a half, free&lt;br/&gt;probability has been shown to be a fundamental new theory, which touches&lt;br/&gt;on diverse areas of mathematics and physics, including random matrices,&lt;br/&gt;combinatorics and operator theory.  For example, freeness provides a&lt;br/&gt;deep and satisfying explanation of the appearance of Wigner's semicircle&lt;br/&gt;law in random matrices, and has proven very useful for the further study&lt;br/&gt;of random matrices.  The natural context for free probability theory is&lt;br/&gt;noncommutative von Neumann algebras and C*-algebras, because the full&lt;br/&gt;power of spectral analysis can be brought to bear.  The project is to&lt;br/&gt;elucidate the structure of C*-algebras and von Neumann algebras related&lt;br/&gt;to free probability theory.  Successful completion of this research will&lt;br/&gt;be both and application and an elucidation of free probability theory&lt;br/&gt;and will deepen our understanding of C*-algebras and von Neumann&lt;br/&gt;algebras.  Von Neumann algebras and C*-algebras were first considered by&lt;br/&gt;von Neumann and, respectively, Gel'fand and Naimark, in the 1930s and&lt;br/&gt;1940s. They are natural contexts for noncommutative analogues of&lt;br/&gt;classical analysis, and they thus arise naturally in the mathematical&lt;br/&gt;theory of quantum mechanics.  Moreover, noncommutative methods are&lt;br/&gt;increasingly being used to study classically commutative problems in&lt;br/&gt;mathematics --- witness the Jones polynomial used to distinguish knots,&lt;br/&gt;and Connes' noncommutative geometric methods used to study fractals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
