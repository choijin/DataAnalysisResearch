<AbstractNarration>This research project focuses on a set of scanning tunneling microscope (STM) experiments employing discrete molecules of hydrogen, silicon, and oxygen (H8Si8O12 and H10Si10O15). The STM-tip/cluster/silicon interaction at the heart of these studies is roughly analogous to a metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) capacitor. However, the proposed model has a controllable coupling between the "metal" (STM-tip) and "oxide" (cluster). In these studies, the structure of the insulator can be independently determined to a much greater degree than is possible for the insulator in actual MOS capacitors. The results of these studies will provide a foundation for understanding STM images taken of device interfaces and the basic mechanism of the hydrogen-silicon bond breaking event that leads to device failure. Understanding of structure and failure mechanisms are key for optimizing the next generations of transistors for microelectronic devices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The silicon/silicon oxide interface is a crucial part of the modern transistor. Over the past decade, the thickness of the silicon dioxide insulating layer has shrunk by more than two orders of magnitude and is now approximately10 Angstroms in the smallest research devices. As the thickness of the insulating layer has approached molecular dimensions, the average stoichiometry and physical properties of the silicon oxide undergo important changes that must be understood in order to optimize, or even successfully build, the next generations of silicon-based transistors.  Students trained in these areas are likely to compete very well for jobs in various communicatons technology sectors.  This research project is jointly supported by the Solid State Chemistry Program of the Division of Materials Research and the Advanced Materials and Processing Program of the Chemistry Division.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
