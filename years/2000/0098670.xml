<AbstractNarration>AST 0098670&lt;br/&gt;McWilliams&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interstellar magnetic fields play a central role in a variety of important processes in galaxies, notably in star formation and the evolution of molecular clouds.  Yet the origin of galactic magnetic fields is poorly understood.  This project is conducting numerical studies of the origin and evolution of magnetic fields in galaxies in order to determine how their strength and geometry change over time in response to the combined effects of small-scale disturbances such as supernovae and star formation and large-scale disturbances such as galactic-scale accretion and differential rotation.  The project's goals include understanding why the field in our Galaxy undergoes a transition from a relatively weak azimuthal field in the Galactic disk to a strong, dipole field at the Galactic center. The detailed nature of the transition zone will be explored, with particular focus on the stability of the transition and the interplay between the magnetic field and individual clouds. Funding for this project was provided by the NSF program for Extragalactic Astronomy &amp; Cosmology (AST/EXC).&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
