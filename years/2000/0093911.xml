<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;0093911&lt;br/&gt;University of Southern Mississippi&lt;br/&gt;Allan Guymon&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The unique ordering presented by polymerizable lyotropic liquid crystalline (LLC) systems provides a wide variety of structures for a number of potentially important applications.  The major obstacle in using polymerized LLC materials, however, is the ability to remain and control this structure throughout the polymerization.  Typically, thermodynamically driven phase separation occurs during polymerization, leaving little or no liquid crystalline order.  The theme of the research planned by the PI is to use the photopolymerization kinetics as a nanoscopic probe to predict and control the nanostructure of LLC systems.  Two fundamental and complementary questions will be addressed using a combination of polymerization of LLC monomers and LLC templated polymerizations.  First, what role do order and the degree of order have in influencing the polymerization behavior?  The photopolymerization of materials spanning the gamut of LLC phases will be monitored to understand changes that occur during polymerization.  Factors that may influence phase behavior and structure control including temperature, LLC phase structure and stability, composition, polymerization time scale, and mobility will be examined.  Second, what influence does the polymerization have on structural evolution and the ability to control this structure?  Factors influencing phase behavior, phase separation, polymer structure and anisotropy will be examined extensively before, during and after polymerization.  Results for both questions will be related forming a complete model of the factors, both kinetic and thermodynamic, governing the ultimate polymer structure.  Tangible outcomes of this research are (1) development of a complete understanding of the polymerization and the mechanisms governing ultimate polymer structure and (2) establishment of the principles and methods for the molecular level design of LLC systems with controllable and adjustable nanostructure designed for particular applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A prevailing theme in this PECASE project will be student education.  Extensive involvement of undergraduate and graduate researchers in a discovery learning environment will be emphasized.  As a means to attract the best and brightest students to polymer science and engineering, a polymer module for high school chemistry is a primary element of the educational component.  In collaboration with Petal High School, a three-week module will be developed that presents the fundamentals, applications, and research opportunities in the field of polymer science.  Lecture, demonstration, laboratory, and testing materials will be correlated to emphasize the importance of polymers in everyday life.  Virtual labs, web-based materials and hands-on experiments will be incorporated.  The curriculum will involve extensive planning and involvement from the school district, the university, and local industry.  After successful implementation, the module will be brought to the Hattiesburg and Oak Grove school districts.  From these experiences a two-day instruction course will be developed for high school chemistry teachers throughout the state.  Special focus will be placed on involvement of districts with high percentages of underrepresented groups in science and engineering.  The module will also be modified appropriately for introductory chemistry courses at both junior colleges and universities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
