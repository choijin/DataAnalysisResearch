<AbstractNarration>0099385&lt;br/&gt;Stephenson&lt;br/&gt;There is increasing experimental evidence that neutrinos have mass, but there is serious need for information on the actual values of neutrino masses.  This proposal continues the study of effects which could influence the extraction of neutrino mass from an analysis of the electron energy spectrum very near the high-energy end point in nuclear beta decay. Scenarios alternative to Standard Model physics may also affect the electron spectrum and have further consequences such as an alteration of signals in solar neutrino detectors similar to what has been observed.  This investigation of neutrino properties could have profound effects on cosmology through the dark matter problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
