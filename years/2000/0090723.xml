<AbstractNarration>Abstract for Lay Audience -Routtenberg&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;       Perhaps the most  unnerving experiences in our intellectual lives is &lt;br/&gt;the frustration of forgetting.  It is the over-arching view of the proposed &lt;br/&gt;research that 'why we forget' has to do with the faulty  chemistry of the &lt;br/&gt;brain connections that form the memory network.   Indeed we have recently &lt;br/&gt;discovered using a model system of brain memory that we can prevent memory &lt;br/&gt;storage and its retrieval.  Then, by giving a drug that activates a &lt;br/&gt;signalling pathway that our laboratory described, we can reactivate the &lt;br/&gt;memory.  Put another way, the key that turns on memory and its retrieval &lt;br/&gt;may be like that used in the car's ignition.  What we have done is moved to &lt;br/&gt;the next stage and 'hot-wired' memory processes, by-passing the initial &lt;br/&gt;switch.  This pathway is thus critical to memory formation and retrieval.&lt;br/&gt;      Our studies employ gene targeting methods in transgenic mice to &lt;br/&gt;modify the switches and signalling mechanisms (gene products or proteins, &lt;br/&gt;one and all) that regulate both the chemistry of the brain connections and &lt;br/&gt;as a consequence the memory storage process.  We study the most widely used &lt;br/&gt;physiological model of memory, long-term potentiation, which monitors the &lt;br/&gt;events that occur at the synapse at the time when model memories are being &lt;br/&gt;stored.  We complement the gene targeting with pharmacological tools that &lt;br/&gt;allow us to confirm with converging lines of evidence the identified &lt;br/&gt;sequence of events involved in the storage of information.  Since gene &lt;br/&gt;manipulation is not feasible in humans, this complimentary approach &lt;br/&gt;provides the basis for drug discovery in the context of current molecular &lt;br/&gt;biological technologies and suggest novel strategies in the war against &lt;br/&gt;cognitive and memory disorders.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
