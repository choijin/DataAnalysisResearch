    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;CTS-0084358&lt;br/&gt;J. H. Fendler, Clarkson University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the proposed research is to demonstrate the possibility of continuous fabrication of nanostructures of chosen size and shape. The demonstration will be carried on self-replicating reversed micelles. It will be attempted to manufacture size-controlled monodisperse sulfide semiconductor nanoparticles and their capped counterparts in reverse micelles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI has acquired an extensive experience in studying the creation of nanoparticle films and multiparticulate layers on surfaces, with the help of surfactant coatings. It was observed that in such processes, man-made templates replace nature's biological membranes. Such apparent "mimicking" of biological processes has been generalized to a systematic biomimetic membrane chemistry for advanced materials preparation (e.g. colloids). The PI has explored in detail the self-replication of membrane mimetic components. The need is now to identify and control three essential biological function: compartmentalization, self-replication and self-assembly. Templates and compartments, supplemented by surfactant coating, provide the same control on the extent of a chemical transformation as a membrane would.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI wants to generalize his research on the replication and assembly of semiconductor materials to more materials and nanogeometries. The proposed research plan is exploratory and high-risk.</AbstractNarration>
