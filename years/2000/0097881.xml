    <AbstractNarration>The investigator's research integrates a number of diverse areas in&lt;br/&gt;mathematics: logic, set theory, algebra, topology, and analysis,&lt;br/&gt;as well as some automated reasoning techniques from computer science.&lt;br/&gt;In topology, the investigator focuses on properties of&lt;br/&gt;Stone spaces, compact homogeneous spaces, and Bohr topologies.&lt;br/&gt;Topology and analysis are integrated in this research; measure theory is&lt;br/&gt;used to construct topological spaces with interesting properties,&lt;br/&gt;while the topological properties of a space are used to prove theorems&lt;br/&gt;about the possible measures which can exist on the space.&lt;br/&gt;The investigator studies Bohr topologies, which involve giving a topology&lt;br/&gt;to arbitrary abstract groups or other structures; this subject has its&lt;br/&gt;roots in the harmonic analysis of the 1930s; modern questions in this&lt;br/&gt;area relate to general topology, Fourier series, and functional analysis.&lt;br/&gt;Logic and set theory are relevant because results in topology and measure&lt;br/&gt;theory are frequently independent of the usual axioms of set theory; when a&lt;br/&gt;result is proved independent, the methods used are those of formal logic. &lt;br/&gt;In algebra, the investigator works on algebraic systems such as&lt;br/&gt;quasigroups and loops. Automated reasoning tools are very useful&lt;br/&gt;here, primarily in the study of non-associative systems. These&lt;br/&gt;systems are described by fairly simple axioms, and a computer search&lt;br/&gt;can often reveal interesting new consequences of these axioms. &lt;br/&gt;However, the investigator combines the computer use with&lt;br/&gt;classical arguments involving combinatorics and group theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; There are two distinct, but related, threads to this research.&lt;br/&gt;The first thread involves the expansion of our knowledge of traditional&lt;br/&gt;pure mathematics. There is no specific practical application in mind&lt;br/&gt;here, although topology arises naturally in an attempt to generalize&lt;br/&gt;properties of the geometry of physical space, and measure&lt;br/&gt;theory is a natural extension of the notion of probability.&lt;br/&gt;The second thread involves automated reasoning (AR) tools. AR allows the&lt;br/&gt;computer to derive logical conclusions from given knowledge. This subject&lt;br/&gt;has been in existence since the 1960s, but it is only in recent years that&lt;br/&gt;the hardware and software have become powerful enough to discover conclusions&lt;br/&gt;which could not have been discovered without computer assistance.&lt;br/&gt;This second thread is a continuation of the investigator's work in&lt;br/&gt;improving the AR tools and using these tools to create new results&lt;br/&gt;in mathematics. This is of interest not only for the&lt;br/&gt;mathematics itself, but because it demonstrates the power of the tools,&lt;br/&gt;which can then be applied to reasoning tasks in other areas of science&lt;br/&gt;and engineering, as well as to autonomous decision making by robotic agents.</AbstractNarration>
