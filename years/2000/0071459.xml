    <AbstractNarration>Abstract for Space Decomposition Methods in Nonsmooth Optimization&lt;br/&gt; DMS 0071459 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research concerns developing theory and methods for combining &lt;br/&gt;polyhedral and quadratic approximation to produce a rapidly convergent &lt;br/&gt;algorithm for minimizing a nonsmooth function of many variables. The idea &lt;br/&gt;is to use a bundle method to determine a so-called VU-space decomposition &lt;br/&gt;such that on V-space the cutting-plane aspect of bundling works fast and on &lt;br/&gt;U-space a quasi-Newton approximation of a Hessian of a U-Lagrangian can be &lt;br/&gt;employed. Such methods can be used to solve large or complicated &lt;br/&gt;optimization models via separation of variables or constraints. For &lt;br/&gt;example, a water pressure control problem of finding values for flow rates &lt;br/&gt;and pump pressure gaps to minimize pumping cost subject to maintaining &lt;br/&gt;water pressures in allowable ranges at all points in a pipe network can be &lt;br/&gt;solved via separation of the variables. If the flow rates are fixed then &lt;br/&gt;the subproblem of finding optimal values for the pressure gaps is an &lt;br/&gt;easy-to-solve linear minimization problem. With this approach the outer &lt;br/&gt;problem of finding optimal values for the flow variables is a nonsmooth &lt;br/&gt;problem whose solution can be found efficiently via the techniques to be &lt;br/&gt;developed. The theoretical research is concerned with properly defining a &lt;br/&gt;class of functions which is special enough for the members to have &lt;br/&gt;U-Hessians and general enough to include functions from many &lt;br/&gt;applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The computational methods proposed for development are significant because &lt;br/&gt;they can be applied in many practical decision-making situations. These &lt;br/&gt;include the determination of values of parameters for fitting models to &lt;br/&gt;data such as in topographic or geophysical modeling. They also include &lt;br/&gt;application of decomposition techniques to large or complicated models such &lt;br/&gt;as those occurring in allocation of scarce resources, traffic assignment, &lt;br/&gt;manufacturing, structural engineering, logistics and strategic planning. &lt;br/&gt;The pipe network problem in the first paragraph is an important example &lt;br/&gt;occurring in civil infrastructure design. It illustrates the need to make &lt;br/&gt;trade-off decisions when considering conflicting design criteria such as &lt;br/&gt;simultaneously having high reliability and low cost. Another area of &lt;br/&gt;application is in power system planning subject to environmental protection &lt;br/&gt;constraints. These decision models will increase in importance as &lt;br/&gt;deregulation of the energy supply sector takes effect. These problems &lt;br/&gt;naturally decompose into higher level problems of deciding which types and &lt;br/&gt;sizes of power generation plants to build and lower level problems of &lt;br/&gt;deciding how best to operate the various units to meet daily energy demand. &lt;br/&gt;Additionally, this research fits in well with on-going efforts in &lt;br/&gt;high-performance computing, because its methods will utilize parallel &lt;br/&gt;processing for solving very large and/or very complex decision-making&lt;br/&gt;problems.</AbstractNarration>
