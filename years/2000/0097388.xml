<AbstractNarration>This Chemistry Division award supports a new Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at Indiana University.  Steven Wietstock is the site's Program Director; Dennis Peters is the Co-Program Director. Approximately thirty faculty will be available to serve as REU student mentors.  During the award period (2001-2003), each summer ten students will participate in a ten-week program.  Recruitment will be via faculty contacts at smaller colleges in the immediate geographic area, including the urban centers of Chicago, Cincinnati, Detroit, Louisville and Milwaukee. In addition, minority recruitment efforts will be directed through existing contacts at Clark Atlanta University, Morehouse College, New Mexico State University, Spelman College, University of North Carolina at Pembroke, and Xavier University of Louisiana.  Student research projects will be available in analytical, biological, inorganic, organic, and physical chemistry.  Included in the summer schedule of activities are classes on ethics in science and chemical information.  A visit to a local chemical industry is planned.  The summer program will conclude with the students participating in a mini-symposium poster presentation and submitting a final research report in the style of a journal article.  A survey at the end of the program will be completed by each of the student participants.  A networking system will be established through e-mail and listserve systems to keep track of the students after they leave the program.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
