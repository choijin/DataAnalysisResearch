<AbstractNarration>This award is to The University of West Virginia to support the activity described below for a period of 36 months.  The proposal was submitted in response to the Partnernerships for Innovation Program Solicitation (NSF 0082).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Partners&lt;br/&gt;University of Akron; Kansas/West Virginia Structural Composites, Inc.; West Virginia Department of Highways; Transportation Research Board; U.S Department of Agriculture&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposed Activities&lt;br/&gt;The proposed activities include: develop, manufacture, implement, field-test, and market novel honeycomb fiber-reinforced polymer sandwich composite materials for applications in civil infrastructure and aquaculture industries, with particular emphasis on highway bridge decks, guardrail systems, and modular fish culture tanks for use with impaired mine water supplies in rugged terrain.  Kansas/West Virginia Structural Composites, Inc is in the process of establishing a manufacturing plant close to the West Virginia University campus. The program will include cost-effective innovations for manufacturing technologies; concurrent optimization of materials and design; prototype development and evaluation; product implementation and marketing; work-force training and curriculum development; technology transfer.  The initial effort will emphasize development and marketing of bridge decks, guardrail systems, and modular fish culture tanks.  Feasibility studies and field implementation studies are being supported by West Virginia Department of Highways, Transportation Board, and U.S. Department of Agriculture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposed Innovation&lt;br/&gt;The proposed innovation includes: technology transfer of new knowledge of composite materials to improve highway civil infrastructure and to create technology for aquaculture for economic enterprise (fish farming) and food production, as well as education of engineers in design with new materials for civil infrastructure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Potential Economic Impact&lt;br/&gt;Estimated income from fish aquaculture is $12M annual sales ($4.6M annual income) and includes approximately 300 new jobs.  Highway materials are targeted to a potential percentage of the $1T civil infrastructure market.  West Virginia estimates that 40% of the highway bridges are in immediate need of repair.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Potential Societal Impact&lt;br/&gt;Potentail societal impact includes increased food production, jobs, and improved highway safety.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
