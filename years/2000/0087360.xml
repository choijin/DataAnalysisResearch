<AbstractNarration>Physics (13) More than 23,000 students are enrolled nationwide in accredited architecture programs. Most of these programs require their students to take a course of introductory physics, for three main reasons: (1) Architects need to use concepts and methods of physics in their profession. (2) As a component of liberal arts education, physics provides a framework for understanding the physical world. (3) As an exact science, physics develops analytical and quantitative thinking skills. Most architecture programs do not offer a special physics-for-architects course, and their students take physics with students from other disciplines. The drawbacks to architecture students from this situation are significant: They do not learn all the basic physics concepts that they need professionally, while they learn in detail concepts that they do not need. There is not enough time to introduce concepts that are important as general education. The amount of time&lt;br/&gt;devoted to problem solving is not optimized for the specific needs of architects. The objective of this project is to develop a text, based on which physics-for-architects courses could be taught. The text, written from the perspective of architects, balances the three required components: relevant professional knowledge, general education, and thinking skills. The availability of such a text encourages architecture programs nationwide to offer physics-for-architects courses. This advances the knowledge and understanding of physics and scientific thinking within the architecture community. During the entire developmental phases, the project is undergoing formative and summative evaluations, both in-house - by students that take the course and by the architecture and physics curriculum committees, and externally - in architecture programs that field-test the material.</AbstractNarration>
