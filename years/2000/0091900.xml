<AbstractNarration>Nebraska EPSCoR, in cooperation and collaboration with research universities in&lt;br/&gt;the state of Nebraska, seeks to build research infrastructures in several areas of&lt;br/&gt;informatics. The effort will be directed at three primary areas that are consistent&lt;br/&gt;with the Nebraska EPSCoR Strategic plan as well as plans and strategic&lt;br/&gt;directions of the participating universities including: (1) development of wired and&lt;br/&gt;wireless network technologies that will more effectively link ongoing inter-campus&lt;br/&gt;efforts within a secure distributed information infrastructure, (2) development of a&lt;br/&gt;test-bed to research next generation Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)&lt;br/&gt;systems architectures that are viable and efficient for e-commerce through&lt;br/&gt;collaboration with the private sector, (3) development of inter-campus capabilities&lt;br/&gt;in newly emerging research areas of bio-informatics and computational biology.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed infrastructure initiative in informatics complements the developing&lt;br/&gt;information technology industry in the state, involves scientists and engineers&lt;br/&gt;from four university campuses (University of Nebraska, Lincoln (UNL), University&lt;br/&gt;of Nebraska Medical Center, University of Nebraska, Omaha (UNO), and&lt;br/&gt;Creighton University. It provides for an integrated plan to accomplish goals that&lt;br/&gt;are considered crucial for establishing competitiveness in computational-based&lt;br/&gt;informatics research within the state of Nebraska. In addition to the major&lt;br/&gt;development effort for the interdisciplinary informatics infrastructures, the&lt;br/&gt;proposed project will greatly enhance the computational capabilities available to&lt;br/&gt;a broad range of fields of research and instruction.&lt;br/&gt;Additional components of the project will support educational activities and&lt;br/&gt;research experiences for underrepresented groups, internships for science and&lt;br/&gt;technology students to work in private industry, a small grants program for faculty&lt;br/&gt;early in their careers, technical assistance and faculty travel, and outreach to&lt;br/&gt;other Nebraska colleges and universities.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
