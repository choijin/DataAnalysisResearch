    <AbstractNarration>Case, David&lt;br/&gt;MCB-0090186&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant provides partial support for the 2001 Gordon Research&lt;br/&gt;Conference on Computational Aspects of Biomolecular NMR, to be held May 6-11, 2001, at the&lt;br/&gt;conference center "Il Ciocco", in Barga, Italy. The conference chairs are Drs. David&lt;br/&gt;Case and Michael Nilges. The purpose of the conference is to bring together scientists&lt;br/&gt;working at the forefront of biomolecular NMR, to foster the free exchange of cutting-edge,&lt;br/&gt;pre-publication work, and to establish directions for exploiting computation to solve&lt;br/&gt;difficult problems in the field. Gordon Conferences provide a valuable means of&lt;br/&gt;disseminating information and ideas in a way that cannot be achieved through the usual&lt;br/&gt;channels of communication, that is, publications and presentations at large scientific&lt;br/&gt;meetings. This meeting is the second of what is intended to be a biannual conference.&lt;br/&gt;Computation plays a crucial role in virtually every aspect of biomolecular NMR, from data&lt;br/&gt;acquisition and analysis to structure determination. In order to reflect the full breadth&lt;br/&gt;of the field, a broad, multinational representation of scientists engaged in both&lt;br/&gt;experiment and computation has been assembled. Central themes of the conference will be&lt;br/&gt;the interdependence of experiment, theory, and computation, and the contributions that&lt;br/&gt;computation can make to advancing the frontiers of biomolecular NMR. Sessions will be&lt;br/&gt;devoted to new sources of structural and dynamical information, computer-aided assignment,&lt;br/&gt;treatment of dynamic disorder and structural heterogeneity, intermolecular interaction and&lt;br/&gt;drug discovery, and NMR and structural genomics.</AbstractNarration>
