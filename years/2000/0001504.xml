    <AbstractNarration>0001504&lt;br/&gt;Prokop&lt;br/&gt;This award provides support for the travel of two U.S. graduate students and one speaker as participants in the conference Bioartificial Organs: Tissue Sourcing, Immuniosolation and Clinical Trials to be held at Davos, Switzerland, October 7-11, 2000.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The subject matter of the Conference relates directly to two important elements of the Biomedical Engineering Program: research in the increasingly important field of tissue engineering, and the encouragement of students and young professionals to engage in research activities. The meeting will provide the opportunity for the participants to meet and confer with world leaders in research directed to the development of bioartificial organs as is illustrated by the preliminary technical program included in the proposal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference is being organized and directed by highly competent individuals who have an enviable track record of successes (most recently Bioartificial Organs II, 1998). All plenary and invited papers are to be published by the New York Academy of Sciences in a book entitled Bioartificial Organs to be edited by the conference organizing committee.</AbstractNarration>
