    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Proposal #0098082&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NSF REU Program at the Roswell Park Cancer Institute presents upper division science majors with pre-graduate school summer research experiences. Students will participate in a challenging ten week program focused in the area of molecular biology. Special efforts will continue to be made to recruit members of recognized under-represented groups and females. More importantly our goal is to recruit undergraduate students that are interested in pursuing scientific careers and may come from colleges that do not have active research programs. Senior faculty serve as mentors. Participants learn science by doing science. Under the tutelage of senior faculty, students are exposed to the realities of a life as a scientist. An environment is created in which the student evolves from a passive, dependent learner to an active member of the research team. The Institute's commitment to the Research Experience for Undergraduates Program is genuine. This program has been in continuous operation since 1953 and it has served as a model for other summer research programs. The "scientific lifestyle" is further explored throughout our program in various seminars/activities and culminates in our concluding three-day scientific mini-conference. This is where the students give oral and poster presentations of their research to their peers and the Institute's scientific faculty. Other summer experiences include attendance at our distinguished lecture series, career counseling sessions, and weekend social activities.</AbstractNarration>
