<AbstractNarration>Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Core models are generalizations of Godel's Constructible Universe.&lt;br/&gt;Jensen's pioneering work on the fine structure of core models and on&lt;br/&gt;techniques for constructing core models with large cardinals has led to&lt;br/&gt;many applications in diverse parts of set theory.  More recently, Martin,&lt;br/&gt;Mitchell, Steel, and others have extended earlier work on core models to&lt;br/&gt;the level of Woodin cardinals.  The investigator's questions concern 1)&lt;br/&gt;the combinatorial structure of core models, 2) the application of core&lt;br/&gt;model techniques in determining the large cardinal consistency strength of&lt;br/&gt;various set theoretic statements, 3) the application of core model&lt;br/&gt;techniques in descriptive set theory, 4) problems in infinitary&lt;br/&gt;combinatorics, forcing, and model theory that were in part inspired by his&lt;br/&gt;earlier work on core models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most widely accepted theory (system of axioms) of sets is known as&lt;br/&gt;ZFC.  Kurt Godel is famous for having shown that if ZFC is consistent,&lt;br/&gt;then ZFC is incomplete in the sense that there are statements which are&lt;br/&gt;neither provable nor refutable in ZFC.  This is particularly striking&lt;br/&gt;since all of mathematics can be expressed in the language of sets and most&lt;br/&gt;mathematicians work exclusively within ZFC.  There are important open&lt;br/&gt;questions that are not decided by ZFC.  The most famous example is Georg&lt;br/&gt;Cantor's Continuum Problem, which Godel showed cannot be answered&lt;br/&gt;negatively in ZFC and Paul Cohen showed cannot be answered positively in&lt;br/&gt;ZFC.  (Cohen received a Fields Medal for this work.) There are many&lt;br/&gt;interesting extensions of ZFC and the relationships between them are quite&lt;br/&gt;complicated.  The investigator's project has to do with a natural&lt;br/&gt;hierarchy of axioms known as the ``large cardinals''.  Many beautiful&lt;br/&gt;results, including some longstanding conjectures, were proved by a number&lt;br/&gt;of researchers using ZFC and large cardinals in the 1980's and 90's;  &lt;br/&gt;further success is anticipated.  And, also, details of how the various&lt;br/&gt;theories of sets are related have been discovered by comparing these&lt;br/&gt;theories with the large cardinal hierarchy.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
