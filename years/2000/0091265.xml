    <AbstractNarration>In most animal cells, the centrosomes, or microtubule organizing centers (MTOC), play akey role in chromosome segregation during nuclear division. They consist of a pair of centrioles&lt;br/&gt;encompassed by a complex protein matrix. In most organisms, the centrioles are paternally&lt;br/&gt;derived from the sperm basal body and the surrounding components are primarily derived from&lt;br/&gt;the maternal cytoplasm. Organisms that undergo parthenogenetic development provide an&lt;br/&gt;opportunity to study natural variants in centrosome formation and structure. The insect order&lt;br/&gt;Hymenoptera (this includes ants, bees, and wasps) is characterized by haplodiploid&lt;br/&gt;parthenogenesis, whereby unfertilized eggs develop as males and fertilized eggs develop as&lt;br/&gt;females. Although the genetics, behavior, and ecology of species within this order have been&lt;br/&gt;intensively studied, surprisingly few studies have directly focused on issues pertaining to the&lt;br/&gt;centrosome. Preliminary results for one species within this order, the jewel wasp Nasonia&lt;br/&gt;vitripennis, demonstrate that centrosomes form despite the lack of a sperm-derived basal body.&lt;br/&gt;Numerous cytoplasmic asters form in both fertilized and unfertilized eggs after the completion of&lt;br/&gt;meiosis. In unfertilized eggs, two of these cytoplasmic asters are captured by the female&lt;br/&gt;pronucleus and these function as the zygotic centrosomes while the unassociated asters&lt;br/&gt;disappear. In fertilized embryos, the sperm derived centrosomes function as the zygotic&lt;br/&gt;centrosomes and the cytoplasmic asters disappear. Because unfertilized eggs develop into males&lt;br/&gt;and fertilized eggs into females, this is the first system described in which centrosomes are&lt;br/&gt;reciprocally inherited. This project seeks to further characterize centrosome inheritance and&lt;br/&gt;structure in Nasonia. These studies are likely to yield novel mechanisms of organizing&lt;br/&gt;MTOCs and also provide new insights concerning the evolution and developmental consequences&lt;br/&gt;of parthenogenesis. The three specific aims of this project are:&lt;br/&gt;1. To further characterize the behavior of the cytoplasmic asters in fertilized and unfertilized&lt;br/&gt;embryos through live fluorescent microscopy.&lt;br/&gt;2. To characterize the centrosome inheritance pattern in Nasonia strains in which development&lt;br/&gt;of unfertilized or fertilized eggs is specifically disrupted.&lt;br/&gt;3. To characterize the composition and structure of the asters and centrosomes in fertilized and&lt;br/&gt;unfertilized embryos through immunofluorescent analysis and thick section electron&lt;br/&gt;microscopy.</AbstractNarration>
