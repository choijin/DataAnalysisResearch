<AbstractNarration>NEW STATISTICAL CHALLENGES POSED BY MULTISCALE AND ADAPTIVE&lt;br/&gt;REPRESENTATIONS  D.L. Donoho &amp; I.M. Johnstone, PI's.&lt;br/&gt;Project period: 07/01/00 -- 06/30/05&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will address the following specific topics:&lt;br/&gt;1. Estimation in tomography: the curvelet tight frame of&lt;br/&gt;representation seems, according to preliminary calculations, to&lt;br/&gt;achieve faster rates of convergence than traditional tomographic&lt;br/&gt;methods.&lt;br/&gt;2. Estimation and testing in time-frequency analysis: a new tight&lt;br/&gt;frame of chirplets has been built by deploying curvelets in the&lt;br/&gt;time-frequency plane.  The new representation has promise for detection and&lt;br/&gt;estimation of chirps in the presence of noise.&lt;br/&gt;3. Recent work in computational vision asks ``what is the best basis&lt;br/&gt;for representing natural images?''  It is proposed that many empirical&lt;br/&gt;results in the rapidly growing literature on this topic might be&lt;br/&gt;explained and improved using analytically-constructed representations:&lt;br/&gt;ridgelets and curvelets.&lt;br/&gt;4. Geometry-driven diffusions are popular in applied image processing&lt;br/&gt;-- but their quantitative performance is not well-understood. It is&lt;br/&gt;proposed to develop a quantitative statistical theory using recent&lt;br/&gt;tools such as multiscale ridgelets.&lt;br/&gt;5. Extensions of Sparsity-Based ideas. Problems of finding `edgels in&lt;br/&gt;white noise' and `subspaces in white noise' offer challenging and&lt;br/&gt;timely directions in which to generalize existing sparsity ideas.&lt;br/&gt;6. Testing Sparse Means.  An adaptive approach is suggested for&lt;br/&gt;testing if the mean of a random vector is nonzero, when the vector&lt;br/&gt;might exhibit an unknown degree of sparsity.&lt;br/&gt;7. Asymptotics of top eigenvalues of large covariance matrices.&lt;br/&gt;A program is set out to develop statistical theory for principal&lt;br/&gt;components of large data matrices based on recent progress in&lt;br/&gt;random matrix theory.&lt;br/&gt;Consistent with the principle of ``reproducible research'', software&lt;br/&gt;and figures from this project will be made available in future&lt;br/&gt;releases of the public domain WaveLab system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In recent years, research in wavelets and time-frequency methods has&lt;br/&gt;broadened to construct new systems of representation, including&lt;br/&gt;systems custom-tailored for specific phenomena.  Examples include&lt;br/&gt;wavelet packets and cosine packets, and very recently, systems like&lt;br/&gt;edgelets, ridgelets, chirplets, warplets, and curvelets.  In parallel,&lt;br/&gt;research in statistical analysis and cognate fields allows data&lt;br/&gt;themselves to dictate the design of their own optimal systems of&lt;br/&gt;representation.  Principal components (i.e.  Karhunen-Loeve&lt;br/&gt;decomposition) is the oldest example of such data-adaptive&lt;br/&gt;representation; many newer ideas have been proposed recently, such as&lt;br/&gt;independent components analysis.  The proposers have been&lt;br/&gt;active in both domains, creating new image and signal&lt;br/&gt;representations and developing statistical theory to underpin adaptive&lt;br/&gt;signal representations.  The current project will (a) pursue two&lt;br/&gt;opportunities arising from the recent introduction of curvelets, (b)&lt;br/&gt;address two active applied research areas, computational vision and&lt;br/&gt;geometry driven diffusions, and (c) attack some issues which are&lt;br/&gt;argued to be at the core of new developments in statistical decision&lt;br/&gt;theory. Topic (a) may have implications for applied work in&lt;br/&gt;tomography, image and signal processing, and (c) may impact applied&lt;br/&gt;uses of principal components in domains such as climate and global&lt;br/&gt;change studies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
