<AbstractNarration>One of the most enduring problems of prime number theory is to determine&lt;br/&gt;how many elements remain when a set of numbers is sieved.  There is a large&lt;br/&gt;literature on this topic, originating in seminal papers of Viggo Brun in 1914,&lt;br/&gt;but even today the best known bounds are either not optimal or not proved&lt;br/&gt;to be optimal.  By starting with a simple sieving situation and then moving&lt;br/&gt;incrementally to more complicated configurations, it is hoped that optimal&lt;br/&gt;bounds can be found, accompanied by proofs of optimality.  The past work&lt;br/&gt;on the PI on the pair correlation of the zeros of the Riemann zeta function&lt;br/&gt;has been interpreted as providing evidence that the zeros are spectral&lt;br/&gt;in nature.  The Pair Correlation Conjecture itself is equivalent to an&lt;br/&gt;assertion concerning the mean square distribution of primes in short intervals.&lt;br/&gt;In new work with k. Soundararajan, it is proposed to extend the second moment&lt;br/&gt;heuristics to other moments, and hence develop heuristics concerning the&lt;br/&gt;distribution function of primes in short intervals.  It is hope that this&lt;br/&gt;new information, when interpreted in terms of zeros of the zeta function,&lt;br/&gt;will provide further insights concerning the distribution of the zeros,&lt;br/&gt;including the Riemann Hypothesis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The seemingly irregular distribution of prime numbers has been a puzzle&lt;br/&gt;to mathematicians for many centuries.  In the early 20th century, new&lt;br/&gt;ideas were introduced, which allowed one to deal with sieving for primes&lt;br/&gt;as a problem of linear programming.  This led to many new results, but&lt;br/&gt;even today the linear programming extremals remain to be found in most&lt;br/&gt;situations.  By starting with a simple situation and moving incrementally&lt;br/&gt;to more complicated ones, it is hoped that it will at last be&lt;br/&gt;possible to locate the extremal configurations.  Heuristics concerning&lt;br/&gt;the distribution of primes in short intervals can be developed from the&lt;br/&gt;Hardy--Littlewood prime k-tuple conjecture, and the insights gained from&lt;br/&gt;such reasoning has an impact on other aspects of prime number theory,&lt;br/&gt;including the famous Riemann Hypothesis which dates from 1860.</AbstractNarration>
