    <AbstractNarration>0003440&lt;br/&gt;Copeland&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a project to study the Caribbean-South American oblique arc-continent collision zone using various geologic (mapping, structure), geochemical (Ar-Ar and U-Pb Geochronology), and seismic (active MCS with onshore/offshore recording using OBS instruments, passive array) techniques. There will also be a geodynamic modeling study that, very innovatively, includes the dynamics of crust-mantle interaction. The overall goal of the project is to understand further the geometry and chronology of a world class, arc-continent accretion event. Seosmic/geological cross-sections are to be derived for several transects across the orogen at different ages of collision. The group of investigators include highly capable seismologists in both active and passive seismology, as well as geologists familiar with the orogenic developments on land. The cooperation with Venezuelan scientists and students is excellent. &lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>
