<AbstractNarration>The  research project is focused on the analytical aspects of the theory of&lt;br/&gt;integrable systems related to the Riemann-Hilbert  and isomonodromy methods.&lt;br/&gt;The problems under consideration include the  asymptotic analysis of the&lt;br/&gt;correlation functions  of  exactly solvable quantum field and statistical&lt;br/&gt;mechanics models, the investigation of the double scaling limits in the &lt;br/&gt;theory of orthogonal polynomials, the analysis of the integrable systems &lt;br/&gt;describing the distribution functions of random  matrix theory and random &lt;br/&gt;permutations,  and  the global asymptotic analysis  of the solutions of &lt;br/&gt;integrable differential  equations of the  Painleve' and KdV types. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theory of integrable systems is an expanding area  which plays an&lt;br/&gt;increasingly important role as one of the principal sources of new&lt;br/&gt;analytical and algebraic ideas for many branches of modern mathematics and&lt;br/&gt;theoretical physics. Simultaneously, it provides an efficient analytic tool&lt;br/&gt;for the study of some of the fundamental  mathematical models arising &lt;br/&gt;in  modern nonlinear science and technology.  Specifically,  the research &lt;br/&gt;directions indicated above deal with the mathematical models which form &lt;br/&gt;the  theoretical basis for the following fields: condensed matter, &lt;br/&gt;high energy and plasma physics, nonlinear hydrodynamics, and  high-bit rate &lt;br/&gt;telecommunication systems.  A special attention  in the project is given &lt;br/&gt;to  the  analysis of the distributions of random matrix theory which govern  &lt;br/&gt;statistical properties of the  large systems which  do not  obey the usual laws  &lt;br/&gt;of classical probability. This kind of systems appears in  many different areas&lt;br/&gt;of applied  science and technology including  heavy nuclei, polymer growth, &lt;br/&gt;high-dimensional data  analysis, and  certain percolation processes.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
