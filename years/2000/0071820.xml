    <AbstractNarration>Proposal DMS-0071820 Principal Investigator: Liviu I. Nicolaescu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project involves topological and geometric aspects of the&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;theory of three-dimensional Seiberg-Witten monopoles and it&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;addresses two general guiding questions. The first question is&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;about the topological significance of the monopole count. Meng&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;and Taubes have shown that on a three-manifold with nontrivial&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;homology this count is given by Reidemeister-Turaev torsion. In&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;the case of rational homology spheres numerical experiments with&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Seifert manifolds suggest that a suitably altered monopole count&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; determine in a very elegant fashion both&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;the Casson-Walker invariant and the Reidemeister-Turaev torsion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first part of the project is devoted to proving this. The&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;second question is about the geometric meaning of&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;three-dimensional monopoles. The link of a complex surface&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;singularity is endowed with a natural CR geometry and it is&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;natural to ask how much of it does a monopole capture. More&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;precisely we address the following fundamental question: how do&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;monopoles "look like" as the link of the singularity collapses&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;onto the exceptional divisor of a resolution of the singularity?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The three-dimensional world has been a source of inspiration&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;for many important developments in algebraic topology. It is&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;within the reach of our physical intuition so some visualization&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;is possible (think of a cube) yet there is plenty of room for&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;surprises (think of gluing in pairs the opposite faces of the&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;cube). One modern point of view is that, if presented in a&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;favorable light, the three-dimensional world will reveal its&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;mysteries. The mathematicians phrase this in a more sober way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If one can find a nice geometry on a three-manifold then one can&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;unlock some of its topological features. The monopoles are&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;geometric objects introduced to the mathematical world by&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;physicists. One could think of them as "signals" produced by a&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;three-dimensional space. These ``signals'' depend on how we look&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;at the manifold. Since they appeared on the mathematical scene&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;they have provided us with surprising insights about the structure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;of low-dimensional worlds. This project is about counting these&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"signals" in a meaningful way and then understanding the&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;significance of each one of them individually when observed under&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;a favorable light.</AbstractNarration>
