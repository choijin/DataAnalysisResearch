<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;Paulsen/Blecher/Papadakis&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Principal Investigators propose several main lines of research on&lt;br/&gt;topics related to the theory and applications of operator algebras,&lt;br/&gt;operator spaces, and frames. Blecher will be studying the general&lt;br/&gt;theory of operator algebras and modules over operator algebras,&lt;br/&gt;Hilbert C*-modules, and questions relating to noncommutative Choquet&lt;br/&gt;theory. Paulsen will continue to study injective operator spaces and&lt;br/&gt;modules, the weak expectation property, function theoretic operator&lt;br/&gt;theory, interpolation theory from an operator algebra point of view.&lt;br/&gt;With Papadakis he will also be studying and frames and reconstructions&lt;br/&gt;with a view to applying reproducing kernel Hilbert space methods and&lt;br/&gt;symmetric orthogonalization results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study of operator algebras originally grew out of quantum mechanics.&lt;br/&gt;It is often important to see how formulas involving numerical variables&lt;br/&gt;behave when these variables are allowed to be operator variables. It is&lt;br/&gt;out of such a process that the theory of operator spaces and completely&lt;br/&gt;bounded maps emerged. Blecher and Paulsen's research focuses mainly on&lt;br/&gt;questions of how various theories behave under this `quantization'.&lt;br/&gt;On the other hand, interpolation theory started as a purely mathematical&lt;br/&gt;exercise, and only in the past 20 years has it been found to have&lt;br/&gt;important applications in engineering. For example, in electrical circuit&lt;br/&gt;design, one starts with a desired frequency response, for a few given&lt;br/&gt;frequencies, and wishes to design the simplest circuit with that given&lt;br/&gt;response. Mathematically, this problem becomes one of finding the&lt;br/&gt;simplest function of a given type that achieves certain given values at&lt;br/&gt;given points. This last problem is what we call an interpolation problem.&lt;br/&gt;Already the demands of electrical engineering take us beyond the known&lt;br/&gt;interpolation theories. Surprisingly, interpolation theory and the study&lt;br/&gt;of operator algebras is interwoven, and this interplay has lead to some&lt;br/&gt;new interpolation results. We have found that a better understanding of&lt;br/&gt;the "quantized", i.e., matrix-valued, interpolation is what is needed&lt;br/&gt;to answer many ordinary interpolation questions.&lt;br/&gt;Frame theory can be applied to the study of how we extract information&lt;br/&gt;out of streams of data, and how we reconstruct the original data from&lt;br/&gt;the derived information. A typical example of a situation where this&lt;br/&gt;arises is the CAT scan, where from a large quantity of data, one is&lt;br/&gt;trying to reconstruct a picture of the inside of a body. Our work is&lt;br/&gt;not focused on particular examples, but on how one analyzes how "good"&lt;br/&gt;is a particular frame.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
