<AbstractNarration>Biological Sciences (61) &lt;br/&gt;Anticipating society's need for broadly trained global change scientists and ecologists, the Biology Department at Carleton College has initiated a new multidisciplinary, collaborative ecology curriculum that examines the relationship between organisms and their abiotic environment. Three new laboratory courses in ecosystem ecology, plant physiological ecology, paleoecology, and a nonmajors course in global change biology are being offered to complement existing strengths in population ecology and evolutionary biology. Ecology courses at Carleton place strong emphasis on learning science by doing science. Lectures are supplemented with small-group, collaborative-learning case studies based on primary literature. These case studies focus on exciting and controversial issues in ecology, such as clearcutting, rising CO2 and carbon sinks, the effects of climate warming on vegetation, and the effects of biodiversity on ecosystem function. Two of the lab courses, Ecosystem Ecology and Plant Physiological Ecology, emphasize common themes of carbon cycling, nutrient cycling, and vegetation response to global change. Because ecosystem ecology and plant physiological ecology offer an excellent opportunity for examining these themes at different levels of biological organization, a few key pieces of equipment support both courses and provide Carleton undergraduates with advanced training. Using sophisticated instruments, students practice the scientific method while learning about the importance of ecology and developing an understanding of the issues professional ecologists. Course materials are disseminated through professional journals, at scientific meetings, on Carleton's website and the Case Studies in Science website at SUNY Buffalo. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
