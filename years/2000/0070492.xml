    <AbstractNarration>This proposal is concerned with two main projects. The former focuses on&lt;br/&gt;various questions in sub-Riemannian geometry and in the closely connected&lt;br/&gt;analysis of sub-elliptic pde's and systems. The PI proposes to investigate&lt;br/&gt;the classification of non-negative entire solutions to non-linear&lt;br/&gt;equations in groups of Heisenberg type, and compute the best constants in&lt;br/&gt;the Folland-Stein Sobolev embedding. This program is instrumental to a&lt;br/&gt;possible attack of the compact CR Yamabe problem in the open case of CR&lt;br/&gt;manifolds of co-dimension higher than one. The geometric case of such&lt;br/&gt;embedding will also be investigated along with the relative isoperimetric&lt;br/&gt;inequalities. The PI also proposes to study the regularity of minimal&lt;br/&gt;surfaces, the question of traces on lower dimensinal sub-manifolds of&lt;br/&gt;functions having integrable horizontal derivatives. The basic boundary&lt;br/&gt;value problems, such as the Dirichlet and the Neumann problem will also be&lt;br/&gt;investigated, and a theory of variational inequalities and regularity of&lt;br/&gt;"free boundaries" will be developed. The second project is concerned with&lt;br/&gt;various problems in which symmetry plays an important role. One of them is&lt;br/&gt;concerned with the determination of the extremal functions in the&lt;br/&gt;Tomas-Stein restriction theorem for the Fourier transform. Other problems&lt;br/&gt;are connected with symmetry in the exterior obstacle problem, a conjecture&lt;br/&gt;of De Giorgi connected to minimal surfaces, and symmetry in the evolution&lt;br/&gt;of surfaces driven by mean curvature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Partial differential equations and systems formed by the latter are the&lt;br/&gt;basic laws which describe most natural phenomena. An understanding of the&lt;br/&gt;physical world also requires grasping the underlying geometric structure&lt;br/&gt;of the latter in its various forms. The present proposal belongs to that&lt;br/&gt;mainstream of research which sits at the confluence of the theory of&lt;br/&gt;partial differential equations and systems, both linear and non-linear,&lt;br/&gt;and their connections with an emerging type of geometry, called&lt;br/&gt;sub-Riemannian geometry. Both theories have witnessed an explosion of&lt;br/&gt;interest in the last decade and they continue to attract the interest of&lt;br/&gt;various schools of mathematicians both nationwide and abroad. Another main&lt;br/&gt;part of this proposal is devoted to the study of physical and mathematical&lt;br/&gt;problems in which symmetry plays an important role. Symmetry is present&lt;br/&gt;everywhere in nature, a remarkable instance being the fundamental laws&lt;br/&gt;of gravitation and electrostatic attraction. The study of conditions under&lt;br/&gt;which a given natural phenomenon develops symmetries is both important for&lt;br/&gt;its practical consequences (the presence of symmetries&lt;br/&gt;drastically reduces the human effort) and for its implications&lt;br/&gt;in the furthering of our knowledge.</AbstractNarration>
