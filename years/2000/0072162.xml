<AbstractNarration>NSF proposal DMS 0072162&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Asymptotic Equivalence of Statistical Experiments&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: M. Nussbaum, Department of Mathematics, Cornell&lt;br/&gt;University, Ithaca, NY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The concept of asymptotic equivalence of experiments serves to compare&lt;br/&gt;properties of statistical models. An experiment is a family of probability&lt;br/&gt;measures; a distance is defined between these objects such that the&lt;br/&gt;informational content of experiments with respect to the parameter is&lt;br/&gt;similar if this distance is small. This basic deficiency pseudodistance &lt;br/&gt;(or Delta-distance) has been introduced by L. Le Cam, generalizing the&lt;br/&gt;concept of sufficiency. If experiments are equivalent via sufficiency&lt;br/&gt;then their Delta-distance is 0; here equivalence via sufficiency&lt;br/&gt;means that one experiment results from application of a sufficient statistic&lt;br/&gt;to the data of the other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based on the idea of the Delta-distance, a theory of local&lt;br/&gt;asymptotic normality (LAN-theory) of experiments has been developed which&lt;br/&gt;has found widespread application in statistics. The idea of data reduction&lt;br/&gt;which is at the heart of the sufficiency concept could thus be combined with&lt;br/&gt;limit theorems of probability, resulting in approximation of general&lt;br/&gt;statistical models by Gaussian shift families. These Gaussian shift or&lt;br/&gt;translation families allow explicit expression for risk bounds in many&lt;br/&gt;instances, and these risk bound then become valid in an asymptotic sense in&lt;br/&gt;the approximated models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The limitation of the LAN-theory consists in its restriction to a&lt;br/&gt;local setting, in which the rate of localization is tied to the&lt;br/&gt;normalization rate in the central limit theorem (the classical root-n in&lt;br/&gt;most cases). This setting precludes application of the resulting risk bounds&lt;br/&gt;to the class of ill-posed function estimation problems. The emphasis of the&lt;br/&gt;current project is on the treatment of this problem class (which includes&lt;br/&gt;nonparametric density estimation) by methods involving the Delta-distance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The restriction to a local setting (or alternatively, a finite dimensional&lt;br/&gt;setting) which is inherent in the LAN-theory has been overcome in recent&lt;br/&gt;years, by efforts of Brown and Low (1996) and by various&lt;br/&gt;results of the P.I. and collaborators, starting also in 1996 &lt;br/&gt;(asymptotic equivalence of density estimation and Gaussian white noise). &lt;br/&gt;The main tool has been approximation of general likelihood processes by Gaussian&lt;br/&gt;ones, using coupling methodology. The present project focuses on elaboration&lt;br/&gt;and extension of these results, with two main directions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(i) constructive realization of equivalence in nonparametric models,&lt;br/&gt;enabling explicit equivalence mappings (direct transfer of decision&lt;br/&gt;functions)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(ii) equivalences in nonparametric models for dependent data (time series&lt;br/&gt;and diffusion process models).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
