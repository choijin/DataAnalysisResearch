<AbstractNarration>The main goal of this project is to describe equilibrium solutions to&lt;br/&gt;boundary value problems for linear and nonlinear elliptic partial&lt;br/&gt;differential equations.  The PI intends to prove existence and&lt;br/&gt;regularity theorems for two-phase free boundary problems.  The PI will&lt;br/&gt;also describe level sets of eigenfunctions, especially nodal sets,&lt;br/&gt;maxima, and minima, and find optimal bounds on the shape of level sets&lt;br/&gt;for convex domains even if the domain becomes long and thin.  Another&lt;br/&gt;goal is to solve a problem in mathematical economics of finding all&lt;br/&gt;possible functional forms of a price-independent social welfare&lt;br/&gt;function (using methods of exterior algebra and overdetermined&lt;br/&gt;systems).  A third goal is to characterize the camera image of a&lt;br/&gt;building using the Fourier transform, that is, to characterize the&lt;br/&gt;distortion of the periodic pattern on the face of the building if the&lt;br/&gt;building is not exactly parallel to the camera.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI plans to describe the equilibrium between two phases in several&lt;br/&gt;problems arising in physics and engineering.  The focus will be on the&lt;br/&gt;boundary between two materials such as ice and water.  Other examples&lt;br/&gt;include the boundary between two liquids and the profile of the wake&lt;br/&gt;of a boat.  In another direction, the PI will attempt to confirm a&lt;br/&gt;principle first proposed by J. Rauch that the point of maximum&lt;br/&gt;temperature in an insulated room tends towards a wall as time&lt;br/&gt;increases.  More generally, the PI will examine how the geometry of a&lt;br/&gt;fixed boundary (as in the walls of a room) affects the shape of&lt;br/&gt;surfaces of equal temperature at or near the equilibrium steady state&lt;br/&gt;temperature.  In a third direction, the PI will try to find all&lt;br/&gt;possible price-independent social welfare functions.  This is of&lt;br/&gt;current interest because such functions are used to compare countries&lt;br/&gt;and to describe the trend towards greater income inequality in the&lt;br/&gt;1990s in the U. S. as well as earlier trends in the opposite&lt;br/&gt;direction. The problem is that prices cannot be held fixed in such&lt;br/&gt;comparisons.  The PI expects that price independence puts serious&lt;br/&gt;limits on the functional forms allowed, which in turn puts limits on&lt;br/&gt;the way comparisons can be made.  Finally, the PI proposes a project&lt;br/&gt;intended to help solve the problem in computer vision of recognizing&lt;br/&gt;the orientation of a building from a photograph.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
