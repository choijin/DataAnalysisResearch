<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;This is an award to Cornell University for the acquisition of instrumentation to study nonlinear nanoscale localization and student training. A pump-probe broad band spectrometer with associated detectors will be purchased to build a new experimental platform for the production and investigation of intrinsic nonlinear nanoscale localization of spin waves in both classical and quantum antiferromagnets.  This instrument will make possible both the production of intrinsic localized spin waves in C(2)CuCl4 and other antiferromagnets over a large frequency region. It will also permit time dependent and transport studies of these nanoscale objects down to the milliseconds and sub-milliseconds time regimes.  Both the high power and the large tuning range are essential features of this specialized instrumentation for the experimental investigation of a new fundamental nanoscale localization phenomenon in condensed matter physics. The general physical feature that such localization in periodic lattices depends only on nonlinearity plus discreteness ensures that graduate and undergraduate students working in this area will have training in nonlinear dynamics with applications spanning a variety of length scales, ranging from the nano- to the macroscopic ones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an award to Cornell University for the acquisition of instrumentation to study nonlinear nanoscale localization and student training. This experimental instrumentation is directed at probing the underlying simplicity of the dynamics of nonlinear periodic physical systems by exploring large amplitude nanoscale excitations in atomic lattices.  The work is expected to influence other developing areas of nonlinear dynamics including intrinsic localized electromagnetic modes in optical switches in nonlinear photonic crystal waveguides, intrinsic localization in periodic Josephson junction arrays, mechanical localization in micro-electrical-mechanical systems, acoustic localization of energy in an air filled tube with a periodic array of resonators and, at the largest scale, the nonlinear localization within multibunch modes in high energy accelerators.  Graduate and undergraduate students working in this new research area will have training in condensed matter nonlinear dynamics with applications involving technologically important length scales.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
