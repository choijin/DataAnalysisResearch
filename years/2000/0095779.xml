<AbstractNarration>Organizational culture is a familiar concept to both researchers and&lt;br/&gt;managers.  It is frequently cited as the source of a firm's efficiency or as&lt;br/&gt;the cause of problems in firm adaptation or mergers.  However, in spite of&lt;br/&gt;its familiarity, it has been difficult to capture exactly what&lt;br/&gt;organizational culture is and how it affects firms.  We propose a series of&lt;br/&gt;studies that use an experimental procedure to create something very similar&lt;br/&gt;to culture in the laboratory.  The basic elements of culture, based on&lt;br/&gt;common threads in the research literature, are that it is something that&lt;br/&gt;arises through shared history and understanding between members of an&lt;br/&gt;organization, that it depends on the organization's history and can&lt;br/&gt;therefore vary greatly between firms, and that it allows members of a firm&lt;br/&gt;to coordinate activity and therefore perform more efficiently.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our experiments use a task that allows "firms" consisting of two or more&lt;br/&gt;subjects to develop culture through repeated interaction.  In our&lt;br/&gt;experiments, language serves as a metaphor for culture - subjects need to&lt;br/&gt;develop a way to refer to unknown and complex objects using simple, short&lt;br/&gt;phrases in order to perform a task quickly.  These "cultures" that subjects&lt;br/&gt;develop end up being based on the group's shared history in performing the&lt;br/&gt;task (what aspects of the objects did they focus on initially?), they end up&lt;br/&gt;being idiosyncratic and varying greatly between groups (as an example: one&lt;br/&gt;group came to refer to an object as "Macarena" while another group referred&lt;br/&gt;to the same object as "coffee cups"), and they end up allowing the groups to&lt;br/&gt;coordinate and improve efficiency (the one word descriptions allowed groups&lt;br/&gt;to jointly identify objects quickly).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our initial experiments investigate what happens when two groups that have&lt;br/&gt;developed culture independently - and have become efficient at performing&lt;br/&gt;the task - are merged.  Not surprisingly, differences in cultures lead to&lt;br/&gt;decreases in the efficiency with which the merged group performs the task.&lt;br/&gt;In addition, subjects are not aware of how difficult it will be to integrate&lt;br/&gt;even these simple cultures, leading them to overvalue the merged firm.&lt;br/&gt;Finally, once culture conflict arises, subjects blame the source of the&lt;br/&gt;failures on incompetence on the part of other subjects rather than on the&lt;br/&gt;difficulty in integrating different cultures.  Future experiments will&lt;br/&gt;further explore the last phenomenon by more closely examining the extent to&lt;br/&gt;which subjects place the blame for merger failure on others rather than on&lt;br/&gt;culture incompatibility.  One implication is that managers may fire&lt;br/&gt;employees too frequently, blaming low performance on their incompetence&lt;br/&gt;rather than on the need for cultural integration.  We will also explore how&lt;br/&gt;cultural integration is related to whether members of an organization have&lt;br/&gt;common or opposed incentives.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
