    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a short-exposure imaging sensor for measuring and controlling particle temperature and velocity of thermal sprays. Thermal spray is a rapidly growing element of the metals processing industry, which needs process control. Currently, there are no direct particle condition controls, for lack of a sensor to provide real-time measurements. This imaging sensor technology will continuously view the entire particle stream, utilize the entire emission across the spectral range of the sensor, and employ fast image processing algorithms to obtain on-line measurements. Phase II will develop a sensor response model, hardware and software design, and prototype sensors will be constructed and calibration tested. These sensors will be incorporated in process control systems and operated in an industrial environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thermal spray technology is changing and improving the way high quality metal parts are manufactured for the automotive, aerospace, energy, and heavy equipment industries. Sensor and thermal spray controls will provide new levels of cost efficiency and consistency to challenges in material processing, namely thermal, wear and corrosion, by coating the surface with metals and ceramics.</AbstractNarration>
