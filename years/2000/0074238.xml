    <AbstractNarration>The investigator and his colleague study ways to break&lt;br/&gt;intractability of algorithms for high-dimensional problems. They&lt;br/&gt;focus on high-dimensional integration, explore breaking&lt;br/&gt;intractability either by settling for a stochastic assurance of&lt;br/&gt;small error or by using additional domain knowledge, and further&lt;br/&gt;develop FinDer, a software package for high-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;integration.&lt;br/&gt; The computational complexity of an algorithm is a measure of&lt;br/&gt;the amount of work the algorithm must perform to produce a&lt;br/&gt;solution for given inputs. Usually the complexity is measured in&lt;br/&gt;the size of the problem being solved. For example, finding the&lt;br/&gt;solution of a linear matrix equation in N unknowns --- an&lt;br/&gt;N-dimsional problem --- generally takes on the order of N times N&lt;br/&gt;times N arithmetic operations; the computational complexity of&lt;br/&gt;such an algorithm is N cubed. There is huge interest in solving&lt;br/&gt;high-dimensional problems. Many applications involve functions&lt;br/&gt;of hundreds, thousands, and even an infinite number of variables.&lt;br/&gt;Examples occur in physics, chemistry, mathematical science, and&lt;br/&gt;economics. These problems must usually be solved numerically and&lt;br/&gt;one has to settle for an approximate numerical solution to within&lt;br/&gt;an error epsilon. If a worst case deterministic assurance of an&lt;br/&gt;epsilon approximation is desired, then the computational&lt;br/&gt;complexity usually depends exponentially on the number of&lt;br/&gt;variables; the problem is said to be intractible. The&lt;br/&gt;investigators study breaking intractability either by settling&lt;br/&gt;for a stochastic assurance of small error or by using additional&lt;br/&gt;domain knowledge. The use of formalizing additional domain&lt;br/&gt;knowledge is a powerful new idea. In particular, the&lt;br/&gt;investigators study under what conditions a double win is&lt;br/&gt;achievable for the important problem of high-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;integration: when does an algorithm to compute the value of a&lt;br/&gt;high-dimensional integral both converge faster than a Monte Carlo&lt;br/&gt;algorithm and do so with a worst case deterministic assurance?&lt;br/&gt;They apply the theoretical results to improve the FinDer software&lt;br/&gt;system for computing high-dimensional integrals. This new&lt;br/&gt;paradigm is applied to other problems of computational&lt;br/&gt;mathematics.</AbstractNarration>
