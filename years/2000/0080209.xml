<AbstractNarration>Manufactured homes are built within and assembly plant under a controlled environment that provides safe and productive construction. "Manufactured Housing" has played a critical role in meeting the rapidly growing housing demand over the last 20-25 years. In spite of the growing market and need for efficient production, manufactured housing industry is faced with the lack of streamlined assembly process and the flow and utilization of materials in the production process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research consists of five objectives, which are: (i) to develop a production process model for multisection manufactured housing production; (ii) to develop a process model for the material flow and its utilization on the assembly line; (iii) to integrate the two process models produced in objectives 1 and 2; (iv) to implement the integrated process model in a computer simulation system; and (v) to develop a dissemination and continuing education strategy for the industry and offer a pilot workshop in conjunction with industry partners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will have direct influence on two of the four path goals related to affordability and durability/quality, and indirect influence on the other two goals related to energy efficiency and safety.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
