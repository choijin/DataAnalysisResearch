<AbstractNarration>0072247&lt;br/&gt;Shubov&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary goal of this proposal is to develop the spectral, asymptotic, &lt;br/&gt;and stability analysis for three increasingly more complete and &lt;br/&gt;complicated models of an aircraft wing in a surrounding airflow. The first &lt;br/&gt;two of these models (1-dimensional and 2-dimensional respectively) have &lt;br/&gt;been developed in the Flight Systems Research Center (FSRC) at UCLA &lt;br/&gt;in collaboration with NASA Dryden Flight Research Center, Edwards, &lt;br/&gt;CA. The designing of the 3-dimensional model is in progress. Among the &lt;br/&gt;wing models existing in the extensive modern literature on aeroelasticity, &lt;br/&gt;the aforementioned ones are most physically complete. In November &lt;br/&gt;1999, the 1-dimensional model was tested in a series of four flight &lt;br/&gt;experiments at Edwards Airforce Base, CA. The experimental results are &lt;br/&gt;in excellent agreement with the theoretical predictions of the model at &lt;br/&gt;least for low - energy aeroelastic modes. Currently, the collaboration is &lt;br/&gt;supported by NSF Grant DMS-9972748 (Interdisciplinary Grants in the &lt;br/&gt;Mathematical Sciences). This grant provides the support for a one year &lt;br/&gt;visit (Fall 1999 - Spring 2000) of the principal investigator to the Center in &lt;br/&gt;order to study in depth the engineering and physical principles of aircraft &lt;br/&gt;wing modeling and to continue work on the joint project with the &lt;br/&gt;researchers of the Center. During recent years, the investigator's research &lt;br/&gt;has been focused on two main directions: (a) spectral and asymptotic &lt;br/&gt;analysis of non-self-adjoint operators in a Hilbert space, operators which &lt;br/&gt;are the dynamics generators of hyperbolic equations and systems &lt;br/&gt;containing damping terms and subject to dissipative boundary conditions; &lt;br/&gt;(b) applications of the results of this analysis to the control of distributed &lt;br/&gt;parameter systems governed by those equations and systems. The series of &lt;br/&gt;results and methods, developed in this research, has now culminated in the &lt;br/&gt;work on the aforementioned 1-dimensional model of a vibrating aircraft &lt;br/&gt;wing. Substantial progress has been made: the PI was able to obtain first in &lt;br/&gt;the literature explicit asymptotic formulas for the high-frequency &lt;br/&gt;aeroelastic modes and mode shapes. The objectives of this project include: &lt;br/&gt;(a) obtaining space-time domain representations for the solutions of the 1-&lt;br/&gt;dimensional model; (b) obtaining spectral asymptotics and representations &lt;br/&gt;for the solutions of most recent 2-dimensional model; (c) applying &lt;br/&gt;asymptotic and spectral results to the flutter suppression problem; (d) &lt;br/&gt;participating in the designing of a 3-dimensional model of a wing and &lt;br/&gt;extending the above analysis to this model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The present project can be considered as a theoretical part of the broad &lt;br/&gt;wing modeling project conducted by the researchers at the aforementioned &lt;br/&gt;Centers. The ultimate goal of the entire project is to give specific practical &lt;br/&gt;recommendations to aircraft industry engineers working on flutter &lt;br/&gt;suppression in aircraft wings and tails. Flutter is a dynamic instability &lt;br/&gt;occurring in an aircraft in flight at a specific speed which is called a flutter &lt;br/&gt;speed. Damage inflicted by flutter results in significant cost to the aircraft &lt;br/&gt;industry. The objective of this project is to carry out a rigorous &lt;br/&gt;mathematical analysis of the aircraft wing model and to apply the results &lt;br/&gt;of this analysis to the problem of flutter control. It has been recognized in &lt;br/&gt;the engineering community that the results of such an analysis can provide &lt;br/&gt;new insights which are not available from experiments or from numerical &lt;br/&gt;simulations. In addition to the above technical objectives of the project, &lt;br/&gt;the principal investigator is planning to develop a new graduate program &lt;br/&gt;on mathematical methods in aircraft engineering for both mathematics and &lt;br/&gt;engineering students.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
