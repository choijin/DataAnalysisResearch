<AbstractNarration>Rinzel&lt;br/&gt;0078420&lt;br/&gt;     The neural computation by the mammalian auditory system to&lt;br/&gt;localize low frequency sound sources relies on processing in the&lt;br/&gt;brain stem.  Neurons and circuits there, in the medial superior&lt;br/&gt;olive (MSO), have specialized biophysical properties for&lt;br/&gt;processing and preserving precise timings.  These neurons have&lt;br/&gt;distinctive firing properties.  When a steady stimulus is&lt;br/&gt;presented they fire only once, at stimulus onset; many other&lt;br/&gt;types of neurons would behave tonically, firing throughout the&lt;br/&gt;stimulus presentation.  This property of phasicness is believed&lt;br/&gt;crucial for the MSO cell's role in precise temporal processing.&lt;br/&gt;In contrast, tonic cells are assumed to be less capable of&lt;br/&gt;tracking rapidly changing signals.  The MSO cells have a special&lt;br/&gt;potassium current, IK-LT, that underlies their phasic behavior.&lt;br/&gt;The investigator and his colleagues systematically study how the&lt;br/&gt;temporal processing ability of a neuron changes as the neuron is&lt;br/&gt;transformed from phasic to tonic mode, say by gradually adjusting&lt;br/&gt;the strength of IK-LT (using pharmacological blockers and&lt;br/&gt;electronic methods of re-introducing the blocked current).  When a&lt;br/&gt;cell is in phasic mode does it track a time-varying signal&lt;br/&gt;better, or does it perform better coincidence detection, than&lt;br/&gt;when it is in tonic mode? The research combines both experimental&lt;br/&gt;and theoretical approaches.  The experiments involve electrical&lt;br/&gt;recording from individual MSO neurons while stimulating them with&lt;br/&gt;periodic and other time-varying signals.  Various quantitative&lt;br/&gt;criteria are applied to assess the quality of temporal&lt;br/&gt;processing.  From the theoretical side, biophysically-based&lt;br/&gt;mathematical models are developed that mimic the MSO neurons,&lt;br/&gt;including a term for IK-LT.  The model's performance for temporal&lt;br/&gt;processing is evaluated just like the real cells.  In addition,&lt;br/&gt;concepts from nonlinear dynamical systems are applied in order to&lt;br/&gt;reveal and understand the underlying mathematical structure.&lt;br/&gt;This mathematical understanding will shed light on the&lt;br/&gt;significance of phasicness in other neural systems where the&lt;br/&gt;mechanism might not involve IK-LT.  This project also explores the&lt;br/&gt;influence of randomness on the temporal processing abilities.&lt;br/&gt;Some randomness is intrinsic to the auditory nervous system, and&lt;br/&gt;it is believed to be functionally important.  Without sources of&lt;br/&gt;variability, these nonlinear neuronal systems tend to phase-lock&lt;br/&gt;too well, impairing a system's ability to perform discrimination&lt;br/&gt;tasks.  The investigator therefore also assesses the effects of&lt;br/&gt;randomness on the temporal processing power of phasic and tonic&lt;br/&gt;cells and on the theoretical models.  This work seeks to test&lt;br/&gt;whether the commonly accepted notion, that phasicness enhances&lt;br/&gt;temporal processing power, passes a set of quantitative criteria&lt;br/&gt;and, if so, to develop a theoretical foundation that supports the&lt;br/&gt;notion and that extends to other neural and possibly some&lt;br/&gt;chemical and physical systems as well.  A related subproject is to&lt;br/&gt;develop computational models that help explain the dynamic&lt;br/&gt;effects seen experimentally as interaural phase (or amplitude or&lt;br/&gt;frequency) is varied dynamically.  A deeper understanding of some&lt;br/&gt;surprising effects, as seen in the auditory mid-brain, should&lt;br/&gt;contribute to developing a theory for how motion of sound sources&lt;br/&gt;is analyzed in the brain.&lt;br/&gt;     It is believed that some neural computations involve&lt;br/&gt;cellular and circuit properties that enable encoding and decoding&lt;br/&gt;based on precise timing of action potentials.  Sound localization&lt;br/&gt;in the auditory system offers a compelling example.  It serves as&lt;br/&gt;the case study for this research, that seeks a more qualitative&lt;br/&gt;characterization of cellular properties that correlate with&lt;br/&gt;precise temporal processing.  Many cells in the auditory brain&lt;br/&gt;stem contribute to the system's ability to detect coincidence of&lt;br/&gt;interaural signals.  These neurons have distinctive firing&lt;br/&gt;properties.  When a steady stimulus is presented they fire only&lt;br/&gt;once, at stimulus onset, while neurons of many other types will&lt;br/&gt;continue to fire until the stimulus is turned off.  This property&lt;br/&gt;of phasicness is believed crucial for precise temporal&lt;br/&gt;processing.  In contrast, tonic cells are assumed to be less&lt;br/&gt;capable of tracking rapidly changing signals.  The biophysical&lt;br/&gt;basis, a special potassium current, IK-LT, appears to underlie&lt;br/&gt;phasicness in the brain stem neurons.  This project systematically&lt;br/&gt;addresses how the temporal processing ability of a neuron changes&lt;br/&gt;as the neuron is transformed from phasic to tonic mode, say by&lt;br/&gt;gradually adjusting the strength of IK-LT.  When a cell is in&lt;br/&gt;phasic mode does it track a time-varying signal better, or does&lt;br/&gt;it perform better coincidence detection, than when it is in tonic&lt;br/&gt;mode?  The research combines both experimental and theoretical&lt;br/&gt;approaches.  The experiments involve electrical recording from&lt;br/&gt;individual neurons in vitro while stimulating them with periodic&lt;br/&gt;and other time-varying signals, including random components.  From&lt;br/&gt;the theoretical side, biophysically-based mathematical models are&lt;br/&gt;developed that mimic the neurons, including a term for IK-LT.&lt;br/&gt;Various measures are applied to the computer and cellular models&lt;br/&gt;to assess reliability and precision of processing.  In addition,&lt;br/&gt;concepts from nonlinear dynamical systems are applied in order to&lt;br/&gt;reveal and understand the underlying mathematical structure.  This&lt;br/&gt;understanding will enable us to generalize about the significance&lt;br/&gt;of phasicness to other neural systems where the mechanism might&lt;br/&gt;not involve IK-LT.  A related subproject is to develop&lt;br/&gt;computational models that help explain the dynamic effects seen&lt;br/&gt;experimentally as interaural phase (or amplitude or frequency) is&lt;br/&gt;varied dynamically.  A deeper understanding of these surprising&lt;br/&gt;effects, as seen in the auditory mid-brain, should contribute to&lt;br/&gt;developing a theory for how motion of sound sources is analyzed&lt;br/&gt;in the brain.  This project is supported by the Applied&lt;br/&gt;Mathematics and Computational Mathematics programs and the Office&lt;br/&gt;of Multidisciplinary Activities in MPS and by the Computational&lt;br/&gt;Neuroscience program in BIO.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
