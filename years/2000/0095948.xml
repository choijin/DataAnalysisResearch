<AbstractNarration>Proposal # HRD-0095948  &lt;br/&gt;Institution: Rochester Institute of Technology&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Harry G. Lang&lt;br/&gt;Title: "Clearinghouse on Mathematics, Engineering, Technology and Science (COMETS): A Comprehensive Resource in the Education of Deaf Students"  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed Clearinghouse On Mathematics, Engineering, Technology, and Science (COMETS) will serve as a major resource for information dissemination.  The Project will also build a network of many professionals who will use the resources for systemic reform, and will evaluate its information dissemination strategies with these audiences.  The goals of the project are to: 1) develop a comprehensive resource to provide synchronous information through interactive components to eight target audiences of professionals, parents, and students available on the World Wide Web and in print: 2) field-test the applicability of the information and the dissemination strategies in both formal and informal professional development activities; and 3) develop a network for systemic reform through information dissemination in the education of deaf students in science, education, mathematics, and technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The revolution in computer technologies shows promise for enhancing information dissemination to students who are deaf or hard of hearing and the professionals responsible for their education.  In particular, the World Wide Web has been shown to be successful in an experimental prototype project as part of a previous NSF-funded teacher preparation project.  Abundant evidence shows that many of the needs of professionals serving deaf students in science, mathematics, engineering, and technology (SMET) areas can be met through quality, interactive resources that are made available on the World Wide Web.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With quality control associated with individual and institutional authority, the Internet can be a credible change agent in an information dissemination program for systemic reform in science and mathematics for deaf students.  COMETS, based at the National Technical Institute for the Deaf (NTID), a college of Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), is an interactive Web site.  Project staff will present educational research findings and draw implications for teaching, curriculum development, and the provision of support services in SMET areas.  The application of the information will be field tested in formal professional development activities.  The quality of the information to be shared will be high, extracted from periodicals refereed by national experts.  The project will also include a comprehensive evaluation of information dissemination and the findings regarding the most effective evaluation strategies will be shared with others through presentations and publications.  An existing network will be expanded from approximately 400 teachers to include administrators, support service professionals, parents, and representatives from organizations critical to systemic reform in the education of deaf students.  The acronym "COMETS" presents an appropriate metaphor.  As with the so-named astronomical bodies, this project will leave a trail of material and energy which will be available for a long time to come.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
