<AbstractNarration>A number of factors are known to affect the timing of reproductive maturation in female primates, including humans.  Nutritional status is a well documented variable and there is some evidence that social stress also plays a role.  This study aims to disentangle the role of socio-ecological variables (both nutritional and social factors) on the timetable of reproductive maturation in captive adolescent female baboons (Papio hamadryas anubis).  More specifically, it is the goal of this study to determine how nutritional factors (body weight, skeletal growth, food intake) and social factors (relative dominance rank, amount of aggression received) affect (a) the timing of menarche/commencement of cycling, (b) the probability of ovulation, (c) the probability of becoming pregnant, and (d) the probability of successful first birth.  With adolescence existing as a marked developmental stage of significant duration in both non-human primates and humans, this study will provide insights into the origins and functions of this transitional stage of development.  In addition, this study will provide evidence as to the roles nutritional status and social stress play in the development and maintenance of regular and competent reproductive functioning, including reliable ovulation and the abilities of individual females to initiate and carry out successful pregnancies.</AbstractNarration>
