<AbstractNarration>Engineering - Civil (54)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pressures on undergraduate science, math, engineering, and technology (SME&amp;T) education and the recommended actions to overcome these problems are well-documented. Miller and Cooper, in work at the University of Washington under the auspices of the Engineering Coalition of Schools for Excellence in Education and Leadership (ECSEL), have developed a multi-faceted suite of educational materials for engineering mechanics courses that incorporates many of these suggestions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project at Louisiana State University is:&lt;br/&gt;1. adapting and implementing the University of Washington Mechanics of Materials educational suite &lt;br/&gt;2. evaluating the effectiveness Miller and Cooper's various components&lt;br/&gt;3. institutionalizing these materials to ensure sustainability&lt;br/&gt;4. disseminating all findings and materials to the engineering education community&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project adds to Miller and Cooper's materials by introducing a wireless network of laptop computers into the classroom. Having computers distributed throughout the classroom affords greater flexibility in developing hands-on activities. Also, multimedia modules are modified and improved, hands-on activities are expanded, and student presentations are expanded to incorporate digital movie making.&lt;br/&gt;The results of these modifications and the effectiveness of the various components of Miller and Cooper's approach are being assessed by mixed mode (quantitative and qualitative) evaluation instruments developed in conjunction with this project. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
