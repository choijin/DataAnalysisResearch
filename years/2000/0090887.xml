<AbstractNarration>The long-term goal of this research is to use Arabidopsis thaliana as a&lt;br/&gt;model system to determine the signaling events leading to systemic acquired&lt;br/&gt;resistance (SAR). SAR is a secondary pathogen resistance which can be&lt;br/&gt;induced after a local infection.  SAR is broad-spectrum and long-lasting.&lt;br/&gt;Through genetic screens, NPR1 has been identified as a key positive&lt;br/&gt;regulator of SAR; mutants of the NPR1 gene are nonresponsive to SAR&lt;br/&gt;induction.  NPR1 encodes a novel protein with functionally important&lt;br/&gt;protein-protein interacting domains, the BTB domain and the ankyrin-repeat&lt;br/&gt;domain.  Recent data show that nuclear localization of NPR1 is essential&lt;br/&gt;for its function.  In the nucleus, NPR1 may affect the activities of the&lt;br/&gt;TGA subclass of bZIP transcription factors as well as the WRKY&lt;br/&gt;transcription factors, which have been implicated as transcriptional&lt;br/&gt;activators and repressors of pathogenesis-related (PR) genes, respectively.&lt;br/&gt;A genetic screen for suppressors of npr1 has led to identification of sni1,&lt;br/&gt;a mutation that restores systemic induction of PR genes in npr1.  The&lt;br/&gt;wild-type SNI1 is believed to be a negative regulator of SAR whose&lt;br/&gt;inactivation requires the function of NPR1.  It is hypothesized that NPR1&lt;br/&gt;induces SAR by activating the TGA transcription activators and inactivating&lt;br/&gt;WRKY transcription repressors, and relieving the negative control of SNI1.&lt;br/&gt;In this project, molecular genetic and biochemical experiments are designed&lt;br/&gt;to (1) determine the functional significance of the interaction between&lt;br/&gt;NPR1 and WRKY transcription factors in SAR;  (2) determine the mechanism by&lt;br/&gt;which SNI1 functions as a negative regulator of SAR; and  (3) identify&lt;br/&gt;components in the NPR1-complex.  Because NPR1, SNI1, and WRKY transcription&lt;br/&gt;factors are either novel or plant-specific proteins, characterization of&lt;br/&gt;these components may unveil new mechanisms of signal transduction.&lt;br/&gt;Understanding molecular mechanisms of disease resistance in plants will&lt;br/&gt;lead to the development of technology in enhancing plants' innate defense&lt;br/&gt;to control infection.  Such technology has the potential to reduce the use&lt;br/&gt;of hazardous pesticides without using non-plant genes.  Therefore, the&lt;br/&gt;study of plant-microbe interactions is of interest to advancement of basic&lt;br/&gt;science as well as to protection of the environment and improvement of&lt;br/&gt;human life.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
