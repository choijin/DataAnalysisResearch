<AbstractNarration>Chemistry (12)&lt;br/&gt;A consortium consisting of institutions including Georgia State University, the Georgia Institute of Technology, the University of Georgia, Emory University, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Williams College, James Madison University, Millersville University, the University of California at Riverside, the University of Illinois at Chicago, Utah State University, and Washington State University is offering five-day intensive workshops in the following areas: Chemical Education, Chemistry of Art, Chemometrics, Combinatorial Chemistry, Computational Chemistry, Environmental Chemistry, Forensic Science, Laser Technology, Metals in Biology, Molecular Genetics, Multidimensional Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Organometallic Chemistry, Phototchemistry, and Polymer Chemistry. These workshops include extensive "hands-on" experience for the participants. Materials that can be readily incorporated into participant instructional activities are being provided. The target audience for these activities is primarily faculty from undergraduate institutions, plus conservators and forensic, biomedical and public health scientists with significant educational responsibilities. The goals of the workshop program include: (1) augmentation and upgrading of participants' knowledge in selected areas; (2) the integration of chemistry and biochemistry into other fields; (3) exposure of participants to new or emerging scientific fields derived from current research activity; and (4) development of new approaches for the implementation of workshop materials into the vocational mission of the participants. The program consists of twelve yearly workshops and two annual reunions over a three-year period. Approximately 850 participants will be served by the program; a total of 3,600 participant-days of instruction will be generated. Some workshops are being scheduled in conjunction with national or regional American Chemical Society meetings. A key goal is the rotation of those workshops that are mobile among the consortium sites in order to serve a geographically dispersed pool of participants.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
