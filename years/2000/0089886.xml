<AbstractNarration>DEB-0089886&lt;br/&gt;Andrew V. Brower&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A collaborative grant has been awarded to Dr. Andrew Brower at Oregon State University and Drs. Thomas Emmel and Keith Willmott at the University of Florida to conduct an integrated phylogenetic analysis of relationships among the ithomiine butterflies.  These tropical butterflies have been of interest to evolutionary biologists and biogeographers for more than a century, because they participate in complex, geographically varying mimicry rings.  Different species of ithomiines, along with representatives of various other butterfly groups, have evolved similar-looking, brightly-colored wing patterns that make them memorable to predators.  Because the butterflies are poisonous, the bright color pattern serves as a warning to avoid similar looking individuals, and thus there is a great benefit to sharing in the common signaling system.  The result of this complex adaptation is that unrelated species may look virtually identical, complicating efforts to understand the relationships among species and genera in the group.  Willmott and Emmel will conduct cladistic analyses of adult morphology and chromosome variation.   Brower will complement that effort with study of additional characters from DNA sequences.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to produce a robust phylogenetic hypothesis for relationships among the 50 or so genera based upon combined analysis of morphology, chromosomal structure, and molecular data.  This will provide a model system for addressing similar complex situations among many other groups of animals and plants, and will allow a better understanding of how biodiversity on our planet has developed.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
