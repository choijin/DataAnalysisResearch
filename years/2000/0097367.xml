<AbstractNarration>Selected undergraduate physics majors will participate in scientific research projects; each student will work directly with a faculty member of the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Toledo.  Possible research areas include astrophysics, atomic physics, biological physics, condensed matter physics, materials science, medical physics, optics, photonics, and plasma physics.  Projects will be parts of significant ongoing research programs, and will often result in scientific publications.  These opportunities will be advertised nationally and the students will be selected competitively.  In addition to stipends and housing for a ten-week research program, students will be given financial support for travel to and from Toledo.  Also, students will be encouraged to present a paper at a regional or national scientific meeting, and provided financial support for that purpose.  The students will also attend workshops to learn how to choose a graduate school, prepare for the GRE, and present a public talk.   Eight students will be supported by the NSF-REU program and two additional students will be supported by funds from the University of Toledo.</AbstractNarration>
