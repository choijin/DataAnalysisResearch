<AbstractNarration>Shaul Mukamel of the University of Rochester and Rudy Marcus of Caltech are supported by the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program for a prototype summer school for graduate students and post-doctoral fellows, administered through the Gordon Research Conferences office.  The summer school runs 11 days and consists of 3-4 lectures per day morning and evening, with afternoons open for discussion.  Lecturers are in residence for at least 7 of the 11 days, to allow time for interaction with students.  The focus of this summer school, a pilot program, is on teaching analytic techniques relevant to rate processes in the condensed phase.  It is envisioned that future summer schools will focus on other areas of theoretical chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this summer school is to provide a basic survey of current theoretical techniques to chemistry graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and advanced senior undergraduate students.  The lectures will emphasize and illustrate specific analytical techniques as well as physically motivated approximations and the connection with current experiments.  Lecturers will discuss what aspects of their work are transferable to other quite different problems in various fields of theory.</AbstractNarration>
