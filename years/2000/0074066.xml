<AbstractNarration>The Novikov conjecture is one of the fundamental unsolved problems of manifold theory. &lt;br/&gt;Its history is a fascinating journey through a remarkably varied mathematical landscape. &lt;br/&gt;The conjecture has provoked vigorous exchanges of ideas between widely separated subjects, &lt;br/&gt;and (like other famous unsolved problems) it has generated lively new mathematics of its &lt;br/&gt;own. The Baum Connes conjecture transports the fundamental aspects of the Novikov &lt;br/&gt;conjecture to operator algebra theory, and makes new contacts with representation theory,&lt;br/&gt;spin geometry and other areas.&lt;br/&gt; Very recently, striking progress has been made on the both conjectures. Methods and ideas &lt;br/&gt;involving dimension theory, amenable actions of groups, Banach space geometry and combinatorics have played essential roles. An unusually exciting opportunity has arisen to&lt;br/&gt;spark interaction among some quite widely separated fields. Some of the core questions are so &lt;br/&gt;basic that one can even expect important exchanges at the student level. The issues are so &lt;br/&gt;broad that the ordinary mathematical scheme of small, two or three person, collaborative &lt;br/&gt;efforts will not give the most rapid and efficient progress. &lt;br/&gt;The key objectives of the proposed program are as follows: &lt;br/&gt;Marshall forces from topology, analysis and from several less apparent areas for a general &lt;br/&gt;attack on the Novikov and Baum Connes conjectures. &lt;br/&gt;Create a rapid and effcient means of providing the essential tools for continuing research &lt;br/&gt;in this broad area. &lt;br/&gt;Broaden the communication and cooperation between US and foreign mathematicians &lt;br/&gt;through a coordinated program of visits. &lt;br/&gt;Offer effective training opportunities for graduate students, giving them exposure to an &lt;br/&gt;unusual breadth of mathematical ideas and expertise. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
