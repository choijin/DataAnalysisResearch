    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project plans to develop a novel technology for polymer encapsulation of nanopowders. Nanoparticles, because of their unique properties and advantages, are fast gaining acceptance by all sectors of the industry. Currently, the use of nanoparticles is restricted by either its unavailability or lack of technology for its processing. One such technology is for the coating of nanopowders with a polymeric material. Polymer coated iron nanoparticles (size range of 5-15 nm), because of their super-paramagnetic properties, have extensive applications in the area of bio-separation, detection of toxins in water, immunoassays, DNA probes, and magnetic resonance imaging. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The super-paramagnetic nature of these beads means a lower magnetic field (about 1/10 to 1/20) is required for their separation and this translates to significant cost reduction. It should be emphasized that currently there is no technique for coating nanopowders with a polymer. During this Phase I effort, a novel technology for coating of iron nanopowders with a polymer-polystyrene will be developed.</AbstractNarration>
