<AbstractNarration>HRD-0000272&lt;br/&gt;Ford&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LS-AMP) is a comprehensive statewide-coordinated program aimed at substantially increasing the number and quality of minority students earning baccalaureate degrees in science, mathematics, engineering, and technology (SMET) areas supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and subsequently to increase the number of minority students enrolling and succeeding graduate school.  A mediator-aim, for the attainment of the above goal, consists of enhancing and institutionalizing, systemic mentoring, student research participation, and a reform-imbued instructional infrastructure at LS-LAMP institutions, in collaboration with other systemic programs in the state, national laboratories, and professional organizations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LS-LAMP began in 1995 with a five-year objective of doubling, by the end of 2000, the number of minority SMET students receiving BS degrees from partner institutions (from 500 to 1,000) and of sending 20% of these graduates to enroll and succeed in SMET graduate school programs in Louisiana and elsewhere.  Indicators of the attainment of the objectives of Phase I are presented farther below.  By the end of the five-year period of Phase II, LS-LAMP proposes not only to maintain the gains of Phase I but also to increase the number of high-quality SMET BS degree production to 1600 per year while institutionalizing its entire operation.  No fewer than 40% of these graduates will successfully pursue SMET graduates degrees.  The basic strategies of LS-LAMP are a comprehensive collaboration, the statewide replication and expansion of exemplary, systematic mentoring and outreach programs, including the Timbuktu Academy and others, and institutionalization.  A notable feature of LS-LAMP Phase II resides in the coordinated approach to complete institutionalization of our activities that are focused on increasing minority participation in SMET.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Southern University and A&amp;M College serves as the lead institution for LS-LAMP program with the active input and advice of an array of collaborating public and private sector entities including the LS-LAMP Governing Board, chaired by the Commissioner of Higher Education, Dr. E. Joseph Savoie.  Currently, there are eleven (11) Louisiana higher educational institutions and one research organization participating in LS-LAMP.  They are Dillard University (DU), Grambling State University (GSU), Southern University and A&amp;M College (SUBR), Southern University at New Orleans (SUNO), Southern University at Shreveport (SU-S), Tulane University (TU), the University of New Orleans (UNO), the University of Southwestern Louisiana (USL), and the Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium (LUMCON).  The grantee and fiduciary agent for Ls-LAMP is the Louisiana Board of Regents.  The Board of Regents, in consultation with the lead institution, issue contracts to LS-LAMP partner institutions as per the cooperative agreement between the Regents and the National Science Foundation (NSF).&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
