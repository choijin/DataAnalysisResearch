<AbstractNarration>the purpose of this proposal is to support the activities of the Board on Infrastructure and the Constructed Environment (BICE) of the National Research Council, National Academies.  The request is for $55,000 out of a total of $185,000 for the one-year period from 1 October 2000 through September 30, 2001.  BICE proposes to continue its function of providing an independent forum where expertise from a wide variety of scienfific and engineering disciplines can address issues and opportunities concerned with infrastructure and the built environment.  BICE has and will continue to respond to specific requests from government, and, as appropriate, act on its own initiative with public and private support.  During the coming year, BICE will broaden its activities in natural and technological hazards to incorporate "extreme events" events whose impacts, effects or outcomes are significant, in this context, to the infrastructure and the built environment.  A colloquium on the topic is planned during the period of the grant.</AbstractNarration>
