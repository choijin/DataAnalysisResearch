    <AbstractNarration>While high-rise construction serves as one of the most challenging projects undertaken by society, tall buildings are one of the few constructed facilities whose design relies solely upon analytical and scaled models, which, though based upon fundamental mechanics and years of research and experience, has yet to be systematically validated in full-scale. To address this issue, several tall buildings in Chicago whose structural systems are most commonly used in high-rise design will be instrumented to measure response characteristics under the action of wind. The instrumentation will include accelerometers and high precision GPS systems. To facilitate unhindered access to real-time measurements, a Java-based internet framework will be developed, permitting the project team, and its advisory board of designers, consultants, and interested researchers, analysis capabilities from any remote location. The subsequent analyses, in total, will provide valuable insight into a variety of response characteristics for tall buildings and permit the systematic validation of existing design practice through the comparison of analytical and wind tunnel response estimates with full-scale observations. Both amplitude-dependent frequency and damping estimates using Wavelet-Based System Identification will be made to shed new light on the dynamic characteristics at varying response levels.</AbstractNarration>
