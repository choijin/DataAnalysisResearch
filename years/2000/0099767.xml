    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT (DMS-0099767)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator proposes to study the sharp regularity&lt;br/&gt;properties of operators associated to domains of finite type in dimensions&lt;br/&gt;greater than two, and to apply the results to the study of the boundary&lt;br/&gt;behavior of holomorphic functions in these domains. He also proposes to&lt;br/&gt;study corresponding properties on certain nilpotent Lie groups. The&lt;br/&gt;operators under consideration include the Szego and Bergman projections, and&lt;br/&gt;the relative fundamental solutions to the Kohn-Laplacian. In particular, the&lt;br/&gt;principal investigator hopes to find an appropriate metric that controls the&lt;br/&gt;size of the distribution kernel for the Szego projection on diagonalizable&lt;br/&gt;pseudo-convex domains of finite type, and on convex domains. He hopes to&lt;br/&gt;study the boundary behavior of holomorphic functions in certain&lt;br/&gt;non-diagonalizable domains, and in this context, he proposes to study&lt;br/&gt;variants of the Hardy-Littlewood maximal function. Appropriate nilpotent Lie&lt;br/&gt;groups can model many of these problems, and the principal investigator&lt;br/&gt;proposes to study the corresponding convolution operators on the groups. The&lt;br/&gt;distribution kernels of these operators have singularities that are more&lt;br/&gt;complicated than the classical Calderon-Zygmund singular integral operators,&lt;br/&gt;and the problem thus leads to interesting questions in harmonic analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interesting questions and results in mathematics often arise at the&lt;br/&gt;interface of two or more areas of research, since in such situations, deep&lt;br/&gt;results in one field can shed light on previously intractable problems in&lt;br/&gt;another. The research outlined in this proposal is directed towards&lt;br/&gt;questions at the interface of modern harmonic analysis, several complex&lt;br/&gt;variables, and linear partial differential equations. For more than forty&lt;br/&gt;years these areas have enjoyed a very profitable symbiotic relationship. For&lt;br/&gt;example, attempts to solve the Levy problem in complex analysis led to the&lt;br/&gt;development of deep results about hypo-elliptic partial differential&lt;br/&gt;equations, and these problems, in turn, led to developments in harmonic&lt;br/&gt;analysis on nilpotent Lie groups such as the Heisenberg group. Many of these&lt;br/&gt;related results dealt with integral operators that are modeled on the&lt;br/&gt;classical singular integrals such as the Hilbert transform and the Riesz&lt;br/&gt;transforms whose study goes back to the middle of the twentieth century. In&lt;br/&gt;recent years, it has become clear that new problems in complex analysis&lt;br/&gt;require the understanding of new kinds of operators in which the&lt;br/&gt;singularities of the kernel are considerably more complicated than the&lt;br/&gt;classical singular integrals. The research described in this proposal is&lt;br/&gt;directed toward understanding these more complicated situations.</AbstractNarration>
