<AbstractNarration>What is the likely price of the Dow next year?  How long can the &lt;br/&gt;patient expect to live?  How many lives are likely to be lost in a &lt;br/&gt;looming military campaign?  Questions such as these confront decision &lt;br/&gt;makers every day.  The proposed research seeks to understand, and &lt;br/&gt;ultimately improve, the precise psychological processes by which such &lt;br/&gt;judgments are made.  Often such judgments are made by adjusting from &lt;br/&gt;some initial starting point.  The Dow is at 10,500 right now, so one &lt;br/&gt;might estimate it will be at 11,000 next year.  The last patient with &lt;br/&gt;the same symptoms lived for 6 months, so one might estimate a &lt;br/&gt;survival time of one year.  Psychologists, economists, and marketing &lt;br/&gt;scholars have investigated such "anchoring and adjustment" processes &lt;br/&gt;during the past twenty-five years and have found that a person's &lt;br/&gt;ultimate judgment tends to be too close to the initial value-i.e., &lt;br/&gt;the initial value serves as an "anchor" that biases the ultimate &lt;br/&gt;judgment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The present research seeks to build on existing knowledge of &lt;br/&gt;anchoring and adjustment processes by pointing out (with empirical &lt;br/&gt;justification) an important misunderstanding in the current &lt;br/&gt;literature.  The proposed experiments are designed to show that the &lt;br/&gt;psychological processes invoked by real-world problems like those &lt;br/&gt;above are quite different from those invoked in the standard &lt;br/&gt;paradigms used to investigate anchoring and adjustment.  Real-world &lt;br/&gt;problems like those above involve explicit adjustment from the &lt;br/&gt;initial value; the standard anchoring paradigm involves simple &lt;br/&gt;priming of anchor-consistent information.  By directing the field to &lt;br/&gt;the true source of anchoring effects in real-world contexts, the &lt;br/&gt;proposed research promises to point the way to strategies that can be &lt;br/&gt;used to improve the accuracy of important real-world forecasts.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
