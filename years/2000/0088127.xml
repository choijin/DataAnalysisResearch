<AbstractNarration>Physics (13) The objective of this project is to use a multitarget sputter deposition system to enhance the capabilities of a Microfabrication Laboratory and course work. This new laboratory is used to give undergraduate students a fundamental understanding of the processes used in the research, development, and manufacture of microelectronic devices. Moreover, microfabrication technology is continually being adapted for other applications, such as microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), optics, biomedical devices, flat panel displays (FPDs), and sensors. Microfabrication, whatever the device being produced, integrates aspects of physics, chemistry, materials science, and several engineering disciplines into one readily recognized application. Consequently, courses and projects conducted in the Microfabrication Laboratory are natural forums in which to emphasize the value of multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary education. The courses and experiments developed at James Madison University, which does not offer engineering degrees, will be designed to insert hands- on, interdisciplinary laboratory experiences early in the undergraduate curriculum through the use of traditional and novel soft lithography techniques. The Microfabrication Laboratory is extensively used for upper level courses and student research projects. The goal is to expose a broad spectrum of undergraduate science and technology students to microfabrication techniques. Equally important is the emphasis on developing teamwork and communication skills in an interdisciplinary environment, with courses and projects pursued by students from multiple departments. Experience with microfabrication techniques at the undergraduate level helps prepare students for further work in this area, whether they enter industry or graduate school. The project also demonstrates the feasibility of implementing microfabrication experiments at other undergraduate institutions and extending them beyond the engineering curricula in which they have previously been incorporated. Many industries will be revolutionized by new and creative application of microfabrication technologies; this revolution begins by exposing a broader audience of students to microfabrication science and technology. Experiments are being adapted from the research and education literature in engineering, physics, chemistry, and materials science.</AbstractNarration>
