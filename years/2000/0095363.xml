<AbstractNarration>The investigators will study wave turbulence and associated transport of heat and mass in filamentary structures in magnetized plasmas.  Filamentary structures are encountered in many space plasmas, including the solar corona and the auroral ionosphere.  In general, filamentary structures are a manifestation of self-organization in magnetized plasmas and their presence can have a profound impact on the global transport properties of the medium.  The methodology is to study the dynamics of temperature, density and current filaments under controlled conditions in the laboratory and to relate the results to theoretical and modeling studies that permit the generalization of the observed behavior to situations encountered in naturally occurring plasmas.  Experiments are to be performed in the Large Plasma Device (LAPD) at UCLA.  The experimental program focuses on narrow magnetic field-aligned structures in density, temperature, and current created by various techniques.  The unique environment available in the new LAPD device for the exploration of these topics will allow for a critical scrutiny of the models used to interpret data acquired by a new generation of spacecraft having increased spatial and temporal resolution.  The research will shed light on problems related to basic plasma physics.  Plasmas are ubiquitous in space and have many practical applications.  Understanding the behavior of natural and artificially created plasmas is essential to solving fundamental scientific problems as well as improving the performance of plasma-based systems on earth.</AbstractNarration>
