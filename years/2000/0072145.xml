<AbstractNarration>0072145&lt;br/&gt;Akylas&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A common mechanism by which internal gravity waves are generated in &lt;br/&gt;nature is flow over topography.  The goal of the proposed work is to &lt;br/&gt;improve our theoretical understanding of this generation mechanism with &lt;br/&gt;particular emphasis on three-dimensional nonlinear disturbances. To this &lt;br/&gt;end, an asymptotic theory will be developed to describe the generation of &lt;br/&gt;finite-amplitude disturbances by nearly uniformly stratified flow over &lt;br/&gt;three-dimensional topography that is more elongated in the spanwise than &lt;br/&gt;in the streamwise direction.  The proposed theory makes it possible to &lt;br/&gt;explore certain features of fully nonlinear waves --- for instance, how &lt;br/&gt;wave breaking is influenced by three-dimensional effects --- that, although &lt;br/&gt;of primary geophysical interest, so far have defied theoretical treatment. &lt;br/&gt;Moreover, the mathematical approach taken here is distinct from prior &lt;br/&gt;studies and promises to advance our understanding of nonlinear internal &lt;br/&gt;wave propagation from a mathematical standpoint as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Internal gravity waves are common features in oceans, lakes and in the &lt;br/&gt;atmosphere.  They owe their existence to the density stratification present &lt;br/&gt;in these natural fluid bodies due to variations in temperature and changes &lt;br/&gt;in the salinity (in the case of oceans) and pressure (in the case of the &lt;br/&gt;atmosphere).  Geophysical internal waves are known to possess enormous &lt;br/&gt;scales, on the order of kilometers to hundreds of kilometers, so it is not &lt;br/&gt;surprising that they are important factors in determining local weather &lt;br/&gt;patterns and climate dynamics.  The proposed work will provide a &lt;br/&gt;mathematical description of the generation of internal waves by flow over &lt;br/&gt;topography, modeling the action of wind over mountain ranges in the &lt;br/&gt;atmosphere or the flow of currents over a sill in the ocean bottom. &lt;br/&gt;Emphasis is placed on particular flow conditions under which internal-&lt;br/&gt;wave generation is most violent and is expected to play an important part &lt;br/&gt;in geophysical applications (e.g., the development of thunderstorms).&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
