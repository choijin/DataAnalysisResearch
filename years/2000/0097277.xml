<AbstractNarration>This project centers around the determination of masses of light ions to unprecedented precision using the mass spectrometer that has been developed over a number of years at the University of Washington.  Using only radio-frequency methods for observing the normal mode frequencies of a single isolated ion, bound to a Penning trap, it is possible to measure masses of low mass-to-charge-ratio ions relative to a multi-charged carbon ion with an overall accuracy that well exceeds one hundred parts per trillion with 24 hours of data and approaches ten parts per trillion in 8-10 days.   Projects for the award period include 1) development of a reliable apparatus that allows an ion of practically any element to be loaded from an external ion source into the spectrometer; 2) measurements of light-ion masses at the ultimate accuracy of the instrument; 3) improvements of the spectrometer to attempt to achieve an accuracy of ten parts per trillion in one day; and 4) refinement of the measurement of the tritium-helium-3 mass difference to an accuracy of 0.1 eV.</AbstractNarration>
