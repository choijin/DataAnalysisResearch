<AbstractNarration>This award provides renewed funding to support the Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program at SUNY Stony Brook. The program annually hosts eight upper division undergraduate students majoring in science or engineering to actively participate in eight weeks of research on estuarine processes. The students will conduct independent research under the guidance of a faculty mentor. Funding for this program will be supplemented by NY State Sea Grant and MSRC. The proposal is based on the theory that mentoring and networking are the most effective methods for recruiting students into a profession and for training young researchers. It is well designed to encourage highly motivated students to continue the their pursuit of research careers in oceanography. It encourages interdisciplinary research by organizing the students' research topics around a central theme. Students conduct independent research and produce oral and written reports at the end of the internship. The program will also encourage a diverse set of students to continue their education in the field of oceanography. In the past the program has had more than 50% female participants, has drawn students from across the nation, and has attracted an ethnically diverse group of students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
