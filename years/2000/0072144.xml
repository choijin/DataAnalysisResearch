<AbstractNarration>This individual investigator award is to a professor at an undergraduate institution, Oakland University.  The project is directed toward fabrication and analysis of multilayer magnetoelectric (ME) composites that are potential candidates for use as smart sensors, actuators, information storage media and high frequency signal processing devices. In composites consisting of magnetostrictive and piezoelectric phases, it is possible to accomplish magnetic field-to-electric field conversion with a two step process: magnetostriction (MS) induced mechanical deformation and piezoelectric (PE) effect induced electric fields.  The work is motivated by theoretical predictions of a very large ME coefficient in multilayer composites of MS and PE phases, in part due to enhanced piezoelectric effects. Efforts will focus on composites consisting of alternate layers of the perovskite oxides: (i) ferromagnetic lanthanum manganites that are magnetostrictive and (ii) ferroelectric lead zirconate titanates that are piezoelectric. Thick film composites will be synthesized by doctor blade techniques and characterized in terms of their electrical, magnetic and ME properties.  The proposed studies will to lead to an understanding of ME effects in multilayers.  Undergraduate students in this project will acquire (i) knowledge in the theory of materials and (ii) training in preparation and characterization of magnetic and dielectric materials and will be well prepared for entry to graduate education or a career in industry.  &lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;This individual investigator award is to a professor at an undergraduate institution, Oakland University.  It will support research into the preparation and characterization of a new class of materials that will facilitate the conversion of an electric field into a magnetic field or vice versa. Magnetoelectric (ME) composites consisting of alternate layers of lanthanum manganites that deform in a magnetic field and lead zirconate titanates that generate electricity when deformed will be studied. Thick film composites will be made and characterized in terms of their structural, magnetic, electrical and ME properties.   The proposed studies are likely to lead to materials for smart sensors, signal processing, and memory devices. Undergraduate student participants will receive hands-on experience in the synthesis and characterization of materials of fundamental and technological importance, the skills that will allow them to be successful in graduate education or for employment in research and development positions in industry. &lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
