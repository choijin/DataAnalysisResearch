<AbstractNarration>Engineering - Materials Science (57)  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Five Packaging Science undergraduate laboratory courses that include segments concerned with packaging materials are being modified with the following objectives: to incorporate more science-based learning; to significantly increase the understanding and hands-on experience of undergraduate students with state-of-the-art materials science characterization and investigative techniques as applied to Packaging Science; to maximize collaborative, discovery-based learning; and to ensure that our sophomore, junior and senior level laboratory experiences are appropriately integrated and pyramided. The project is adapting collaborative learning strategies from Millis at the US Air Force Academy and Cottrell at Miami University; Johnson and Johnson at University of Minnesota; and Felder at North Carolina State University, among others. The project objectives are enabled by the acquisition of state-of-the-art materials characterization instrumentation, especially thermal analysis, to augment the existing, extensive gas permeation equipment and new physical testing capabilities. The techniques and interpretative skills of using this instrumentation to understand the inter-relationships of processing, structure and properties of the wide variety of materials used for packaging are well-known. Until now, their integration into the undergraduate Packaging Science curriculum has been rudimentary. With the collaboration of the Clemson Office of Teaching Effectiveness and Innovation, the new laboratory exercises and revised courses are being designed to move from individual, problem-based learning to collaborative, discovery-based learning. The Clemson Web-based Collaborative Learning Environment is being used to promote learning communities within and across classes. Surveys of students and alumni are providing feedback on the effectiveness and usefulness of the changes. The findings and results are being disseminated to other Packaging Science programs, to other interested educators within and outside of the University, and to the packaging industry. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
