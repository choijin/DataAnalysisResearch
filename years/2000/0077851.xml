    <AbstractNarration>Hagedorn&lt;br/&gt;0077851&lt;br/&gt; The investigator seeks advances in the reconstruction of&lt;br/&gt;phylogenetic, or evolutionary, trees in biology by improving the&lt;br/&gt;utility of the method of phylogenetic invariants, one of several&lt;br/&gt;different methods of tree reconstruction. It would be extremely&lt;br/&gt;useful to have an accurate, computationally efficient method of&lt;br/&gt;phylogenetic analysis, but no such method is yet known. The&lt;br/&gt;method of phylogenetic invariants theoretically has these&lt;br/&gt;advantages. Modern phylogenetic methods analyze the mathematical&lt;br/&gt;and statistical similarities between the nucleotide sequences of&lt;br/&gt;different species. By modeling the evolution of the sequence for&lt;br/&gt;a proposed evolutionary tree T as a Markov model, one can obtain&lt;br/&gt;polynomials specifying the frequencies with which certain&lt;br/&gt;patterns should occur in observed sequence data. These&lt;br/&gt;polynomials parameterize a high-dimensional real algebraic&lt;br/&gt;variety X. Finding the equations that implicitly define X is&lt;br/&gt;theoretically equivalent to knowing how to determine whether T is&lt;br/&gt;the "true" evolutionary tree. These equations have been&lt;br/&gt;previously found for special evolutionary models such as the&lt;br/&gt;Kimura 3-parameter model. The investigator studies the&lt;br/&gt;invariants for the most general Markov model of nucleotide&lt;br/&gt;sequences and uses a combination of combinatorics and non-abelian&lt;br/&gt;Fourier analysis to find a complete set of invariants. He also&lt;br/&gt;explores ways to reduce the method's sensitivity to evolutionary&lt;br/&gt;noise and raising its accuracy. Advances on these issues are&lt;br/&gt;essential to make implementations of the invariant method&lt;br/&gt;practical for phylogenetic analysis.&lt;br/&gt; The investigator develops better methods to construct&lt;br/&gt;biological trees explaining the evolutionary relationships&lt;br/&gt;between species. Understanding evolutionary relationships is an&lt;br/&gt;important biological question, whose applications range from&lt;br/&gt;aiding the discovery of the origin of life to helping the medical&lt;br/&gt;community research possible vaccines and treatments for pathogens&lt;br/&gt;such as the H.I.V. virus. It would be extremely useful to have&lt;br/&gt;an accurate and computationally efficient method of phylogenetic&lt;br/&gt;(or evolutionary) analysis, but no method is currently known to&lt;br/&gt;possess both qualities. The project seeks to improve the&lt;br/&gt;accuracy of the tree reconstruction method using phylogenetic&lt;br/&gt;invariants. The method of invariants is a computationally&lt;br/&gt;efficient method, which is known to theoretically give correct&lt;br/&gt;answers. However, in practice, the method is very susceptible to&lt;br/&gt;the presence of noise in the data. The investigator aims to&lt;br/&gt;minimize this problem by eliminating several assumptions that&lt;br/&gt;currently must be met to use the method of invariants.</AbstractNarration>
