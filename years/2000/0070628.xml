<AbstractNarration>   William D. Banks&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This research will focus on two somewhat distinct areas of number theory.  First, the investigator will continue to study the Whittaker-Fourier coefficients of metaplectic forms, with a view to seeking new arithmetical and analytical applications in number theory, such as improved average value results for L-series attached to n-th order Hecke characters, and generalizations of the Bump-Hoffstein conjectures for L-functions on GL(n).  Second, the investigator and his colleagues will continue their joint research in number of areas of cryptography, including the development of efficient identification schemes, new techniques of encryption, and further results in the theory of pseudorandom functions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Automorphic forms (such as those associated to elliptic curves) play an important and central role in modern number theory, allowing the powerful tools of complex analysis to come to bear on arithmetical questions.  Metaplectic forms are a natural (though more mysterious) generalization of automorphic forms whose construction intimately depends on very deep results of class field theory (in particular, the higher order reciprocity laws).  While the study of metaplectic forms in still in its infancy, the results of this proposed research will prove to be very exciting.  The second part of this proposal focuses on cryptography, the rapidly developing field of mathematics/computer science that deals primarily with information security.  The investigator and his colleagues plan to continue their work on identification schemes for use with credit/smart cards, encryption algorithms, and questions related to the theory of pseudorandom functions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
