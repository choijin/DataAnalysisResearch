<AbstractNarration>DMS-0071494&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Meyer will  work on a variety of problems involving the $N$-body problem,&lt;br/&gt;Hamiltonian systems and dynamical systems. Building on his recent work with &lt;br/&gt;Dr. McCord on the integral manifolds of the spatial three body problem he will &lt;br/&gt;study the geometry and homology of the {\it regularized} (compactified)&lt;br/&gt;integral &lt;br/&gt;manifolds of the spatial three-body problem.  These are eight-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;algebraic&lt;br/&gt;sets which vary with the masses, energy and angular momentum of the particles. &lt;br/&gt;These computations should refute Birkhoff conjecture, yield information on the&lt;br/&gt;existence of cross &lt;br/&gt;sections, and answer the Birkhoff question on cross sections in the negative as&lt;br/&gt;they did  in the non-regularized problem. As another application of the rich&lt;br/&gt;topology found in the integral manifolds of the three-body problem, he will use&lt;br/&gt;variational arguments to establish new classes of periodic solutions. Dr. Meyer&lt;br/&gt;will also work on (i) simplifying the proof of the existence of Xia diffusion&lt;br/&gt;in the three-body problem; (ii) the existence of comet-like &lt;br/&gt;periodic orbits in the N-body problem; (iii)  establishing the stability of an&lt;br/&gt;equilibrium point of a Hamiltonian system in the case of 1:1 resonance; and&lt;br/&gt;(iv) the evolution and bifurcation of invariant manifolds of a Hamiltonian&lt;br/&gt;system which depend on a parameter. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Meyer will work on a number of problems in the qualitative theory of the&lt;br/&gt;equations &lt;br/&gt;which describe the motion of mechanical systems and celestial bodies, namely&lt;br/&gt;Hamiltonian systems.  One of the important equations of this type is the N-body&lt;br/&gt;problem which describes &lt;br/&gt;the motion of N masses -- the planets.  Systems of this type typically conserve&lt;br/&gt;energy and momentum and these conservation laws place global restrictions on&lt;br/&gt;the possible motion of the bodies.  Dr. Meyer has an ongoing research program&lt;br/&gt;studying the ramifications of these &lt;br/&gt;conserved quantities on the nature of the motion.  Dr. Meyer will also&lt;br/&gt;investigate the existence of regular and chaotic motions in these systems and&lt;br/&gt;how these types of motions depend of various physical parameters.  One type of&lt;br/&gt;regular motion he will establish is &lt;br/&gt;periodic motions in the N-body problem and one type of chaotic motion he will&lt;br/&gt;try to establish is known as Xia diffusion. Dr. Meyer will also study the&lt;br/&gt;evolution of the stable manifold of equilibrium solutions i.e. the evolution of&lt;br/&gt;the set of solutions which tend to &lt;br/&gt;an equilibrium (the stable manifold).  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
