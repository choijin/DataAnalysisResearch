    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0071372&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Xiaobo Liu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research program addresses problems in two areas. The&lt;br/&gt;Virasoro conjecture in symplectic geometry asserts that the&lt;br/&gt;generating function of the Gromov-Witten invariants for a compact&lt;br/&gt;symplectic manifold must be annihilated by a sequence of&lt;br/&gt;differential operators in the Virasoro algebra. The principal&lt;br/&gt;investigator will study whether the genus-one Virasoro conjecture&lt;br/&gt;and perhaps more general constraints hold for all projective&lt;br/&gt;varieties. It is even possible that the generating function of&lt;br/&gt;genus-one primary Gromov-Witten invariants can be computed&lt;br/&gt;explicitly from the genus-zero invariants, although this is more&lt;br/&gt;than the Virasoro conjecture implies. The second area to be&lt;br/&gt;addressed is submanifold geometry, especially the properties of&lt;br/&gt;isoparametric submanifolds, including infinite dimensional&lt;br/&gt;submanifolds. We know some good constructions of isoparametric&lt;br/&gt;submanifolds, but important aspects of the classification theory&lt;br/&gt;are in early stages of development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Geometric descriptions of classical or quantum mechanical systems&lt;br/&gt;are based in symplectic geometry, which takes as its basic&lt;br/&gt;measurement the area of two-dimensional surfaces. The&lt;br/&gt;Gromov-Witten invariants of a symplectic manifold can be&lt;br/&gt;described as a family of number that count the number of surfaces&lt;br/&gt;of a nice sort that satisfy certain constraints, such as&lt;br/&gt;intersecting specified subsets of the manifold. Enumerative&lt;br/&gt;invariants of this kind are an ancient concern in algebraic&lt;br/&gt;geometry, where we count the number of solutions to a system of&lt;br/&gt;equations, and the subject was recently found to be connected to&lt;br/&gt;high energy physical theory, where the partition functions of&lt;br/&gt;certain quantum systems on a manifold have been found to be&lt;br/&gt;related to generating functions that collect families of&lt;br/&gt;Gromov-Witten invariants into a manageable form. The Virasoro&lt;br/&gt;conjecture proposed by a group of physicists and mathematicians&lt;br/&gt;asserts that these generating functions satisfy a family of&lt;br/&gt;constraints that simplify computations and connect the&lt;br/&gt;Gromov-Witten invariants to the mathematics of completely&lt;br/&gt;different problems. A different kind of geometry arises in the&lt;br/&gt;study of submanifolds as curved objects, where we use several&lt;br/&gt;measurements of bending to capture the intuitive sense that a&lt;br/&gt;sphere in three-space is more curved if its radius is small than&lt;br/&gt;if its radius is large. An isoparametric submanifold is an&lt;br/&gt;imbedded object which has particularly simple curvature&lt;br/&gt;properties with respect to the larger space, and the character of&lt;br/&gt;this specialty is driven by the fact that this local condition&lt;br/&gt;frequently imposes strong symmetry properties the whole&lt;br/&gt;submanifold.</AbstractNarration>
