<AbstractNarration>One of the main problem in arithmetic geometry is the determination of the set &lt;br/&gt;of rational solutions of a system of polynomial equations with rational &lt;br/&gt;coefficients. One of the most successful technique in the study of such a set &lt;br/&gt;of solutions is to reduce the equations modulo a prime p and to study first the &lt;br/&gt;set of solutions of the latter system of equations. It turns out that in many &lt;br/&gt;situations, it is possible to describe a canonical way of reducing the &lt;br/&gt;equations modulo p. For instance, the canonical reduction of an abelian &lt;br/&gt;variety is called its Neron model, and is the object of study in Lorenzini's &lt;br/&gt;first research project. The canonical reduction of a curve is called its &lt;br/&gt;regular minimal model, and is the object of study in Lorenzini's second &lt;br/&gt;research project. For all but finitely many prime p, the canonical reduction &lt;br/&gt;is `good' and, as the name suggests, such a reduction type  can be better &lt;br/&gt;understood than the reduction at the finitely many remaining primes. Our &lt;br/&gt;present understanding of the information encoded in the canonical reductions &lt;br/&gt;that are not good (and not semistable) is far from complete. Some very &lt;br/&gt;difficult problems arise when studying reductions modulo small primes. One &lt;br/&gt;such difficulty can be stated as follows. A famous theorem due to Grothendieck &lt;br/&gt;and others states that there exists a finite field extension L/K such that &lt;br/&gt;the reduction of the initial equations viewed as equations over L is either &lt;br/&gt;good or semistable. In other words, it is possible to improve the reduction &lt;br/&gt;by extending the initial field. When p is large, the extension L/K is totally&lt;br/&gt;understood once its degree is known: it is the unique cyclic extension of that&lt;br/&gt;degree. When p is small and divides the degree of L/K, there are infinitely &lt;br/&gt;many extensions of that given degree, and almost nothing is known about the &lt;br/&gt;specific extension L/K needed to improve the reduction of the initial &lt;br/&gt;equations. Lorenzini's proposed research will shed more light on this &lt;br/&gt;and other special phenomena that arise when the reduction modulo a small &lt;br/&gt;prime p is not `good'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For centuries, human beings have been fascinated with solving diophantine &lt;br/&gt;equations, named after the Greek mathematician Diophantus who lived in &lt;br/&gt;the third century AD. The field of diophantine equations has taken on&lt;br/&gt;added significance in the modern world as it finds applications in a&lt;br/&gt;variety of areas including, for example, encryption. A diophantine equation &lt;br/&gt;is a mathematical expression in several variables, say x and y.  The central &lt;br/&gt;problem in the field is to find all possible solutions where x and y &lt;br/&gt;are both whole numbers or both fractions. For instance, the equation xy-10=0 &lt;br/&gt;has many solutions (e.g., x = y = square root of 10) but the solutions in &lt;br/&gt;whole positive numbers are in this case the divisors of 10, namely &lt;br/&gt;(x,y) = (1,10), (2,5), (5,2), and (10,1). While such an  equation is very &lt;br/&gt;simple, a slight modification, such as replacing 10 by a very large number &lt;br/&gt;(for instance, one having 150 digits) renders the new equation extremely hard &lt;br/&gt;to solve in practice. It is this fact, that it is so hard to solve such &lt;br/&gt;equations, that is the key to many of the safest current military codes and &lt;br/&gt;data encryption systems. The complexity of the determination of all solutions &lt;br/&gt;in whole numbers or fractions of an equation increases with the power at which&lt;br/&gt;the variables appear in the equation. For instance, the equation `x to the &lt;br/&gt;power n plus y to the power n equals 1' was conjectured in the 17th century &lt;br/&gt;to have only two solutions when n is any odd number greater than 1. &lt;br/&gt;(Those two solutions are (x,y)=(1,0) and (x,y)= (0,1). This  conjecture &lt;br/&gt;is called Fermat's Last Theorem and was proved only in 1994. Since the time &lt;br/&gt;of the Greeks, mathematicians have developed sophisticated tools to aid in &lt;br/&gt;solving equations. This investigator has developed some such mathematical &lt;br/&gt;tools and is currently working on further contributions to this field.</AbstractNarration>
