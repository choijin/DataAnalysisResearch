<AbstractNarration>A major reason cited for underrepresentation of low income students, especially women, minorities, and students with disabilities, in Montgomery County Community College's associate degree programs in computer science, engineering, and mathematics is financial.   To increase enrollment of academically talented but low income students in these fields, MCCC proposes a Computer Science, Engineering and Mathematics (CSEMS) Scholarship Program to assist interested students in meeting both college costs and daily living expenses and attaining academic success.&lt;br/&gt;Two Principal Investigators, the Deans of Academic Affairs and of Student Affairs, will oversee the scholarship administration.  Their selection committee comprised of faculty from relevant disciplines, financial aid and counseling will choose recipients based on their Pell eligibility as verified by Financial Aid, citizenship or qualified alien status, full time enrollment in associate degree in CSEMS programs, and 3.0 or higher college or high school grade point averages as verified by Admissions &amp; Records.  Applicants' descriptions of extra-curricular activities, employment, and reasons for choosing CSEMS programs will assist assessment of their motivation and potential.    &lt;br/&gt;Assigned counselors will monitor progress and use of academic and student services and submit reports at the end of each semester to PIs who will certify continuing eligibility.&lt;br/&gt;Expected outcomes: increased enrollments of low income, academically talented students in CSEMS fields; enhanced persistence and performance; successful degree completion and direct application of learned skills in employment or through transfer; and ensured program continuation, will be measured by graduation rates, overall grade point averages, and success in obtaining employment in their field or transferring to four year institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
