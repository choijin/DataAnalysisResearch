<AbstractNarration>00-73237 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Peet / Fridley  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DDIG: Relationships among species diversity, site fertility, resource heterogeneity, and ecosystem productivity in plant communities  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ecosystem productivity, the rate at which organisms produce biomass, is the basic currency for all of humanity's food, fiber, and fuel.   Recently, ecosystem productivity has been shown to be influenced by the number of species an ecosystem contains.  However, productivity is also influenced by environmental factors such as soil fertility, and the influence of species diversity on productivity within the context of a range of environmental conditions is unknown.  This issue is particularly important because in many ecosystems, both species diversity and the underlying environment are changing rapidly in response to human influence.  In this research, the investigators will conduct a set of field experiments to assess the relative influences of plant species diversity and soil fertility on ecosystem productivity.  In addition, the work includes experiments to manipulate environmental heterogeneity (specifically, the patchiness of soil resources) to examine whether the influence of species diversity on ecosystem productivity is enhanced by environmental complexity. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
