<AbstractNarration>EIA-0000516&lt;br/&gt;Wolfson, Ouri&lt;br/&gt;University of Illinois, Chicago&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CISE Postdoctoral Associates in Experimental Computer Science: Data&lt;br/&gt;Replication in Peer to Peer Broadcast Networks&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A mobile computing problem that has generated a significant amount of&lt;br/&gt;interest recently is data broadcasting.  The problem is how to organize the&lt;br/&gt;pages in a broadcast from a server to a large client population in the&lt;br/&gt;dissemination of information.  A strongly related problem is how to&lt;br/&gt;replicate (or cache) the broadcast data in the mobile units that receive&lt;br/&gt;the broadcast.  Our research involves the study of the problems of&lt;br/&gt;broadcast and replication in a peer-to-peer rather than client-server&lt;br/&gt;architectures.  These architectures are motivated by new types of emerging&lt;br/&gt;wireless broadcast networks where receiving nodes may be disconnected,&lt;br/&gt;turned off or out of power, and messages may be corrupted.  Further,&lt;br/&gt;reliable broadcasting by acknowledgment and retransmission may not be&lt;br/&gt;justified due to increases in communication costs.  The postdoctoral&lt;br/&gt;associate will explore fundamental principles of peer-to-peer broadcast&lt;br/&gt;replication: when to broadcast, what to broadcast, and the cost functions&lt;br/&gt;to measure the efficiency of a given replication approach.  Various&lt;br/&gt;broadcast replication algorithms will be compared analytically and&lt;br/&gt;experimentally and the associate will 1) design and analyze various&lt;br/&gt;broadcast replication algorithms, and 2) design and conduct experiments to&lt;br/&gt;compare these algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
