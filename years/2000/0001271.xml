    <AbstractNarration>Drivers of Technological Changes in the&lt;br/&gt;Twenty First Century&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of Miami will organize a workshop to examine the drivers of technological changes in the twenty-first century and the demands that these changes place on human resource development. The expected impact of the fast pace of technological change on industry's competitiveness will be examined. Industry's needs for highly educated and trained work force will require a shift in educational paradigms. Universities and academic institutions will have to respond with educational programs more in tune with the demands of the new century.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposed workshop is intended as a follow-up on a previously funded NSF project entitled "Management of Technology and the Paradigm shift in Education in Response to the Technology Revolution". The 1998 Project resulted in a report entitled "Management of Technology: Future Directions and Needs for the New Century. "The report and its findings will be presented to a large audience al the 9th International Conference Oil Management of Technology to be held in Miami Florida February 20-25. 2000. The conference is usually attended by 400 highly qualified researchers and practitioners of technology management from all over the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two main objectives of the current project/workshop are: 1) To present and solicit comments on the findings of the 1998 University of Miami/ NSF report from a large group of experts in the field and; 2) To hold a special workshop at the International conference on MOT to discuss the responses and to develop a plan of action that will facilitate implementation of the report's findings.</AbstractNarration>
