<AbstractNarration>The proposed research will focus on problems concerning  Banach  space &lt;br/&gt;theory  and its connections with operator algebras and operator theory. The main aim of  this research is the investigation of structures of non-commutative L^p-spaces and non-commutative Hardy spaces. The basic permanence question in this direction of research  is wether or a given property can be lifted from a given function space to its  non-commutative version. One of the questions that  will be considered is the classification of non-commutative spaces according to type  and cotype. Another significant question is whether or not reflexive subspaces of preduals of von Neumann  algebras have the fixed  point property. Basic Banach space structure of the newly defined script-L^p-spaces and several&lt;br/&gt;non-commutative generalizations of Hardy spaces are at the center of this &lt;br/&gt;investigation. Another direction of research  to be considered  is the study of  ideals  of  operators on C*-algebras.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal represents work of an interdisciplinary nature on &lt;br/&gt;mathematical analysis. Banach space theory, which is the main topic of this proposal,  studies  notions of distances on infinite dimensional vector spaces. It provides general  framework  for several fields of mathematics. The theory of function spaces played a  crucial  role in the development  of Banach space theory for several decades. The current  project studies a relatively new concepts of non-commutative analog of  function spaces  in which  functions are replaced by operators. These spaces includes  C*-algebras, preduals of von Neumann algebras among many others. C*-algebras turn out to be one of  the most&lt;br/&gt;important structures in mathematics. They have significant applications to &lt;br/&gt;other parts of sciences (for examples,  geometry, mathematical physics and quantum mechanics), so it is important to consider them from many different point of view. In  this case as Banach spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
