<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop a new means of caring for patina-covered copper and bronze outdoor statues, sculptures, and other structures, by developing Electrochemical Brush Patination (EBP).  If successful, this technique will allow conservators and others responsible for the care of patinized objects to repair small localized areas of damage to the patina layer without damaging the surrounding intact layer.  Stripping away large sections of patina, as is commonly done&lt;br/&gt;now when repairs to damaged areas are effected, followed by repatination through non-electrochemical means, can be time-consuming, expensive, and potentially damaging to the object to be restored.  The proposed technique will use controlled electrochemistry to grow a new patina layer only in the damaged area.  The new patina shall share the visual appearance (e.g., color, texture, thickness) of the original patina layer, and shall provide equivalent protection against corrosion of the substrate metal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed EBP technique will provide a new and improved means of repairing localized areas of damage to patina layers on copper and bronze. While the initial inspiration for this work was the desire to repair outdoor art objects, the commercial applications may extend to any patinized commercial or private structures, including but not limited to statuary, sculptures, building details, bridge details, etc.  Repair of damaged patina on such structures is important not only for visual appearance, but also for protection of&lt;br/&gt;the underlying substrate metal from ongoing corrosive attack.</AbstractNarration>
