    <AbstractNarration>Brooks, III Charles L.&lt;br/&gt;MCB-0091839&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Energy landscape theory was the springboard for development of the "new view'" of protein&lt;br/&gt;folding. This framework is responsible for our growing quantitative understanding of&lt;br/&gt;protein folding mechanism and detailed connections to experiments probing the folding&lt;br/&gt;process. Parallel development of landscape theory in the study of clusters and glasses has&lt;br/&gt;also significantly shaped understanding in this field. The interchange of ideas and&lt;br/&gt;concepts between these two distinct areas has added to the growth of each. However, more&lt;br/&gt;detailed exchanges and forums for discussion and presentation of underlying ideas and&lt;br/&gt;questions will aid continuing development of both areas. The goal of this symposium is to&lt;br/&gt;provide this forum for a discussion of common themes between folding and glasses and&lt;br/&gt;cluster phenomena, to promote the exchange of ideas between these communities, to survey&lt;br/&gt;the advances that have hallmarked each area, and to point to the challenges that remain in&lt;br/&gt;both.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The exciting new advances that have taken place in these areas of investigation would have&lt;br/&gt;been impossible without the integration of the new theoretical and experimental advances&lt;br/&gt;in computational chemistry and physical chemistry that have been successfully applied to&lt;br/&gt;molecular biology and biochemistry. In this symposium, we will integrate the different&lt;br/&gt;groups that have taken part in shaping the successes this interdisciplinary persuit aimed&lt;br/&gt;at a quantitative understanding of the folding problem. The ACS Spring Meeting in 2001 at&lt;br/&gt;San Diego will provide the appropriate forum for this event.</AbstractNarration>
