<AbstractNarration>Major Research Instrumentation support will enhance the development of a research program at The University of Texas PanAm (UTPA) by acquiring a Torque Rheometer, a Dynamic Mechanical Rheometer and an Electrical and Thermal conductivity tester. This research program will contribute to fundamental understanding of nanoreinforced polymer composites for engineering applications.  Project studies will focus on process-structure-property relationships for composites prepared by conventional plastic processing technologies.  Studies will investigate reinforcement handling, dispersion, and reinforcement-matrix interactions.  Effects of the nanoreinforcement on the morphological, mechanical, thermal, electrical, and rheological properties will be of significant importance for the development of multifunctional materials. Conventional manufacturing technologies such as extrusion, injection molding, and fiber drawing will be employed as well as advanced manufacturing technologies such as rapid prototyping.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;UTPA, long respected as a teaching institution serving underrepresented minorities, is promoting faculty research that will encourage undergraduates to pursue careers in science and engineering and train graduate students as leaders in regional industries.  Most of the polymer engineering projects will involve UTPA's undergraduates, 85 percent of whom are Hispanic and have had limited experience with technical research.  The acquisition of the requested instruments will also increase research opportunities for faculty from science and engineering departments at UTPA.  Finally, the instruments will foster collaborative research with small businesses as well as, training programs with the Rio Grande Valley's local manufacturing entities, an important segment of which is dedicated to the polymer industry.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
