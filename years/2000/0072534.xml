<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0072534&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Carolyn S. Gordon&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inverse spectral geometry is the study of the extent to which the&lt;br/&gt;geometry of a surface or, more generally, of a Riemannian&lt;br/&gt;manifold can be extracted from spectral data.  The primary&lt;br/&gt;spectral data associated to a compact Riemannian manifold are the&lt;br/&gt;eigenvalues of the Laplace-Beltrami operator.  The investigators&lt;br/&gt;propose to apply recently developed methods to study the extent&lt;br/&gt;to which the eigenvalue spectrum determines the local geometry of&lt;br/&gt;a compact Riemannian manifold.  They will also ask the extent to&lt;br/&gt;which additional spectral data such as the spectrum of the&lt;br/&gt;Laplacian acting on differential forms of various degrees&lt;br/&gt;determines the geometry of the manifold.  Inverse spectral&lt;br/&gt;problems will be considered on Riemannian orbifolds as well as on&lt;br/&gt;manifolds; orbifolds are the most tractable singular spaces.  For&lt;br/&gt;the Schrodinger operator "Laplacian plus potential", the problem&lt;br/&gt;of recovering the potential from spectral data will be studied in&lt;br/&gt;the case of line bundles over tori.  In analogy to the case of&lt;br/&gt;planar domains, the lowest eigenvalue of the Laplacian on a&lt;br/&gt;compact Riemannian manifold may be viewed as the fundamental&lt;br/&gt;tone.  The question of whether random Riemann surfaces have large&lt;br/&gt;first eigenvalue will be studied using connections between&lt;br/&gt;spectra of Riemann surfaces and spectra of graphs.  For&lt;br/&gt;noncompact Riemannian manifolds, the primary spectral data are&lt;br/&gt;the scattering poles; the investigators expect to exhibit&lt;br/&gt;continuous families of isopolar metrics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In spectroscopy, one attempts to recover the chemical composition&lt;br/&gt;or the shape of an object from the characteristic frequencies of&lt;br/&gt;light or sound emitted.  In the case of a vibrating membrane such&lt;br/&gt;as a drumhead, viewed mathematically as a bounded region in the&lt;br/&gt;plane, the spectrum of characteristic frequencies corresponds to&lt;br/&gt;the mathematical notion of the Laplace spectrum.  The Laplace&lt;br/&gt;spectrum is also defined for other geometric objects called&lt;br/&gt;manifolds which arise in mathematics and physics.  The&lt;br/&gt;investigators, along with Scott Wolpert, earlier constructed the&lt;br/&gt;first examples of differently shaped drumheads (planar regions)&lt;br/&gt;with the same spectrum.  Planar regions can differ in their&lt;br/&gt;global shape but locally are identical; i.e., if you look at a&lt;br/&gt;small piece cut out from one of the regions, you can not tell&lt;br/&gt;which region it came from.  Recently, the principal investigator&lt;br/&gt;developed methods for constructing geometric objects with the&lt;br/&gt;same Laplace spectrum but which differ in their local as well as&lt;br/&gt;global shape.  These methods will be used to investigate which&lt;br/&gt;local geometric properties of manifolds are not spectrally&lt;br/&gt;determined.  Additional spectral problems will also be considered&lt;br/&gt;such as the construction of surfaces of arbitrarily large volume&lt;br/&gt;but having bounded fundamental tone.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
