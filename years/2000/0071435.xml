<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Kaminker&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researcher will work on three projects.  Investigation will be&lt;br/&gt;continued on the connection between hyperbolic dynamical systems and&lt;br/&gt;K-theory of C*-algebras. In particular, the zeta function of a Smale&lt;br/&gt;space will be expressed in terms of the K-theory of the stable algebra&lt;br/&gt;and the induced homomorphisms.  This leads to a general program to use&lt;br/&gt;the K-theory of these C*-algebras as a replacement for ordinary&lt;br/&gt;homology groups which were used in the past to study hyperbolic&lt;br/&gt;systems. The second direction involves the study of the relation between the&lt;br/&gt;Exactness conjecture and the Novikov conjecture for finitely presented&lt;br/&gt;groups.  If a group acts amenably on a compact space then both of&lt;br/&gt;these conjectures hold.    The relation between the existence of such&lt;br/&gt;an action and approximation properties for the reduced C*-algebra will be&lt;br/&gt;studied and precise relations between the two conjectures will be established.&lt;br/&gt;In a third direction, work will be done on obtaining a higher index&lt;br/&gt;formula for regular Lie groupoids.  This will provide a formula for&lt;br/&gt;the pairing of certain cyclic cocycle on the smooth convolution algebra of&lt;br/&gt;the groupoid with the class in K-theory representing the analytic&lt;br/&gt;index of an elliptic operator.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These projects are part of a general program to see how symmetry, in&lt;br/&gt;its various forms, effects different parts of mathematics.  It is&lt;br/&gt;often the case that unexpected symmetry has important implications.&lt;br/&gt;Solutions to important equations in physics and engineering have&lt;br/&gt;been discovered and studied by using the fact that their form must&lt;br/&gt;be unchanged under certain transformations.  It is hoped that the&lt;br/&gt;results of the present project will have similar applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
