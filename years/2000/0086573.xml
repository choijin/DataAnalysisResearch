<AbstractNarration>Vestibular research has seen recent major advances with the advent of new tools,&lt;br/&gt;techniques and ideas.  These advances have been realized in studies of both the&lt;br/&gt;central and peripheral vestibular systems and in studies performed in both&lt;br/&gt;terrestrial and micro-gravity.  Advances have been made in the understanding of&lt;br/&gt;the contributions of biomechanics, including intralabyrinthine pressure and the&lt;br/&gt;stiffness and elastic restoring forces of the stereocilia and cupula to the&lt;br/&gt;formation of the response dynamics of the semicircular canal nerves&lt;br/&gt; The conference should be of interest to broad areas of neuroscience,&lt;br/&gt;including developmental biology, physiology and pharmacology, space biology,&lt;br/&gt;bioengineering, and the medical fields of neurology, otolaryngology, and&lt;br/&gt;neurosurgery. The conference will be held in the Eric P. Newman Center for Continuing&lt;br/&gt;Education of the Washington University School of Medicine from Thursday November&lt;br/&gt;16 through Saturday November 18, 2000 under the direction of Drs. Stephen M.&lt;br/&gt;Highstein, Chair and Joel Goebel, Co-Chair.  Speakers have been chosen by Drs.&lt;br/&gt;Highstein and Goebel with the advice of the advisory panel and others prominent&lt;br/&gt;in vestibular research.  While many of the speakers have national and&lt;br/&gt;international reputations as leaders of their fields, an emphasis has been&lt;br/&gt;placed on the contributions of younger workers wherever possible.  Women are&lt;br/&gt;also represented to the maximum extent possible.  We are interested in bringing&lt;br/&gt;existing controversies to light, and adequate time will be provided for&lt;br/&gt;discussion and resolution of differing viewpoints.  An effort has been made to&lt;br/&gt;provide an outlet for research that is new and on the cutting edge in a poster&lt;br/&gt;session.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
