<AbstractNarration>The interaction between the solar wind and Earth's magnetosphere is often manifested by transient variations in magnetic field, plasma and energetic particle parameters.  Such transient events are commonly observed by spacecraft in the vicinity of the dayside magnetopause.  The proposed study is an investigation of the distribution patterns and the scale sizes of these events using spacecraft at geosynchronous orbit.  The results will provide a connecting path from the solar wind through the magnetosphere to Earth's ionosphere as well as information on the decay and evolution of these events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has two primary objectives.  The first objective is to obtain a better understanding of the relationship between transient magnetic signatures in the dayside magnetosphere and in the ionosphere.  The second objective is an investigation of magnetospheric transient events using simultaneous observations by two GOES spacecraft and the AMPTE CCE during late 1984.  Since this project is complementary to earlier work on the motion and distribution of transient events, the overall result will be a comprehensive survey of the properties of magnetospheric transient events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As with previous projects performed by the principal investigator, this study will involve the active participation of undergraduate students.  A strong emphasis will be placed on learning and independent thinking.  The importance of research in the educational process will be stressed.</AbstractNarration>
