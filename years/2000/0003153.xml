<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;The Northern California Rural Systemic Initiative (NCRSI) is a systemic change&lt;br/&gt;effort undertaken by a consortium of universities, school districts, parents, students,&lt;br/&gt;nonprofit organizations, government agencies and businesses that addresses the&lt;br/&gt;barriers to adequate science, mathematics and technology education in rural Northern&lt;br/&gt;California. Grounded in the belief that effective uses of new technologies to enhance&lt;br/&gt;student learning require new pedagogical skills and curricular content, the consortium&lt;br/&gt;seeks to transform mathematics and science education by introducing comprehensive&lt;br/&gt;changes in pedagogy including instruction and curriculum. NCRSI consists of the&lt;br/&gt;following three core elements:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. An in-depth self-study of Modoc and Siskiyou counties including the collection of&lt;br/&gt;base-line data on mathematics, science and technology instruction;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. An innovative preservice and inservice teacher and administrator preparation&lt;br/&gt;model, Guiding Partners, which incorporates mathematics, science, technology&lt;br/&gt;Training and development of constructivist based pedagogy skills centered&lt;br/&gt;Around a concept of project facilitation - the pedagogy will be modeled by&lt;br/&gt;Consortium staff developers and university faculty as they teach it to classroom&lt;br/&gt;Teachers who will practice it with students in K-12 fieldwork;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. Development of a five year implementation plan based upon the in-depth study of&lt;br/&gt;Mathematics, science and technology instruction - the plan will include specific,&lt;br/&gt;Measurable outcomes, timelines, and designate responsibilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
