<AbstractNarration>Lawrence Berkeley National laboratory (LBNL) will host a workshop to promote the formation of research partnerships between faculty at colleges and university in designated EPSCoR states and the scientific staff from DOE national laboratories and facilities.  The date will be August 16-17, 2000 in the San Francisco Bay Area, near LBNL.  Attendance will include up to 200 researchers from the 20 EPSCoR jurisdictions and the Department of Energy (DOE) National Laboratories.&lt;br/&gt;The primary objective of the meeting is to provide a forum for research scientists from the EPSCoR states to:  1) report advances in EPSCoR funded research activities; 2) update their knowledge of DOE programs and initiatives; 3) learn about LBNL National User Facilities and research directions; 4) explore opportunities for research with DOE scientists; 5) develop plans for future research projects; and 6) learn about DOE laboratory opportunities for training and hands-on research experience for undergraduate, graduate, postdoctoral fellows and new faculty.&lt;br/&gt;The workshop  will be sponsored by the DOE, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences EPSCoR program and co-sponsored by the National Science Foundation (NSF) EPSCoR Office.&lt;br/&gt;Project leaders and participants in both DOE and NSF EPSCoR are invited to attend and provide technical poster presentations.  Workshop participants are requested to submit an abstract of their research activities and/or updates on their particular program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
