    <AbstractNarration>Physiological demands imposed by the environment are, of course,&lt;br/&gt;fundamentally different for marine fish and birds. The cellular and&lt;br/&gt;molecular processes that control inorganic phosphate and sulfate, however,&lt;br/&gt;appear similar, though they may be used differently. It is by comparing&lt;br/&gt;and contrasting these systems that we gain insight into the general&lt;br/&gt;principles of ion regulation. The long-term goals of this project are to&lt;br/&gt;better understand the comparative physiology of the mechanisms and&lt;br/&gt;regulation of renal transport of inorganic phosphate and sulfate. These&lt;br/&gt;anions can alter calcium balance, acid-base balance, urinary buffer&lt;br/&gt;capacity, extracellular matrix of bone and cartilage, etc., and their&lt;br/&gt;levels are tightly controlled in all vertebrates. Dietary in-take,&lt;br/&gt;intestinal absorption and renal excretion are the sole determinants, aside&lt;br/&gt;from growth, of body phosphate and sulfate balance. Excretion of these&lt;br/&gt;anions is a result of renal filtration, reabsorption and secretion. The&lt;br/&gt;kidney is the most important site of regulation of excretion of these&lt;br/&gt;anions in the body. We here propose likely mecha-nisms regulating&lt;br/&gt;phosphate and sulfate transport in members of two verte-brate classes&lt;br/&gt;(winter flounder and chicken). Methods are used which permit&lt;br/&gt;characterization of anion transport at several levels of organization&lt;br/&gt;(proximal tubule primary cultures, isolated proximal tubule brush-border&lt;br/&gt;and basolateral membrane vesicles, and renal clearance). We also have a&lt;br/&gt;reasonable understanding of the basic intracellular signaling systems that&lt;br/&gt;activate and inactivate membrane mechanisms for reabsorption or secretion&lt;br/&gt;of these anions in both species. Regulation of transport by proximal&lt;br/&gt;tubule involves the interaction of several hormones, acid-base status, and&lt;br/&gt;phosphate and sulfate availability. We will examine a variety of hormones&lt;br/&gt;that may control kidney handling of phosphate. In addition, our recent&lt;br/&gt;studies indicate an important role for carbonic anhydrase in renal sulfate&lt;br/&gt;secretion by marine fishes. The enzyme's role probably stems from the&lt;br/&gt;membrane anion exchangers responsible for sulfate secretion. Because this&lt;br/&gt;transepithelial transport process is profoundly influenced by steroid&lt;br/&gt;hormones in both flounder and chicken, we have here proposed to examine a&lt;br/&gt;possible regulatory effect of steroids (including vitamin D3) on carbonic&lt;br/&gt;anhydrase activity and renal sulfate transport in both fish and chicks.</AbstractNarration>
