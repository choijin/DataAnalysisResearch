    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop new automatic methods for designing, configuring, and reconfiguring communications networks. New communications technologies, like Wave Division Multiplexing, or fully mobile wireless networks and new communications services with Quality of Service requirements all require fast, reliable methods for reconfiguring network topologies, defining fixed and mobile equipment locations, selecting from available media, and providing and configuring required interface equipment. The resulting networks must be able to recover from temporary traffic congestion, equipment outages, or interference. This project uses innovative Genetic Algorithm (GA) techniques to solve these problems and provide end users with reliable cost-effective methods for network design, management, and reconfiguration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The GA based decision aid will shorten planning cycles and increase reliability in designing, managing, expanding, and adding new services on current multi-site commercial and military networks. It will also provide reliable, effective support for configuring military, commercial, or disaster relief wireless networks using mobile switching equipment. It will also shorten the time and expense required for Internet Service Providers to upgrade their networks for new users and services. The methods will also apply to fault diagnosis, network expansion, vulnerability analysis, and performance tuning in existing networks and extend the capabilities of current network management tools. These application areas represent growing multi-billion dollar markets.</AbstractNarration>
