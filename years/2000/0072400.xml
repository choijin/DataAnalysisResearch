<AbstractNarration>This project covers a variety of methodological developments and foundational research.&lt;br/&gt;In particular, the object of this research is to develop some new nonparametric model building&lt;br/&gt;and identication procedures for high-dimensional nonlinear time series data. The investiga-&lt;br/&gt;tor studies both the varying-coefficient regression models and nonlinear additive regression&lt;br/&gt;models for nonlinear time series data and makes the models practically applicable. The first&lt;br/&gt;objectiveis to develop nonparametric estimation procedures for nonlinear time series. In&lt;br/&gt;particular, for varying-coefficient regression models, local polynomial regression techniques&lt;br/&gt;are used to estimate the coefficient functions and the asymptotic properties of the resulting&lt;br/&gt;estimators are studied. This procedure differs from the classical local linear regression for&lt;br/&gt;curve fitting where the response surface is of interest. Here, of interest is to estimate the&lt;br/&gt;coefficient functions. For nonlinear additive regression models, the investigator uses partial&lt;br/&gt;residual method to estimate unknown additive functions coupled with projection method&lt;br/&gt;and local polynomial fitting. The approach is divided into two steps. In the first step, the&lt;br/&gt;initial estimated values for all components are obtained by using the projection method. In&lt;br/&gt;the second step, a local polynomial technique is employed to estimate any one of compo-&lt;br/&gt;nents by using the initial estimated values of the rest of components. The second objective of&lt;br/&gt;this research is concerned with the model identification. For both models, a new goodness-&lt;br/&gt;of-fit test technique is proposed, based on the comparison of the residual sum of squares&lt;br/&gt;under the null and alternative models, to detect whether certain coefficient functions in the&lt;br/&gt;varying-coefficient models are constant or whether certain components in the additive mod-&lt;br/&gt;els are linear or whether any covariates are significant in the models. The null distribution&lt;br/&gt;of the test is estimated by a nonparametric bootstrap method. Also, the investigator studies&lt;br/&gt;the practical implementation of the methods, particularly the automatic bandwidth selection&lt;br/&gt;method based on a modified generalized cross-validation. A nonparametric version of Akaike&lt;br/&gt;information criterion is proposed for choosing the smoothing variable in varying-coefficient&lt;br/&gt;models and determining an appropriate model for given data.&lt;br/&gt;This research is concerned with model estimation and identification procedures in non-&lt;br/&gt;linear time series analysis. A time series is a set of data observed over a period of time. For&lt;br/&gt;example, daily ozone and pollutant levels from environmental study, quarterly earnings for&lt;br/&gt;a company or daily currency exchange rate from economical study, wild animals' popula-&lt;br/&gt;tion observed over years from ecological study, number of in uenza cases observed over time&lt;br/&gt;from epidemiology, and noisy telecommunication signals. The investigator has been active&lt;br/&gt;in this research area. Furthermore, the investigator has conducted preliminary work on the&lt;br/&gt;described problem area which has led to encouraging results. There are sufficient reasons&lt;br/&gt;to believe that by pursuing the topics outlined in this proposal, the results of this research&lt;br/&gt;should have significant contributions in nonlinear time series analysis, which has many impor-&lt;br/&gt;tant applications in the fields of economics, social science, medicine, epidemiology, biology,&lt;br/&gt;environment, physical sciences, engineering, and many others.</AbstractNarration>
