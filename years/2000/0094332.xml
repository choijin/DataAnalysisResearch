<AbstractNarration>This CAREER project addresses the molecular level structure of water at the liquid solid interface in the presence of adsorbed protein molecules.  Professor Paul Cremer and his coworkers at Texas A&amp;M, with the support of the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, will examine the interactions of water, protein molecules, and solid silica surfaces.  An understanding of these types of systems is important to a variety of applications, including biocompatibility, biofouling in the food and pharmaceutical industries, and in the development of biosensors and catalysts.  Infrared-visible sum frequency generation methods will be used to probe the structure of substrate associated water in the presence of adsorbed protein.  Time resolved studies will be implemented to follow structural changes upon adsorption of protein molecules at the solid surface.  Educational aspects of this project include the development of a bio-physical chemistry course for upper level undergraduates, and the implementation of undergraduate research projects in the field of protein surface interactions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The interaction of protein molecules with surfaces is important in the development of biosensors, in enhancing biocompatibility for medical implants, and for understanding the process of biofouling in food and pharmaceutical process machinery.  The structure of adsorbed water in these systems provides the detailed information that can be used to design surfaces with desired protein adsorption properties.  This CAREER project uses state of the art surface spectroscopic methods to probe this structural question.  Integration of this basic research with educational goals in the training of bio-physical scientists and in the development of course materials in this area is the focus of the educational aspect of this project.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
