<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;The NSF Major Research Instrumentation grant funds a versatile imaging system based on new developments in the state of the art technology.  The research instrumentation comprises (a) an extremely versatile, high resolution, image intensified framing/streak CCD camera, (b) an all-solid state coherent, collimated and monochromatic laser light source to be operated in conjunction with the high-speed camera, and (c) a wide bandwidth, high sampling rate digital oscilloscope for use in various laser interferometry based optical techniques. The system represents a fundamental upgrade of the laser based diagnostic capabilities of several major laboratories in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering and would support other research and development in the Case School of Engineering.&lt;br/&gt; The advanced capabilities of the new ultra-fast imaging system will be utilized by the PI, two Co-PI's and several other contributing faculty members of the Case School of Engineering for conducting fundamental experimental investigations in areas of importance to experimental techniques. The proposed equipment is expected to significantly encourage intra- and inter- university collaborations. At Case Western Reserve University the acquisition of the high speed imaging system will bring together talents and facilities in the Macromolecular Science, Materials Science and Engineering, Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, and Civil and Environmental Engineering.  These collaborative, multidisciplinary research efforts will explore fully the phenomena of high-speed friction between dissimilar materials, design and development of novel damage-tolerant light-weight multifunctional material systems, fundamentals of combustion and explosion science, reliability of MEMS devices, damage evolution and failure in bio-skeletal tissues of importance to trauma-biomechanics and orthopaedics, fundamentals of deformation processing with applications to high rate manufacturing, to name a few.&lt;br/&gt;Besides being useful on research and development, the new high-speed digital imaging system will provide an opportunity for laboratory experience and training for graduate and post-graduate students in the state-of-the-art of modern instrumentation.  In addition to the basic scientific content within the proposed project areas, this training reaches into areas of applied technology that are bridged by elements within the proposed research that look for active opportunities in the development of instrumentation and novel experimental methods for advanced laser diagnostics of short duration events.  One outcome of this would be the development of engineers who can integrate experimental and analytical techniques to attack technologically important areas. The Case School of Engineering at CWRU is strongly encouraging the involvement of undergraduate students in faculty research projects and this would occur for the proposed work as well.  Every effort will be made to encourage and involve undergraduate and graduate students especially from groups presently under-represented in the engineering discipline.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
