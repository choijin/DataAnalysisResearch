<AbstractNarration>INT-0003028&lt;br/&gt;Richardson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a scientific workshop and conference to be held for five days beginning July 3, 2000, at Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznan, Poland, on recent advances in the broad area of Orbital and Celestial Mechanics.  The Principal Investigator for this workshop is Dr. David Richardson of the University of Cincinnati.   The workshop hopes to sow seeds for future collaborative research between newly graduated scientists in the U.S. and in Central and Eastern Europe.  The workshop will address broad, diverse aspects of theoretical and applied Orbital and Celestial Mechanics to establish the current status and prospects for future research.  The workshop will bring together practical and proven numerical and analytical procedures with the more promising theoretical and academic research now underway worldwide.  The workshop will support participants from the U.S., Central and Eastern Europe and the Newly Independent States (NIS).  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award fulfills the program objectives of bringing together leading experts in Orbital and Celestial Mechanics in the U.S., Central and Eastern Europe and NIS to combine complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest and competence on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
