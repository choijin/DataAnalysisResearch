<AbstractNarration>     Optical communication networks employing wavelength division multiplexing can support several&lt;br/&gt;communication sessions using a limited number of wavelength channels. The employment ofwave-&lt;br/&gt;length reuse in different parts of the network contributes to the increase in the number of sessions&lt;br/&gt;that can be supported. As such, these networks can provide a means to serve those applica-&lt;br/&gt;tions which individually or collectively require large amounts of bandwidth. An important class&lt;br/&gt;of services with such property is the class of multicast, or multipoint traffic, which requires the&lt;br/&gt;delivery of data from the source to a group of destinations. Although a few studies have addressed&lt;br/&gt;packet-switched multicast services in broadcast-and-select optical networks, the topics of routing,&lt;br/&gt;wavelength assignment, dimensioning, and performance of circuit-switched multicast services in&lt;br/&gt;wavelength routing optical networks have received little attention.&lt;br/&gt;     This project deals with multicast services in optical networks, with and without wavelength&lt;br/&gt;converters. Such applications can be served using wavelength routing networks. The project has&lt;br/&gt;several objectives. First, we would like to develop multicast tree construction algorithms for optical&lt;br/&gt;networks which take into account the optical network constraints into account, such as thepower&lt;br/&gt;budget, wavelength collisions and wavelength continuity, aswell as the cost and type of splitters and&lt;br/&gt;wavelength converters. Optimal network provisioning and dimensioning under multicast service,&lt;br/&gt;given the traffic demands and cost constraints, is another objective. We also plan to investigate the&lt;br/&gt;possibility of formulating a joint problem for the optimal provisioning, and the optimal wavelength&lt;br/&gt;converter and splitter placement. It is also planned that routing, and wavelength selection algo-&lt;br/&gt;rithms will be developed for multicast services in optical networks. It is also planned to study the&lt;br/&gt;effect of these algorithms on the dimensioning and performance of the network. All this requires&lt;br/&gt;construction of accurate analytical models for the evaluation of call blocking probabilities under&lt;br/&gt;different routing and wavelength selection algorithms. As the efficient support of multicast traffic&lt;br/&gt;requires the branching of the traffic at several points in the network, these models are expected to&lt;br/&gt;be very involved, especially that several standard independence assumptions cannot be used in this&lt;br/&gt;case. In addition to general performance models, bounds on performance will be established, which&lt;br/&gt;will provide a guide to the provisioning and dimensioning of networks for multicast service. Such&lt;br/&gt;bounds will be established through the identification of extreme network topologies which serve to&lt;br/&gt;provide these bounds.&lt;br/&gt;     The results of this work are expected to advance the understanding of the behavior of optical&lt;br/&gt;networks under futuristic, yet more involved, traffic conditions. At the same time, these results&lt;br/&gt;will contribute to the design and dimensioning of such networks.</AbstractNarration>
