    <AbstractNarration>ATM-0071836&lt;br/&gt;Mendillo, Michael&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A renewal of a 3-year grant to operate the CEDAR Optical Tomographic Imaging Facility (COTIF) and for the scientific analysis of the results obtained is proposed in which COTIF capabilities will be applied to several aspects of sub-auroral physics related to sources of stable red auroral (SAR) arcs. Now that solar maximum is approaching, the re-appearance of SAR arcs in late 1998 offers the first ever opportunity to study the latitude-altitude dependence of volume emission rates for SAR arcs, the only possible way to access the height-dependent excitation physics. Issues of thermal excitation, high speed convection excitation, and augmentation of emission by proton precipitation can now be addressed. To conduct the latter study, the PI proposes to field a CEDAR funded high-throughput-imaging-Eschell-spectrograph (HITIES). Modeling expertise for SAR arc mechanisms is in place, and a leading expert on proton modeling will join the group as part of another program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New to this effort is the application of imaging science capabilities from COTIF and HITIES to the study of mesospheric gravity waves. A CEDAR Post-doctoral award to Dr. Steven Smith will allow for the study of wave sources and dissipation mechanisms from these datasets. With new FPI and LIDAR instruments being installed at Millstone Hill for the CEDAR-TIMED collaboration, a truly robust set of optical diagnostics will finally be in place for the first comprehensive study of wave activity at a sub-auroral site. &lt;br/&gt;ATM-0071836&lt;br/&gt;Mendillo, Michael&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A renewal of a 3-year grant to operate the CEDAR Optical Tomographic Imaging Facility (COTIF) and for the scientific analysis of the results obtained is proposed in which COTIF capabilities will be applied to several aspects of sub-auroral physics related to sources of stable red auroral (SAR) arcs.
