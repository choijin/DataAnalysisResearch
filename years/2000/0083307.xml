<AbstractNarration>The Materials Research Society symposium on   Non-Lithographic &amp; Lithographic Methods  for Nanofabrication: from ULSI to Photonics to Molecular Electronics will address the materials science, chemistry, physics, and biology of micro- and nanoscale structures including potential applications areas. In addition to the materials science and physics of these nanoscale systems, the symposium will  include a discussion of techniques such as self-assembly and lithographic methods as fabrication tools for building structures with micron and nanometer feature sizes,  and novel and emerging devices that rely on structures with submicron dimensions. &lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;Nanostructured materials often display chemical and physical properties distinctly different from their corresponding bulk materials. Nanotechnology areas such as electronic, photonic and catalytic materials nanostructures exhibiting  novel properties for various applications are currently viewed as high priorities within industry. Preference for NSF  support to participate in this symposium will be given to students,  postdocs, and faculty who are early in their careers who may otherwise find it difficult to to travel to this conference.       &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
