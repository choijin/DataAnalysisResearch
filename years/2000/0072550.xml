    <AbstractNarration>DMS-0072550&lt;br/&gt;Marcus Banagl&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Complexes of sheaves which are self-dual in the sense of &lt;br/&gt;Verdier have become indispensable tools in studying the &lt;br/&gt;topology of singular spaces, a prime example being the Goresky-MacPherson-Deligne intersection chain sheaf on a &lt;br/&gt;stratified space with only even-codimensional strata. On &lt;br/&gt;spaces that include strata of odd codimension as well, &lt;br/&gt;self-duality of the latter sheaf fails to hold in general. &lt;br/&gt;In recent research, we have shown that "Lagrangian structures" &lt;br/&gt;can be employed to construct self-dual intersection homology &lt;br/&gt;on such spaces. We propose to study the variance of the &lt;br/&gt;associated characteristic classes as the Lagrangian structure&lt;br/&gt;changes. In many situations, the effective manipulation of &lt;br/&gt;self-dual sheaves places heavy demands on the stratification &lt;br/&gt;of the underlying space. We propose to investigate the potential existence of a good "sheaf package" on weakly stratified &lt;br/&gt;spaces (the homotopically stratified sets of Quinn), using the technology of teardrop neighborhoods and manifold stratified approximate fibrations. Further, in collaboration with Sylvain &lt;br/&gt;Cappell, we are interested in developing characteristic class&lt;br/&gt;formulae for the signature of singular spaces in the presence of&lt;br/&gt;non-trivial monodromy, via a synthesis of Atiyah's formula for manifolds and the Cappell-Shaneson signature formula.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Topology is the study of geometrical objects focusing on the neighborhood relations between points rather than on measurement &lt;br/&gt;of distances. In the last century, considerable effort has been directed towards studying "manifolds" -- spaces that locally look uniform, at each point and in each direction. This effort has &lt;br/&gt;been immensely successful; a central insight was that crucial information about a manifold is carried by one number: its &lt;br/&gt;"signature," measuring intersections of geometric sub-objects &lt;br/&gt;within the manifold. In the last two decades, topologists have &lt;br/&gt;studied "singular" spaces with increasing interest, due to their numerous occurrences and applications within pure mathematics (algebraic geometry, number theory) and outside pure mathematics (mathematical physics). In contrast to a manifold, a singular &lt;br/&gt;space may locally look different from point to point. The proposed research tries to define, understand, and compute topological &lt;br/&gt;invariants for singular spaces.</AbstractNarration>
