<AbstractNarration>0003701&lt;br/&gt;Bassalleck&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a three-year collaborative research project between Professor Bernd Bassalleck of the University of New Mexico and Professor Tomokazu Fukuda of the High Energy Accelerator Research Organization (KEK) in Japan.  The researchers will undertake a study of hyperon-hyperon and hyperon-nucleon interaction.  This is the most fundamental baryon-baryon interaction involving one and two strange quarks, respectively.  The primary focus of the proposal is the approved KEK experiment E452.  Its goal is the study of the spin-dependent interaction between the E+ hyperon and the proton, in particular the E+ spin-orbit interaction, which is predicted to be large.  What makes this particularly interesting is the sharp contrast to the now firmly established smallness of the A spin-orbit interaction.  The actual measurement to be performed is the left-right asymmetry in the elastic scattering of polarized E+ off protons using a novel scintillation detector with Image Intensifier and CCD readout for complete 3-dimensional track reconstruction.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project brings together the efforts of two laboratories that have complementary expertise and research capabilities.  Results of this research should provide a significant enhancement of our understanding of the fundamental baryon-baryon interaction utilizing the strange quark as a special probe not normally available in conventional nuclear physics.   Through the exchange of ideas and technology, this project will broaden our base of  basic knowledge and promote international understanding and cooperation.  The researchers plan to publish results of their research in scientific journals and report on the findings at scientific meetings.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
