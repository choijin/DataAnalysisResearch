<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0071358&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Steve Zelditch&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We propose to apply quantum dynamical notions to problems in&lt;br/&gt;geometry, inverse spectral theory and mathematical physics.&lt;br/&gt;First is the well-known problem, `Can you hear the shape of an&lt;br/&gt;analytic drum?' We have constructed a `quantum Birkhoff normal&lt;br/&gt;form' of the Laplacian around a bouncing ball orbit and have&lt;br/&gt;proved that it is a spectral invariant. We will investigate the&lt;br/&gt;extent to which a bounded simply connected analytic plane domain&lt;br/&gt;is determined by its normal forms at one or more bouncing ball&lt;br/&gt;orbits. We will also investigate a new connection between the&lt;br/&gt;spectrum and X-ray tomography of the domain.  The second group of&lt;br/&gt;problems involves applications of a recently developed&lt;br/&gt;probabalistic theory of holomorphic sections of line bundles over&lt;br/&gt;Kahler manifolds.  We have at this time determined much of the&lt;br/&gt;local statistics of sections over small balls.  We have also&lt;br/&gt;generalized the results to symplectic manifolds. We now aim to&lt;br/&gt;apply these results to determine hole probabilities,&lt;br/&gt;probabilities of transversality, and other matters which arise in&lt;br/&gt;complex and symplectic geometry.  The third group of problems&lt;br/&gt;belongs to Quantum Chaos. We have introduced a new model of&lt;br/&gt;random quantum maps, obtained by quantizing stochastic&lt;br/&gt;Hamiltonian flows.  We propose to investigate the main problems&lt;br/&gt;of Quantum Chaos for this model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Much of physics of the twentieth century has revolved around the&lt;br/&gt;quantum mechanics of particles and fields, in particular around&lt;br/&gt;the Schrodinger equation, and the physics and engineering of the&lt;br/&gt;future will be even more quantum mechanical.  Quantum systems are&lt;br/&gt;quite un-intuitive and one of the best ways to understand what&lt;br/&gt;they do is to compare them to the classical systems which they&lt;br/&gt;quantize. For instance, a hydrogen atom in a strong magnetic&lt;br/&gt;field can be thought of as a small particle moving in a force&lt;br/&gt;field.  As the magnetic field gets stronger, the particle's&lt;br/&gt;motion becomes more complex and chaotic. What does this say about&lt;br/&gt;the quantum particle?  According to twenty years of numerical&lt;br/&gt;studies, the behaviour of a chaotic quantum particle should be&lt;br/&gt;random, with statistics similar to those for random matrices.&lt;br/&gt;Why should solutions of the Schrodinger equation know anything&lt;br/&gt;about random matrices?  Our approach is to introduce a new model&lt;br/&gt;of chaotic quantum systems which allows one to consider large&lt;br/&gt;families of systems at once.  In a sense, we are trying to&lt;br/&gt;show that a `random' quantum system behaves similarly to a&lt;br/&gt;`random' matrix, despite the differences in these systems.&lt;br/&gt;Such a model should be able to explain observations ranging from&lt;br/&gt;nuclear resonance levels to chemical reaction rates.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
