<AbstractNarration>This proposal requests support for Professor Vladimir Braginsky and his group at the Moscow State University (MSU) in Moscow, Russia.  Braginsky and his group are members of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC) and they propose to continue research on topics of great interest to the LIGO project to which the group has made outstanding contributions over the years.   While most of the research will be carried out at MSU, Braginsky and his colleagues will be in frequent close contact with LIGO Laboratory and LSC members as the collaboration works to develop new tools and techniques that will be used in Advanced LIGO detectors.  The MSU group will focus their research on new materials and techniques that will reduce the noise level that limits the sensitivity of LIGO in its quest to detect gravitational waves.   In addition, they will study ideas for breaking through the quantum limit on measurement precision that is expected to be reached by Advanced LIGO.  This limit was pointed out by Braginsky a number of years ago, and interest in trying to avoid this limit is now being pursued in a number of laboratories.  Schemes for accomplishing this (called "Quantum-Non-Demolition" - a term invented by Braginsky) will be studied by the MSU group, the acknowledged world leaders in this topic.</AbstractNarration>
