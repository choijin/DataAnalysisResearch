<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Snyder&lt;br/&gt;OPP-0095089&lt;br/&gt;Forman &lt;br/&gt;OPP-0094982&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a collaborative proposal between the University of Illinois-Chicago and Bowling Green University. The Principal Investigators propose to decipher the glaciation history of northeastern Kola and Kanin peninsulas, Russia.  This region, situated near the presumed last glacial maximum (LGM) confluence of the Scandinavian and Barents Sea ice sheets, is very important to the reconstruction of both ice masses.  However, recent published glacier reconstructions of the region propose a variety of different interpretations.  In particular, uncertainty exists on the glaciation of Kanin Peninsula during the LGM and on the presence and extent of an independent Ponoi ice cap on eastern Kola Peninsula during deglaciation.  Much of the uncertainty in this region results from a lack of chronological control on features associated with glaciation and deglaciation of the region.&lt;br/&gt;To test these conflicting hypotheses, the Principal Investigators will undertake a broad glacial geologic field program which emphasizes the collection of data to provide an improved chronology of deqlaciation.  They will do complementary geochronologic methods rock surface exposure dating utilizing the accumulation of cosmogenic 36Cl and 10Be and radiocarbon dating of basal organic materials preserved in lakes.  Surface exposure samples will be collected from exposed glacial erratics and glacier-scoured bedrock surfaces.  Radiocarbon samples will be obtained by coring glacier-scoured lakes, abundant in the region.  In addition, new basic data on glacial geology, such as ice-flow-direction indicators and glacial stratigraphy, will be collected and integrated with previous observations in the region to provide a geomorphic and stratigraphic framework for their investigations.&lt;br/&gt;  This research should lead to significant improvements in our knowledge of the extent of Late Weichselian glaciation and the chronology and patterns of deglaciation in the region.  Better knowledge of the existence and timing of an independent Ponoi ice cap will provide a means to assess regional climatic gradients during the Younger Dryas and earlier late-glacial climate events.  Furthermore, improved reconstruction of Late Weichselian glaciation and deglaciation of the region will aid the broader scientific community by providing more realistic data to improve models of global climate, Earth rheology and sea-level change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
