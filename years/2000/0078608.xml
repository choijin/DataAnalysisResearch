    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will continue to develop and demonstrate a computational tool for detailed simulation of Rapid thermal processing (RTP) in a distributed computing&lt;br/&gt;environment by taking advantages of the findings in Phase I. RTP has become a key technology in the&lt;br/&gt;fabrication of advanced semiconductor devices. As wafers get larger and chip dimensions smaller, the&lt;br/&gt;understanding of the highly coupled physics such as radiative heat transfer, transient fluid flow and heat&lt;br/&gt;transfer as well as chemical reactions through numerical modeling using high-performance computing is&lt;br/&gt;the key to the design, optimization, and control of RTP reactors. In Phase II, A 3D surface radiation&lt;br/&gt;model based on the modified discrete transfer method (MDTM) will be developed to treat radiative&lt;br/&gt;transfer in the lamphouse and process chamber as a whole process. The detailed pattern effects will be&lt;br/&gt;taken into account by rigorously solving time-domain Maxwell's equations through a finite volume&lt;br/&gt;approach. The rarefied gas dynamics in low pressure RTP will be modeled by adding Burnett terms into&lt;br/&gt;the Navier-Stokes equations. The governing equations that contain various multi-disciplinary physical&lt;br/&gt;models will be solved by a 3D unstructured finite volume method. To address computationally intensive&lt;br/&gt;3D simulation needs, an efficient parallel strategy will be implemented in the solution procedure. Data&lt;br/&gt;communication among parallel processors will be conducted by the Message Passing Interface (MPI)&lt;br/&gt;library. To accelerate the overall solution convergence and improve the parallel performance, the&lt;br/&gt;algebraic multi-grid (AMG) method will be used to solve the discretized equations in each processor. It is&lt;br/&gt;expected that the proposed simulation tool can be used to systematically investigate the underlying&lt;br/&gt;physics occurring in RTP systems, and to help in the design, optimization, and control of RTP reactors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed simulation tool will significantly benefit the semiconductor manufacturing equipment industries that require a detailed understanding of multimode and highly coupled transport phenomena. The potential applications include the design, optimization, and control of RTP reactors and many other manufacturing and materials processing systems.</AbstractNarration>
