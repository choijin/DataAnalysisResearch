<AbstractNarration>0077235&lt;br/&gt;Bradley&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During embryonic development, cells destined to develop into discrete tissues must recognize and adhere to one another.  These adhesive events are mediate by proteins found on the surfaces of cells, on such family of which are the protocadherins.  Recently a novel protocadherin member, termed NFPC, was isolated from the frog, Xenopus laevis.  NFP is found in the developing frog nervous system in a subset of neurons in both the spinal cord and eye, implying that NFPC might mediate the adhesion and segregation of these neurons during development.  Accordingly this study will dissect the role of NFPC in the adhesive events responsible for correct development of these neurons.  As it is not known how protocadherins function as cell adhesion molecules, and whether they may have additional roles in cell signaling, the mechanism by which NFPC acdts will be investigated by isolating and analyzing the cytoplasmic factors with which it interadcts.  &lt;br/&gt;Finally the roles of other novel protocadherins in vertebrate neural development will be assessed.&lt;br/&gt; Results from these studies will provide insights into the molecular mechanisms by which the vertebrate nervous system forms, as well as an elucidation of how protocadherins contribute to this process.  Thus, these studies will lead to a better understanding of how alterations in cell adhesion can contribute to the etiology of neural defects and cancer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
