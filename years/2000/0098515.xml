<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;AST 0098515&lt;br/&gt;Miralda-Escude&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;High resolution spectroscopic observations of quasars often show multiple emission-line and absorption-line features which are identified as the resonance line of Lyman Alpha (Lya ) which originates in clouds of hydrogen gas at different redshifts located between the observer and the quasar itself. These redshifted Lya lines can be used to map structure in the high-redshift universe (since the redshift gives position along the line of sight). This theoretical research program will show how correlations along multiple lines of sight in the observed Lya  absorption lines and correlations between different tracer populations (such as narrow absorption lines, emission lines from diffuse hydrogen, and broad absorption lines) can tighten cosmological constraints and elucidate the physics of quasar and galaxy formation. The research will use hydrodynamic cosmological simulations, collisionless N-body simulations, and numerically calibrated analytic approximations to obtain predictions of current theoretical models, which can be tested against observational studies of multiple tracer populations in the same spatial volumes. In sum, the proposed research program will provide the theoretical development needed to motivate, design, analyze, and interpret multi-tracer studies of high-redshift structure.&lt;br/&gt;Funding for this project was provided by the NSF program for Extragalactic Astronomy &amp; Cosmology (AST/EXC).&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
