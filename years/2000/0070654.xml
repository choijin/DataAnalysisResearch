<AbstractNarration>Working with his colleagues, the investigator will develop the &lt;br/&gt;formalism of Derived Deformation Theory. This theory aims to &lt;br/&gt;resolve in a systematic fashion many of the difficulties arising &lt;br/&gt;from the fact that moduli spaces in algebraic geometry related&lt;br/&gt;to higher dimensional varieties are typically singular. The basic &lt;br/&gt;idea is that the correct object to consider for a moduli problem &lt;br/&gt;is some ``derived moduli space'' which should be manifestly smooth &lt;br/&gt;in an appropriate sense and should carry a differential-graded &lt;br/&gt;structure sheaf. The usual moduli space is obtained from the derived &lt;br/&gt;version as the degree-zero truncation, and this explains its singular&lt;br/&gt;nature. In recent work, Ciocan-Fontanine and Kapranov defined and&lt;br/&gt;studied the ``right derived category of schemes'', whose objects are &lt;br/&gt;differential-graded schemes, and they have constructed the derived  &lt;br/&gt;version of Grothendieck's Quot scheme. The investigator will extend &lt;br/&gt;the formalism to a larger category of differential-graded stacks, and &lt;br/&gt;use it to construct derived versions of some other important moduli &lt;br/&gt;spaces in algebraic geometry (such as moduli of vector bundles, stable &lt;br/&gt;maps, etc.).  As a first application of the theory, it is proposed to &lt;br/&gt;give a simpler and more general construction of the virtual fundamental&lt;br/&gt;classes of Behrend-Fantechi and Li-Tian. This new construction is &lt;br/&gt;expected to be better suited to investigate the properties of virtual &lt;br/&gt;fundamental classes in the case of moduli of stable maps of higher genus &lt;br/&gt;to a hypersurface in a Fano manifold and to understand mathematically&lt;br/&gt;mirror symmetry at higher genus. The project has also a part dealing&lt;br/&gt;with some explicit calculations of genus zero Gromov-Witten invariants &lt;br/&gt;of flag manifolds, and applications to mirror symmetry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is research in the field of algebraic geometry, which is one of the &lt;br/&gt;oldest branches of modern mathematics. In recent years, the methods and &lt;br/&gt;ideas of algebraic geometry, especially the study of moduli spaces, have &lt;br/&gt;been employed in string theory, a very active part of theoretical physics. &lt;br/&gt;Developments in string theory have  sparked a fruitful interaction between &lt;br/&gt;the two communities of researchers and have led to the discovery and study &lt;br/&gt;of many striking new phenomena. Mirror symmetry is one example. &lt;br/&gt;It is expected that a better understanding of moduli spaces in algebraic &lt;br/&gt;geometry will lead to more applications to string theory.</AbstractNarration>
