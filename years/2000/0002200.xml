    <AbstractNarration>INT 0002200&lt;br/&gt;Kalman&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This U.S.-Hungary project between Gabor Kalman of Boston College and Zoltan Donko of the Research Institute for Solid State Physics and Optics, Budapest, examines Strongly Coupled Coulomb Systems (SCCS) which are characterized by a significant ratio of the Coulomb interparticle potential energy to the kinetic energy of the particles. The strong coupling effects can take place both in the electronic and ionic components and one finds them in settings such as inertially confined plasmas, astrophysics, condensed matter systems, mesoscopic matter, and laser and particle beams for thermonuclear fusion. Specifically, this U.S.-Hungarian team intends to address layered systems (electronic or ionic bilayer, modeled by two quasi two-dimensional layers of charged particles) and dusty plasmas (liquids and crystal). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kalman and his group bring a strong theoretical underpinning to the work while Donko contributes expertise with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations that will be utilized as an "experimental" check for the theoretical aspects of this study of SCCS. Their collaborative research plan features computation of pair correlation functions, dynamic structure functions, and transport coefficients. The MD simulation work serves two purposes by providing: 1) an independent source of data for quantities obtained through theoretical calculations, making a comparison between theoretical and MD results possible; and 2) information on physical quantities for which a theoretical model is not available. If successful, results should improve our fundamental understanding of SCCS and serve as a check for theoretical predictions related to material properties and phase changes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project in theoretical physics fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling experts in the United States and Central Europe to combine complementary talents and share research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.</AbstractNarration>
