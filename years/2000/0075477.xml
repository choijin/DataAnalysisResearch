<AbstractNarration>Proposal: DMS-0075477&lt;br/&gt;PI: Yakov eliashberg et al&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;The program ``Low-dimensional contact geometry" is organized jointly&lt;br/&gt;by the American Institute of Mathematics (AIM) and the Department&lt;br/&gt;of Mathematics of Stanford University.  It will run from&lt;br/&gt;mid-August till mid-December 2000. The program will end with a&lt;br/&gt;a Contact Geometry Workshop. The goal of the program is to capitalize &lt;br/&gt;on recent progress in contact geometry. It seems that the time is ripe now&lt;br/&gt;for new breakthroughs in the field, and that the concentration of both&lt;br/&gt;established and young researchers in contact and symplectic geometry and &lt;br/&gt;related areas, as well as participation of several graduate students, may &lt;br/&gt;help to produce new remarkable results.  The organizers feel that a &lt;br/&gt;coherent picture of contact geometry in 3 dimensions is within reach.&lt;br/&gt;In particular,  the participants will try to achieve a complete &lt;br/&gt;classification of contact structures for large classes of 3-manifolds, &lt;br/&gt;to make further advances in the theory of Legendrian and transversal&lt;br/&gt;knots in contact 3-manifolds, and to establish further properties of contact&lt;br/&gt;3-manifolds which serve as boundaries of symplectic 4-manifolds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contact geometry was born more than two centuries ago in the work of &lt;br/&gt;Huygens, Hamilton, Jacobi as a geometric language for optics. It was &lt;br/&gt;soon realized that it has applications in many other areas, including&lt;br/&gt;non-holonomic mechanics and thermodynamics. One encounters contact geometry &lt;br/&gt;in everyday life when parking a car, skating, using a refrigerator, or &lt;br/&gt;watching the beautiful play of light in a glass of water. Sophus Lie, &lt;br/&gt;Elie Cartan, Darboux and many other great mathematicians devoted a lot of &lt;br/&gt;their work to this subject. However, till very recently most of the results &lt;br/&gt;were of a local nature. With the birth of symplectic and contact topology &lt;br/&gt;in the Eighties, the subject was reborn, and  the last decade  witnessed a&lt;br/&gt;number of breakthrough discoveries. There were found new important &lt;br/&gt;interactions with Hamiltonian mechanics, symplectic and sub-Riemannian &lt;br/&gt;geometry, foliation theory, complex geometry and analysis, topological &lt;br/&gt;hydrodynamics, 3-dimensional topology, and knot theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Details of the program can be found at http:/math.stanford.edu/contact.html&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
