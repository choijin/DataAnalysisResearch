<AbstractNarration>The National Science Foundation Computer Science, Engineering, and Mathematics (CSEMS) project is providing scholarships for low income, academically talented students, enabling them to pursue degrees in computer science, computer technology, engineering, engineering technology, and mathematics. There are two complementary aims of the program. The two- year degree program prepares students to make the transition to a four- year degree program. In addition, associate and certificate programs provide opportunities, not only for pursuing additional degrees, but also for workforce placement in an area with high unemployment but strong occupational demand for people with the training and education in these technical areas. Recruitment, retention, matriculation, graduation, and continuing education/ placement are the focus of students participating in the program. Well-established academic support and mentoring programs strongly embedded in the management philosophy and college vision provide strong retention support to assure that students complete the programs. The program has four goals: improved education for all students in the stated disciplines, increased retention to degree achievement, improved professional development and employment for participating students, and strengthened partnerships between institutions of higher education and related employment sectors.</AbstractNarration>
