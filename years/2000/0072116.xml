<AbstractNarration>This proposal is designed to analyze and critique current measurements and benchmarks for information technology (IT).  In addition, it proposes to develop and test new measurements and benchmarks aimed at providing a more accurate understanding of infrastructure, access, and use of information technologies and telecommunications systems.  As part of this process, the proposal will develop an inventory of existing internationally-comparable data and benchmarks of global IT that will highlight the type of measurement, source, the time period, and any data limitations.  It will also aim to develop new approaches to the analysis and presentation of data indicators, with particular focus on effective methods of presenting complex information as indicators in IT.  While international data does exist, these providers currently employ measures and benchmarks that do provide information on IT systems and structures, the ability of these data and standards to fully convey the complexity of IT is open to question.  For example, current measurements and benchmarks take into the account the build-out of copper-wire and fiber optic landlines, but do not fully account for the transformation of networks to digital capacity.  The audience for the results of this project include both scholars and policy practitioners engaged in IT and national development, particularly for nations and regions of the developed world.  The project team consists of individuals from Northwestern University and the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).</AbstractNarration>
