<AbstractNarration>Biological Sciences (61) &lt;br/&gt;Faculty from the Departments of Biochemistry and Ecology and Evolutionary Biology are developing an integrated pair of biology methods courses for pre- service teachers. One course focuses on topics related to cell biological, molecular, and biochemical topics; the other highlights topics and approaches in teaching about ecology and evolution. Both focus on a level of understanding appropriate for middle and high school biology teachers and provide considerable exposure to biological content as well as teaching methods. The two courses are offered separately, but are integrated by a common conceptual theme of life in the desert. All topics are considered from the point of view of adaptations to the desert environment, from the whole organism to the cell and molecular level. Extensive use is made of both campus and off-campus resources that help students better understand life in the desert. Computer-interfaced field instruments and sensors facilitate investigative field research projects that are designed and carried out by students who are also student teachers. Both courses engage students in dialogue about the common misconceptions about the natural world, and how an interdisciplinary, hands- on teaching approach can help to identify and clarify misconceptions. Our goal in focusing on misconceptions is to model how teachers can best help students learn difficult concepts and how to genuinely assess learning and understanding. The focus on misconceptions also creates an environment in our courses where questioning and intellectual thought are valued, where a lack of understanding is an impetus for further exploration, and where students are encouraged to learn from each other and to value a diversity of styles of teaching and learning. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students work through exemplary activities and discuss the techniques that foster student involvement in biology laboratory activities. Both courses are mapped to Benchmarks for Science Literacy (AAAS, 1993) and the National Science Education Standards (NRC, 1996) and both adapt practices from a number of resources including Great Explorations in Math and Science, Full-Option Science Series programs, Science and Technology for Children, Bottle Biology, and the American Chemical Society Chemistry in the Community . A practicing secondary school teacher is a valued collaborator in course design and teaching to ensure that both courses are as relevant as possible to the actual classroom teaching situation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
