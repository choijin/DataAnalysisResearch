<AbstractNarration>Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;The main objective of the proposed research is to develop novel&lt;br/&gt;Software-Implemented Fault Tolerance (SIFT) techniques for increasing&lt;br/&gt;the dependability of the distributed and networked environments based on&lt;br/&gt;COTS.&lt;br/&gt;The issues of dependability will be addressed by the design and&lt;br/&gt;implementation of (SIFT), dynamic reconfiguration in distributed systems&lt;br/&gt;and high-speed computer networks. Novel fast dynamic reconfiguration&lt;br/&gt;techniques for various irregular network topologies will be developed and&lt;br/&gt;analyzed. An analytical method is proposed for evaluating the reliability&lt;br/&gt;improvement by using  SIFT for any size of distributed systems .&lt;br/&gt;The  goal of this research  is to identify and develop new key building&lt;br/&gt;blocks&lt;br/&gt;for reliable distributed systems built with inexpensive off-the shelf&lt;br/&gt;components. The platform consists of computing nodes connected via&lt;br/&gt;multiple interfaces to networks configured in fault-tolerant topologies.&lt;br/&gt;Thus, the research community and a large number of users will have the&lt;br/&gt;opportunity  to build reliable distributed systems based on COTS in a user&lt;br/&gt;transparent way.The goal will be to achieve a high reconfiguration rate&lt;br/&gt;and a small recomputation overhead in the presence of faults in the&lt;br/&gt;distributed&lt;br/&gt;systems and high-speed computer networks in a way transparent to the user,&lt;br/&gt;which will provide a high dependability.&lt;br/&gt;This research project will have a positive impact on a large community&lt;br/&gt;implementing applications in distributed and network environments such as&lt;br/&gt;: e-commerce, telepresence, telemedicine, Internet data centers,&lt;br/&gt;distributed applications running concurrently across</AbstractNarration>
