<AbstractNarration>The PI is investigating several aspects of large cardinal theory in the&lt;br/&gt;region of Woodin cardinals, including (1) Long Games; (2) Iterability; and&lt;br/&gt;(3) connections with Descriptive Set Theory. 1 - Results obtained by the&lt;br/&gt;PI through previous NSF support demonstrate the tight connection between&lt;br/&gt;Woodin cardinals and games of variable countable length. The existence of&lt;br/&gt;iterable models for specific large cardinals can be used to yield the&lt;br/&gt;determinacy of games of specific lengths, with increasing length&lt;br/&gt;corresponding to increasing large cardinal strength. These games in turn&lt;br/&gt;can be used to decide statements over minimal inner models for large&lt;br/&gt;cardinals. The PI is attempting to extend this correspondence, the first&lt;br/&gt;main test case being open games of length omega one. 2 - The study of&lt;br/&gt;Woodin cardinals leads naturally to a transfinite game known as the&lt;br/&gt;iteration game. Winning strategies ("iteration strategies") for the good&lt;br/&gt;player in this game are essential to the comparison process that lies at&lt;br/&gt;the heart of inner model theory. Proving that iteration strategies exist&lt;br/&gt;is the single most important problem in the field. The PI has been working&lt;br/&gt;on this problem, contributing to the existing pool of partial results.&lt;br/&gt;Several problems, related to the general problem of iterability but&lt;br/&gt;specialized and more concrete, are investigated as part of this project.&lt;br/&gt;This investigation should provide increased understanding of the main&lt;br/&gt;problem, and hopefully lead to additional partial results. 3 - The PI is&lt;br/&gt;working to solidify the connections between large cardinals and definable&lt;br/&gt;sets of real numbers. Extensive work, much of it done during the '70s and&lt;br/&gt;'80s, provides a detailed analysis of definable sets of reals assuming&lt;br/&gt;determinacy. Later work obtained determinacy from large cardinals. The PI&lt;br/&gt;is working to emulate the existing analysis of definable sets of reals,&lt;br/&gt;working directly from large cardinals. The point here is to try to convert&lt;br/&gt;methods used in the study of definable sets of reals, into methods which&lt;br/&gt;can be used in inner model theory and the study of large cardinals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set Theory is a branch of Mathematics which attempts to understand the&lt;br/&gt;universe of Mathematics, that is the collection of all objects studied by&lt;br/&gt;Mathematicians, or more precisely the collection of all _sets_. (Numbers,&lt;br/&gt;groups, functions, etc., can all be represented as sets.)  Set Theorists&lt;br/&gt;view this universe as a structure in its own right, a structure which can&lt;br/&gt;itself be analyzed using mathematical reasoning. For example, a Set&lt;br/&gt;Theorist may ask "is there an embedding of the universe into a similar,&lt;br/&gt;yet not identical, structure?" Set Theorists work with such embeddings&lt;br/&gt;("elementary embeddings") in much the same way that one would work with&lt;br/&gt;functions on numbers, asking "how similar is the target structure to the&lt;br/&gt;original structure?" and "what's the smallest size of a set actually moved&lt;br/&gt;by the embedding?" Such questions about embeddings of the universe form a&lt;br/&gt;subfield of Set Theory known as the study of large cardinals. The&lt;br/&gt;terminology here hints at the answer to the last question mentioned.&lt;br/&gt;Indeed, the sets actually moved by elementary embeddings are substantially&lt;br/&gt;larger than any object studied in other branches of Mathematics&lt;br/&gt;(substantially larger than the set of real numbers for example). Yet it&lt;br/&gt;turns out that the existence of elementary embeddings has concrete effects&lt;br/&gt;on lower level objects, including concrete effects on real numbers. This&lt;br/&gt;project is part of the on-going effort to better understand large&lt;br/&gt;cardinals, and better understand their effects on the line of real&lt;br/&gt;numbers. The PI, like other researchers in the field, is motivated by the&lt;br/&gt;connection between the abstract and the concrete.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
