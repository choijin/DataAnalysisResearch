<AbstractNarration>The investigator and colleagues study various objects involving the  combinatorics of geometric intersections.  These include the characteristic  classes of oriented matroid bundles as defined by Gelfand and MacPherson,  the configuration spaces of simplices first studied by Schubert and  an application related to work of Sarkaria to extensions of Tverberg's  theorem proposed by Kalai.  Oriented matroid bundles are a combinatorial  analog of vector bundles for which a classifying space is known.  The  cohomology of this classifying space is studied.  The spaces of simplices  are singular moduli spaces which arise in geometric ennumeration problems  as well as in the study of generalized Schur modules.  A combinatorially  defined resolution of singularities is defined and its intersection  properties studied.  Tverberg's theorem has conjectured extensions by  Kalai involving the dimensions of the Tverberg points.  The relationship  to the deleted join of simplices with the symmetric group action is studied.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work relates several previously studied approaches to the intersections  of geometric objects to finite mathematical problems.  This will provides  a better understanding of both the finite objects in question, as for instance  in the third case above, and of the geometric objects, as in the second case  above.  These finite objects arise frequently in both computer science  and physics, and further understanding the relationships to geometric  objects could have an impact on these fields.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
