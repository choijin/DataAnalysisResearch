<AbstractNarration>Chemistry (12)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The chemistry department at Friends University, as a part of developing learning outcome goals for our students and the resulting assessment of our program, has begun making major changes in our curriculum to improve our program. The next step in our curriculum improvement is to integrate the use of a modern computer interfaced FTIR instrument into a number of courses. A number of experiments from the Journal of Chemical Education are being adapted for this purpose. The FTIR is being introduced throughout the curriculum to increase student interest, to involve students in independent projects, and to serve as a complementary tool to other instrumental techniques already available for undergraduate use. In the beginning classes, the speed and ease of use of the FTIR and the simplicity of interpreting spectra as molecular fingerprints allows students to collect high quality data and to make decisions based on the results. The FTIR is making possible major changes in upper level laboratory courses by allowing development of new experiments and studies. The instrument also is used in Summer Workshops for secondary teachers and for high school students involved in the Junior Academy of Science and our Summer Science Program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
