<AbstractNarration>0072816&lt;br/&gt;Mizel&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the part of the present proposal involving unorthodox &lt;br/&gt;materials is to develop an understanding of step structure and step motion &lt;br/&gt;in the limit of small step free energy for crystals with surface defects &lt;br/&gt;consisting of monatomic height steps separated by terraces. Such defects &lt;br/&gt;are fundamental structures since steps--as sinks and sources for atoms--&lt;br/&gt;influence mass transport at surfaces and therefore influence fundamental &lt;br/&gt;multidimensional surface processes such as nucleation and growth, facet &lt;br/&gt;formation and thermal roughening in crystals and their applications. &lt;br/&gt;Consequently these defects have been studied since the 1950's and fairly &lt;br/&gt;successful macroscopic models to describe behavior in most materials &lt;br/&gt;have been developed. These models express the energy of an isothermally &lt;br/&gt;wandering step as the integral of the (generally orientation dependent) step &lt;br/&gt;energy per unit length. However in the limit of vanishing step free energy, &lt;br/&gt;new physics [e.g. higher-order elastic interactions and step-to-step &lt;br/&gt;interactions] enters the picture. These higher-order effects can lead to the &lt;br/&gt;spontaneous development of highly periodic step structures. Such novel &lt;br/&gt;step morphologies are members of an increasingly important class of self-&lt;br/&gt;organizing systems: systems that spontaneously form atomic scale &lt;br/&gt;periodic patterns.  A recent (1997) pathbreaking experiment on Boron-&lt;br/&gt;doped Silicon in which the isothermal wanderings in question, contrary to &lt;br/&gt;the simple models cited, are periodic and increase with a decrease of the &lt;br/&gt;steady state temperature in an interval presents a significant challenge to &lt;br/&gt;the development of appropriate macroscopic models for this branch of &lt;br/&gt;crystal theory. It reveals that there is a major gap in the current technical &lt;br/&gt;understanding of defects in crystals of this nature, since detailed analysis &lt;br/&gt;of the dynamics of these fluctuating step edges is incompatible with &lt;br/&gt;current theories of step energetics.  Resolving this issue is important for &lt;br/&gt;near term attainment of non-routine applications involving crystals with &lt;br/&gt;small step free energy, since it has direct impact on understanding the &lt;br/&gt;atomic-scale structures they develop. In turn, this understanding is needed &lt;br/&gt;for the development of materials with uniformly closely spaced and nearly &lt;br/&gt;congruent self-organized [quantum dot] defects--such self-organizing &lt;br/&gt;materials being crucial to the development of monochromatic lasers and &lt;br/&gt;quantum wires, for example, as device scales shrink. The goal of that part &lt;br/&gt;of the present proposal involving orthodox materials is focussed on &lt;br/&gt;clarifying an as yet unresolved issue in the theory of nonlinearly elastic &lt;br/&gt;materials.  Equilibria for such materials subjected to specified boundary &lt;br/&gt;displacements correspond to deformations which minimize a stored energy &lt;br/&gt;integral whose integrand associates to each deformation a nonnegative real &lt;br/&gt;valued function.  Such stored energy integrands are subject to various &lt;br/&gt;constraints in order to correctly represent possible physical materials.  In &lt;br/&gt;the last decade a previously unnoticed issue has been raised. Namely in &lt;br/&gt;view of a little known one-dimensional variational phenomenon &lt;br/&gt;(originally established in 1926) that for certain variational integrands the &lt;br/&gt;minimizing functions can differ depending on the smoothness of the class &lt;br/&gt;of deformations under consideration -- even though the smoother class of &lt;br/&gt;functions is dense in the larger class. In fact there can be a nonzero &lt;br/&gt;difference between the infima of the integrals associated with such classes &lt;br/&gt;[Lavrentiev's gap phenomenon].  A corresponding gap between classes of &lt;br/&gt;continuous deformations in three dimensional nonlinear elasticity would &lt;br/&gt;imply that the global equilibrium deformation in the larger class would be &lt;br/&gt;energy minimizing and more singular than the energy minimizing global &lt;br/&gt;deformation in the smaller class--whereby structures devised on the basis &lt;br/&gt;of the less singular deformations could develop flaws [fractures], contrary &lt;br/&gt;to the evidence provided by calculations based on standard methods. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To summarize, the PI proposes in the case of the unorthodox type of &lt;br/&gt;crystalline material exemplified by Boron doped Silicon to devise &lt;br/&gt;variational models that will shed light on the entirely nonstandard physical &lt;br/&gt;behavior of such materials.  Such models will involve devising what are &lt;br/&gt;known as Landau-de Gennes type order parameter terms for the free &lt;br/&gt;energy of such materials to reflect the particularly delicate atomic &lt;br/&gt;interactions governing the nanatomic structure of such crystals. On the &lt;br/&gt;other hand, in the case of orthodox materials the PI intends to clarify &lt;br/&gt;whether in the well-established theory of nonlinear elasticity there can &lt;br/&gt;occur materials which for certain classes of boundary conditions can &lt;br/&gt;exhibit an energy gap between the minimum energy on one class of &lt;br/&gt;continuous smooth deformations and the minimum energy on a smaller &lt;br/&gt;class.  The occurrence of such an energy gap could lead to cases in which &lt;br/&gt;structures devised on the basis of computations associated with the smaller &lt;br/&gt;class could develop flaws because the actual energy minimizing &lt;br/&gt;deformation is more singular than the computations suggest.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
