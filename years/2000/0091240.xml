<AbstractNarration>Molecular Mechanisms of Receptive Field Formation and Adaptation in the Vertebrate Retina"&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI:  Robert Paul Malchow, Ph.D.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vision begins with the absorption of light by photoreceptors, which is followed by extensive processing of visual signals by cells within the retina.  This cellular processing is absolutely essential for normal visual perception to take place.  The molecular mechanisms responsible for such processing in the outer retina remain unclear, but it has been suggested that hydrogen ions and nitric oxide may play important roles in this process.  The current proposal seeks to use newly-developed self-referencing electrodes, with greatly heightened sensitivity and stability, to measure the release of these substances from retinal cells and to study their modulation.  This work will provide much needed information on the basic cellular and molecular mechanisms used by retinal cells to contribute to normal vision, and will provide a groundwork to understand abnormalities in vision that occur when these processes fail to function normally.  This work will also offer training opportunities for students, including women and minorities, at the graduate and undergraduate level, to learn about newly developed experimental methods employed in the study of sensory processing. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
