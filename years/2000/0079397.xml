<AbstractNarration>This grant provides funding for the purchase of a Laser Engineered Net Shaping (LENS) system and a Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) unit for interdisciplinary research and education in Solid Freeform Fabrication (SFF). The primary objective of the research is to develop science-based processing and microstructure models that will aid in moving LENS from the proof-of-concept stage towards full scale implementation by industry. Processing models will be developed for predicting heat flow, minimizing residual stress and distortion, controlling microstructure, and optimizing tool path planning. The LENS unit will be used for model validation and development of processing algorithms for controlling microstructure and minimizing distortion. Methods for depositing components with graded microstructures and properties will also be investigated through both model and experimental based activities. The role of powder properties on flow uniformity will be assessed, and the LENS process will be evaluated to identify advantages and limitations relative to competing SFF processes. The instruments will be used for education through undergraduate course instruction. In this educational effort, the FDM unit will be used by undergraduates in the Materials, Mechanical, and Industrial Engineering Departments in an integrated manufacturing course to create solid models from computer aided drawings. Once solid models are created, the LENS unit will then be used to prepare functional prototypes for performance testing. New instruction modules on rapid prototyping and SFF will be developed jointly between the participating engineering departments to support the new equipment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From these efforts, generic models and algorithms will be developed that can be applied by end users for process optimization in order to avoid "trial and error" approaches to LENS manufacturing. The results of this research will be used by industrial partners to fabricate components with reduced manufacturing time, improved dimensional accuracy, and properties that are tailored for enhanced performance. The educational activities will teach undergraduate students how to apply basic concepts in materials, mechanical, and industrial engineering to manufacture components using SFF processes.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
