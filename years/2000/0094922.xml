<AbstractNarration>This project is providing scholarship grants to talented low- income students who are enrolled full- time in a program leading to an associate degree in mathematics, pre- engineering, computer science, or computer technology. The overall goal for this program is the successful attainment of a degree and subsequent employment in the degree field, or transfer to a four- year institution to obtain a baccalaureate degree in the chosen field. The college is developing a pool of program applicants through a recruitment process directed primarily at high schools. Particularly encouraged to apply are individuals from groups underrepresented in these disciplines (minorities, women, and the disabled). This recruitment process solicits the assistance of teachers at the high schools, and involves informational seminars for interested students. Applications are being reviewed and rated by a College Selection Committee composed of faculty from the program disciplines involved, using criteria developed specifically for this program by the College. The college is providing retention and support services for participating students. These services include required attendance at two group meetings each semester. The initial meeting is an orientation meeting to review continuing eligibility requirements, clarify scholarship disbursement processes, and to orient participants to services available (counseling, tutoring, mentoring, and faculty- student conferences). The second meeting occurs at mid- semester to identify academic problems and secure participant feed- back on general or program specific problems. These meetings also serve to encourage mutual support among this student group. Implementation of this program provides career opportunities for program participants and also increases the numbers of underrepresented individuals in the targeted professions. Further, as the community moves from a minimum- wage manufacturing based economy to a higher wage technology based economy, this program contributes to the technologically skilled employee pool that is needed.</AbstractNarration>
