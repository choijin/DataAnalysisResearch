<AbstractNarration>The ability to sequence plant genomes has resulted in the identification of large numbers of novel open reading frames (ORFs). The challenge ahead is to gain information about the function of many known and novel genes that have been identified through these projects.  To this end, systematic efforts are underway to characterize the genes on a large scale using both bioinformatics and high throughput procedures.  Most of the high throughput methods entail analyzing nucleic acids: mRNAs, cDNAs, or genomic sequences. These data provide information about gene expression, genome sequence comparisons and target sites for DNA binding proteins. However, much information about genes comes from the analysis of gene function and gene products. Therefore, in the post-genomic era, large-scale functional genomics approaches are necessary for converting sequence information into functional information. A recently developed para-genetic approach called virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) offers rapid means of gaining insight into gene function in plants. The strategy is termed 'para-genetic' because it effectively creates genetic suppressors in the absence of host genome mutation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The long-term goal of the project is to develop tools for plant functional genomics that will help to understand how plant resistance genes recognize pathogen elicitors and signal the induction of defense responses that ultimately halt the pathogen spread. The specific objectives are to: (1) develop viral vectors for plant functional genomics using a VIGS approach, and (2) identify 'global' and 'specific' suppressors of disease resistance signaling components using VIGS approach. The tools developed in this proposal will be of great utility to gain insight into plant signaling networks. The tools and information developed in this project will be made available to the scientific community for plant signaling studies. Eventually, the knowledge gained from these studies will provide new strategies for the engineering of improved crops.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
