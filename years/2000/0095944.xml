<AbstractNarration>Proposal # HRD-0095944&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Colorado at Boulder&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigators: Lucy Y. Pao, Dale A. Lawrence, and&lt;br/&gt;Howard Kramer &lt;br/&gt;Title: "Haptic Interfaces for Spatial Learning"&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will explore the use of haptic (touch) interfaces, in concert with conventional visual and audio interfaces, to enhance communication and learning of spatial concepts in science and engineering.  Graphical means of expressing spatial concepts provide the most clear and concrete representation of spatial ideas, but are often the most difficult for people to use.  In contrast to existing approaches that use only vision, the project will seek non-visual means of expressing and communicating spatial ideas and data.  The approach also differs from recent attempts to reproduce 2D visual graphs or pictures as 2D haptic or tactile artifacts for the visually impaired.  Such approaches depend on projections of 3D objects onto viewing planes, a technique that is only marginally accessible to blind people.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technology exists that can enable people to draw effectively in 3D without depending on vision or vision-like projections of the 3D object or idea.  The project will explore the integration of a 6 degree of freedom (DOF) haptic interface with new software tools that produce a variety of direct 3D drawing capabilities, including the capability to instantly review and correct the concept as it is created.  Investigators will explore the benefits of non-visual (haptic and audio) feedback for drawing.  We believe non-visual interaction with drawing tools can make graphical representations of spatial constructs, relationships, and ideas much easier to generate and share, promoting clearer discourse in fields that depend on spatial concepts.  The ability to create precise 3D drawings would provide a mode of communication for visually impaired people opening new opportunities in fields that require an ability to communicate using spatial representations.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technology to be developed and test consists of a desktop workstation that provides capability for visual, audio, and haptic interaction with computer-generated spatial constructs.  The tools will consist of software programs that allow users to easily draw in 3-dimensions with visual, haptic, and audio feedback.  A suite of rendering/drawing modes will also be developed to enable users to create and interpret 3-dimensional objects or drawings. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The existing visual/haptic interface facility at the University of Colorado will be augmented with audio capabilities similar to those currently used in the University of Colorado Assistive Technology Lab.  This augmented workstation will be used as a testbed during years 1 and 2 of the project, where work will focus on the development and testing of particular modes of drawing and rendering spatial objects and data, and of particular pedagogic approaches to learning spatial concepts.  The resulting rendering modes will be evaluated by students with learning and/or visual impairments as well as non-impaired students who are interested in science and engineering.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
