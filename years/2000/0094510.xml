<AbstractNarration>People often wonder whether their perceptions are accurate or appropriate. For example, jurors are asked to disregard inadmissible evidence, and people in hiring positions are responsible for ensuring that their evaluation of candidates is free from racial or gender bias. This project seeks to understand how and when people attempt to avoid or remove bias in their judgments and perceptions. The Flexible Correction Model (FCM) addresses such issues and forms the theoretical basis for the experiments. In contrast to past theories addressing bias correction, the FCM conceptualizes bias correction as guided by individuals' naive theories (beliefs) about which biases are at work in a given setting. Some biases might be made salient for a particular judgment (e.g., when a judge instructs jurors not to use a particular piece of inadmissible evidence), whereas other potential biases might be salient for an individual across many settings (e.g., if a person has seen many past instances of racism). Whether active attempts at bias correction do or do not occur is also determined by the levels of motivation and ability people have to avoid the bias. For instance, juries might use inadmissible but condemning evidence because they are motivated to convict the right person. In other situations, people may not be able to avoid bias because they are distracted with other activities or because they do not have time to consider the biases at work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fourteen experiments examine the variables that can influence which biases are most likely to be noticed and corrected by social perceivers, investigate the consequences of efforts to remove or avoid bias, and compare the belief-based corrections outlined by the FCM with alternative theories of avoiding bias. By utilizing a variety of research domains, including persuasion, stereotyping, and impression formation, the experiments will demonstrate how the FCM can help to organize our understanding of corrections in such varied settings as hiring decisions, courtroom judgment, advertising, and education.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
