    <AbstractNarration>This study focuses on attorneys, both U.S. and non-U.S. nationals, engaged in the overseas practice of American securities law. The research has multiple objectives. One is to develop the study of regulatory lawyering across different types of regulatory agencies. A second objective is to generate new evidence of how American law is understood and practiced by attorney overseas. A third objective is to build on existing literature regarding process of corporate regulatory decisionmaking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Data will be collected through approximately 150 interviews with attorneys in law firms, corporate general counsel, and corporate and government officials. These interviews will include a representative sample of both American and British lawyers practicing law in London. The research also includes a survey of securities practitioners and general counsel in both countries.</AbstractNarration>
