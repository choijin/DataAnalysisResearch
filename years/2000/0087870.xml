<AbstractNarration>Interdisciplinary (99)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the proposal is to incorporate Geographic Information Systems (GIS) into undergraduate biology, geography, and geology courses. The project is an adaptation of curricular revisions made at Richard Stockton College in their Environmental Studies Curriculum. Learning with GIS enables students to engage in the processes and methods of inquiry, to think rigorously, rationally, and creatively about the acquired knowledge, and to communicate effectively. GIS have traditionally been used to analyze spatial data and problems in field-oriented disciplines like biology, environmental studies, geography, and geology, but it can also be used to study problems in economics, political science, sociology, and urban studies and modeled as a teaching aid in education. The project modifies a core set of inquiry-based courses in biology, geography, and geology in order to infuse GIS methodology in the natural and social sciences and to serve as multiple entry points into an advanced geography course in GIS theory and application. Faculties teaching these lead courses specialize in appropriate areas of GIS theory and application so that they may serve as mentors to interested faculty across campus. The implementation will take two tracks. First, a centralized learning laboratory with sufficient computer hardware and peripheral equipment is created so students are able to take full advantage of campus GIS technology. Also, lead faculty are trained in the use of ESRI 's ArcView and ArcInfo relative to their needs and discipline specialties. An important outcome of the project is that the use of GIS extends across the curriculum by providing mentoring opportunities to a self-selected group of faculty that have identified a need and interest in incorporating GIS into their coursework.</AbstractNarration>
