<AbstractNarration>0003279&lt;br/&gt;Mitchell&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a three-year collaborative research project between Professor Aaron Mitchell, Columbia University and Professor Mitsuhiro Shimizu of Meisei University in Tokyo, Japan.  The researchers will be undertaking a study of mechanics of chromatin-mediated repression in early meiotic genes in yeast.  The objective of the study is to understand how the genetic transcriptional machinery responds to changes in chromatin structure.  Chromatin is the complex of protein and DNA that comprises eukaryotic chromosomes.  The protein constituents are largely histones, an evolutionarily conserved group of proteins that coat DNA with little sequenced specificity.  Chromatin has long been thought to affect the expression of genes, and several biochemical mechanisms by which chromatin may govern gene expression have been explored.  Proposed studies examine directly two mechanisms by which chromatin may influence gene expression.  The studies focus on two yeast repressors, Rme1p and Ume6p, that function in regulation of meiosis in yeast.  The project brings together the efforts of two laboratories that have complementary expertise and research capabilities.  The researchers hope to learn how a repressor can act over a substantial distance (2Kbp) to affect activity of several transcriptional activators and how does a proximal histone deacetylase inhibit promoter actifity.   Results of this research should be applicable to the understanding of transcriptional repression in plants and animals.  Through the exchange of ideas and technology, this project will broaden our base of basic knowledge and promote international understanding and cooperation.  The researchers plan to publish results of the research in scientific journals and report on the findings at scientific meetings.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
