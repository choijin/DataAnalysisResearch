<AbstractNarration>This research seeks to answer the question of how to measure the capacity&lt;br/&gt;and flexibility of a transportation system, considering uncertainty in&lt;br/&gt;system performance and traffic. The emphasis is on the term system, for&lt;br/&gt;methods already exist to measure the capacity of individual links and nodes&lt;br/&gt;of a network in terms of volume-delay functions. But as we have learned&lt;br/&gt;with the recent capacity problems of U.S. freight railroads, capacity is&lt;br/&gt;dependent on many other system elements, including the fleet, labor, and&lt;br/&gt;energy, among others. And information technology -- vehicle and cargo&lt;br/&gt;tracking systems, mobile communications, real-time movement control, etc.--&lt;br/&gt;can increase fleet productivity and shift link volume-delay curves. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will develop overall metrics for system capacity. These are&lt;br/&gt;intended to address questions of the maximum amount of traffic a system can&lt;br/&gt;accommodate, and the flexibility of the system in accommodating different&lt;br/&gt;mixes of traffic. Such mixes include changes in: spatial patterns resulting&lt;br/&gt;from shifts in national or international trade patterns, the mix of&lt;br/&gt;commodities carried, and speed or other level of service features required&lt;br/&gt;by industry. We term these different quantities and mixes of commodities&lt;br/&gt;and related features "traffic scenarios."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The methods developed are intended to address fundamental questions that&lt;br/&gt;face those responsible for providing transportation infrastructure,&lt;br/&gt;including: Is the system capable of accommodating an expected future&lt;br/&gt;traffic scenario? If not, what are the bottlenecks? How flexible is the&lt;br/&gt;current system in accommodating various traffic scenarios that might arise?&lt;br/&gt;How adequate and flexible will the system be given planned investments and&lt;br/&gt;other changes? Traditional transportation models have focused on estimating&lt;br/&gt;the performance-- cost and level of service--of a given system with given&lt;br/&gt;traffic scenario, and generally do not consider uncertainty. This research&lt;br/&gt;addresses different but related questions, namely, the ability of a system&lt;br/&gt;to accommodate various possible traffic scenarios. Our results should&lt;br/&gt;provide improved methods by which private and public sector infrastructure&lt;br/&gt;mangers can assess the state of their systems and also evaluate&lt;br/&gt;improvements resulting from investments and operational changes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In undertaking this research, we will build upon existing models of the&lt;br/&gt;system, but structure these into an optimization formulation that enables&lt;br/&gt;us to posit different measures of capacity and flexibility. One version&lt;br/&gt;will be deterministic. But our goal is to develop a stochastic model that&lt;br/&gt;will take into account stochastic variations in such features as link&lt;br/&gt;performance and the quantity and mix of different commodities over time.&lt;br/&gt;Thus we also intend to develop a Monte Carlo simulation version of the&lt;br/&gt;model, which will provide a basis for developing a combined optimization&lt;br/&gt;and stochastic approach to the problem. We expect to use current capacity&lt;br/&gt;problems in the freight transportation system as examples and tests of the&lt;br/&gt;methodology that we develop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is made under the Exploratory Research on Engineering the&lt;br/&gt;Transport Industries (ETI) program solicitation.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
