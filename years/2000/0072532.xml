<AbstractNarration>Strained solid films are an important component of newly-developed&lt;br/&gt;electronic devices such as the quantum-well semiconductor and the&lt;br/&gt;bipolar heterojunction transistor.  The strain in the film is&lt;br/&gt;essential to these devices because it modifies the electronic band gap&lt;br/&gt;in the device to generate the desired electronic properties.  The&lt;br/&gt;strain in the film, however, is also responsible for the generation of&lt;br/&gt;instabilities during growth, resulting in nonplanar films with&lt;br/&gt;inhomogeneous microstructure, such as "quantum dots" and "quantum&lt;br/&gt;wires".  Because of the strain localization associated with the&lt;br/&gt;inhomogeneous microstructure, the resulting electronic properties can&lt;br/&gt;be enhanced due to quantum electronic effects.  Thus, there has been&lt;br/&gt;intense interest in natural "self-assembly" of quantum dot and quantum&lt;br/&gt;wire morphologies during the growth process.  The research of the PI&lt;br/&gt;will focus on the analysis of mathematical models for the development&lt;br/&gt;of such inhomogeneous microstructures in strained alloy films.  The&lt;br/&gt;theoretical description of morphological development in strained films&lt;br/&gt;is difficult because of the major role that elastic strain plays in&lt;br/&gt;the development of the morphology; the generic case is that of a free&lt;br/&gt;boundary or moving boundary elasticity problem.  While there has been&lt;br/&gt;a significant amount of progress made on the mathematical modeling of&lt;br/&gt;the growth of single-component strained films, models for the growth&lt;br/&gt;of alloy strained films are still in their infancy.  The proposed&lt;br/&gt;research will examine the microstructure generated from the new alloy&lt;br/&gt;film models as nonlinear solutions to the moving boundary elasticity&lt;br/&gt;problem using a combination of both analytical and numerical&lt;br/&gt;techniques.  The research will focus on three areas relating to the&lt;br/&gt;formation of microstructure in strained alloy films.  First, the&lt;br/&gt;possibility of generating a new type of microstructure based on&lt;br/&gt;self-assembled compositional modulations in thick films will be&lt;br/&gt;investigated by a bifurcation analysis of the nonlinear free boundary&lt;br/&gt;problem.  Second the growth of inhomogeneous alloy quantum dots will&lt;br/&gt;be described using a hybrid asymptotic and numerical approach, and the&lt;br/&gt;theoretical predictions will be compared to experiments carried out in&lt;br/&gt;parallel by a collaborator.  Finally the appropriate mathematical&lt;br/&gt;modeling of facet corners in strained alloy crystals will be examined&lt;br/&gt;through a model which incorporates atomic-scale behavior in a&lt;br/&gt;macroscopic model for film growth.  The overall goal of the research&lt;br/&gt;is to develop mathematical approaches that enable a comprehensive&lt;br/&gt;theoretical description of nanostructure formation in strained alloy&lt;br/&gt;films.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In nanoscale electronic devices, strained solid layers play an&lt;br/&gt;important role because of the improved electronic properties of the&lt;br/&gt;strained material.  While flat, planar strained films have been used&lt;br/&gt;successfully, they can be susceptible to instabilities during the&lt;br/&gt;growth process and develop nanoscale bumps ("dots").  These nanoscale&lt;br/&gt;"quantum dots" have been found to give superior electronic behavior&lt;br/&gt;because of quantum-physics electronic effects.  There is thus interest&lt;br/&gt;in growing quantum dots with a controlled size and spacing to give a&lt;br/&gt;material with specified or optimum electronic properties.  The&lt;br/&gt;research supported by this grant focuses on the development of&lt;br/&gt;mathematical models for describing the formation of quantum dots and&lt;br/&gt;other nanostructures from detailed modeling of the physics of the&lt;br/&gt;growth process.  In particular, the work will focus on the growth of&lt;br/&gt;alloy films, for which theoretical understanding not well developed.&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the theoretical work will be to evaluate the effect of&lt;br/&gt;different growth parameters to guide the development of "optimum"&lt;br/&gt;quantum dot structures.  To solve the mathematical problem, advanced&lt;br/&gt;mathematical techniques will be developed and applied to determine the&lt;br/&gt;characteristics of the solutions and how they depend on the material&lt;br/&gt;properties and growth conditions.  In addition, the research will also&lt;br/&gt;address the difficult question of how to incorporate atomic-level&lt;br/&gt;behavior into a large scale model for strained film growth.  The&lt;br/&gt;theoretical predictions will be compared to experiments conducted in&lt;br/&gt;parallel by a collaborator here at the University at Buffalo.  The&lt;br/&gt;results of the work will be twofold.  The understanding of how to&lt;br/&gt;treat the mathematical issues of strained alloy film growth well will be &lt;br/&gt;improved. Also,  a useful "parameter map" describing the important &lt;br/&gt;physical processes that influence the development of nanostructures &lt;br/&gt;will be developed. This parameter map can be used as a&lt;br/&gt;guide to the design of strained alloy nanostructures with specified or&lt;br/&gt;optimum properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
