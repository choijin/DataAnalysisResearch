<AbstractNarration>Theoretical research is being carried out in two areas related to&lt;br/&gt;gravitational waves and their detection.  The first area is the&lt;br/&gt;invention of new techniques and technology for advanced&lt;br/&gt;laser-interferometer gravitational-wave detectors.  These advanced&lt;br/&gt;detectors will entail measuring the motions of 40 kilogram&lt;br/&gt;sapphire-crystal mirrors with an accuracy so high that the mirrors are&lt;br/&gt;governed by the laws of quantum mechanics and not the laws of classical&lt;br/&gt;physics. The new techniques and technology entail, among other things,&lt;br/&gt;new configurations of mirrors and laser beams designed to deal with&lt;br/&gt;quantum effects that are absent in current gravitational-wave&lt;br/&gt;detectors, changes in how the laser light is manipulated after it&lt;br/&gt;leaves the interferometer, and a reshaping of the cross sections of the&lt;br/&gt;interferometer's light beams. The second area of research is the&lt;br/&gt;theoretical modeling of astrophysical sources of gravitational waves&lt;br/&gt;with the goal of predicting the sources' dynamical behaviors and the&lt;br/&gt;details of the waves they emit.  Among the sources being modeled are&lt;br/&gt;oscillations of rapidly spinning, newborn neutron stars, the spins of&lt;br/&gt;neutron stars that are accreting gas from companion stars (``Low-Mass&lt;br/&gt;X-Ray Binaries''), the late, highly relativistic phase of inspiral of&lt;br/&gt;black-hole/black-hole and black-hole/neutron-star binaries, collisions&lt;br/&gt;of black holes, and the tearing apart of a neutron star by a black&lt;br/&gt;hole.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research on new techniques and technology for gravitational-wave&lt;br/&gt;detectors is a key underpinning for the advanced detectors that are&lt;br/&gt;being proposed for construction in LIGO (the Laser Interferometer&lt;br/&gt;Gravitational Wave Observatory) beginning in 2006, and for even more&lt;br/&gt;advanced detectors in the subsequent decade.  This research makes use&lt;br/&gt;of, and contributes to, human knowledge in the area of quantum&lt;br/&gt;information theory --- a new, 21st century discipline that also&lt;br/&gt;includes quantum computation.  This research is likely to have much&lt;br/&gt;impact on areas of technology that---in the coming two or three&lt;br/&gt;decades---will confront quantum limits on the accuracy of measurement&lt;br/&gt;and will try to evade them via ``quantum nondemolition'' (QND)&lt;br/&gt;techniques. These areas of technology include quantum optics and&lt;br/&gt;nanotechnology.  The research on sources of gravitational waves will&lt;br/&gt;provide key underpinnings for analyses of the gravitational-wave data&lt;br/&gt;to be produced by LIGO:  It will improve the ability to find&lt;br/&gt;gravitational-wave signals in the noisy LIGO data, and it will provide&lt;br/&gt;tools for extracting astrophysical information from the discovered&lt;br/&gt;signals.  Thus, this research will play a key role in future&lt;br/&gt;gravitational-wave-based studies of black holes, neutron stars, and&lt;br/&gt;their oscillations and collisions.</AbstractNarration>
