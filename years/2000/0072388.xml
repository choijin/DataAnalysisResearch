<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SINGULAR CONTROL OF DIFFUSION PROCESSES&lt;br/&gt;AND ITS APPLICATIONS TO THE MODELS OF ECONOMIC DYNAMICS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research lies within the area of optimal&lt;br/&gt;stochastic control. It deals with optimal control of&lt;br/&gt;diffusion processes by means of singular with respect&lt;br/&gt;to time functionals.  This type of control naturally&lt;br/&gt;appears in the problems in which there is no natural&lt;br/&gt;restriction on the rates of control and  as a result&lt;br/&gt;the  optimal control rate is infinite. The optimal&lt;br/&gt;policy in these types of problems is to reflect the&lt;br/&gt;process from an a priori unknown boundary.  Such type&lt;br/&gt;of action also arises in problems with additive control,&lt;br/&gt;as an approximation for a "bang-bang" optimal policy.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research consists of developing the theory&lt;br/&gt;of the related Partial Differential Equations with gradient&lt;br/&gt;constraints, studying optimal reflecting barriers and&lt;br/&gt;optimal policies in one dimensional and multidimensional&lt;br/&gt;cases.  Applications include stochastic control models&lt;br/&gt;of flexible manufacturing systems as well as dividend&lt;br/&gt;optimization and  multidimensional portfolio optimization&lt;br/&gt;models. It is also intended to consider application of&lt;br/&gt;the singular stochastic control theory to optimization     &lt;br/&gt;problems in  insurance. We will also study stochastic&lt;br/&gt;control models of large economies and analysis of the&lt;br/&gt;relationship between the general framework of the no&lt;br/&gt;arbitrage asset pricing in mathematical finance and the&lt;br/&gt;equilibrium paths in those models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to developing new stochastic control and stochastic&lt;br/&gt;processes theory, the applications of this research would&lt;br/&gt;include devising better models for optimization of the&lt;br/&gt;manufacturing processes and outputs. In addition our research&lt;br/&gt;would also result in developing new optimization models&lt;br/&gt;in mathematical finance and insurance.  While perceived by&lt;br/&gt;many nonspecialists as a tool for making a fast profit,&lt;br/&gt;mathematical finance in fact is a "technology" for risk&lt;br/&gt;reduction. In this regard its merge with insurance is only&lt;br/&gt;too natural. The issues of controlling the risk as well as&lt;br/&gt;insurance aspects of the financial risk has loomed large&lt;br/&gt;recently in both financial markets as well as in the insurance&lt;br/&gt;industry. The importance of optimization in devise of the&lt;br/&gt;policies employed by insurance and financial institutions&lt;br/&gt;is hard to overestimate. Exposure to unnecessary economic and   &lt;br/&gt;financial risks and failure to employ the optimal procedures&lt;br/&gt;may have serious economic and social impacts. Our research&lt;br/&gt;deals with development of mathematical models of optimal&lt;br/&gt;risk control techniques for financial and insurance corporations.&lt;br/&gt;This  will also enable one to get a better insight into the&lt;br/&gt;nature of the optimal risk reduction techniques a publicly&lt;br/&gt;traded financial corporation should adhere to, as well as the&lt;br/&gt;optimal dividend distribution policy it should follow.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
