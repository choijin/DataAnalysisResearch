<AbstractNarration>We propose to develop a new family of stable high-order finite&lt;br/&gt;difference methods suitable for the solution of wave problems&lt;br/&gt;involving many interfaces and significant geometric complexity.&lt;br/&gt;These complications are addressed by embedding the computational&lt;br/&gt;problem into a Cartesian grid and formulating methods such that&lt;br/&gt;the position of the material interfaces as well as the physical&lt;br/&gt;properties of the solution across the interface is accounted for&lt;br/&gt;properly to the order of the scheme. Staggered grid as well as&lt;br/&gt;non-staggered grid methods will be explored with the emphasis on&lt;br/&gt;the development of a rigorous mathematical foundation for these&lt;br/&gt;schemes to ensure robustness and uniform stability for all grid &lt;br/&gt;sizes and embedded geometries. Appealing properties of embedding&lt;br/&gt;methods such as the ability to model moving interfaces and the&lt;br/&gt;introduction of virtual interfaces to enhance parallel performance&lt;br/&gt;will be exploited to model a variety of wave problems in&lt;br/&gt;electromagnetics, acoustics, seismology, and elasticity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The increasing interest in the accurate and efficient solution&lt;br/&gt;of wave-dominated problems, e.g. problems in acoustic and &lt;br/&gt;electromagnetics, over very long periods of time has spawned an &lt;br/&gt;interest in the formulation of high-order accurate computational&lt;br/&gt;methods for such problems. In this effort we propose to develop&lt;br/&gt;a new class of computational techniques, specifically aimed at&lt;br/&gt;the reliable and robust modeling of problems of a realistic&lt;br/&gt;size and complexity, e.g., the modeling of the propagation of&lt;br/&gt;electromagnetic and acoustic noise and its environmental impact, and&lt;br/&gt;the modeling of underground waves of interest to the oil industry.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed methods are unique in maintaining a very simple &lt;br/&gt;computational structure without sacrificing the accuracy, hence&lt;br/&gt;overcoming a number of well known difficulties associated with&lt;br/&gt;existing methods which require some kind of automated generation of&lt;br/&gt;the computational grid on which the solution is computed.&lt;br/&gt;These proposed developments will enable the modeling of&lt;br/&gt;very complex and realistic scenarios and will, in combination &lt;br/&gt;with high-performance computing facilities for which the&lt;br/&gt;methods are well suited, allow for the modeling and analysis&lt;br/&gt;of complex wave dominated problems in a variety of areas of interest&lt;br/&gt;to engineers and scientists.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
