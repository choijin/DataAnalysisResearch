<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0072153&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Michael Rudnev&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Global dynamics in near-integrable Hamiltonian systems with&lt;br/&gt;several degrees of freedom will be studied. The research aims to&lt;br/&gt;progress towards proving the conjecture about the existence of a&lt;br/&gt;generic topological instability in such systems, known as&lt;br/&gt;"Arnold's diffusion", effected via resonances. The first goal is&lt;br/&gt;to obtain an adequate local description of various geometric&lt;br/&gt;objects that the perturbation causes to appear. These objects can&lt;br/&gt;be characterized by their rotation vectors.  First, they are&lt;br/&gt;lower-dimensional partially hyperbolic (whiskered) tori and the&lt;br/&gt;Lagrangian manifolds (whiskers) asymptotic to these tori.&lt;br/&gt;Generally, the collection of all the rotation vectors yielding&lt;br/&gt;whiskered tori form a set of the first category. Rotation numbers&lt;br/&gt;in the "gaps" in it describe so-called "Aubry-Mather sets". Yet&lt;br/&gt;the latter term is somewhat obscure beyond the case of two&lt;br/&gt;degrees of freedom.  Incorporating many of the above mentioned&lt;br/&gt;objects of all types into a single global geometric framework&lt;br/&gt;effected as an atlas over the phase space, is the second, and the&lt;br/&gt;main goal. Apropos of "Aubry-Mather sets", this will require&lt;br/&gt;mutual interpretation of the results obtained via variational&lt;br/&gt;methods of Lagrangian mechanics and geometric implicit function&lt;br/&gt;theorems, such as KAM, of Hamiltonian approach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research focuses on instability as a generic feature&lt;br/&gt;of complex mechanical systems, be it the Solar system, or a&lt;br/&gt;polyatomic molecule. In order to describe such, one needs to know&lt;br/&gt;the present state of the system, and the equations of its future&lt;br/&gt;evolution. Typically, due to their complexity, one cannot obtain&lt;br/&gt;the solutions of these equations with the initial conditions&lt;br/&gt;incorporated. Otherwise, and this is an exceptional case, the&lt;br/&gt;system is called integrable. Such would be the Solar system if&lt;br/&gt;one considers only the interaction of each individual planet with&lt;br/&gt;the Sun, disregarding in particular the mutual gravitational&lt;br/&gt;attraction between the planets, etc. Yet the laws of motion are&lt;br/&gt;known exactly, the initial state of a system has to be measured,&lt;br/&gt;which leads to errors, however small. The hypothesis of&lt;br/&gt;instability, alias "Arnold's diffusion," suggests that two&lt;br/&gt;infinitesimally different initial conditions may result in two&lt;br/&gt;qualitatively different scenarios ad infinitum. In particular,&lt;br/&gt;this is believed to be true for small perturbations of integrable&lt;br/&gt;systems, e.g. if one takes into account the influence of the Moon&lt;br/&gt;or Jupiter on the orbital motion of the Earth. The suitable&lt;br/&gt;mathematical enviroment to model the systems in question is&lt;br/&gt;provided by geometrical mechanics. The technological motivation&lt;br/&gt;for this research comes from molecular chemistry and biology&lt;br/&gt;where billions of years it would take the instability to develop&lt;br/&gt;itself on a cosmic scale, translate into fractions of a second.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
