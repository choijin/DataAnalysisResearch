<AbstractNarration>     The investigators develop very efficient adaptive&lt;br/&gt;discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods for transient hyperbolic and&lt;br/&gt;singularly perturbed convection-diffusion problems.  These&lt;br/&gt;methods use discontinuous bases and thus are very effective at&lt;br/&gt;capturing discontinuities.  In addition, they simplify adaptive&lt;br/&gt;h-, p-, and hp-refinement, are simple to implement on&lt;br/&gt;unstructured meshes with irregular boundaries, parallelize very&lt;br/&gt;well, and satisfy local (element level) conservation principles.&lt;br/&gt;Adaptive enrichment by h-, p-, and r-refinement or combinations&lt;br/&gt;thereof has typically been guided by a posteriori estimates of&lt;br/&gt;discretization errors.  The investigators study asymptotically&lt;br/&gt;correct error estimates of discretization errors under h- or&lt;br/&gt;p-refinement that provide very reliable measures of solution&lt;br/&gt;accuracy.  A posteriori error estimates are developed for linear&lt;br/&gt;and nonlinear hyperbolic and singularly perturbed&lt;br/&gt;convection-diffusion problems.  The investigators implement these&lt;br/&gt;DG methods for large-scale problems on modern parallel systems&lt;br/&gt;ranging from advanced supercomputers to clusters of workstations.&lt;br/&gt;Parallel procedures must address heterogeneity at the processor,&lt;br/&gt;memory, and communications levels as adaptivity greatly&lt;br/&gt;complicates matters.  A balanced parallel computation may cease&lt;br/&gt;to remain so under adaptive h- or p-refinement.  Computational&lt;br/&gt;loads must dynamically be redistributed during the solution&lt;br/&gt;process to restore and maintain balance.  Procedures to migrate&lt;br/&gt;work between the processors so as to minimize the computational&lt;br/&gt;time have hardly been addressed in such a heterogeneous&lt;br/&gt;environment.&lt;br/&gt;     Complex realistic computer simulations of physical problems&lt;br/&gt;like the flow about a vehicle, weather prediction, and materials&lt;br/&gt;processing require long times on the fastest supercomputers.  The&lt;br/&gt;investigators develop very efficient and reliable computational&lt;br/&gt;techniques based on the discontinuous Galerkin method that should&lt;br/&gt;have advantages for parallel and network computation.  Accuracy&lt;br/&gt;and reliability of the results are guided by estimates of&lt;br/&gt;solution errors that are automatically obtained as part of the&lt;br/&gt;computation.  These are used to create adaptive procedures that&lt;br/&gt;assign computational resources to regions where they are needed&lt;br/&gt;most.  The efficiency provided by adaptivity leads to more&lt;br/&gt;accurate computer simulations, better products, and shorter&lt;br/&gt;design cycles.</AbstractNarration>
