<AbstractNarration>Chemistry (12)&lt;br/&gt;In order that students achieve a better understanding of the atomic nature of matter and to provide technologically advanced yet increasingly ubiquitous instrumentation for undergraduate laboratories and research, we are integrating atomic force microscopy (AFM) into three facets of the chemistry curriculum. In many academic and industrial settings AFM is becoming a routine tool. With its unique capability for "seeing" atoms and its ability to image under ambient conditions and in liquids, AFM provides a technologically advanced solution to many problems facing undergraduate chemistry students. The project adapts several experiments from the literature into various levels of the curriculum in order to enhance the study of atomic and molecular structure. At the freshman level, AFM instrumentation is being demonstrated in the laboratory while images are presented and discussed in the classroom to provide a "proof" of the existence of atoms and to give students a sense of atomic size. This basic foundation in AFM paves the way for hands-on laboratory experiences for upper division chemistry, biochemistry and some biology majors. Mica, silica or graphite are being imaged along with an "exotic" sample in the instrumental analysis laboratory. As an exciting new use for AFM, an experiment suitable for incorporation into the biochemistry laboratory is being developed. Finally, an AFM provides the instrumentation needed to support three diverse research projects guided by three professors. Undergraduate students are investigating atmospheric particulate matter of environmental concern, modified silica surfaces for use in chromatographic stationary phases, and environmental factors affecting cell surface glycopeptides in the Penicillium mold.</AbstractNarration>
