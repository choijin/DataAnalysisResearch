<AbstractNarration>EIA-0097858&lt;br/&gt;Frincke, Deborah&lt;br/&gt;University of Idaho&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;REU SITES:  Developing Undergraduate Research in Computer Network-Based Intruision Detection and Information System Protection&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The need for technologically literate workers has reached a critical level.  The US Department of commerce predicts that by 2006, the United States will need more than 1.3 million new technology workers.  Further, there is a growing consensus that the lack of trained information security an information assurance personnel has reached or soon will reach crisis proportions.  This REU is intended to address the shortage of information assurance researchers by providing opportunities for undergraduates to participate in ongoing research projects under the auspices of the CSDS.  The Center for Secure and Dependable Software (CSDS) at the University of Idaho (UI) was formed in 1998 as an Idaho Center to better organize and promote information security education and research.  The CSDS/University of Idaho was named as one of the first seven Centers of Excellence in Information Assurance Education, and is therefore uniquely suited to lead this initiative.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Our specific objectives are to include 14 undergraduate REU participants yearly (42 total) in a program, which is intended:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. To address the national need for researchers and "thinkers" with competencies in critical infrastructure protection by involving undergraduates in this area of research.&lt;br/&gt;2. To provide an "learn by doing" environment in which motivated undergraduates learn how to take charge of their research in a disciplined and creative manner, and to lead others in such endeavors.&lt;br/&gt;3. To offer a unique research experiences to people who would not otherwise have such opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;4. To stimulate undergraduates to pursue graduate education or research careers in information assurance.&lt;br/&gt;5. To attract a diverse student population to this field of study.&lt;br/&gt;6. To provoke discussion and consideration of the vast array of ethical issues involved in computer security and privacy research and practice, both for the REU participants and later at her REU participants' home site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Key components of our program include: a faculty with considerable experience in working with undergraduates in a research environment; immediate integration of students in existing research programs in information assurance, drawn from the PI and senior investigator's currently funded research: an emphasis on critical thinking, leadership, presentation, and publication skills; the Expanding Horizons seminars, which bring students into direct contact with highly regarded members of the information assurance field, with practitioners, and  with those involved in setting national policy in this area; also an optional ethics component in the form of an integrated sequence of lectures and discussion sections to be led by senior investigators with considerable expertise in this area.  A service aspect is also included, where students lead a project of their choice to solve specific real problems in information assurance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program is geared towards students who would not normally have an opportunity to work in research or in this area.  Recruitment will emphasize diversity, both to enrich the student experience and to bring underrepresented groups in the national security/privacy/information assurance policy and technology debates.  Ongoing assessment is emphasized in terms both of examining how student capabilities change through their participation in this program as well as in tracking student career choices after the program ends.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
