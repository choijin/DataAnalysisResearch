<AbstractNarration>Chemistry (12)&lt;br/&gt;Technology is being incorporated into first and second year chemistry courses via eight ScienceWorks workstations. Incorporation of technology into introductory chemistry is the next step in the continuous reform in the Department of Chemistry. The workstations allow the laboratories to move from traditional 'recipe' experiments to inquiry-based experiments by decreasing the amount of time needed for data acquisition. This allows students more time to analyze, to interpret data, and to develop critical thinking skills necessary to be successful in the work place. Current experiments are being revised and new experiments are being adapted from a variety of sources, including ChemLinks modules, the Middle Atlantic Discovery Chemistry Project (MADCP), and other literature sources, to make full use of the new equipment, such as pH sensors to monitor pH changes in a titration reaction. The workstations also are being used to modify 'traditional' lecture settings to a more active learning environment by using 'mini' lecture experiments, CD-ROMs, and internet sites such as those provided through ChemLinks and others. As a result, professors are able to address the multiple learning styles of our students. For example, difficult concepts such as valence shell electron pair repulsion are addressed by the blackboard, models, and computer simulated 3-D models from websites and CD-ROMS. The workstations also are used for inquiry-based lecture learning using ConcepTests developed by New Traditions and activities from ChemLinks modules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
