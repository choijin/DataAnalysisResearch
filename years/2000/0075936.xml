    <AbstractNarration>0075936&lt;br/&gt;Lynch&lt;br/&gt; The main objective of the Gordon Research Conference on Nuclear Chemistry is to provide the international community of nuclear scientists with a unique forum in which the newest developments at the forefront of this science can be presented and subjected to detailed and extended discussions and criticism. The purpose of the conference is to encourage communication and the discussions to be conducted in an atmosphere conducive to open interactions between the scientists, provoking new and even speculative ideas for future research.&lt;br/&gt; To accomplish these goals requires the participation in all of the&lt;br/&gt;conference activities of a significant number of leaders in the&lt;br/&gt;field. However, the field invites and needs cooperative efforts on&lt;br/&gt;all levels with a range of expertise for its growth. Therefore,&lt;br/&gt;younger scientists from all countries are encouraged to participate&lt;br/&gt;in the conference and to present their ideas. In particular, in&lt;br/&gt;anticipation of the future need of manpower and of a growing&lt;br/&gt;importance of international cooperative scientific ventures, it&lt;br/&gt;appears necessary to expose selected advanced graduate students from the major international research universities to the new&lt;br/&gt;opportunities and techniques in nuclear science. This award will&lt;br/&gt;facilitate participation from these junior scientists.</AbstractNarration>
