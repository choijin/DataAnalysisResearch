    <AbstractNarration>In conjunction with a public radio program, Sheldon Jackson College and Pacific High School will conduct a one-week camp on science and society issues for ninth-grade girls. Our marketing plan will be to encourage traditionally underserved students, such as Alaskan Natives, low income and rural (bush) students. The camp will be preceded by a three-day workshop for teachers to become familiar with update science concepts. The camp will be held on the Sheldon Jackson College campus located in downtown Sitka, on the Pacific Ocean at the edge of the Tongass National Forest in the Heart of Alaska's inside passage. The cam will utilize Expeditionary Learning School techniques: guided questions, and posing challenges to have students explore scientific arenas. The goal of the camp will be to expose young women to science in relation to social and ethical issues. The camp will cover the scientific method, scientific assumptions and explore how science impacts our culture, how the media portrays scientists, and science communication. The experience should result in positive student attitudes towards exploring careers in science. Further, time will be spent with each individual developing a career pathway that will map out a plan for courses during their high school career.</AbstractNarration>
