<AbstractNarration>This study will examine the role of science in the formation of United States endangered species policy.  In particular, the project will use the West Indian manatee as a longitudinal case study.  The project will accomplish three major goals. First, it will examine when and how scientific knowledge is incorporated into policy. Second, it will explore the role that scientists play in the process of creating biodiversity policy. Finally, it will identify what, when, and why social, cultural, political and economic factors preempt the use of science in the process of policy formation and implementation. Using the West Indian manatee as a longitudinal case study, multiple research methods will be used to achieve these goals. Specifically, researchers will use content analysis of scientific literature published on the manatee, content analysis of documents establishing policy directed at manatee recovery and protection, and personal interviews of key persons responsible for the creation of policy regarding manatee recovery and protection. The research findings will be useful to scientists, natural resource managers, and legislators by documenting and analyzing the process through which linkages are made between science and endangered species policy. The research will also contribute new knowledge about the sociological significance of science in the policymaking process.</AbstractNarration>
