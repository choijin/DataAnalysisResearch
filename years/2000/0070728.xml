    <AbstractNarration>The (de Rham) cohomology, based on differential forms on a smooth&lt;br/&gt;manifold, provides an analytic representation of singular cohomology. &lt;br/&gt;For natural spaces which are not smooth, like complex algebraic&lt;br/&gt;varieties, singular cohomology is available, but some of its useful &lt;br/&gt;properties no longer hold and there is no good analytic representation. &lt;br/&gt;However, the de Rham cohomology of forms with moderate growth near the &lt;br/&gt;singular set provides a good alternative, because it satisfies duality &lt;br/&gt;and (Hodge) filtration properties like those in the smooth case. &lt;br/&gt;The investigator and his collaborators study this cohomology in two &lt;br/&gt;cases, where the variety has isolated, point singularities and where &lt;br/&gt;it is the minimal compactification of a locally symmetric space. In &lt;br/&gt;the latter case certain natural functions are studied, with the goal &lt;br/&gt;of proving that they are modular forms. A second line of investigation &lt;br/&gt;concerns quadratic forms defined over the ring of regular functions &lt;br/&gt;on an algebraic variety. The investigator relates these quadratic &lt;br/&gt;forms to quadratic forms defined on the rational function fields &lt;br/&gt;of all subvarieties, in much the same way that holomorphic functions &lt;br/&gt;are related to meromorphic functions and their residues. The &lt;br/&gt;consequent connection to certain multiplicative structures on ideals &lt;br/&gt;in the ring of regular functions is explored.&lt;br/&gt; The first part of the project pursues a program to study &lt;br/&gt;wrinkles (singularities) in a space. If this space were a surface, &lt;br/&gt;wrinkles would typically occur near places where the degree of &lt;br/&gt;turning (called curvature) is very high. One part of the project &lt;br/&gt;is then to quantify this degree of turning, with the eventual goal &lt;br/&gt;of understanding what sorts of wrinkles can occur singly or in groups. &lt;br/&gt;Some of the problems in this project come up in physics, especially &lt;br/&gt;string theory, to which the the investigator and his collaborators &lt;br/&gt;intend to apply the methods they develop. The second part of the &lt;br/&gt;project concerns questions about abstract number systems, in particular &lt;br/&gt;whether a given (abstract) number is a perfect square, or the sum of &lt;br/&gt;two or more perfect squares. Such questions have been studied for &lt;br/&gt;centuries in the mathematical subfield called number theory. More &lt;br/&gt;recently, the intractability of the problem of finding certain &lt;br/&gt;perfect squares, even with a computer, has been shown by other &lt;br/&gt;investigators to be the basis of certain protocols which guarantee &lt;br/&gt;the secure and fair electronic exchange of information.</AbstractNarration>
