<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0072237&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  David E. Barrett&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Barrett will investigate various topics in complex&lt;br/&gt;analysis.  One topic to be studied is the behavior of two&lt;br/&gt;different systems of partial differential equations implementing&lt;br/&gt;deformation of a real hypersurface in two-dimensional complex&lt;br/&gt;euclidean space by the Levi-form of the hypersurface.  The&lt;br/&gt;systems are analogous, respectively, to harmonic-mapping heat&lt;br/&gt;flow and to the Ricci-flow on the space of conformal metrics, but&lt;br/&gt;these particular systems have special features (the role of&lt;br/&gt;Lorentzian geometry in the target space and the inclusion of&lt;br/&gt;lower-order terms which are not conjugation invariant in the&lt;br/&gt;source space) that introduce new phenomena and difficulties.  The&lt;br/&gt;associated steady-state system has known applications to function&lt;br/&gt;theory and engineering, and the study of the time-dependent&lt;br/&gt;versions given above may lead to new insights into analytic&lt;br/&gt;continuation.  A second topic to be studied is the boundary&lt;br/&gt;behavior of the Bergman kernel function (off the diagonal) and&lt;br/&gt;Bergman representative coordinates on domains with corners, with&lt;br/&gt;particular interest in the case of generic intersections of&lt;br/&gt;strictly pseudoconvex domains (the case of intersecting balls&lt;br/&gt;serving as a key model problem).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Barrett will investigate various problems involving&lt;br/&gt;multiple parameters (the parameters are understood to lie in the&lt;br/&gt;so-called complex number system, a widely-used extension of the&lt;br/&gt;standard number system).  One topic involves the study of systems&lt;br/&gt;of partial differential equations which serve to flatten a&lt;br/&gt;surface in the parameter space; sometimes the equations push the&lt;br/&gt;surface to an equilibrium configuration (the situation is&lt;br/&gt;somewhat analogous to that of a soap film attached to a fixed&lt;br/&gt;wire boundary), but sometimes the surface breaks before reaching&lt;br/&gt;equilibrium (for example, this will happen if there is no&lt;br/&gt;available equilibrium configuration).  The computation of&lt;br/&gt;equilibrium configurations for these problems (or the&lt;br/&gt;documentation that no equilibrium exists) is important in&lt;br/&gt;classical function theory, and is also a central topic in the&lt;br/&gt;engineering discipline known as "H-infinity control theory."  A&lt;br/&gt;second topic to be studied is based on Stefan Bergman's method of&lt;br/&gt;finding a sort of "ideal form" for a region in complex&lt;br/&gt;multiparameter space.  In the one-parameter setting Bergman's&lt;br/&gt;method tells us how to perform the useful task of smoothing out&lt;br/&gt;corners appearing in the boundary of the region (such smoothing&lt;br/&gt;is of fundamental importance for example in classical&lt;br/&gt;aerodynamics); the proposed research will examine what happens to&lt;br/&gt;corners in the multi-parameter setting.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
