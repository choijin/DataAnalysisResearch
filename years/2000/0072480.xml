    <AbstractNarration>Dear Jong-Shi:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I was very pleased to receive your email saying that you plan to recommend&lt;br/&gt;funding of my NSF proposal as a 36 month standard award of $150,710.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you requested, here is an abstract of the project. Please let me know&lt;br/&gt;if this is acceptable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Regards,&lt;br/&gt;Rick Falk&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract: Finite Element Approximation of Problems in Solid Mechanics&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The finite element approximation of mathematical models of thin plates and&lt;br/&gt;shells is studied. For the Reissner-Mindlin plate model, there are many&lt;br/&gt;proven "locking-free" methods (i.e., no accuracy loss for smaller thickness)&lt;br/&gt;using triangular and rectangular elements. It is proposed to analyze&lt;br/&gt;quadrilateral elements for this problem and study important but unresolved&lt;br/&gt;issues about these elements in more general contexts. In addition to the&lt;br/&gt;shear locking which causes problems in the approximation of plate models,&lt;br/&gt;shells also suffer from the problem of membrane locking. The goal is to&lt;br/&gt;improve on the shell elements so far proposed and provide a rigorous analysis&lt;br/&gt;of convergence. Variational methods used previously for the derivation and&lt;br/&gt;analysis of plate models will be extended to the derivation and analysis of&lt;br/&gt;shell models. Discontinuous Galerkin finite element methods are promising&lt;br/&gt;candidates for a robust approximation method for both convection-dominated and&lt;br/&gt;diffusion-dominated convection-diffusion problems. Further analysis is&lt;br/&gt;proposed to demonstrate their effectiveness more conclusively. Computational&lt;br/&gt;and analytical techniques are proposed to understand the predictions of 2-D&lt;br/&gt;mathematical models concerned with stress driven instability, expanding on&lt;br/&gt;previous grant work done on a simpler 1-D model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is concerned with the use of mathematical models to study&lt;br/&gt;several problems in solid mechanics. The use of mathematical models offers a&lt;br/&gt;cost-effective way to make quantitative predictions about how mechanical&lt;br/&gt;systems will change when external forces are applied and serves as an&lt;br/&gt;alternative to the use of costly or difficult experiments. Typically, when&lt;br/&gt;realistic mathematical models are formulated, they are in terms of equations&lt;br/&gt;whose solutions, which represent physical quantities of interest to engineers&lt;br/&gt;and scientists, are not able to be determined analytically, i.e., in a simple&lt;br/&gt;form one can easily write down. However, by employing numerical methods, good&lt;br/&gt;approximations to the physical quantities which are described by the&lt;br/&gt;mathematical models may still be found. Typically, high performance computing&lt;br/&gt;is needed to do the large number of calculations involved. This project is&lt;br/&gt;concerned with the design and analysis of numerical approximation schemes for&lt;br/&gt;a number of important mathematical models used in mechanics. These include&lt;br/&gt;models of elastic plates and shells (used for example to design the roof of a&lt;br/&gt;building to avoid collapse) and models of nano-scale solid crystals (which&lt;br/&gt;can be used to study instabilities in certain materials).</AbstractNarration>
