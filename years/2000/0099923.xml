    <AbstractNarration>This proposal is for research into three areas of current interest in&lt;br/&gt;noncommutative algebra. First the PI plans to study the enveloping&lt;br/&gt;algebra of a classical simple Lie superalgebra. Specifically he is&lt;br/&gt;interested in primitive ideals and problems concerning the center of the&lt;br/&gt;enveloping algebra. Secondly the PI intends to investigate differential&lt;br/&gt;operators on toric varieties and maps between toric varieties arising from&lt;br/&gt;refinements of fans. Finally the PI proposes the study of certain finite&lt;br/&gt;dimensional Hopf algebras arising from quantized enveloping algebras of&lt;br/&gt;classical Lie superalgebras. The methods to be used come from&lt;br/&gt;representation theory and algebraic geometry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is concerned with some particular aspects of modern&lt;br/&gt;abstract algebra, as an area of mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;In recent years a number of algebraic constructions have been increasingly&lt;br/&gt;important in Physics. These include Lie superalgebras and quantum groups,&lt;br/&gt;two constructions which will be investigated in this proposal. It is a&lt;br/&gt;widely held belief that a better understanding of the algebraic structure&lt;br/&gt;of these objects could lead to further significant advances in Physics.</AbstractNarration>
