    <AbstractNarration>This award provides funds for renewed support of an REU Site in archaeology conducted by CUNY City College along with Columbia University and the New York Historical Society. The project consists of the archaeological study of Seneca Village, a 19th-century African-American and Irish immigrant community located in Central Park in New York City. The project is made up of four parts. The first includes working with a geophysicist and remote sensing equipment to ascertain whether or not archaeological remains of the village survive intact in the ground. The second part involves historical research aimed at identifying the various buildings that made up the village and the various people who lived and worked in them as well as the locations and extent of the Village's three cemeteries. The third part involves integrating both the historical and geophysical data into a GIS format. Finally, each student will create a research design for planning archaeological excavations to address a research question related to this 19th-century multi-cultural community. The project will involve eight undergraduate students per year who will focus on different portions of the village and different historical records for the eight week program. Students will be selected from the colleges that belong to the New York City Archaeological Consortium, i.e., the colleges and community colleges of the City University, and the colleges of Columbia and New York Universities. &lt;br/&gt;This award contributes to the Foundation's continuing efforts to attract talented students into careers in science through active undergraduate research experiences.</AbstractNarration>
