<AbstractNarration>     The principal investigator will apply tools from arithmetic &lt;br/&gt;geometry to study invariants attached to the actions of finite &lt;br/&gt;groups on schemes.   These invariants are Euler characteristics&lt;br/&gt;associated to different kinds of cohomology.  Methods&lt;br/&gt;of computing these Euler characteristics will be studied,&lt;br/&gt;along with their connection to L-series,  Arakelov theory&lt;br/&gt;and the theory of motives.   The principal investigator&lt;br/&gt;will also work on two other projects.  These are to&lt;br/&gt;complete earlier research relating capacity theory&lt;br/&gt;to arithmetic intersections theory, and to study&lt;br/&gt;the universal deformation rings of representations&lt;br/&gt;of finite groups and their applications to Galois theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    This proposal concerns using geometric ideas to study&lt;br/&gt;the solutions of systems of algebraic equations.  In geometry,&lt;br/&gt;it is often useful to consider the symmetries of an object,&lt;br/&gt;which are the ways the object can be rotated or flipped&lt;br/&gt;back onto itself.  Another geometric idea, which goes back&lt;br/&gt;to the mathematician Euler, is that one can attach certain&lt;br/&gt;numbers ("Euler characteristics") to objects.  These&lt;br/&gt;numbers provide a measure of complexity, and in simple&lt;br/&gt;cases they count various natural features, such&lt;br/&gt;as the number of holes in the object.  The current proposal&lt;br/&gt;has to do with studying the symmetries of systems&lt;br/&gt;of equations, and how one can assign natural Euler characteristic&lt;br/&gt;numbers to them.  The goal of this is to carry over to algebra&lt;br/&gt;some of the insights gained in geometry from considering&lt;br/&gt;symmetries and Euler characteristics.  Systems of equations&lt;br/&gt;arise from many different mathematical applications.&lt;br/&gt;Euler numbers and symmetries can in many cases be used&lt;br/&gt;to either rule out or count the number of particular&lt;br/&gt;kinds of solutions to such equations.</AbstractNarration>
