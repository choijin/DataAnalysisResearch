<AbstractNarration>Proposal:  DMS-0071454&lt;br/&gt;PI: Wojciech Chacholski&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is concerned with the study of  the localization process and&lt;br/&gt;its dual, the  colocalization process, in homotopy theory. One of the &lt;br/&gt;goals is to develop tools to analyze  the colocalization functors analogous     &lt;br/&gt;to those developed by  Bousfield and Kan to study  completion and&lt;br/&gt;localization. Another aspect of the project is to find geometric applications &lt;br/&gt;and interpretations of results on  localization. This is related to&lt;br/&gt;certain geometric relations between spaces. The key idea is to use a fixed&lt;br/&gt;space as a basic building block and  use  operations like push-outs and&lt;br/&gt;wedges to construct more complicated spaces (in a similar way as spheres&lt;br/&gt;are used to build CW-complexes). For this purpose the P.I. has been&lt;br/&gt;working on understanding an invariant called complication. It roughly&lt;br/&gt;gives the minimal number of steps needed  to build a new space out of a&lt;br/&gt;given one. There is a close relation between this invariant and the so&lt;br/&gt;called Bousfield lattice, the lattice of the localization functors on&lt;br/&gt;spaces. Understanding this relation has been one of the purposes  of the&lt;br/&gt;P.I.'s work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Homotopy theory can be perceived as a study of the localization process.&lt;br/&gt;The idea is to ignore information which is of less interest to us.&lt;br/&gt;In this way homotopy theory works as a simplifying tool. For example,&lt;br/&gt;in order to simplify spaces, we can think about the unit interval as the&lt;br/&gt;point. In this way we ignore all the consequences caused by the difference&lt;br/&gt;between these two spaces. By doing so we identify for example the &lt;br/&gt;letter A and the letter O. This gives  the standard homotopy theory.&lt;br/&gt;The P.I.'s research has been about understanding what happens if we treat&lt;br/&gt;other spaces  as points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
