<AbstractNarration>Biological Sciences (61) This project is strengthening the basic science curriculum through use of computerized work stations in the laboratory component of Experimental Neurobiology. Experimental Neurobiology is structured around the laboratory component, and provides a heavily investigative approach. Students learn modern neurobiology techniques including: intracellular recording, extracellular recording, action potential discrimination, neuronal tract tracing, and neuron staining and imaging. These techniques are learned using model invertebrate preparations that allow novice students to successfully record from nervous systems and perform experiments in a three-hour period each week. Many laboratory sessions are adaptations of investigations from the NSF-funded Project Crawdad, and we are developing several new activities based on other invertebrates. Each student designs and carries out an independent four-week investigation culminating in an oral presentation and a web page illustrating their findings. The work stations are also benefiting the laboratory activities in five other physiology/cell biology courses. Also, this equipment is greatly expanding opportunities for undergraduates to gain an independent research experience in neuroscience. Finally, the equipment is also allowing us to integrate a neuroscience laboratory experience in two science education courses required for pre-service teachers.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
