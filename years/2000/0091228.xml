<AbstractNarration>Singel&lt;br/&gt;MCB 0091228&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The discovery by Furchgott of an endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) and its&lt;br/&gt;subsequent identification with NO raise an intriguing problem: in regulating vascular tension&lt;br/&gt;and blood flow, how does NO avoid being hoarded or destroyed by well-known reactions with&lt;br/&gt;hemoglobin (Hb) to form Hb-heme-iron(II) nitrosyl complexes or nitrate? The recent&lt;br/&gt;discovery, by Stamler and co-workers, of an S-nitrosylated derivative of hemoglobin (SNO-Hb)&lt;br/&gt;in vivo, and the ongoing elucidation of its biological activities, suggest a means to&lt;br/&gt;evade both such fates. Evidently, the previously unsuspected NO/Hb reaction channel - S-nitrosylation&lt;br/&gt;- can effectively compete with the Hb-Fe(II)-NO and nitrate forming reactions.&lt;br/&gt;Moreover, these studies suggest a dynamical cycle in which the NO-group is alternatively largely&lt;br/&gt;sequestered (Hb-Fe(II)-NO) or made available for delivery (Hb-SNO), in response to the cyclic&lt;br/&gt;variation in oxygen tension during the arterial/venous transit. The implicated iron-to-sulfur NO-group&lt;br/&gt;transfer chemistry appears to be linked to the cooperative oxygen delivery function of&lt;br/&gt;Hb. The broad aim of this project is to generate experimental results that test these ideas, and&lt;br/&gt;provide critical observations for further development of the model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A direct competition (competitive kinetics) method recently introduced by Gow et al.&lt;br/&gt;will be utilized to characterize the relative rates of the reactions that occur upon exposure of&lt;br/&gt;oxygenated Hb to NO and its congeners. The experiments are designed to detect the dependence&lt;br/&gt;of the relative kinetic behavior on the oxygen-saturation of Hb, and to probe the link between&lt;br/&gt;this behavior and the allosteric state of Hb. The reaction competition is assessed by detection of&lt;br/&gt;the heme-iron(II) nitrosyl-Hb, SNO-Hb, Fe(III)-metHb, and nitrate products through EPR&lt;br/&gt;(electron paramagnetic resonance) spectroscopy, UV/VIS spectroscopy, and chemiluminescence&lt;br/&gt;techniques. The chemical behavior will be characterized over a range of conditions -temperature,&lt;br/&gt;pH, CO2 tension, organic phosphate concentration - that: 1) focus on the standard&lt;br/&gt;physiological conditions relevant to testing the biological significance of the NO/Hb chemical&lt;br/&gt;pathways; but also 2) embrace non-physiological conditions that have assumed a standard role in&lt;br/&gt;studies of Hb allostery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Experiments designed to demonstrate that iron(II)-nitrosyl complexes in Hb can serve as&lt;br/&gt;a labile, accessible reservoir, rather than a sink of NO-groups (alpha-heme-iron(II) nitrosyls) will&lt;br/&gt;also be undertaken. EPR and chemiluminescence methods will be utilized to monitor the&lt;br/&gt;migration of the NO-group during variation of hemoglobin ligation state (oxy, deoxy, met). This&lt;br/&gt;reactive behavior will also be studied under conditions of physiological significance and under&lt;br/&gt;conditions known to affect the allosteric behavior of Hb.</AbstractNarration>
