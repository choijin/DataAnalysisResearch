    <AbstractNarration>EEC-0001880&lt;br/&gt;Arizona State University&lt;br/&gt;Heydt&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is proposed to bring the Arizona State University portion of the Center for the Advanced Control of Energy and Power Systems (ACEPS) into the Power Systems Engineering Research Center (Pserc). Both these efforts focus on research in electric power engineering. The ASU portion of ACEPS will bring expertise to Pserc in the areas of electric power quality, high voltage engineering, and power electronics. These areas are believed to beneficially supplement the existing Pserc power engineering efforts. Additionally, ASU-ACEPS will bring expertise in power system instrumentation and control, and power system analysis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The combined center is expected to be one of the largest power engineering efforts in the world, focusing on questions of power systems, deregulation of the power industry, power quality, transmission and distribution , and the efficient use of power infrastructure. An educational component of the program is proposed in the form of graduate and undergraduate student training and research and bringing advanced concepts in power engineering into the undergraduate classroom</AbstractNarration>
