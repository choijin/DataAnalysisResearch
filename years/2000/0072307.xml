<AbstractNarration>The investigators study asymptotic and algorithmic properties of groups. The area of research includes Dehn functions and relative Dehn functions of groups, the complexity of algorithmic problems of groups, Burnside problems for groups.  Many papers published during the last forty years showed deep connection between asymptotic invariants of groups and topology, geometry, amenability, dynamical systems, etc.  Quite&lt;br/&gt;recently, the proposers (jointly with Rips and Birget) discovered a close&lt;br/&gt;relationship between the asymptotics of isoperimetric functions, on the one&lt;br/&gt;hand, and the complexity of the word problem for groups, on the other hand.&lt;br/&gt;The investigators are developing their method, combining geometric and&lt;br/&gt;computational approaches. One of their goals is to obtain the solution&lt;br/&gt;of other algorithmic problems using geometric group theory. In particular&lt;br/&gt;the investigators believe they will be able to prove that every recursively presented&lt;br/&gt;finitely generated group can be embedded into a finitely presented group&lt;br/&gt;with the same degree of unsolvability of the conjugacy problem. This would&lt;br/&gt;solve a problem formulated by Collins in 1976.&lt;br/&gt;The computational-geometric methods of the investigators also show promise of being able to be fruitfully applied to the  Burnside-type  problems.&lt;br/&gt;The investigators are close to constructing non-amenable finitely presented&lt;br/&gt;groups having no non-cyclic free subgroups. This will solve the&lt;br/&gt;corresponding well-known problem which goes back to von Neumann's 1929&lt;br/&gt;paper. Since the group in question is a finitely presented extension of a&lt;br/&gt;torsion group of finite exponent by a cyclic group, this example will be&lt;br/&gt;a breakthrough in the search for a finitely presented torsion&lt;br/&gt;group (one of the main open problem in the theory of infinite groups).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    It is a well known point of view after Klein, Hilbert, Einstein and Weil&lt;br/&gt;that fundamental laws describe symmetries occurring in the nature. The&lt;br/&gt;symmetry of an object can be measured by the group corresponding to the&lt;br/&gt;object. Groups can be defined as groups of symmetries or abstractly by an&lt;br/&gt;algorithmic description (generators and relations). In the second approach,&lt;br/&gt;the investigators choose some basic symmetries (generators) so that all other symmetries&lt;br/&gt;are compositions (words) of the basic symmetries, and describe certain&lt;br/&gt;relations between the basic symmetries such that all other relations follow&lt;br/&gt;from the chosen relations. One of the main problems about a group given by&lt;br/&gt;generators and relations and relations is the word problem: when are two&lt;br/&gt;compositions of generators the same?  In some exotic cases this problem can&lt;br/&gt;be undecidable, that is there are groups for which there are no automatic&lt;br/&gt;procedures to recognize if two words of generators are equal. but even&lt;br/&gt;in cases when this problem is decidable, the automatic procedure can be very&lt;br/&gt;complicated.  In recent years the investigators discovered a deep&lt;br/&gt;relationship between the word problem of a group and the global geometry of&lt;br/&gt;the group. The geometry of a group is described in terms of certain&lt;br/&gt;asymptotic invariants. The invariants have been known since the pioneering&lt;br/&gt;works of M. Dehn at the beginning of the 20th century but the investigators&lt;br/&gt;discovered deep relationship between these invariants and algorithmic&lt;br/&gt;problems. The investigators are developing their geometric method solving&lt;br/&gt;old mathematical problems of algorithmic nature and corresponding algebraic problems about groups.</AbstractNarration>
