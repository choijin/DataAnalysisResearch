<AbstractNarration>Program Objectives&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Albert Einstein Distinguished Educator Fellowship Program is designed to provide outstanding elementary and secondary mathematics and science teachers the opportunity to bring to Congress and appropriate branches of the federal government the insights, extensive knowledge, and practical experience of classroom teachers.  As Fellows, teachers can help to increase the understanding, communication, and cooperation between Congress and Federal agencies, and the mathematics and science education community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Process&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ms. Kerry Venegas, a teacher in the Gallup-McKinley County School District was initially identified by the The Albert Einstein Distinguished Educator Fellowship Program and was subsequently interviewed at the National Science Foundation based on her interest and related experience to the work of the Division of Educational System Reform. The ESR Acting Division Director and two Program Directors interviewed the applicant. They unanimously agreed that it would be mutually beneficial to allow a Fellowship candidate to work with the Rural Systemic Initiative program.  The incumbent will have an opportunity to work with program directors to guide the overall RSI program and assist in the assessment of ongoing projects and provide recommendations to strengthen the projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
