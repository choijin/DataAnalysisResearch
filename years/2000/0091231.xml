    <AbstractNarration>DNA damage repair is essential for the maintenance of genetic integrity in all organisms. Unrepaired or imprecisely repaired DNA can lead to DNA alterations, cell death, or transformation of cells. DNA damage specifically in the form of chromosomal breaks can occur both from treatment of cells with DNA damaging agents, as well as from normal metabolic processes such as DNA replication. &lt;br/&gt;Mammalian cells were initially thought to repair DSBs almost exclusively by a process in which the broken ends are joined using little or no sequence homology, i.e., by a process that does not recognize if the DNA sequence at the ends are highly related to each other. However, recent studies have demonstrated that repair of chromosome breaks occurs frequently also by homologous recombination. In this process, an identical or nearly identical DNA molecule provides the sequence information for the repair of the broken DNA molecule. &lt;br/&gt; Experiments that examin the repair of chromosome breaks in mouse cells in which two different chromosomes were involved has begun. Repair events involving two chromosomes have the potential to cause genomic rearrangements, including translocations. This project is aimed at understanding break repair in terms of the role of different repair mechanisms in maintaining genomic stability.</AbstractNarration>
