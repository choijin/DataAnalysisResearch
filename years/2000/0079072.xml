<AbstractNarration>This award to Professor James Canary of New York University is supported by the Advanced Materials and Processing Program in the Chemistry Division. With this award, copper coordination complexes and their derivatives with electrochemical and chiral properties will be studied as molecule-based switches. Synthesis of electrochemical chiral materials and determination of optical properties of these materials after one-electron oxidation and reductions are parts of this award.   One outcome of these studies will be development of molecular switches in place of molecular assemblies as in liquid crystals.  Molecular switches will make the electronic devices very efficient, lightweight and compact.  In addition, the research program will have substantial impact on undergraduate training and education of students in Materials Chemistry in general and electrochemical chiral materials in particular.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Under this award, electrochemical chiral materials will be synthesized and their optical properties determined after one-electron oxidation and reductions.  Molecular switches developed from the electrochemical chiral materials if incorporated in electronic devices such as computers will make them efficient, lightweight and compact.  Undergraduate and graduate training programs under the award will enhance the overall standard of the Material Chemistry Program and will provide future scientists and engineers in this field.</AbstractNarration>
