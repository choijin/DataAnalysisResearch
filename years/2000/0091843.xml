<AbstractNarration>The goal of this research project is to investigate human motor skills and their representation in a spatio-temporal database management system. The challenges involved are multi-faceted. First, the captured data is continuous media and must be rendered in a timely manner in order to simulate a movement. If a system delivers the data at a slower rate than its pre-specified rate without special precautions (e.g., prefetching), the user might observe logical errors that result in undesirable behavior, e.g., with chop-sticks, either one or both sticks might fall out of place. Second, the movement of a limb -- say a hand -- when performing the same activity is slightly different across multiple repetitions of that activity. The approach to the first challenge is to explore design and implementation of real-time spatio-temporal database management systems that represent an activity as a multi-level presentation. The approach to the second problem is to investigate "Envelope of Limits" (EoL) to capture the essence of a movement. In addition, this research strives to develop a framework that detects spatio-temporal patterns that represent hypotheses about the physical constraints that govern movements. The results of this project will advance real-time spatio-temporal databases in support of haptic devices. This is a high-risk research, because it spans multiple fields, with a potential to emerge as a new discipline. If successful, a high payoff can be expected, as the results will have an impact on applications in broad areas such as health-care, education, and entertainment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
