<AbstractNarration>Washington MESA is a statewide partnership of school districts, families and alumni, community organizations, higher education, industry, business, and government.  In 1982, MESA served 88 students in four schools; today it serves over 3,000 traditionally underrepresented students in 71 schools and 17 school districts across the state.  MESA promotes academic achievement by increasing students' interest in science, mathematics, and engineering (SME); expanding students' career options to include SME fields; and, by developing students' habits of high expectations and success.  Services provided by MESA include tutoring, mentoring, summer technical camps, internships, and after-school enrichment for students, parents and teachers. Ninety-four percent of the 374 MESA students that were seniors in 1999 enrolled in postsecondary institutions. Sixty-eight percent of these students are pursing degrees in SME fields.</AbstractNarration>
