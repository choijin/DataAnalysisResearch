<AbstractNarration>This experimental and computational research program continues the investigation of Rydberg atoms and molecules in electric fields using the technique of recurrence spectroscopy.  Quantum mechanical atomic wavefunctions do not provide the means to easily visualize the dynamics of an atom, whereas recurrence spectroscopy, combined with semiclassical theory, provides a physical understanding of the motion of the Rydberg electron through its classical orbits.   Recurrence spectroscopy will be used to investigate recurrences above the classical ionization threshold as well as recurrences resulting from higher excited initial states and recurrences of higher angular momentum states.  These studies will be undertaken on helium, complex atoms, and simple molecules.  A strong interaction between experimentalists and theorists is a hallmark of the program.</AbstractNarration>
