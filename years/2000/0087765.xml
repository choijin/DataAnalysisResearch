<AbstractNarration>     The use of multi-beam antenna arrays for transmission and reception allows wireless units to send and&lt;br/&gt;receive tens of beams in different directions and using multiple frequency bands. If we deploy a large number&lt;br/&gt;of such multi-beam wireless units over a large area, we obtain a highly connected and high capacity wireless&lt;br/&gt;network. We call this the All Wireless Network (AWN).&lt;br/&gt;     Analogous to Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) in All Optical Networks (AON), we&lt;br/&gt;propose an analogous Frequency Division (FD) and Space Division (SD) technique for All Wireless&lt;br/&gt;Networks (AWN). Unlike point-to-point connectivity of an AON, we argue that massively parallel number of&lt;br/&gt;beams with flexibly assigned direction and frequency from wireless multi-beam units can provide unlimited&lt;br/&gt;connectivity and bandwidth. We rely on spatial parallelism to achieve an extremely high network throughput.&lt;br/&gt;     An AWN can be arranged as a spatially distributed multi-stage circuit switch or a fully connected ring,&lt;br/&gt;allowing multi-rate and multi-cast capability of a parallel and spatially distributed switch fabric. A single&lt;br/&gt;multi-beam wireless unit can receive from multiple beams to achieve a Gigabit per second throughput for an&lt;br/&gt;application. The wireless unit can also serve as relay nodes to switch incoming beams of given direction and&lt;br/&gt;frequency through a switch fabric onto outgoing beams of different direction and frequency. This is analogous&lt;br/&gt;to all optical switching for DWDM in an AON, except we have an added dimension of free and continuous&lt;br/&gt;spatial connectivity, rather than fiber-to-fiber connectivity.&lt;br/&gt;     We shall devise switching and routing theory and techniques for SD/FD circuit switching over AWN,&lt;br/&gt;taking into account co-channel and adjacent channel interference and various fading factors. We formulate&lt;br/&gt;metric for routing that accounts for power consumption, distance covered, and externality induced to other&lt;br/&gt;routes. We study social optimality versus individual optimality for such routing techniques.&lt;br/&gt;     Using the OPNET software package, we shall implement a simulation of the AWN. The transmitted&lt;br/&gt;radiation pattern is modeled for each wireless multi-beam unit. We distribute many such units over an area,&lt;br/&gt;either randomly or using various wireless interconnection network topologies. Propagation barriers are also&lt;br/&gt;modeled. The graphical simulation provides estimation of power and interference level. Various power control&lt;br/&gt;and routing protocols will be tested using the simulation software.&lt;br/&gt;     Theoretical and simulation results will be used to design an Internet Circuit (IC) Router. Routing and&lt;br/&gt;switching algorithms will be made distributed with a multiple -path connection set-up using a link state routing table, or using source initiated connection requests. We plan to implement a simple IC Router for the&lt;br/&gt;internetworking of wireless multi-beam units for concept demonstration.&lt;br/&gt;     We believe that the proposed AWN architecture shall be low cost, high performance, and highly flexible&lt;br/&gt;for traffic pattern and link/node impairments. The high throughput of the AWN will allow high quality&lt;br/&gt;multimedia applications to be delivered on-demand entirely by wireless communications.</AbstractNarration>
