<AbstractNarration>0078311&lt;br/&gt;Bothwell&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is currently believed that biologically active polypeptides, such as&lt;br/&gt;peptide hormones and growth factors, may be secreted by two alternative&lt;br/&gt;processes - an unregulatory secretory pathway and a regulated pathway, and&lt;br/&gt;it is thought that all polypeptides share the same regulated secretory&lt;br/&gt;mechanism.  For cells that display regulated secretion of several different&lt;br/&gt;peptide hormones and growth factors, this model predicts that cells cannot&lt;br/&gt;regulate release of these polypeptides independently.  Preliminary results&lt;br/&gt;indicate, however, that there must exist at least two distinct pathways for&lt;br/&gt;secretion of biologically active polypeptides, potentially allowing cells to&lt;br/&gt;independently control the release of hormones and growth factors that have&lt;br/&gt;different functions.  The novel pathway is revealed by studies of the&lt;br/&gt;secretion of the neurotrophic factor, BDNF.  Regulated secretion of BDNF by&lt;br/&gt;brain nerve cells is of profound importance, because BDNF participates as an&lt;br/&gt;important regulator of synaptic transmission in the context of memory and&lt;br/&gt;learning. The general goal of this proposal is to examine the mechanisms&lt;br/&gt;regulating secretion of BDNF in pituitary cells (which serve as a convenient&lt;br/&gt;model system for study of regulated secretion) and in nerve cells from the&lt;br/&gt;hippocampal and cortical regions of the brain.   Secretion of BDNF will be&lt;br/&gt;compared to secretion of structurally related neurotrophic factors, NGF and&lt;br/&gt;NT-3.  Also secretion of BDNF will be compared to secretion of&lt;br/&gt;neuropeptides, such as ACTH and NPY.  Some experiments will directly monitor&lt;br/&gt;the release of these polypeptides, from cultured cells, using immunoassays.&lt;br/&gt;Other experiments will compare the distribution of these polypeptides in&lt;br/&gt;secretory vesicles within the cell, by immunohistochemical techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These studies may have broad importance for understanding hormone action in&lt;br/&gt;the endocrine system, and for understanding nerve cell communication in the&lt;br/&gt;brain.  The orderly function of all tissues of the body is dependent on&lt;br/&gt;communication between cells.  A major method of cell-cell communication&lt;br/&gt;involves secretion of specific polypeptides, which act as messenger&lt;br/&gt;molecules.  The release of these polypeptides, which may be called peptide&lt;br/&gt;hormones, neuropeptides, or growth factors, must be carefully controlled.&lt;br/&gt;This project explores the possibility that cells can control release of&lt;br/&gt;these polypeptides much more cleverly than was realized previously.&lt;br/&gt;Thoroughly characterizing these controlled release mechanisms is essential&lt;br/&gt;for a basic understanding of biological processes ranging from hormone&lt;br/&gt;action to memory and learning.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
