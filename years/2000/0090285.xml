    <AbstractNarration>0090285&lt;br/&gt;Mailloux&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2001 IEEE AP-S/URSI Symposium on Antennas and Propagation, co-sponsored by the IEEE Antenna and Propagation Society and URSI, will be held from 8 to 13 July 2001 in Boston, MA, USA. The purpose of this conference is to provide an opportunity for the exchange of ideas between academia and industry. This purpose will be accomplished in two ways: by providing a firsthand look at the latest developments in the antenna industry and by providing a forum to discuss up-to-date problems and solutions in antennas and propagation in general.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will feature oral presentations, poster sessions, exhibits, and workshops. Approximately 1200 papers are expected to be presented. The exhibits will be provided by 20 companies focused strictly on antennas and propagation. Six to seven workshops and nine special sessions are currently planned. The intention of the conference is to provide an international forum for the discussion of all aspects of antennas and propagation including novel antennas, propagation modeling and applications. Topics to be considered will include (but are not limited to) the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;.Adaptive, Active, Signal Processing &amp; Imaging Antenna&lt;br/&gt;.Biomedical Applications&lt;br/&gt;.Broadband and Multifrequency Antennas &lt;br/&gt;.Mobile and PCS Antennas&lt;br/&gt;.Electromagnetic Education&lt;br/&gt;.Application of Photonics in Antennas Systems &lt;br/&gt;.Microstrip Antennas&lt;br/&gt;.Phased Array Antennas&lt;br/&gt;.Numerical Methods for Analysis of Antennas&lt;br/&gt;.Propagation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, the following Commissions of the URSI will have sessions at the conference:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;.Commission A Electromagnetic Metrology&lt;br/&gt;.Commission B Fields and Waves&lt;br/&gt;.Commission D Electronics and Photonics&lt;br/&gt;.Commission F Wave Propagation and Remote Sensing&lt;br/&gt;.Commission G Ionospheric Radio Propagation&lt;br/&gt;.Commission H Waves in Plasmas&lt;br/&gt;.Commission K Electromagnetics in Biology and Medicine</AbstractNarration>
