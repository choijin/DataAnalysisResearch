<AbstractNarration>Chemistry (12) The contributions that chemical laboratory technicians make in modern &lt;br/&gt;workplaces cannot be overstated. They have a unique ability to make sense of subtle differences in the appearance of materials and the behavior of techniques and instruments. The challenge for chemical technology educators is to provide students with meaningful experiences that prepare them for these responsibilities. In 1998, the NSF awarded a grant to our institute to develop a model for a contextually-driven, laboratory-based curriculum in chemical technology. Three modules are being fully developed: the chemistry of aqueous systems, the chemistry of terrestrial systems, and the chemistry of polymer systems. A fourth module, the synthesis of modern drug release systems, is being outlined as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project team is preparing to launch its final stage of development and alpha testing based upon promising feedback from students and faculty. This renewal proposal captures this momentum by: (1) fully developing and testing module 4, the synthesis of modern drug release systems; (2) developing two advanced-level modules focused on petroleum refining and computer-based data analysis; (3) beta testing modules 1,2,and 3; and (4) engaging in strategic dissemination. The previously assembled team (materials developer, project manager and Principal Investigator are continuing and a new partner (leading the beta testing) has been added. Both alpha and beta testing of the various modules developed are continuing. Beta testing is being carried out in a Chemical Technology program at a trade technical college. This activity is providing feedback as to the effectiveness of the modules. As a result of this renewal, the contextually-based, laboratory-driven curriculum will be completed. Discussions with commercial publishers have begun, ensuring that the curriculum will be disseminated and revised on an ongoing basis.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
