<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;The project will expand the work of a teacher-researcher collaboration in the area of early literacy development, particularly early identification of and intervention for children at-risk for reading failure. The objectives of this work are threefold: (a) refine and pilot test the efficacy of a comprehensive literacy assessment and accompanying interventions to be used with at-risk children in kindergarten and first grade in preparation for a future large-scale efficacy study, (b) use the software tools developed by TIMSS Video-R project and LessonLab to create a digital video library of illustrations of literacy assessments and interventions, and to document changes in instructional practices in the classroom as a result of implementing the literacy assessment and intervention, and (c) using information from the pilot efficacy study and the digital library, begin to develop a model program for literacy assessment and intervention to be used in teacher professional development. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pilot efficacy study involves two treatment  conditions and one no-treatment comparison  condition. One of the treatment groups uses the assessment and interventions with full support from the project team for formative evaluation purposes, a second is supported only by the web-based (digitized  materials to examine the assessment s use under anticipated future implementation  conditions. If successful, this study will show that it is possible to affect change in reading out comes for at-risk  children by providing teachers with assessment tools and intervention  choices focused on early literacy development. Results of the study will aid in the design and implementation of the large-scale efficacy study and the development of a model program for early identification and intervention that  can be disseminated electronically.</AbstractNarration>
