<AbstractNarration>Mesoscale is a term intended to convey an intermediate level description of&lt;br/&gt;a physical system.  Its function is to capture the interactions of the&lt;br/&gt;system at finer scales with interactions or influences from larger coarser&lt;br/&gt;scales, and the mesoscale level itself.  Such systems, active across&lt;br/&gt;disparate length and time scales, are inherently metastable.  This feature&lt;br/&gt;is often revealed by hysteretic behavior or by a reluctance to evolve&lt;br/&gt;quickly to equilibrium.  The focus in this proposal is on several&lt;br/&gt;prototypes of these systems that occur in materials sceince.  One is &lt;br/&gt;the role of interfaces, or grain boundaries, in determining or limiting the &lt;br/&gt;behavior of polycrystalline materials. The energy and mobility of grain &lt;br/&gt;boundaries depends on crystallography and geometry, according to &lt;br/&gt;established thermodynamic principles.  Innovative new ways to determine &lt;br/&gt;these functions explicitly for important materials are the objective of the &lt;br/&gt;Mesoscale Interface Mapping Project.  This involves developing automated &lt;br/&gt;microscopy to harvest large amounts of data from samples and then &lt;br/&gt;formulating and solving a complex inverse problem.  One way to approach &lt;br/&gt;determination of mobility consists in the development of large scale &lt;br/&gt;simulations of grain boundary evolution.  The second focus is the &lt;br/&gt;coarse grained descriptions of mesoscale systems, the functional analytic &lt;br/&gt;limit processes in the microstructure of solids or the averaging to distribution &lt;br/&gt;functions in systems with stochastic behavior. The new methods allow &lt;br/&gt;study of situations where kinetics arise directly in terms of thermodynamic &lt;br/&gt;state functions and naturally carry with them an appropriate topology.  &lt;br/&gt;The issue of metastability has been under investigation in this context.  &lt;br/&gt;There is now the opportunity to improve understanding, for example, &lt;br/&gt;of microstructural evolution in shape-memory materials and diffusion &lt;br/&gt;mediated transport in certain liquid crystal systems and in protein motors.  &lt;br/&gt;This will include diagnostics for these systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The challenge of the mesoscale in materials science is to understand how &lt;br/&gt;it constrains finer scale systems (at the molecular scale) and determines &lt;br/&gt;larger scale systems (at the scale of entire devices).  This is accomplished&lt;br/&gt;through coarse graining procedures.  For example, many technologically&lt;br/&gt;useful materials are polycrystalline, or granular, in nature.  The aluminum&lt;br/&gt;skin of an aircraft and the copper or copper-aluminum interconnects in&lt;br/&gt;computer chips are but two examples at vastly different size scales of such&lt;br/&gt;granular materials.  It is widely understood that many aspects of these&lt;br/&gt;materials depend on the interfaces they contain, or their grain boundaries.&lt;br/&gt;Properties of grain boundaries determine the reliability as well as the &lt;br/&gt;mechanical strength. This project will exploit the exciting opportunities and &lt;br/&gt;challenges for mathematical science in this field and beyond.  Specifically, &lt;br/&gt;coarse graining methods will be developed in order to better understand &lt;br/&gt;phenomena that occur in protein motors and in liquid crystals.  A related &lt;br/&gt;problem of coarse graining arises when information is to be extracted from &lt;br/&gt;the immense amounts of data that can be produced with simulations of&lt;br/&gt;complex systems, such as polycrystalline materials. This problem of coarse &lt;br/&gt;graining at an information scale rather than a physical scale will also be addressed &lt;br/&gt;in this project.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
