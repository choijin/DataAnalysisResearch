<AbstractNarration>The main objective of this proposal is to investigate processes &lt;br/&gt;fundamental to the behavior of multicomponent fluids and&lt;br/&gt;multiphase materials. We will do this by (1) developing and applying &lt;br/&gt;state-of-the-art numerical methods to large scale computation and (2)&lt;br/&gt;analytical, numerical and modelling studies of important constituent &lt;br/&gt;processes. More specifically, our focus will be on developing, &lt;br/&gt;implementing and analyzing  successively more realistic models of the&lt;br/&gt; diffusional evolution  of microstructure in solid/solid phase transitions. &lt;br/&gt;Our investigation of multiphase fluids includes a study of ternary fluid &lt;br/&gt;flow where only two of the components are immiscible. These projects &lt;br/&gt;involve fundamental physical processes whose phenomenology is basic to &lt;br/&gt;understanding the behavior of real fluids and the material properties of &lt;br/&gt;solids. Both are characterized by the presence of multiple constitutive &lt;br/&gt;components, complex pattern formation and/or singularities (i.e. spatial &lt;br/&gt;complexity). Although these processes arise in very different physical &lt;br/&gt;phenomena (fluids versus solids), both involve free boundary problems&lt;br/&gt;where the motion of a bounding interface, separating the different &lt;br/&gt;components, is driven by a competition between surface energy and either &lt;br/&gt;an instability or multi-body interactions. As such, they can be treated &lt;br/&gt;using a common set of analytical and computational tools. The highly &lt;br/&gt;nonlinear nature of these problems makes fast, accurate and robust &lt;br/&gt;numerical methods essential to their study.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this proposal, we bring together mathematical and numerical&lt;br/&gt;analysis, modelling, and large-scale scientific computation to study&lt;br/&gt;certain fundamental problems in fluid dynamics and materials&lt;br/&gt;science.  Our focus will be on developing, implementing and analyzing&lt;br/&gt;successively more realistic models of the diffusional evolution  of &lt;br/&gt;microstructure in solid/solid phase transitions.  These transformations&lt;br/&gt;are an important method of processing multicomponent metallic alloys such&lt;br/&gt;such as steels. The result of this process is the formation of a multiphase&lt;br/&gt;microstructure, which is a key variable in setting the macroscopic&lt;br/&gt;mechanical properties (i.e. stiffness, strength and toughness) of the&lt;br/&gt;alloy. The microstructure is characterized by regions of different metallic &lt;br/&gt;components separated from one another by interfaces. The goal of our &lt;br/&gt;research is to accurately model and simulate the formation of microstructure &lt;br/&gt;in alloys in order to provide metallurgists with a recipe for generating new &lt;br/&gt;alloys with desirable material properties. Our investigation of multiphase &lt;br/&gt;fluids involves modelling liquid/liquid extraction processes that are widely &lt;br/&gt;used in chemical production and waste processing. In these processes, two &lt;br/&gt;(or more) fluids are placed in contact and a contaminant in one of the fluids &lt;br/&gt;diffuses preferentially into another. The first fluid thus is cleaned and is &lt;br/&gt;then extracted. In these processes, two (or more) fluids are placed in contact&lt;br/&gt;and a contaminant in one of the fluids diffuses preferentially into another.&lt;br/&gt;The first fluid thus is cleaned and is then extracted. If the contaminated &lt;br/&gt;fluid is broken up into small droplets, the interfacial area and hence mass &lt;br/&gt;transfer is increased. We will use analysis, modeling and large scale &lt;br/&gt;scientific computation to study reaction and mixing rates within these &lt;br/&gt;systems. The ultimate goal of this work is to provide a theoretical &lt;br/&gt;foundation for improving the performance of liquid/liquid extractors.&lt;br/&gt;Although the two problems described above arise from very different physical &lt;br/&gt;processes (fluids versus solids), they are similar in the sense that the &lt;br/&gt;relevant phenomena is strongly influenced by surface tension at the &lt;br/&gt;respective interfaces. Consequently, they can be studied using common &lt;br/&gt;analytical and computational tools. The highly complex nature of these &lt;br/&gt;problems makes fast, accurate and robust numerical methods essential to their &lt;br/&gt;study.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
