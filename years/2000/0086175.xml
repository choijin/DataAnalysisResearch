<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;The Rural Systemic Initiative proposed by Fort Peck Community College for the &lt;br/&gt;next five years will build on the accomplishments of the previous High Plains program.&lt;br/&gt;Fort Peck Community College will serve as the catalyst for establishing common goals for the&lt;br/&gt;new program. Systemic change in science, mathematics and technology education will be&lt;br/&gt;implemented throughout the reservation school system K-12 and Fort Peck Community&lt;br/&gt;College. Members of the collaboration include the five public school districts, Fort Peck&lt;br/&gt;Community College, the Fort Peck Tribal Education program, the Montana Office of&lt;br/&gt;Public Instruction and other collaborators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objectives&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objective 1. By August 2000, each of the five reservation schools will implement&lt;br/&gt;vigorous, standards-based instruction for all students and the curriculum, professional&lt;br/&gt;development and assessment systems to document systemic change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objective 2. By June 1, 2001, each leadership team will establish a unified set of&lt;br/&gt;policies to facilitate and enable Objective 1.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objective 3. By July 1, 2001, each instructional leadership team will insure that&lt;br/&gt;all resources (school and grant funded) are uniformly applied.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objective 4. By September 2001, the Project Coordinator and leaderships teams&lt;br/&gt;will mobilize the full community stakeholders in order to facilitate Objective 1.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objective 5. By August 2002, the instructional leadership teams will insure that&lt;br/&gt;all schools increase student attainment in science, mathematics and technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objective 6. By August 2005, the systemic approach will result in a reduction in&lt;br/&gt;attainment differences between those traditionally underserved and their peers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Methodology&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Principal Investigator and Project Coordinator will administer the project.&lt;br/&gt;The Project Advisory Committee composed of major stakeholders, will be responsible&lt;br/&gt;for policy development, change process, dissemination of information about the project&lt;br/&gt;to the community, strategic planning and project evaluation. The instructional leadership&lt;br/&gt;teams, composed of all Fort Peck public school teachers who regularly teach&lt;br/&gt;mathematics, science and technology, school administrators, and Fort Peck Community&lt;br/&gt;College advisors, will be responsible for systemic change in instruction, curriculum and&lt;br/&gt;evaluation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Potential Impact&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will result in a reduction in attainment differences between students&lt;br/&gt;traditionally underserved and their peers. The degree of student attainment will be&lt;br/&gt;documented by the Core Data Elements. Project achievement will be measured by&lt;br/&gt;documenting the degree to which the objectives have been achieved.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
