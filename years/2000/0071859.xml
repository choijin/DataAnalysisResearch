<AbstractNarration>The project is an investigation of the interplay of topology and &lt;br/&gt;nonlinear dynamics from both applied and theoretical viewpoints. Complicated&lt;br/&gt;topology arises naturally in nonlinear dynamical systems and frequently&lt;br/&gt;"carries" the dynamics of the system. Understanding this topology is&lt;br/&gt;essential to understanding the dynamics and the long-term behavior of the&lt;br/&gt;system. Planned are (i) further theoretical study of the topology present&lt;br/&gt;in "most" (i.e., generic) dynamical systems with a given property,  (ii)&lt;br/&gt;applied study of stirring and turbulence (with chemical engineers at&lt;br/&gt;Rutgers), (iii) theoretical and applied study of area-preserving systems,&lt;br/&gt;(iv) an investigation of how topology and invariant measures are&lt;br/&gt;related in one-dimesional dynamical systems, and (v) further study of&lt;br/&gt;topological horseshoes (with J. A. Yorke and others from the Maryland&lt;br/&gt;group). The project builds on work already done by the investigator both&lt;br/&gt;alone and in collaboration with other mathematicians and scientists. The&lt;br/&gt;tools of both topology and dynamical systems are needed and will be used&lt;br/&gt;to carry out the project. Theoretical results concerning stirring will be&lt;br/&gt;backed up by actual experiment and observation in the lab.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Whenever a nonlinear dynamical system, such as the weather, or the &lt;br/&gt;motion of different fluids as they are stirred, or the solar system, is&lt;br/&gt;"operating", interesting topology arises as sets are mapped back across&lt;br/&gt;themselves. Understanding these sets is crucial to understanding the&lt;br/&gt;complicated behavior of nonlinear systems. Sometimes the complicated&lt;br/&gt;topology can be observed as it forms, and is a marker for  certain kinds&lt;br/&gt;of complicated dynamics. Can this be made precise? Can it be "quantified"?&lt;br/&gt;Consider stirring, a phenomenon of special interest to the investigator,&lt;br/&gt;for example. Stirring occurs in every kitchen, and seems to be a simple&lt;br/&gt;process. But this is far from the case: Stirring occurs in industrial&lt;br/&gt;settings and in nature in many different contexts as chemicals or&lt;br/&gt;medicines, or hot and cold air, or hot and cold water, are mixed. Most&lt;br/&gt;often in industry achieving homogeneity of the mixed substance efficiently&lt;br/&gt;is the goal. Experimental and simulated results by chemical engineers&lt;br/&gt;demonstrate that those processes used today do not result in homogeneity.&lt;br/&gt;How can those processes be improved? That is one of the problems to which&lt;br/&gt;the results of this project should be applicable. More generally, the&lt;br/&gt;project planned is a study of the topology of complicated dynamical&lt;br/&gt;systems, and both the implications of the presence of complicated topology&lt;br/&gt;for nonlinear systems and vice versa. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
