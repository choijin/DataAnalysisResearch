<AbstractNarration>0002930&lt;br/&gt;It is now well recognized that shape-memory materials derive their unusual and inherently nonlinear and anisotropic properties from the fine-scale rearrangements of phases, or ``microstructures,'' and  that the  strain produced in the pseudoelasticity effect, as well as that recovered during the shape-memory effect, depends on  crystal orientations. Specially oriented single crystals of some shape memory materials can produce sizeable strains (~ 10%) due to phase transformations.  Practical shape-memory materials are typically polycrystalline in nature, and because of their thermo-mechanical processing history, they are initially textured. It has recently been recognized that the initial crystallographic texture of sheets, wires and rods of shape-memory alloys  is crucial in determining the overall properties  of these materials. The pronounced anisotropies caused by the initial texture need to be properly accounted for in developing a robust computational capability for the improved design of geometrically-complex engineering components made from shape memory materials. We shall  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;   Experimentally study the effects of initial texture on the thermo-mechanical response of the  shape-memory alloy Ti-Ni, in both bulk form, and thin films. This material is finding increased use as a functional/smart-material for a variety of applications. Ti-Ni alloys in thin-film form are promising materials for microactuators, because of the enhanced rate of heat transfer in thin films.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  Develop constitutive equations and computational procedures for modeling and simulation of the important pseudoelasticity and shape-memory effects observed  in these materials.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mathematical models and procedures that we plan to develop should be useful&lt;br/&gt;in the design of components for enhanced  thermo-mechanical  performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
