<AbstractNarration>Proposal # HRD-0099141 &lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Southern Maine&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigators: Sharon Locke and Libby Cohen&lt;br/&gt;Title: "Earth System Science Works!"&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project enhances and expands the work of ACCESS Earth, an intensive summer institute in Earth system science for students with disabilities and their teachers previously funded by NASA.  During ACCESS Earth teachers and students work with research scientists at the Wells National Estuarine Research Reserve on the coast of Maine, examining the impacts of sea level rise, climate change, and coastal development.  Teachers and students have the opportunity to use technology such as Geographic Information Systems and remote sensing to study environmental changes and the dynamics of land-sea-air interactions.  Earth System Science Works! will build on the current program by providing: 1) mentoring for teachers and students during the school year, 2) support for adaptation of existing Earth system science curriculum, 3) support for a partnership with the Digital Library for Earth System Education, and 4) support for visiting scientists with disabilities to attend the summer institute.  Through Earth System Science Works! students and teachers will be able to continue their studies in earth system science beyond the week of the summer institute.  Students will communicate electronically with scientists with disabilities working in earth system science fields and will share their interests in science through an interactive Web site.  Teachers will communicate with science and education faculty on implementing accessible earth system science lessons into their classrooms and will post adapted lessons and other ideas on the project Web site.  The goal is to create a sustained discussion forum on the accessibility of earth system science education at the K- 12 level. &lt;br/&gt;This project will positively influence the way in which earth system science is taught at all educational levels through a partnership with the Digital Library for Earth System Education.  A special working group of teachers selected by project staff will adapt popular earth system science curricula so that they are accessible to students with disabilities and will field test the adaptations in their classrooms and at the summer institute.  The adapted curricula and strategies for teaching earth system science to students with disabilities will be published as an Earth System Science IdeaBook, which will be fully integrated into the Digital Library.  The timing of this project affords an ideal opportunity to guide the development of the library.  Teachers and students will serve as testers of library tools, collections, and interfaces and will advise staff on its accessibility for persons with disabilities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks to increase the number of students with disabilities who pursue earth system science careers by changing the methods, materials, and curricula used in high school science classes.  Earth system science courses are being offered with increasing frequency at both the high school and middle school levels, and the Digital Library for Earth System Education will further increase the availability of educational resources.  Earth System Science Works! Will comprehensively evaluate the accessibility of earth system science education and provide new resources for teaching earth system concepts to persons with disabilities. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
