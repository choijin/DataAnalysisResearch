<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;This project is directed towards the development, analysis and numerical &lt;br/&gt;validation of new finite element methods for fluid flows and &lt;br/&gt;electromagnetics.  The research in methods for fluid flows will focus on &lt;br/&gt;applications of nonstandard least-squares principles in the construction&lt;br/&gt;of the numerical algorithms.  While for incompressible viscous flows &lt;br/&gt;conventional least-squares principles have established themselves as a &lt;br/&gt;viable alternative to mixed Galerkin methods, such principles are not &lt;br/&gt;completely satisfactory in the context of high Re or transonic flows.  To &lt;br/&gt;circumvent existing computational defects of L2-norm methods such as &lt;br/&gt;sensitivity to singularities, lack of norm equivalence and etc., the new &lt;br/&gt;algorithms will be based on mesh-dependent and negative-norm least-squares &lt;br/&gt;principles.  The emphasis of the second research direction will be on eddy &lt;br/&gt;current computations in three dimensions.  To address computational &lt;br/&gt;complexity of 3D simulations algorithms will use equivalent potential &lt;br/&gt;formulations of the governing equations.  The issue of proper gauge &lt;br/&gt;selection for the potentials will receive a thorough and systematic &lt;br/&gt;examination so as to ensure well-posed sets of differential equations.  &lt;br/&gt;Algorithmic development will pay special attention to the efficient &lt;br/&gt;implementation of the relevant boundary and interface conditions where &lt;br/&gt;least-squares terms will be used to enforce these conditions weakly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The common thread which links the two principal research directions of&lt;br/&gt;this project is the focus on new computational algorithms for partial &lt;br/&gt;differential equations.  Such equations arise in virtually every field of &lt;br/&gt;science and engineering and their efficient numerical solution is critical &lt;br/&gt;for our ability to conduct computer simulations of physical processes &lt;br/&gt;ranging from atmospheric motions to flows of current in superconductors.  &lt;br/&gt;As a result, development of high performance computational tools which &lt;br/&gt;enable realistic simulations will play an increasingly important role for &lt;br/&gt;the future advances in science and technology.  The impact of such &lt;br/&gt;computational algorithms will be felt not only in terms of tremendous cost &lt;br/&gt;and/or time savings made possible by replacing field experiments by &lt;br/&gt;virtual, computer experiments, but also by the fact that in some instances &lt;br/&gt;computer models may be the only feasible design approach.  In the focus of &lt;br/&gt;this project is the development of such tools for differential equations &lt;br/&gt;arising in modeling of fluid flows and electromagnetic fields.  Two &lt;br/&gt;specific applications that we have in mind are computation of &lt;br/&gt;three-dimensional eddy currents and simulations of transonic and high &lt;br/&gt;Reynolds number flows.  One motivation for our research is the practical &lt;br/&gt;relevance of these problems.  For instance, solution of the eddy current &lt;br/&gt;equations arises in such varied areas as development of toroidal field &lt;br/&gt;magnets for fusion power, modeling of plasma physics phenomena, and design &lt;br/&gt;of tape heads, while transonic and high Re flows are relevant to design of &lt;br/&gt;aircraft and modeling of dispersion of pollutants.  At the same time &lt;br/&gt;numerical solution of these problems in realistic three-dimensional &lt;br/&gt;settings continues to be an outstanding and challenging computational&lt;br/&gt;task. Thus, our research is also motivated by the real and existing need to &lt;br/&gt;develop efficient and robust computational tools for electromagnetics and &lt;br/&gt;fluid flow applications which can be used in such realistic settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
