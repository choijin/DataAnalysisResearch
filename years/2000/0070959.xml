<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project from an established professor at the University of Maryland consists of infrared (IR) and microwave magneto-optical studies of strongly correlated transition metal oxide metals, concentrating on the cuprate high temperature superconductors. Systematic investigations of the infrared Hall effect in thin film samples will be made using recently developed highly sensitive polarization modulation techniques to detect the small magneto-optical signals. The complex frequency-dependent magnetoconductivity tensor will be determined. In the studies in the normal state of high temperature superconductors the objectives are to expand on preliminary IR Hall data and past magneto-transport work that shows that the zero field response and the Hall response of these materials are governed by different relaxation processes. In the superconducting state the main goal is to provide the phenomenology that will allow an understanding of vortex dynamics in high Tc superconductors. The proposed studies break new ground in superconductivity research and they hold the promise of opening new paths for the science and technology of superconductors. They represent studies of the carrier dynamics in these materials which show anomalous non-Fermi liquid behavior. They cover the frequency range that corresponds to the important interaction energies in these materials. The results may provide important new insights into the mechanisms of high temperature superconductivity. The program involves the training of undergraduates, graduate students and post-docs in IR materials physics. &lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;This project from an established professor at the University of Maryland consists of magneto-optical studies of materials with strongly interacting electrons, concentrating on the cuprate high temperature superconductors. The measurements will be made at high magnetic fields and cryogenic temperatures. The infrared (IR) Hall effect will be measured in thin film samples using recently developed highly sensitive infrared polarization modulation techniques. The studies probe the electrical properties of these materials that appear highly anomalous in comparison with traditional metals and superconductors. They break new ground in high temperature superconductivity research and they hold the promise of opening new paths for the science and technology of these materials. They cover the frequency range corresponding to the important interaction energies of the electrons in these materials. The results may provide important new insights into the mechanisms of high temperature superconductivity and in the understanding of materials with strongly interacting electrons in general. The program involves the training of undergraduates, graduate students and post-docs in IR materials physics. &lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
