<AbstractNarration>This program provides an opportunity for talented but financially disadvantaged individuals to acquire a higher education degree in the fields of math, engineering, or computer science. More specifically, this program increases the number of associate degree graduates in these fields, with significant numbers transferring to four- year institutions to pursue baccalaureate degrees, and others ultimately earning graduate degrees. The institution is committed to providing the student support services necessary to ensure the retention and graduation of the scholarship recipients and, when desired, their successful transfer to four-year colleges. Overall, the institution fosters an institutional climate supportive of the recipients' success. Ten program objectives have been formulated to meet these needs: Identification and selection, assessment, retention, achievement, career awareness and counseling, service-learning, enrichment, graduation, transfer, and employment. In support of these goals, there is a comprehensive student support services program that includes personal and academic counseling, academic advising and assistance in course selection, enrichment seminars and activities, academic programs, instruction in study skills, mentoring program, career awareness, services for the disabled, transfer initiative, computer literacy, tutorial services, service-learning placement, and employment services and placement. Specifically, the program impacts both the recipients and the community as a whole through the realization of the following outcomes: improved education for students in the stated disciplines; increased retention of students to degree achievement; strengthened partnerships between institutions of higher education and related employment sectors; improved professional development and employment; and further higher education placement of participating students.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
