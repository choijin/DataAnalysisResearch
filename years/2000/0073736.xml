<AbstractNarration>     Recent advances in technology have provided portable computers with wireless interfaces that&lt;br/&gt;allow networked communication among mobile users.  The resulting computing environment, which&lt;br/&gt;is often referred to as mobile computing, no longer requires users to maintain a fixed and universally&lt;br/&gt;known position in the network and enables almost unrestricted mobility.  An ad hoc wireless&lt;br/&gt;network is a special type of wireless mobile network in which a collection of mobile hosts with&lt;br/&gt;wireless network interfaces may form a temporary network, without the aid of any established&lt;br/&gt;infrastructure or centralized administration.&lt;br/&gt;     Efficient routing among a set of mobile hosts (also called nodes) is one of the most important&lt;br/&gt;functions in ad hoc wireless networks.  Routing based on a connected dominating set is a promising&lt;br/&gt;approach, where the search space for a route is reduced to the nodes in the set.  A set is dominating if&lt;br/&gt;all the nodes in the system are either in the set or are neighbors of nodes in the set.  In this proposal,&lt;br/&gt;the researchers study a simple and efficient distributed algorithm for calculating a connected dominating set&lt;br/&gt;in an ad hoc wireless network, where connections of nodes are determined by their geographical&lt;br/&gt;distances and the corresponding graph is called a unit graph.  A reduced graph is then induced&lt;br/&gt;from the connected dominating set and the routing process is restricted to this reduced graph.  The researcher's preliminary results on random unit graphs are very promising in generating a small reduced graph in a way faster than existing methods.&lt;br/&gt;     The goals of the proposed research are: (1) Enhance the process (also called the marking&lt;br/&gt;process) of determining a connected dominating set of a unit graph.  (2) Complete the update/re-&lt;br/&gt;calculation algorithm for the connected dominating set when the topology of the ad hoc wireless&lt;br/&gt;network changes dynamically.  (3) Extend the proposed approach to a hierarchical structure, where&lt;br/&gt;the marking process is applied on the reduced graph to generate a reduced graph of the reduced&lt;br/&gt;graph.   The hierarchical structure is obtained by applying the marking process iteratively.  (4) Select&lt;br/&gt;an appropriate routing protocol for the reduced graph.  This scheme could be a proactive routing&lt;br/&gt;(such as various extended link state and distance vector routing protocols), a reactive routing (also&lt;br/&gt;called on demand), or a combination of both.  (5) Explore the possibility of combining dominating&lt;br/&gt;set information and location information provided by a Global Positioning System (GPS) to derive&lt;br/&gt;a better routing scheme.  (6) Integrate different components and fine tune the system through an&lt;br/&gt;empirical study based on a set of well-defined quantitative performance metrics.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
