<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;Proposal #0098284&lt;br/&gt;Saunders, B. David&lt;br/&gt;University of Delaware&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a program of research in the area of exact solution of systems of linear equations and related problems. There will be an emphasis on Diophantine problems, wherein the input data (coefficients) are integers and the solutions sought must also have integer coefficients. There will also be an emphasis on parametric linear systems, wherein the input data contain symbolic parameters and the solutions must be expressed in terms of these parameters, including all special cases (ranges of values of the parameters for which the solutions have form different from the general case). New efficient algorithms are sought and high performance software is to be developed based on both new and previously described methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work will be largely carried out in the context of the LINBOX collaboration. LINBOX is a group of twelve researchers in three countries (USA, France, Canada) who are conducting research in the design of efficient algorithms for linear algebra, in their implementation in a software library, and in how to interface the library to widely-used scientific computing software. such as Maple and Mathematica.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two basic approaches to sparse matrix problems, iterative and direct. Both approaches have been significantly developed by the numeric linear algebra community. Iterative methods involve finding recurrence relations in a series of vectors resulting from matrix-vector products. In LINBOX these have been called "black box" methods, and the adaptation of such methods to symbolic problems has been the emphasis to date. There has been substantial theoretical work in the past two decades in this area. The emphasis of LINBOX is to find and to demonstrate in software the variants and extensions and improvements to these methods which will work in practice. The here proposed research will continue in this direction but will also work to develop the direct methods for solution of sparse symbolic linear systems, again basing on prior work in numerical linear algebra.</AbstractNarration>
