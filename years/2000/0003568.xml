<AbstractNarration>0003568&lt;br/&gt;Hacker&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is focused on the area around a 5 km drill hole the Chinese are going to drill in the Sulu ultrahigh-pressure (UHP) metamorphic terrane in east-central China.  The goal of the project is to understand the formation and exhumation of UHP rocks through study of ultramafic (mantle) rocks from a "forbidden zone" of P-T conditions (i.e., very high P, very low T).  Some specific questions to be addressed are:&lt;br/&gt; o What type of crust-mantle interaction occurs when continents are subducted?&lt;br/&gt; o How much of continental mass is recycled in this manner?&lt;br/&gt; o Can timing of fluid-rock interactions be constrained?&lt;br/&gt; o What do the UHP garnet peridotites tell us about "petrotectonic" processes?&lt;br/&gt;             o How were UHP peridotites emplaced into the crust?  How did they evolve during exhumation?  What mechanisms and rates of ascent are necessary to preserve their high P,  low T assemblages?&lt;br/&gt; o What roles do slab hydrous phases play in recycling of      volatiles into the mantle?&lt;br/&gt; o Can we tell the difference between subduction/collisional      architecture of orogens from younger events using deep-seismic profiles?&lt;br/&gt;             o In what tectonic settings does UHP metamorphism and subsequent exhumation occur?  Is continent-continent collision required?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Principal Investigators  will employ a variety of methods in their study:  1) mapping and structural analysis; 2) petrology &amp; geochemistry; 3) geochronology;  4) geophysics at the Donghai drill site;  and 5)  geodynamic modeling.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
