<AbstractNarration>James Madison University will host an eight-week REU program for six undergraduates per year during the summer of 2002.  The primary goal of the program is to provide its student participants with an authentic mathematical research experience.  The components of program include:   (1) Working with another student on a research project with a faculty mentor;  (2) Writing a research paper containing project results; (3) Participating in a common seminar at the beginning of the program;  (4) Presenting results to the other research groups throughout the program;  (5) Visiting research mathematicians at NASA in Langley, VA; (6) Participating in social activities with undergraduate research students in biology, chemistry, physics, and geology;  (7) Having results "refereed" by an external panel; (8)  Presenting results at professional meetings during the following academic year; and  (9) Continued contact with the mentors after the end of the project.  As part of the evaluation process, an external review panel will evaluate the program's success and provide a "referee's report" for individual student projects.  At least three of the six participating students will be recruited from outside the institution, and a significant effort will be made to recruit students from institutions less likely to have resources available to support undergraduate research activity, as well as members of mathematically underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
