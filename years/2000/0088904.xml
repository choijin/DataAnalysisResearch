<AbstractNarration>Engineering - Electrical (55)  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this project is to produce educational materials for an electrical engineering service course that motivates mechanical engineering students by presenting the content of electrical systems in the context of mechanical engineering. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Motivating students and engaging their interest is the one element vital for the success of any course and is, unfortunately, the element too often lacking in such service courses. This problem is addressed by presenting topics in electrical systems from the viewpoint and in the context of the discipline being served. The study of electrical systems is embedded into major components of mechanical engineering, thus allowing students to construct a knowledge of electrical systems that is well integrated with their existing base of knowledge. This approach can be extended to other engineering disciplines that need knowledge of electrical systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Delivery features include studio format, a variety of active learning strategies, and Web-based learning and assessment tools including Just-in-Time Teaching (JiTT), ConcepTests, multimedia simulations, and hypertext informational documents. Throughout the project, a review board of nationally-recognized experts in engineering education and assessment is evaluating the educational materials developed, providing information for continuous improvement, and assuring that the materials developed can serve as a model for the development of service courses in electrical systems. Dissemination will be through a published textbook, journal articles, conference presentations, and faculty workshops. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
