    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will develop an inexpensive Visible Light Audio Information Transfer System (VLAITS) that transmits information to small Personal Audio Receivers (PAR) for blind, hard of hearing, non-physically impaired and non-English speaking users. VLAITS uses already-installed visible lighting fixtures like fluorescent lights to provide modulated light as a carrier medium for data. The PAR receives this modulated light and presents audio to the user. VLAITS is remarkably inexpensive because it requires no additional equipment or special wiring other than typically used in existing lighting fixtures. There is no perceptible visual flicker in light because of data coding schemes. Phase I demonstrated VLAITS, qualified commercial visible light as an information carrier, and demonstrated wayfinding and aural assistance with blind and hard of hearing users. This project seeks to design and refine a commercial VLAITS system and validate system functions and capabilities with blind and hard of hearing users. Included are miniaturization and reduction of production cost of the computer-controlled light ballast transmitter and computer-controlled portable receiver. The receiver will also be designed to be compatible with currently installed infrared systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project proffers a solution for the communication of information to people, particularly to those with disabilities, that leverages existing infrastructure in an innovative and cost effective way. Commercial products will be modified light ballasts, personal audio receivers and design of assistive networks.</AbstractNarration>
