<AbstractNarration>It is widely recognized that linear control laws are inadequate to account for&lt;br/&gt;severe nonlinearities and uncertainties that many physical systems possess.&lt;br/&gt;Two examples of such systems, that will be studied in this project,&lt;br/&gt;are underactuated mechanical systems and communication networks.&lt;br/&gt;The issue of designing performance-aimed nonlinear controllers&lt;br/&gt;with robustness to significant uncertainties has drawn attention of&lt;br/&gt;many researchers in the last 20 years.&lt;br/&gt;Phase I of this project will continue the study of nonlinear systems with&lt;br/&gt;dynamic uncertainties, initiated in our earlier work, and provide further&lt;br/&gt;insights into the inherent limitations on achievable performance&lt;br/&gt;caused by (input) dynamic uncertainties.&lt;br/&gt;Despite many elegant results in the recent literature of nonlinear control,&lt;br/&gt;their direct application to decentralized nonlinear systems with complex&lt;br/&gt;interconnecting structures seems to be limited from a practical point of view. &lt;br/&gt;On the basis of the new framework of nonlinear ISS (input-to-state stability) &lt;br/&gt;small-gain theorems, we will develop nonlinear feedback design tools for &lt;br/&gt;important classes of decentralized nonlinear systems&lt;br/&gt;with applications to communication networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phase II of this project is to address some interesting nonlinear&lt;br/&gt;control problems in communication networks. The study of hard saturation&lt;br/&gt;nonlinearities and time-varying uncertain propagation delays in such systems&lt;br/&gt;will generate new decentralized/nonlinear control problems as applications&lt;br/&gt;for the basic research in Phase I.&lt;br/&gt;We expect that our contributions from the nonlinear control perspective&lt;br/&gt;will enhance the NSF's existing investment in this active application area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The educational element of this CAREER development plan is closely linked to&lt;br/&gt;the research work. We will enhance the current control curriculum at Polytechnic&lt;br/&gt;by incorporating ``nonlinear'' thinking into the classical feedback control &lt;br/&gt;courses where ``linear'' methods are now the focal point, and by developing &lt;br/&gt;Web-based educational tools and tutorials.&lt;br/&gt;The specific goals of the educational plan include:&lt;br/&gt;(1) developing a new graduate course {\em Nonlinear Systems Theory}&lt;br/&gt;to report on recent developments in nonlinear systems and control;&lt;br/&gt;(2) setting up a Laboratory for Robust Nonlinear Control for research and &lt;br/&gt;education,&lt;br/&gt;which strengthens the Department's activities in control;&lt;br/&gt;(3) promoting hands-on experiments and involving undergraduate students in &lt;br/&gt;research-oriented and application-driven projects; and&lt;br/&gt;(4) developing interactions with practicing engineers for technology transfer &lt;br/&gt;and dissemination of new theory through seminars, workshops and continuing &lt;br/&gt;education programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
