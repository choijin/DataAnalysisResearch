    <AbstractNarration>Progress in our understanding of yeast chromosome structure, and the mechanisms and control of chromosome replication and segregation continues to proceed at a rapid pace. To bring together leading and new scientists that work in this area, The Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB) will sponsor a research conference on Yeast Chromosome Structure, Replication and Segregation to be held August 19-24, 2000, at Snowmass Village, Colorado. This conference will represent the sixth iteration of what has become the most successful and important meeting of this field. This conference succeeds in several essential areas. First and foremost, the findings presented are always on the "cutting edge", as each of the five previous meetings have upheld a strong tradition of presenting primarily unpublished results. Second, the meeting is attended by most of the leaders in the yeast chromosome transmission field, and in striking contrast to many meetings, Principal Investigators are present and actively participate for the entire meeting. The conference also provides a good balance of students, postdoctoral fellows, junior and senior researchers, with an informal atmosphere that contributes greatly to interactions between younger and older scientists. For students, this serves as an essential aspect of their scientific education, and for Principal Investigators, the conference keeps them abreast of the latest findings and stimulates collaborative efforts. Participation of women and minorities, both as organizers and as session speakers has been excellent for the past five meetings, and remains a strength of this current meeting. Finally, this is the only conference that is specifically devoted to this topic. Therefore, for scientists working on chromosome structure and transmission, this meeting has served as a critical vehicle for the dissemination of important findings and a major source for generating scientific interactions. The objectives for the 2000 meeting are to bring together both leaders in the field as well as new investigators, to continue the extremely high level of excitement and scientific excellence that has characterized the past five conferences.</AbstractNarration>
