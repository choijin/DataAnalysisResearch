    <AbstractNarration>This research is devoted to problems in mathematical analysis&lt;br/&gt;arising from questions in physics. There are six main areas: (1)&lt;br/&gt;The ultraviolet problem in quantum electrodynamics, (2) analysis of the&lt;br/&gt;precise rate of approach to equilibrium on models of Kac type for kinetic &lt;br/&gt;theory, (3) problems of interface motion arising from phase separation problems &lt;br/&gt;in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, (4) sharp Lieb-Thirring &lt;br/&gt;inequalities, and (5) the search for patterns in minimizers of simple energy &lt;br/&gt;functionals. Our proposed research into these various problems in&lt;br/&gt;each case centers on a strategy in which geometric and dynamical analysis &lt;br/&gt;of problems in the calculus of variations&lt;br/&gt;plays a key role. We expect, as in our past research, that this strategy will&lt;br/&gt;lead us to discover new results and methods in pure analysis, as well as to&lt;br/&gt;improve the understanding of the physical phenomena in question.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is devoted to problems in mathematical analysis&lt;br/&gt;arising from questions in physics.
