<AbstractNarration>In this project the investigators will study experimentally the dynamic evolution of prepared quantum states using a newly-developed wave-particle correlator.  In a cavity QED system, where optically pumped atoms interact with a single mode of a driven high finesse optical cavity, the conditional field measured by the wave-particle correlator will allow the reconstruction of the evolution of the quantum state.   The conditional measurements will be coupled to quantum feedback control to find ways to stabilize the quantum state.  A new study of the development of time asymmetries in correlation functions by looking at the relationship between correlations and measurement back action will also be undertaken.</AbstractNarration>
