<AbstractNarration>This individual investigator award is for a project to investigate a newly discovered phenomenon, superconducting granular balls. When a strong electric field is applied to a suspension of liquid nitrogen and high temperature superconducting particles, the granular particles quickly move between the electrodes and bind themselves together to form macroscopic balls in milliseconds. The phenomenon shows a new property of superconductor: electric field induced surface energy. The current preliminary explanation relates this surface energy to a loss of Joshphson coupling energy between the ab-planes due to the induced surface charge on the particles. The physical model requires extensive development. The new phenomenon is also related to a long-standing unresolved issue: the behavior of superconductors in a static electric field. The basic science of the phenomenon is important to the understanding and development of superconductivity. The research may also lead to a new method to produce superconducting films.  The project offers excellent opportunity for the training of undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows in techniques that will prepare them for future careers. &lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;This individual investigator award is for a project directed towards the study of a new phenomenon of superconductivity discovered recently, the formation of superconducting granular balls in a strong electric field.
