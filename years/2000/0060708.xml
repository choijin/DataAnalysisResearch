    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will utilize known chemistry and economical materials to create imide-based anions containing greater charge delocalization and ligands for anion solvation. The solvent levels needed for high conductivity for safe, high rate (10 degree C) operation of lithium ion cells will be determined. Acceptable densities in small cells create safety concerns in large capacity batteries, particularly at high load levels, because solvent-lithium reactivity, heat, and solvent volatility can generate explosive or pyrotechnic mixtures. Better electrolyte conductivity and stability are needed for safe high power operation. The lithium prototypical salt is not as stable or conductive as desired and is less stable than imide-based anions. Solid-polymer-based electrolytes reduce the danger of catastrophic battery failure, but they have lower power densities due to lower conductivity compared to liquid electrolytes. A new class of imide-based lithium salts containing covalently attached ligands to solvate anions and enable Li+ (lithium ion) dissociation and conductivity, using little or no molecular solvent will be developed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Large, safe, high rate, rechargeable lithium ion batteries are needed for a variety of applications, including electric vehicle propulsion, aircraft and space vehicles, and communications equipment. Improved consumer electronic products, such as portable telephones, computers, cameras, and power tools, could also be a market for this proposed technology.</AbstractNarration>
