    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project describes a novel laser-based technology for large-scale analysis and processing of living cells. One application of this technology is the detection and elimination of contaminating tumor cells from autologous hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplants for cancer patients. Published studies have shown that: (1) contaminating tumor cells contribute to cancer relapse; (2) successful tumor purging provides a clinical benefit; and (3) current purging methods are inadequate. Therefore, technology that reliably eliminates tumor cells from transplants, while leaving HSCs undamaged, is needed. A patented innovative approach integrating fluorescence scanning cytometry, real-time image analysis, and specific laser-induced killing of individual cell targets will be used. The Phase II project will complete the clinical-scale prototype instrument, leading into clinical trials. The instrument design will then be configured for successful commercial manufacturing, and further improvements in capabilities will be pursued in order to maintain market leadership and expand into other markets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The studies conducted in the Phase II project will lead to commercialization of a method to eliminate detectable tumor cells from an HSC transplant with a several hour automated procedure. The resulting instrumentation will also be useful in a number of other clinical and research applications that require cell analysis and purification with high purity, yield and speed.</AbstractNarration>
