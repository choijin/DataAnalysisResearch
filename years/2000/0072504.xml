<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0072504&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Eric Zaslow&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zaslow proposes research directed towards a unified understanding&lt;br/&gt;of mirror symmetry.  Current ideas -- including ``classical''&lt;br/&gt;mirror symmetry; Kontsevich's conjecture; the work of Vafa; and&lt;br/&gt;the conjecture of Strominger, Yau, and Zaslow -- are only loosely&lt;br/&gt;connected and involve both perturbative and non-perturbative&lt;br/&gt;string reasoning.  An understanding of how non-perturbative&lt;br/&gt;string theory relates to the classical mirror symmetry picture&lt;br/&gt;and Gromov-Witten invariants will be an important step towards&lt;br/&gt;unification.  Five projects are proposed towards achieving this&lt;br/&gt;goal: 1) Developing a mathematical formulation of the new&lt;br/&gt;invariants obtained by Gopakumar and Vafa from BPS state&lt;br/&gt;counting.  2) Understanding the multiple-cover formulas which&lt;br/&gt;yield integers from higher-genus Gromov-Witten invariants.  3)&lt;br/&gt;Resolving the holomorphic ambiguity by determining it from the&lt;br/&gt;structure of singularities of Calabi-Yau moduli space.  4)&lt;br/&gt;Developing a physical understanding of Kontsevich's enlargement&lt;br/&gt;of Calabi-Yau moduli space to include A-infinity structures.  5)&lt;br/&gt;Defining a geometric Fourier-Mukai-like functor relating&lt;br/&gt;special-Lagrangian cycles of one manifold to Hermitian-Yang-Mills&lt;br/&gt;connections on bundles over the mirror.  This functor could lead&lt;br/&gt;to a geometric proof of Kontsevich's formulation of mirror&lt;br/&gt;symmetry.  All these projects aim to unify our still disparate&lt;br/&gt;approaches to mirror symmetry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is directed towards unifying our mathematical and&lt;br/&gt;physical understanding of the phenomenon of mirror symmetry,&lt;br/&gt;discovered by theoretical physicists working in string theory.&lt;br/&gt;String theory is a proposed physical theory with the promise of&lt;br/&gt;incorporating Einstein's understanding of space and gravity into&lt;br/&gt;the quantum theory.  Mirror symmetry is a duality symmetry in&lt;br/&gt;string theory, whereby two very different physical theories are&lt;br/&gt;actually equivalent.  When one of the theories is easily&lt;br/&gt;computable and the other hard, this leads to predictions of&lt;br/&gt;answers to difficult calculations.  From the mathematical point&lt;br/&gt;of view, this can lead to conjectures relating parallel&lt;br/&gt;structures -- the structures involved in describing the&lt;br/&gt;different, but equivalent, mathematical models of physical&lt;br/&gt;theories.  The relationships unearthed by mirror symmetry are&lt;br/&gt;deep and novel.  A unified understanding of them may join not&lt;br/&gt;only fields of research but different disciplines -- math and&lt;br/&gt;physics -- as well.  This award is partially funded by the&lt;br/&gt;program in Mathematical Physics of the Division of Physics.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
