<AbstractNarration>0082381&lt;br/&gt;Adomaitis&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We  propose to develop the computational framework that will make possible a rapid proto-typing approach to simulator development for microelectronic device fabrication process systems. This research is intended to fill the gap that exists between supercomputer-based, highly resolved simulations and lumped-parameter models, a range currently spanned by specialized methods for process simulation, analysis,  model reduction, and parameter estimation - numerical tools that are generally incompatible with each other. The proposed approach to process simulation is based on developing computational elements that have a one-to-one correspondence to the steps taken when  implementing high-dimensional projection, spectral filtering and advanced weighted residual methods, such as the reduced basis and nonlinear Galerkin projections.  Methods for assessing model validity; solution analysis (e.g., stability), and discretization error will be addressed in this framework. Indeed, because of its reliance on parameter estimation methods, an absolute measure of reduced-model predictive power always will be produced in this simulation framework. These interconnected computational tools will be developed in the MATLAB environment, taking advantage of MATLAB's object-oriented programming features to simplify simulations of complex systems and to create a pathway to incorporating our simulation tools in spectral element and other commercial software packages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The need to generate computationally efficient, validated simulations for improving across-wafer processing uniformity in chemical vapor deposition and other semiconductor materials manufacturing unit operations provides the primary motivation for this research.  Reduced models are suitable for real-time and run-to-run control, efficient process recipe optimization, and model-based sensing and estimation of unmeasurable processes, such as microfeature evolution.  This proposal will support the joint research between the PI and the Tecbnology CAD group of Intel through a graduate student internship aimed at testing the simulation tools in a corporate research environment. The basic elements of this approach also will be developed in the context of a commercial chemical vapor deposition (CVD) cluster tool located at the University of  Maryland, with the goal of producing a  validated, reduced model to be used for wafer temperature prediction and conformal CVD studies.  &lt;br/&gt;***  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
