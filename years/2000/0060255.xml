<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I Project will develop new methods for continuous synthesis and purification of important carbon-based nanostructured materials, including fullerenes and endohedral metallofullerenes.  Due to their unique properties, structured carbon nanomaterials including fullerenes and nanotubes have become a large field of research that extends from chemistry, to physics and materials science.  Intense effort is directed in increasing the fabrication yield of these materials, since current synthesis methods have typical yields of less than 0.5% for the more exotic and revolutionary nanomaterials.  Low yields, coupled with the current high cost of fabrication, has limited the development and commercialization of these important new materials.  Luna Innovations will develop new methods for continuous synthesis and purification of fullerenes and endohedral metallofullerenes based on recent advancements developed through joint research with our university research partners.  This approach will not only increase the quantity of these critical nanomaterials, but will in addition reduce manufacturing costs and usage of associated hazardous solvent materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Applications of these carbon nanostructures are predicted to revolutionize many areas of technology, including optical communications, high-strength composites, thermally-tailored structures for microelectronic and space applications, quantum computing, advanced medical diagnostics and treatments, and others.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
