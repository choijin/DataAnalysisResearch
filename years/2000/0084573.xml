    <AbstractNarration>The validation of structural analytical models in practice is mainly based&lt;br/&gt;on comparing both experimental static and dynamic data with model predictions.&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this project is to develop an algorithmic framework suitable&lt;br/&gt;for distributed processing which updates both the model structure (constitutive&lt;br/&gt;laws, modeling idealizations, discretization) and model parameters (material&lt;br/&gt;parameters) to produce a test validated model capable of predicting the&lt;br/&gt;response/character of the structure when subjected to a wide range of inputs&lt;br/&gt;and design changes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The algorithmic framework is based on the Genetic Algorithm (GA) optimization&lt;br/&gt;paradigm. The GA paradigm loosely implements Darwin's "survival of the fittest"concepts and attempts to evolve better solutions to a given problem statement.&lt;br/&gt;The GA paradigm is being used because it does not require sensitivity&lt;br/&gt;information (which doesn't exist for model structure changes) and can seamlesslyhandle both continuous and discrete design variables. Several GA formulations&lt;br/&gt;are being developed which address the computational efficiency of the algorithm&lt;br/&gt;based on what experimental data is available and the model structure and &lt;br/&gt;parameter changes that are allowed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Even with advances in computational power, model updating can be applied to&lt;br/&gt;realistic problems only if a suitable approximation theory relating changes&lt;br/&gt;in vibration properties to changes in model structure and parameters is &lt;br/&gt;developed. An iterative structural dynamics modification theory is under&lt;br/&gt;development which provides accurate approximations in a computationally&lt;br/&gt;efficient manner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The major impact of this project is that upon completion a framework for &lt;br/&gt;developing test verified structural models which can be used with confidence&lt;br/&gt;in model-based simulations will be established. The ability of engineers&lt;br/&gt;to rely on model-based simulations will have a profound impact in a wide&lt;br/&gt;range of areas, including product design/development, product safety&lt;br/&gt;evaluation, national security and infrastructure assessment.</AbstractNarration>
