<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0072336&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Richard W. Montgomery&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator will search for new solutions to the&lt;br/&gt;Newtonian N-body problem using a combination of the direct method&lt;br/&gt;of the calculus of variations, a detailed knowledge of ``shape&lt;br/&gt;space'', and a careful investigation of the action functional&lt;br/&gt;near collisions of the bodies.  By the ``shape space'' we mean&lt;br/&gt;the space of either similarity classes or congruence classes of&lt;br/&gt;N-gons.  In recent joint work with Alain Chenciner, this&lt;br/&gt;three-pronged approach proved its utility by yielding a hitherto&lt;br/&gt;unknown orbit for the three-body problem.  In our new orbit all&lt;br/&gt;three masses chase each other around the same figure eight shaped&lt;br/&gt;curve in the plane. Our orbit turns out to be dynamically&lt;br/&gt;(actually KAM) stable.  The chief technical difficulty to be&lt;br/&gt;overcome in successfully applying the method is that of avoiding&lt;br/&gt;collisions between the masses.  Unlike the action in problems&lt;br/&gt;with strong-force potentials, the action with the Newtonian&lt;br/&gt;potential admits finite-action solutions with collision.  One&lt;br/&gt;knows very little about minimizers with collision. In particular&lt;br/&gt;they need not be regularized in any of the various senses.  The&lt;br/&gt;proposer will focus on the collisions.  If an action minimizing&lt;br/&gt;sequence tends to a curve with collisions, under what&lt;br/&gt;circumstance are those collisions Levi-Civita regularized?  Are&lt;br/&gt;there blow-up techniques which will enable us to better&lt;br/&gt;understand such sequences tending toward collision?  These are&lt;br/&gt;some of the questions we will consider.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The three-body problem is the problem of understanding the long&lt;br/&gt;term behaviour of three masses (planets, stars, satellites)&lt;br/&gt;attracting each other according to Newton's laws of physics.  It&lt;br/&gt;is one of the oldest problems in mathematics,dating back to&lt;br/&gt;Newton.  About 100 years ago the French mathematician Poincare&lt;br/&gt;made fundamental progress. He showed that chaos exists in the&lt;br/&gt;three-body problem, in contrast to the the two-body problem,&lt;br/&gt;where the motions are very regular (and well-approximated by that&lt;br/&gt;of the earth around the sun).  He also pointed out the central&lt;br/&gt;importance of periodic orbits to the problem. Periodic orbits are&lt;br/&gt;motions of the masses which repeat the same pattern indefinitely&lt;br/&gt;like a point going around a circle.  We propose to find new&lt;br/&gt;periodic solutions to the three-body problem and the N-body (N is&lt;br/&gt;four, five, six,...)  problem by using a combination of&lt;br/&gt;methods. The methods themselves are not new, but their&lt;br/&gt;combination is.  This approach has already proved successful in&lt;br/&gt;one instance -- by yielding a new solution in which three equal&lt;br/&gt;masses chase each around a figure eight curve, never catching&lt;br/&gt;each other.  Our work could lead to further significant advances&lt;br/&gt;in the understanding of the N-body problem. The techniques may&lt;br/&gt;prove to be useful in other dynamical situations.  There is some&lt;br/&gt;possibility that our orbits might be found to exist somewhere in&lt;br/&gt;the universe, or used in space missions someday.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
