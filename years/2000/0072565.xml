<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The problems that are to be addressed in this project involve, &lt;br/&gt;on one hand,  dynamics of  flows on homogeneous spaces of Lie &lt;br/&gt;groups, and, on the other hand, the multi-dimensional theory &lt;br/&gt;of Diophantine approximations. Various connections between &lt;br/&gt;these two fields have been found in the last two decades, &lt;br/&gt;which significantly stimulated progress in both fields. During &lt;br/&gt;recent years, the proposer's research has been centered on &lt;br/&gt;developing new links between homogeneous dynamics and number &lt;br/&gt;theory, which has resulted in solving many important problems, &lt;br/&gt;as well as in creating new directions for further research. &lt;br/&gt;The investigator is to continue his work on bounded trajectories,&lt;br/&gt;growth rate of orbits, Diophantine approximation with weights &lt;br/&gt;and Khintchine-type theorems on manifolds. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project deals with algebraic dynamical systems and their &lt;br/&gt;applications to number theory. Many problems concerning &lt;br/&gt;simultaneous approximation of real numbers by rational numbers &lt;br/&gt;can be cast in terms of the behavior of certain orbits. &lt;br/&gt;Dynamical systems in the present context deal with how points &lt;br/&gt;in a system move over time, given a set of differential equations &lt;br/&gt;(or laws of nature) governing the system. It turns out that various &lt;br/&gt;numerical approximations used in the theory of integer equations &lt;br/&gt;can be better calculated once they are phrased in dynamical systems &lt;br/&gt;language. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
