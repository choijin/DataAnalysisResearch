<AbstractNarration>Computational Modelling of Multi-Unit/Multi-Level Organizations&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the most important organizational forms in modern economies is the multi-unit&lt;br/&gt;organization. In manufacturing, the typical plant is part of a multi-plant manufacturer. In&lt;br/&gt;services, the typical store is part of a retail chain. A defining problem of a multi-unit&lt;br/&gt;organization is how to balance giving units the freedom to handle the idiosyncratic&lt;br/&gt;features of their environments while, at the same time, coordinating the units to take&lt;br/&gt;advantage of the commonality among them. How do multi-unit organizations solve this problem&lt;br/&gt;and what is the most effective means of doing so? What is the relevant set of instruments&lt;br/&gt;and what are the relevant features of the environment determining the best organization and&lt;br/&gt;strategy? This project explores these questions and more broadly advances our understanding&lt;br/&gt;of multi-unit organizations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our focus is on retail chains. The central idea underlying our approach is that much of the&lt;br/&gt;behavior and performance of a retail chain can be explained by understanding how chains&lt;br/&gt;generate, communicate, and use information. How new ideas arise and how they are evaluated&lt;br/&gt;and adopted. How the authority to use information is distributed within the chain and how&lt;br/&gt;incentives are structured to influence the creation and effective dissemination of&lt;br/&gt;information. And how competition and technology interact with these information processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Implementation of this approach involves the development of a computational model of a&lt;br/&gt;retail chain in which corporate headquarters (HQ) and stores are adapting to their&lt;br/&gt;environments. HQ and store managers develop new ideas, evaluate their ideas and the ideas&lt;br/&gt;of others, and then decide whether to adopt and communicate them to other members of the&lt;br/&gt;organization. Competing chains are simultaneously engaging in an analogous exercise while&lt;br/&gt;consumers experience and experiment among stores to find the one that best suits their&lt;br/&gt;needs. Our analysis explores how various factors influence the rate of improvement of store&lt;br/&gt;practices and chain efficiency. These factors include organizational structure (in&lt;br/&gt;particular, the authority of store managers to change practices), store manager incentives&lt;br/&gt;(as influenced by how they are compensated), the degree of competition within and across&lt;br/&gt;geographic markets (and, relatedly, the effect of mergers), the amount of consumer search,&lt;br/&gt;the rate of change in consumers' preferences, the degree of informational spillovers across&lt;br/&gt;chains, and advances in information technology.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
