<AbstractNarration>Chemistry (12) &lt;br/&gt;Governors State University is developing a model Student Environmental Contract Laboratory( SECL) to improve instruction in the Environmental Chemistry course. The Environmental Chemistry course is required in two curricula, the BS in Chemistry with a Teacher Education Certificate (secondary school endorsement) and the BA in Elementary Education with Chemistry Teaching Specialization, and also is an advanced elective in the American Chemical Society approved BS in Chemistry curriculum. The SECL adapts the curriculum developed in NSF 9750477 at Coastal Carolina University in order to analyze environmental samples generated by the students enrolled in the class and for 'clients', including GSU biology courses and local high school teachers and high school student projects. The SECL is equipped with a new an atomic absorption spectrometer with flame and graphite furnace atomization with autosampling automation and PC control. A block digestion system facilitates greater volume of student analyses. An autosampling accessory of the university's existing GC/ MS also equips the SECL. The students enrolled in the environmental chemistry course create the SECL, perform USEPA regulatory methods, develop appropriate QA/QC procedures, and are evaluated during a mock laboratory audit. Their experiences enhance student preparation for the entry level positions in the industrial workplace. Such preparation is critical for GSU students since the BS in Chemistry majors are non- traditional students (29.9 average age), returning to the classroom to complete professional education or to change careers. Over 80% of the chemistry majors attend GSU part-time, enrolling in the late afternoon, evening and Saturday course offerings. The new instrumentation also provides remote access to the instrumentation for operation by regional high school teachers. This remote access allows participating high school teachers to enhance their effectiveness in the classroom, with enrichment of curriculum, in extracurricular activities such as clubs, and in student projects and guided inquiry. The collaboration with high school teachers and their high school students was developed based on experience gained through our CCLI A&amp;I project 99550554, "A Regional WWW-Based FT-NMR for Chemistry Improvements."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
