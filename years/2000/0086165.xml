<AbstractNarration>The Wind River Rural Systemic Initiative (WRRSI) has been promoting quality&lt;br/&gt;RSI programs for the Wind River Indian Reservation students for the past five years.&lt;br/&gt;Phase II funding will allow WRRSI to expand its focal area and serve approximately&lt;br/&gt;2,150 students, of which 95% are Native American.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The need for science and math systemic reform on the Wind River Indian&lt;br/&gt;Reservation is documented by test scores showing Native students still score below the&lt;br/&gt;state average. WRRSI's Phase I data shows that their programs have made a difference,&lt;br/&gt;however, as Wyoming has now adopted statewide standards and has begun to require&lt;br/&gt;statewide standardized tests, WRRSI must continue to work to improve these&lt;br/&gt;traditionally under served students' scores.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phase II programming will include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On-going professional development opportunities for teachers on the&lt;br/&gt;       Wind River Indian Reservation;&lt;br/&gt;Summer school and after school activities for K-8 students;&lt;br/&gt;Summer institute for 9-12 grade students;&lt;br/&gt;An integration of culture into the curriculum; and&lt;br/&gt;Career awareness and job shadowing programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Data collection over the next five years will be extensive. WRRSI will develop&lt;br/&gt;databases for both students and teachers. Teacher databases will document professional&lt;br/&gt;development opportunities and courses taken. The student database will document&lt;br/&gt;student achievement and participation in program offerings; track students after they&lt;br/&gt;leave high school; and allow WRRSI to determine program effectiveness by comparing&lt;br/&gt;students participating in programs to those not participating.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WRRSI's underlying goal is to provide Native American students with a solid&lt;br/&gt;base in science and mathematics to provide opportunities and choices to compete &lt;br/&gt;at the college level. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
