<AbstractNarration>Award Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Sellers often have or may acquire proprietary information about the value of the object to&lt;br/&gt;be sold. A conventional wisdom from auction theory is that a seller at auction will increase&lt;br/&gt;revenues on average by adopting a policy of always revealing all her available information&lt;br/&gt;about the object's value.&lt;br/&gt;Our project demonstrates that a seller will often do better by revealing no information.&lt;br/&gt;More generally, a policy of partial information revelation is better than both no revelation&lt;br/&gt;and full revelation.&lt;br/&gt;Full revelation policies unambiguously enhance revenue only under special circumstances.&lt;br/&gt;Despite this limitation, full revelation has been routinely advocated and adopted by sellers.&lt;br/&gt;For instance, a full revelation policy was adopted by the FCC in its design of spectrum&lt;br/&gt;auctions. Similar policies were subsequently implemented by other nations selling spectrum&lt;br/&gt;rights. We demonstrate that quite generally the seller can increase her expected revenue by&lt;br/&gt;carefully crafting a policy that conceals part of her information. We describe a procedure&lt;br/&gt;for crafting such a policy.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
