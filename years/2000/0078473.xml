    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will enable conversion of low value residual edgings from sawmill operations into a structural quality engineered wood composite called Structural Strand Lumber (SSL). Edgings are created at sawmills when round logs are sawn into rectangular pieces of lumber. The SSL concept is to cut these edgings into strands, align them directionally, and then glue and compress them into a high value product. Edging material currently is used for low value wood chips for use in paper production. The SSL process will enable sawmills to convert up to 14% more of forest raw materials into structural quality lumber compared to conventional practices. SSL manufacturing will yield a high value added wood product, dramatically reduce waste, reduce demand on natural resources, and increase sawmill operating efficiency. These benefits will reduce dramatically the environmental impacts of sawmill operations. Phase I research provided a fundamental understanding of key processes, and clearly demonstrated the feasibility of the SSL concept. Phase II will demonstrate the operation of critical SSL components, and enable a manufacturing facility prototype demonstration early in the Commercialization Phase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the research is successful, dramatic increases in the fraction of a log that can be used for quality structural materials will result. The cost of the engineered material will be competitive with solid high-grade structural material. The method is applicable to virtually all sawmills operating in the United States and around the world. More efficient utilization of existing wood supply will be enabled by this innovation.</AbstractNarration>
