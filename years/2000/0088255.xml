<AbstractNarration>Earth Systems Science (40) Undergraduate students in science and engineering curricula are frequently bound by disciplines, taught multitudes of reductionist facts endemic to multiple disciplines, and evaluated by competitive measure. Yet they are expected to emerge into professions that function in interdisciplinary, problem-based modes demanding creative and cooperative decisions. Approaching learning in a constructivist, collaborative manner, using Earth system topics of environmental significance, and applying modern as well as traditional technologies for science data acquisition and analysis can offer students a unique opportunity to develop knowledge, attitudes and skills for 21st century careers in science, engineering and technology. This project is developing, offering and assessing a prototype course for use in higher education institutions and field facilities in coastal areas. As an earth systems sciences course it focuses on relationships among elements of the hydrosphere, atmosphere, lithosphere and biosphere of coastal and offshore areas, and it is driven by environmental questions that link the systems with human society. A combination of high-tech tools are employed, such as satellite imagery, datasheets on line, digital models, as well as traditional field technologies for ground truth measurements and supplements to more global datasets. Processes of instruction are based on construction of learning through experiences, collaborative group process and problem-based learning. Alternative assessment will be used to evaluate course outcomes in non-competitive ways.</AbstractNarration>
