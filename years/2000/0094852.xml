<AbstractNarration>Students are provided with services and activities that are designed to promote the following: improve the undergraduate educational experience of students in relevant disciplines; 2) increase the number and percentage of students completing the first stage of the baccalaureate study and those student receiving degrees in relevant disciplines; 3) improve the likelihood of Program Scholars post- baccalaureate placement in employment or graduate programs in technical or related disciplines; and provide the opportunity to further strengthen partnerships with employers and the institution. Each scholar is paired with a mentor who is a member of the Program Scholars discipline area in which he/ she is pursuing his/ her baccalaureate degree; the mentor serves as an advocate for the scholars academic and career success. Activities that some of the scholars are involved in include: tutorial assistance, visitations to research laboratories and graduate programs, career counseling, attendance and/ or participation in national professional conferences within their discipline and national student research conferences, writing assistance, and professional work experiences. The program focuses on students in engineering and engineering technology.</AbstractNarration>
