<AbstractNarration>This study addresses the evolutionary significance of the production of nonfertilizing sperm.  In in many organisms (including fruitflies and humans) males produce many fertilization-incompetent sperm.  The effect of these nonfertilizing sperm on successful reproduction is unknown. Two types of experiments will be performed in a common fruitfly, Drosophila pseudoobscura: 1) replacing its existing mating system with decreased and increased opportunities for mating with multiple partners and subsequently measuring the affect this alteration has on the production of sterile sperm, and 2) a comparison of sibling species, some of which produce sterile sperm, of life history and mating system. The teaching component of this work focuses on the scientific method and the nature of science, and improving the understanding of evolutionary processes. Two components, primarily focused on middle and secondary school teachers, provide this emphasis: 1) pre- and in-service workshops on the nature of science and evolution for middle and secondary school teachers geared to Nevada Science Content Standards, and 2) summer research experience for in-service teachers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research proposed examines fundamental processes of reproduction, primarily evolutionary factors affecting the production of sterile sperm.  To that end, this project will elucidate a vexing and common occurrence in animal taxa; the deliberate production of nonfertilizing sperm.  The teaching component will contribute to the understanding the nature of science and incorporating knowledge of evolutionary processes, such as antibiotic resistance, that will be critical for individuals to make decisions about issues affecting their personal lives, society and the environment.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
