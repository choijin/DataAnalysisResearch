<AbstractNarration>     We are currently witnessing an incredible transformation in the way we access information and&lt;br/&gt;computing power. With small handheld devices such as personal digital assistants, cellular phones,&lt;br/&gt;and palmtop computers, users are taking their computers with them more often than not. Fur-&lt;br/&gt;thermore, with the developments in wireless technologies, users are beginning to slowly move away&lt;br/&gt;from their dependence on wired access to their information. While this trend is building significant&lt;br/&gt;momentum, the types of information that are accessed through these devices is still severely lim-&lt;br/&gt;ited by the wireless media. Given the bottle-necks associated with today's power-limited portable&lt;br/&gt;devices, the limitation due to channel conditions has not yet been felt by the user; however the&lt;br/&gt;strain on the underlying wireless network will only get worse.&lt;br/&gt;     The goal of the proposed research is the construction of high performance algorithms for tetherless&lt;br/&gt;access which consider overall system goals through joint optimization across multiple layers. The&lt;br/&gt;objective will be to solve problems which connect the physical layer to the application layer. In the&lt;br/&gt;past, a classical approach to wireless communication system design was undertaken { a modular&lt;br/&gt;approach loosely based on the Open Systems Interconnection reference stack model. For wired&lt;br/&gt;communication networks, such a separation of activities led to functioning systems offering solid&lt;br/&gt;performance. However, the deleterious effects of the wireless communications channel force the&lt;br/&gt;investigation of all possible methods to improve performance. Thus, to provide the desired fidelity&lt;br/&gt;and to transport high-data rate information over the wireless medium, joint optimization across&lt;br/&gt;multiple communication layers will be necessary. To focus the research, wireless transport of video&lt;br/&gt;via Direct Sequence Code-Division Multiple-Access (DS-CDMA) will be considered.&lt;br/&gt;     In this project, we propose the research and development of video streaming algorithms that are&lt;br/&gt;more suited for wireless transmission using DS-CDMA as an access methodology. There are several&lt;br/&gt;reasons why this project is necessary. First, current research onmulti-rate detection and estimation&lt;br/&gt;algorithms at the physical layer are not tailored for specific application layer data. Second, many of&lt;br/&gt;the video transmission schemes over wireless networks have assumed fixed bit-error rates that are&lt;br/&gt;introduced by the wireless transmission. In CDMA systems, the bit-error rate is highly dependent&lt;br/&gt;on the channel and the number of active users, both of these processes are time-varying; however,&lt;br/&gt;this variability in bit-error rates has not been fully addressed at the application layer. Third, the&lt;br/&gt;elasticity ofvideo can be exploited to design efficient algorithms which can take advantage of the&lt;br/&gt;shape of video streams as well as time-varying channel conditions to offer desired quality-of-service.&lt;br/&gt;     This research project has three principle goals:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Investigation of efficient multi-rate detection and estimation algorithms for wireless physical&lt;br/&gt;media transmission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Investigation of video streaming techniques for wireless networks that use underlying network&lt;br/&gt;condition feedback to dynamically adjust the forward error correction used to protect the&lt;br/&gt;video data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Investigation of the integration of physical layer media characteristics and higher-level video&lt;br/&gt;applications to provide the highest quality-of- service to applications.</AbstractNarration>
