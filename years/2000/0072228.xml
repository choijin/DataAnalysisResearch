<AbstractNarration>0072228&lt;br/&gt;Papageorgiou&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work addresses computationally and analytically two classes of fluid &lt;br/&gt;dynamics problems. The motion of bubbles through fluids containing &lt;br/&gt;soluble surfactants is considered first. Experiments show that even trace &lt;br/&gt;amounts of surfactants can increase the drag on moving bubbles &lt;br/&gt;significantly. Through careful modeling, asymptotic analysis and direct &lt;br/&gt;numerical simulations of the Navier-Stokes equations coupled with the &lt;br/&gt;surfactant equations in the bulk and on the interface, we address both the &lt;br/&gt;steady and unsteady problems and in particular evaluate the effect of &lt;br/&gt;surfactants on wake size and control. Such controls are desirable in &lt;br/&gt;enhanced interphase mass transfer systems. In parallel, we will also study &lt;br/&gt;a class of exact Navier-Stokes solutions which emerges in models of &lt;br/&gt;lubrication bearing flows. We have found that such exact solutions can &lt;br/&gt;describe the viscous flow between two plates when one or both of the &lt;br/&gt;plates move normal to themselves. When this boundary motion is periodic, &lt;br/&gt;chaotic solutions can emerge at sufficiently high but order one Reynolds &lt;br/&gt;numbers. These flows are underlying flows whose stability to wavelike &lt;br/&gt;disturbances is highly complicated since the baseflow is chaotic to begin &lt;br/&gt;with. We consider such local flows when they are embedded into finite &lt;br/&gt;geometries. Direct Navier-Stokes computations will be performed in many &lt;br/&gt;geometries and high frequency limits analyzed asymptotically, in order to &lt;br/&gt;predict transitions to chaos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work studies mathematical problems in fluid dynamics leading to &lt;br/&gt;scientific computations and analytical problems. The models arise from &lt;br/&gt;applications concerned with enhancing technological processes such as &lt;br/&gt;materials processing in microgravity, environmental and chemical &lt;br/&gt;processes, biomedical applications and lubrication technologies. We use a &lt;br/&gt;combination of mathematical and computational tools and intensive &lt;br/&gt;computations to elucidate and identify regimes and mechanisms that can &lt;br/&gt;enhance the efficiency of the applications mentioned above. For example, &lt;br/&gt;we identify, using simulations, situations where flow in squeeze bearings &lt;br/&gt;can stay laminar rather than become chaotic. Chaotic flows can cause the &lt;br/&gt;equipment to fail with disastrous effects on machinery. Modeling and &lt;br/&gt;simulations have the advantage, over experiments, of allowing wide &lt;br/&gt;parameter studies and hence help identify critical experiments and design &lt;br/&gt;strategies. The research is valuable in both benchmarking large scale &lt;br/&gt;simulations as well as providing direct comparisons with experiments.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
