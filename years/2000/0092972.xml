    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this project is to develop and implement new and&lt;br/&gt;efficient optimization methods for robust and discrete optimization&lt;br/&gt;problems. The applications of interest to us are in the fields of&lt;br/&gt;financial engineering and network design. The robust optimization&lt;br/&gt;framework is an attempt to correct for the modeling uncertainties&lt;br/&gt;that are inevitable in engineering. Optimization problems are&lt;br/&gt;especially susceptible to modeling errors since, in trying to exploit&lt;br/&gt;the constraints, the optimal solutions typically amplify the errors&lt;br/&gt;several fold. In the robust framework, the perturbations are modeled&lt;br/&gt;as unknown, but bounded, and optimization problems are solved&lt;br/&gt;assuming worst case behavior of these perturbations. Robustness to&lt;br/&gt;modeling and estimation errors is an issue of critical importance for&lt;br/&gt;financial optimization problems because of the serious consequences&lt;br/&gt;of making wrong bets! Surprisingly, however, robust optimization has&lt;br/&gt;not been widely explored in financial engineering. The research&lt;br/&gt;proposed here formulates robust dynamical models for financial&lt;br/&gt;problems and develops semidefinite rogramming based methods for&lt;br/&gt;solving them. These models systematically account for parameter&lt;br/&gt;uncertainty and robustly update error-bounds as more information&lt;br/&gt;becomes available over time. In addition, the project extends the&lt;br/&gt;semidefinite relaxation methodology to probabilistically robust&lt;br/&gt;optimization problems that naturally emerge in the financial context.&lt;br/&gt;The other research focus of this proposal is on developing&lt;br/&gt;semidefinite models for graph theoretic problems such as the&lt;br/&gt;traveling salesman problem and network design. These models employ&lt;br/&gt;linear matrix inequalities (LM ) to represent geometric&lt;br/&gt;constraints, such as graph connectivity, specified number of&lt;br/&gt;edge/vertex disjoint paths, etc. The optimization problems resulting&lt;br/&gt;from these LM models are, typically, mixed integer semidefinite&lt;br/&gt;programs, i.e. semidefinite programs where some of the decision&lt;br/&gt;variables are constrained to be integers. Currently, mixed&lt;br/&gt;semidefinite programs are appproximately solved by relaxing the&lt;br/&gt;integrality constraints. However, as computational ower increases and&lt;br/&gt;the interior point methods for solving semidefinite programs become&lt;br/&gt;more efficient, the PI expects that there would be a push for&lt;br/&gt;developing systematic methods of tightening the relaxations - as in&lt;br/&gt;the case of linear programming relaxations of mixed integer programs.&lt;br/&gt;As a first step in this direction, the PI proposes to develop several&lt;br/&gt;cutting lane strategies for mixed semidefinite programs. Although the&lt;br/&gt;problems of interest to the PI belong to disparate application areas,&lt;br/&gt;they are linked in that linear matrix inequalities and semidefinite&lt;br/&gt;programming provide the necessary tools to efficiently model and&lt;br/&gt;solve them. The education component of this proposal includes&lt;br/&gt;developing a sequence of graduate courses on engineering applications&lt;br/&gt;of optimization. These courses would fill an important gap in the&lt;br/&gt;curriculum of the Deppartment by providing students with a firm&lt;br/&gt;theoretical and practical grounding in optimization. The World Wide&lt;br/&gt;Web will be extensively used in these courses. All the teaching&lt;br/&gt;material will be available on the web. The PI will develop Java-based&lt;br/&gt;applets for all the examples used in the courses which would allow&lt;br/&gt;students to experiment with these examples in real time. Also, the&lt;br/&gt;optimization resources on the web will be integrated into the&lt;br/&gt;curriculum. This should be particularly useful to students from&lt;br/&gt;industry who would take the courses over the Video Network. To expose&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate students to research, the PI plans to organize an&lt;br/&gt;interdisciplinary research program in optimization and its&lt;br/&gt;applications. To facilitate industry outreach, the PI plans to&lt;br/&gt;implement the results of the proposed research into a software&lt;br/&gt;package and publish expository articles on the applications of the&lt;br/&gt;new techniques. The PI expects that the availability of a user&lt;br/&gt;friendly software will spur further applications and encourage&lt;br/&gt;industrial collaboration.</AbstractNarration>
