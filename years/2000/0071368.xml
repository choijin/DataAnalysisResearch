<AbstractNarration>The investigator will model and analyze a class of physical&lt;br/&gt;problems arising in microwave processing of ceramics.  These problems&lt;br/&gt;give rise to challenging nonlinear initial boundary value problems&lt;br/&gt;for partial differential equations. Their mathematical formulation involves &lt;br/&gt;one or more nonlinear parabolic equations, governing  the diffusion of heat and&lt;br/&gt;the diffusion of a chemical concentration, and the time harmonic&lt;br/&gt;version of Maxwells equations, governing the propagation of electromagnetic waves.  &lt;br/&gt;These equations are coupled together in a nonlinear fashion and, in &lt;br/&gt;addition, nonlinear heat balances are required in certain applications &lt;br/&gt;where surface temperatures produce significant thermal radiation.  &lt;br/&gt;Kriegsmann will develop and use asymptotic methods, dictated &lt;br/&gt;by certain physical limits, to simplify the mathematical systems and &lt;br/&gt;develop and use numerical methods to solve the reduced problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of the work supported with this award are twofold.  The first is &lt;br/&gt;the mathematical understanding of the basic physical mechanisms which &lt;br/&gt;make microwave processing work.  Such an understanding will give scientists &lt;br/&gt;and engineers involved in microwave processing of ceramics more basic scientific&lt;br/&gt;underpinnings to judge and interpret their experimental findings.&lt;br/&gt;The second goal is the development and application of asymptotic, numerical,&lt;br/&gt;and other approximate methods required to obtain an accurate description&lt;br/&gt;of more realistic and complicated processes. The successful completion&lt;br/&gt;of the planned research will allow engineers and scientists to design&lt;br/&gt;more efficient sintering and joining processes for ceramics which will allow &lt;br/&gt;them to produce higher quality materials.   It will also help in the design&lt;br/&gt;and implementation of microwave assisted vapor deposition processes&lt;br/&gt;which are highly promising in the construction of composite ceramic&lt;br/&gt;materials&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
