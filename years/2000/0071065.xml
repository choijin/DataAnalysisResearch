    <AbstractNarration>Arithmetic of L-values&lt;br/&gt;PI: Glenn Stevens Proposal 0071065&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator proposes to continue his work on special&lt;br/&gt;values of L-functions and their relation to arithmetic geometry.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research would improve our understanding of both&lt;br/&gt;automorphic forms and p-adic cohomology by providing new tools for&lt;br/&gt;studying the former and by providing concrete examples of the latter.&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the research would extend the applicability of Explicit&lt;br/&gt;Reciprocity Laws to include p-adic analytic families of galois&lt;br/&gt;representations. This, in turn, would provide a new tool for&lt;br/&gt;studying the arithmetic properties of two-variable p-adic&lt;br/&gt;L-functions. It would also clarify how analytic families of galois&lt;br/&gt;representations degenerate at semistable non-crystalline points and&lt;br/&gt;would describe monodromy at such points in terms of a deformation in&lt;br/&gt;the weight direction, thus enlarging the standard picture of&lt;br/&gt;monodromy in potentially useful ways. This research would also&lt;br/&gt;complement Kato's recent work on values of L-functions and K-theory of&lt;br/&gt;modular curves by providing tools for deforming Kato's theory in&lt;br/&gt;p-adic analytic families. In related work, the PI hopes to develop&lt;br/&gt;a p-adic Eichler-Shimura correspondence that would relate his&lt;br/&gt;theory of overconvergent modular symbols to Katz's theory of&lt;br/&gt;overconvergent modular forms and to construct analytic families of&lt;br/&gt;non-ordinary half-integral weight modular forms by generalizing a&lt;br/&gt;p-adic theta lifting developed in earlier work of the PI. Finally,&lt;br/&gt;the PI intends to generalize these ideas to automorphic forms on&lt;br/&gt;other reductive algebraic groups. This research offers promising&lt;br/&gt;tools for the construction of p-adic analytic families of&lt;br/&gt;non-ordinary automorphic representations together with natural&lt;br/&gt;deformation spaces of Galois representations, and&lt;br/&gt;multivariable p-adic L-functions. This is connected with a&lt;br/&gt;number of investigations, including p-adic monodromy, Jochnowitz's&lt;br/&gt;conjectures on the square root of the theta operator, and the&lt;br/&gt;p-adic deformation theory of Galois representations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigations of this proposal belong to the general&lt;br/&gt;mathematical area of Arithmetic Geometry. This ultramodern research&lt;br/&gt;area combines two of the oldest branches of mathematics: number&lt;br/&gt;theory and geometry. New insights arising out of this&lt;br/&gt;combination are producing increasingly powerful tools to solve&lt;br/&gt;longstanding problems like Fermat's Last Theorem, which have&lt;br/&gt;resisted the strongest efforts of over three centuries of&lt;br/&gt;mathematicians. In addition, though Arithmetic Geometry is sometimes&lt;br/&gt;regarded as the purest of pure mathematics, it has also been&lt;br/&gt;developing insightful new techniques leading to dramatic progress in&lt;br/&gt;such applied areas as error-correcting codes and cryptography.</AbstractNarration>
