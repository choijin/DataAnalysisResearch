<AbstractNarration>Geology (42) &lt;br/&gt;Faculty from geology, biology, and chemistry are incorporating use of a Low-Vacuum Scanning Electron Microscope with Energy Dispersive Spectrometer (LV-SEM/EDS) into undergraduate science laboratories and research experiences. Scanning electron microscopy is an accessible technique for undergraduates and provides an important means for hands-on learning. The goals of this project are to: 1) develop students' skills of observation and analysis while using technologically-advanced equipment in coursework and research; 2) foster collaborative learning through development and implementation of learner-centered laboratories and experiments; and 3) promote interdisciplinary work and exchange of ideas between and within different groups of student and faculty researchers. To meet these goals, several discovery-based activities involving image and compositional analysis of a variety of specimens (e.g., minerals, rocks, microfossils, semiconductors, plankton, synthetic crystals, and gunshot residue) are being implemented in courses across the curriculum (e.g., introductory through advanced courses in geology, biology, and chemistry). The project adapts curricular aspects of programs at Western Kentucky University, Hamilton College, Middlebury College, and Bowdoin College. Overall, the instrument is being incorporated into 15 courses throughout the science curriculum. Undergraduate students are working closely with faculty to prepare specific laboratory exercises. These student assistants are responsible for aiding the instructor in writing exercises, performing calibrations, acquiring images, and developing laboratory instructions. Exercises focussing on discovery of critical concepts and interpretation of data involve a wide variety of phenomena, including compositional variation in minerals, flow textures in volcanic rocks, plant morphology, surface degradation in fossil remains, microstructures in deformed rocks, peptide-mineral adhesion, and textures of metal oxide films. Students working interdependently on these projects in small, self-selected groups, are seeking a deeper understanding of course material in addition to developing a clear understanding of the physical principles basic to SEM. The results of this project are to be made available to the public and colleagues at other institutions through the world wide web, journal articles, and presentations at professional meetings. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
