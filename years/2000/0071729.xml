    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0071729&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Brian Smyth&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is predominantly concerned with qualitative aspects&lt;br/&gt;of the theory of surfaces as well as its application to the&lt;br/&gt;construction of a complete theory of equilibria for the general&lt;br/&gt;elastic membrane. The work on surface theory is uncovering&lt;br/&gt;previously unsuspected qualitative behavior of the principal&lt;br/&gt;foliations near an isolated singularity (umbilic) in a smooth&lt;br/&gt;surface in space, which strikingly distinguishes them from&lt;br/&gt;general foliations. This behavior explains the Caratheodory&lt;br/&gt;conjecture and, in many cases, proves the conjecture as a mere&lt;br/&gt;numerical consequence. The work on elastic membranes establishes&lt;br/&gt;the equilibrium equation of the most general stretched elastic&lt;br/&gt;membrane in equilibrium under an applied force field --- a&lt;br/&gt;far-reaching generalization of the classical Young-Laplace&lt;br/&gt;equation which was only valid for isotropic membranes. The&lt;br/&gt;context for this work is the unit circle bundle of the membrane&lt;br/&gt;surface equipped with the canonical lift (Sasaki metric) of the&lt;br/&gt;induced metric on the membrane surface; the key idea is the&lt;br/&gt;construction of a vector-valued 1-form on this bundle which&lt;br/&gt;completely encodes the responding forces of surface tension set&lt;br/&gt;up within the membrane.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Surfaces are mathematical entities which are fundamental to the&lt;br/&gt;understanding of the structure of matter in physics, chemistry&lt;br/&gt;and biology. The surface at the interface of two different types&lt;br/&gt;of matter is frequently modeled by an elastic membrane. An&lt;br/&gt;observer of an elastic membrane in equilibrium can see the shape&lt;br/&gt;of the membrane, understand the forces that are being applied and&lt;br/&gt;even measure the average surface tension but has no idea of the&lt;br/&gt;responding forces of surface tension set up within the&lt;br/&gt;membrane. This work reveals the precise relationship between&lt;br/&gt;these observables and the internal surface tension forces for the&lt;br/&gt;general membrane. It follows that the response is never entirely&lt;br/&gt;predictable from the observables (membrane geometry, applied&lt;br/&gt;force, average surface tension) but that a certain core behavior&lt;br/&gt;is determined --- except for a very remarkable family of&lt;br/&gt;membranes (whose exceptional nature is defined solely by their&lt;br/&gt;geometry and not their physics) which live by a different set of&lt;br/&gt;rules. By example, it is shown that the common ad hoc assumptions&lt;br/&gt;of isotropy are seriously flawed. The authors' work on the&lt;br/&gt;principal foliations of surfaces has already provided a key&lt;br/&gt;result which has been applied by Rozoy to settle a long-standing&lt;br/&gt;problem on the symmetry of a liquid ball in general relativity,&lt;br/&gt;as well as relating streamlines of a plane fluid flow to surface&lt;br/&gt;theory.</AbstractNarration>
