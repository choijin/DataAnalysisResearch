<AbstractNarration>0091286  Ronald B. Emeson and Carlyle B. Storm&lt;br/&gt;A Gordon Research Conference on RNA Editing is planned for January 21-26, 2001 at the Doubletree Hotel in Ventura, California.  RNA editing is the co- or post-transcriptional modification of RNA which results in the insertion, deletion or substitution of nucleotides.  RNA editing can therefore correct, extend or diversify the information encoded within the corresponding genomic sequence and can dramatically alter the function of the modified RNAs.  For example, editing events within the mammalian central nervous system can increase the diversity of neurotransmitter receptor expression and serve to effectively modulate neuronal signaling pathways.  Equally significant is the cellular regulation of many of the RNA editing processes which provides for developmental, tissue-specific and metabolic fine tuning of protein function and biochemical pathways.  The understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying RNA editing and their biological occurrence has reached a critical stage where cross-fertilization of hypotheses and experimental approaches is essential for focus in the next decade of research. The biological significance of RNA editing is a recurring theme throughout all aspects of the conference.  There are many common questions and experimental goals among investigators of RNA editing despite the diversity of organisms wherein editing occurs, and the apparent dissimilarities in sequences which are modified.  Important to the understanding of every editing system is a basic description of the RNA substrates that are modified by these processes.  Similarly, questions of general interest concerning the mechanism, specificity, fidelity and processivity of RNA editing can be addressed with a combination of biochemical and molecular biological techniques coupled with the development of in vitro editing systems.  The cellular and molecular aspects of RNA editing regulation are also broadly being pursued at the level of evolution as well as the occurrence of editing activities in different tissues and during development. Finally, information about other forms of RNA processing is likely to have implications for understanding RNA editing mechanisms, and vice versa.</AbstractNarration>
