    <AbstractNarration>The focus of this research is to better understand the chemistry of organolithium reagents. Major efforts will be undertaken in the following areas: the mechanism of the metal-halogen exchange and related reactions, the structure of allenyl-propargyllithium reagents, the configurational stability of chiral organolithium reagents, the effect of polar cosolvents on organolithium structure and reactivity, the nature and consequences of chelation, and the role of electrophilic catalysts and ion pair structure in organolithium reactions. The research is enhanced by the use of detailed Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) studies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this renewal award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. Hans J. Reich of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. Professor Reich will focus his work on gaining a mechanistic understanding of important reactions and processes in organolithium chemistry. The experiments will be carried out under conditions in which they are used by synthetic chemists so that the results will have direct impact on a broad array of users. The research also offers an excellent training opportunity for graduate students.</AbstractNarration>
