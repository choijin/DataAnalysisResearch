<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;                           &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;   Polynomials pervade mathematics. Virtually every branch of mathematics,&lt;br/&gt;from algebraic number theory and algebraic geometry to applied analysis,&lt;br/&gt;Fourier analysis, and computer science, has its corpus of theory arising &lt;br/&gt;from the study of polynomials. This project intends to study polynomial  &lt;br/&gt;inequalities and their applications in classical analysis, approximation &lt;br/&gt;theory, orthogonal polynomials, and number theory. The proposed research &lt;br/&gt;is about polynomials in a general sense, so it includes Chebyshev spaces, &lt;br/&gt;Markov spaces, Descartes systems, Muntz polynomials, rational function &lt;br/&gt;spaces, as well as polynomials with various constraints such as restricted &lt;br/&gt;zeros, integer coefficients, and nonnegative coefficients in various bases.  &lt;br/&gt;The project continues several years of successful work on a variety of &lt;br/&gt;topics and describes various new directions.        &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;   The polynomial is one of the most basic concepts of mathematics. Throughout&lt;br/&gt;history people have found problems concerning polynomials especially fascinating.  &lt;br/&gt;Each of the ``three famous problems'' in the ``Heroic Age'' dealt with zeros of &lt;br/&gt;polynomials: squaring the circle, duplicating the cube, and trisecting an  &lt;br/&gt;angle. Historically, questions relating to polynomials, for example, the solution&lt;br/&gt;of polynomial equations, gave rise to some of the most important problems of&lt;br/&gt;the day. Besides the natural intellectual interest in them, polynomials, and in&lt;br/&gt;particular extremal problems involving polynomials, arise not only in&lt;br/&gt;almost every field of mathematics, but also in other sciences, especially &lt;br/&gt;in engineering. However, it is often the case that polynomials related to a practical &lt;br/&gt;problem belong to a restricted class. Depending on the nature of the &lt;br/&gt;problem, some additional pieces of information on the polynomial may be known. &lt;br/&gt;For filter design, polynomials with coefficients from {-1,0,1} are very useful, &lt;br/&gt;because, if they are used, then the filter can be implemented without  &lt;br/&gt;the use of multiplications; their implementation requires only additions &lt;br/&gt;and subtractions. This reduces the cost of implementation. The problem is &lt;br/&gt;to find such polynomials which have a ``lowpass'' behavior on the unit &lt;br/&gt;circle of the complex plane. Roughly, that is, they approximate 1 in a &lt;br/&gt;neighborhood of 1 and approximate 0 in a neighborhood of -1. The project plans  &lt;br/&gt;to study extremal properties of polynomials with coefficients from {-1,0,1}&lt;br/&gt;{0,1}, and {-1,1}. Unimodular polynomials (when the coefficients are complex numbers &lt;br/&gt;of modulus 1) are also important in engineering. In some other problems related &lt;br/&gt;to physics, in particular electrostatics, information about the distribution of  &lt;br/&gt;the zeros of the polynomial is known. ``Gaped'' polynomials (polynomials&lt;br/&gt;with a large number of zero coefficients) are used to analyze, for example,&lt;br/&gt;the time-optimal boundary controls for the one-dimensional heat equation. &lt;br/&gt;The proposal intends to explore further applications of polynomial inequalities&lt;br/&gt;as well as to offer a systematic study of naturally arising questions regarding &lt;br/&gt;polynomials subject to various constraints.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
