<AbstractNarration>This award is a collaborative research among researchers from the City College of New York (CCNY), the University of Tokyo, and the Kyoto University, Japan.  The objective of this project is to develop a new and advanced semi-active  electromagnetic shape-memory alloy friction damper for protecting buildings and other civil infrastructures against strong winds and earthquakes. The new semi-active electromagnetic shape-memory alloy friction damper to be developed has significant advantages and potential over other semi-active control systems currently under development. Specific objectives of this project are: (i) to develop a semi-active electromagnetic friction damper, (ii) to develop a semi-active electromagnetic shape-memory alloy friction damper, (iii) to demonstrate the performance of the proposed advanced semi-active friction dampers developed in (i) and (ii), and to verify the theoretical results using a 1/4 scaled 5-story building model on the shaking table at the City College of New York, and (iv) to demonstrate the application of the proposed semi-active friction dampers on a full-scale 5-story frame building at the Disaster Prevention Research Institute, Kyoto, Japan. It is mentioned that the budget for the proposed research doesn't include the cost to manufacture the proposed semi-active electromagnetic shape-memory alloy friction damper. &lt;br/&gt;The proposed damper device for the 1/4 scaled and full-scale testing will be manufactured using small research grants from the Professional Staff Congress of the City University of New York (PSC-CUNY) and the start-up funds of the PI. The semi-active electromagnetic shape-memory alloy friction damper to be developed is inherently nonlinear. Effective and practical control strategies will be investigated and developed, in particular with respect to the demand of near-field earthquakes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The device is applicable not only to the new constructions but also to the retrofit of deteriorated structures. The results of this research project are expected to make a significant advancement for the state-of-the-technology in auto-adaptive media based protective systems for civil infrastructures. The benefit derived from this research project in urban earthquake disaster mitigation is not limited to US and Japan, but also&lt;br/&gt;many countries in the world.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
