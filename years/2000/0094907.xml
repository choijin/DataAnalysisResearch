<AbstractNarration>The specific project objectives of the program include: (i) promoting diversity and increase the numbers of minority students enrolling in, and completing degrees in computer science, engineering and mathematics; (ii) expanding the pool of minority talent that have suffered from a long- standing under- utilization for industry, government, and academia (i. e., Ph. D. holders); (iii) improving the educational experiences of students through connections of academic content to the work environment and building new industry partnerships; (iv) increasing enrollment of academically- gifted students from community colleges; (v) encouraging scholarship recipients to pursue advanced degrees; and (vi) providing mentor programs that allow students to devote more time to their degree programs as opposed to working on non- discipline jobs. The goals of the program are being accomplished by: (i) Recruitment; (ii) Academic support to provide participants the tools necessary to succeed; (iii) A retention program, which relies heavily on the positive impact of mentors and academic contracts that include professional development of the scholars; (iv) Building on the existing infrastructure for student and industry support within the University as well as local community colleges; (v) Establishing faculty mentors in every department to provide one- on- one mentoring by experienced faculty and peers; (vi) Requiring the Scholars to participate in research and design projects for presentation at professional meetings and industry- sponsored workshops; (vii) Maintaining records on the Scholars: progress toward degree, research experiences, design projects, resume, career goals, work portfolios, mentoring activities, professional development opportunities, job interviews, graduate school applications, the change in the number of minority students transferring in; and (viii) Initiating an exit interview process to evaluates the effectiveness of scholarship programs. The grant award acts as a catalyst to reinforce other curricula enhancement programs. The scholarship program provides leadership training and experience, and a controlled academic process for low- income students to insure successful graduation and entrance to graduate school when desired. The scholarship program builds on several existing programs that help students achieve academic success.</AbstractNarration>
