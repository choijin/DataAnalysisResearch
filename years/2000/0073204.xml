    <AbstractNarration>0073204&lt;br/&gt;Sytsma &amp; Hall&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project explores evolution of floral morphology in the plant family Capparaceae from two different perspectives: (1) genealogy or phylogenetic relationships and (2) developmental biology. Using differences in DNA sequences and morphology, genealogical relationships within this family and its close relative Brassicaceae (mustard family) will be analyzed. This analysis will provide the framework for more detailed studies of two African genera, entailing intensive field work and developmental studies of floral buds. Patterns of development will lead to formulation of explicit hypotheses of possible genes that may be responsible for smaller scale changes in floral form, utlizing the wealth of knowledge gleaned from the model organism, Arabidopsis (Brassicaceae). Pollination field studies will also be conducted to evaluate roles that pollinators may have in changes in floral form. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There have been great advances made in our knowledge of phylogenetic relationships of plants and on developmental genetics of flowers. In general, these fields have evolved independently of one another. Phylogenies are powerful tools for exploring evolution of floral form and, at the same time, developmental studies provide a genetic model for changes in floral forms of model organisms. Combination of these fields permits exploration of underlying genetic mechanisms for evolution of morphological variation.</AbstractNarration>
