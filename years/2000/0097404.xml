<AbstractNarration>The Center for Neuroscience at the University of Pittsburgh (CNUP) will train eight to twelve undergraduate students each summer in its ten-week Neuroscience Research Experience for Undergraduates (Neuroscience REU). The main focus of the Neuroscience REU will be full-time student involvement in laboratory research under the guidance and supervision of CNUP faculty mentors.  Students will experience the challenges and rewards of intensive, hypothesis-driven laboratory research in molecular, cellular, and systems-level neuroscience.  The Program aims to encourage a broad and diversified pool of talented students to consider careers in neuroscience research, and will provide the laboratory experience that is necessary for students to compete successfully for admission to neuroscience graduate training programs.  Consequently, the Program particularly seeks applicants from students at liberal arts colleges and other academic institutions with limited neuroscience research opportunities.  The Neuroscience REU will officially begin in early June.  A weekly "Research Breakfast" seminar series will expose students to a variety of neuroscience topics and technical approaches.  During the summer, students will receive workshop training in research ethics, and will learn how to make effective oral presentations, write a research abstract, and get into graduate school.  Research projects will foster a close collaboration between mentor and student, and will provide a hands-on preview of career opportunities in neuroscience research and education.  Students will learn many of the skills necessary to perform research, such as proper formulation of experimental strategy and appropriate documentation and analysis of data.  At the end of the 10-week Program, students will formally present the results of their training experience at a colloquium of participating students and mentors.  The Neuroscience REU will accept applications from full-time undergraduate students who are enrolled at a four-year accredited college in the United States, and who have successfully completed at least one year of study in neuroscience and/or related college coursework (e.g., biology, chemistry, psychology, mathematics).  Interested students should complete an application form and write a personal statement describing their interest in the Neuroscience REU.  Applicants also must have two letters of recommendation sent from faculty at their home institution who are familiar with their qualifications</AbstractNarration>
