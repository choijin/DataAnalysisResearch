<AbstractNarration>This project brings together two NSF I/UCRC's to improve accelerated life testing (ALT) of vehicle electronics.  The Center for Advanced Vehicle Electronics (CAVE) of Auburn University with partner with the Quality and Reliability Engineering (QRE) Center of Rutgers University and Arizona State University to investigate the relationship between wear, degradation and failure of vehicle controllers as experienced in the field with that expected by the results of ALT conducted in the laboratory.  DaimlerChrysler Electronics of Huntsville, Alabama supplies the test bed.  Vehicle electronics are subject to stress due to temperature, humidity, cycling and other environmental hazards.  The materials that comprise the controllers are susceptible to the effects of corrosion and oxidation.  The solder that connects the controller components can crack due to fatigue and creep under high temperature and thermal cycling stresses.  These failures affect the performance of the vehicle from slightly to severely.  The research of this project will develop a general methodology for specifying accelerated life tests so that they result in an accurate characterization of the degradation and failures that will be experienced in the filed.  The failure mechanisms for the assembly materials in field units will be investigated in the development of the accelerated life tests.  ALT standards, which new units must pass prior to marketing, will be adequate without being overly conservative, potentially allowing new designs and new materials to be used in vehicle electronics.</AbstractNarration>
