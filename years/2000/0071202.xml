<AbstractNarration>DMS-0071202&lt;br/&gt;Julius L. Shaneson &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most of the proposal concerns applications of relations&lt;br/&gt;between continuous and discrete summation in higher &lt;br/&gt;dimensions.  Such a relation is called an Euler-MacLaurin &lt;br/&gt;formula, and describes how to sum a function over a set of&lt;br/&gt;lattice points in a geometric region in terms of integrals &lt;br/&gt;of the function and its derivatives on the region and parts &lt;br/&gt;of the boundary.  For polynomial functions summed on lattice &lt;br/&gt;points of a polytope with lattice point vertices, there are &lt;br/&gt;exact, closed formulae for doing this, due to the proposer &lt;br/&gt;and S. Cappell, obtained as  consequences of their results &lt;br/&gt;on characteristic classes of singular varieties.  For general (transcendental) functions, there are approximate formulae of &lt;br/&gt;given length, together with remainder terms involving &lt;br/&gt;differential operators whose coefficients are related to generalizations of the classical Bernoulli polynomials on &lt;br/&gt;the real line.  The capability to handle trascendental &lt;br/&gt;functions makes possible the use Euler-MacLaurin formulae &lt;br/&gt;the study the growth of the number of lattice points in smooth &lt;br/&gt;regions, such as circles or the regions under a hyperboloid, &lt;br/&gt;as the figure expands. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A lattice point can be thought of as a vertex point in a multidimensional grid or lattice-work. Results relating &lt;br/&gt;summation over such points to some continuous summation &lt;br/&gt;process, i.e. some type of integration method, can &lt;br/&gt;impact numerous applied mathematics problems, including &lt;br/&gt;rapid integration schemes, problems in network capacity, and &lt;br/&gt;optimization issues in shipping and communications.  &lt;br/&gt;In addition, questions concerning the number of lattice &lt;br/&gt;points in smooth regions, especially certain very symmetric &lt;br/&gt;ones like circles or parts of hyperboloids, are well-known &lt;br/&gt;to arise in central parts of number theory, and good estimates &lt;br/&gt;on these could lead to new results on the distribution of prime &lt;br/&gt;numbers and other important questions. Finally, these counting &lt;br/&gt;methods might be good test cases for the problems ("P = NP") of logic/computer science concerning the miminum time needed &lt;br/&gt;to perform certain kinds of computations.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
