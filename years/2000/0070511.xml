<AbstractNarration>A  range of studies in measurable dynamics of are  proposed.&lt;br/&gt;They lie generally in extensions and applications of orbit equivalence methods.  The PI&lt;br/&gt;has helped to develop two general approaches here.  The first is Restricted Orbit &lt;br/&gt;Equivalence, where&lt;br/&gt;one places restrictions on the sorts of orbit preserving maps allowed.  The second,&lt;br/&gt;and new, method is an "orbit transference method" where the orbit equivalence is &lt;br/&gt;arbitrary&lt;br/&gt;but measurable with respect to an algebra orthogonal to the algebra of interest.   &lt;br/&gt;Among the&lt;br/&gt;applications proposed for these methods are:&lt;br/&gt;1) a deeper and perhaps complete understanding the the Weak Pinsker property of &lt;br/&gt;Thouvenot&lt;br/&gt;2) a version of the theory of Isometric Extensions of Bernoulli automorphism for some &lt;br/&gt;class of restricted orbit equivalences, in particular for standard dyadic reverse &lt;br/&gt;filtrations.&lt;br/&gt;3) extensions of restricted orbit equivalence beyond actions of descrete amenable &lt;br/&gt;groups to spaces of labeled random graphs, to not necessarilly descrete groups and &lt;br/&gt;to non-singular actions.  Most important here is that one should look for good examples, &lt;br/&gt;for example an entropy theory for nonsingular actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Large scale phenomena can often exhibit a random behavior. Crystals often include random inclusions.  Large data bases often (always?) &lt;br/&gt;include random errors.  The genome can be modeled as an infinite sequence of base &lt;br/&gt;pairs that in places is random and places not so.  One models such  structures in &lt;br/&gt;probabilistic terms as a space of linked nodes to which are attached labels, colors if &lt;br/&gt;you will, endowed with some notion of the probability of occurance of some particular &lt;br/&gt;local labeling or picture occuring within an infinite picture.  It is natural to look for ways of &lt;br/&gt;coding and comparing  such random arrays among themselves.   One can seek &lt;br/&gt;extremely rigid encodings that allow no  distortion of the nodes and their links, just an &lt;br/&gt;encoding of the label at a particular node to that same node in the other labeling&lt;br/&gt;of the array.   Or  more generally and interestingly  one can allow the nodes and links to &lt;br/&gt;distort as well.   By setting some control on the distortions one can craft an approach to &lt;br/&gt;understanding a variety of properties of such systems.  Although the goals of this &lt;br/&gt;proposal are of an abstract nature, one of the first such controlled distortions (called &lt;br/&gt;f-bar) was brought over from genetics where it was used as a measure of evolutionary &lt;br/&gt;relatedness among DNA molecules.   What is proposed here are a variety of &lt;br/&gt;applications of methods involving controlled distortion of such labeled arrays to &lt;br/&gt;understand such random phenomena more deeply.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
