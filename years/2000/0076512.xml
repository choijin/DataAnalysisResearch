<AbstractNarration>0076512&lt;br/&gt;Johnson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This an award is for the acquisition of a modern sample preparation equipment to prepare with minimum damage specimens of complex materials for transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The equipment will provide new opportunities and advance the current capability of the TEM facility at Caltech acquired earlier with NSF support. The new sample preparation equipment will allow reliable and controlled specimen preparation, and the reduction of specimen contamination in the electron microscope. It will facilitate investigations of micromechanisms of deformation in bulk metallic glasses, interfacial phenomena in composites and other fundamental properties of a wide range of materials. The equipment will see heavy use for a broad range of materials investigations currently and for materials research at Caltech over the next decade.  &lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;This an award is for the acquisition of a modern sample preparation equipment to prepare with minimum damage specimens of complex materials for transmission electron microscopy (TEM).
