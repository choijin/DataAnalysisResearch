    <AbstractNarration>CMS0085306&lt;br/&gt;PI: Jean-Pierre Bardet&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Southern California&lt;br/&gt;Title: "GROUND DEFORMATION DUE TO SURFACE FAULTING AND LIQUEFACTION DURING THE 1999 KOCAELI AND DUZCE, TURKEY, EARTHQUAKES"&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the 1999 Kocaeli and Duzce, Turkey, earthquakes, surface faulting&lt;br/&gt;caused substantial damage to structures and lifelines. It is the first time&lt;br/&gt;that surface faulting impacts urban and industrial areas to such an extent,&lt;br/&gt;and raises major concerns about our current practices in earthquake&lt;br/&gt;engineering. During the 1999 Kocaeli, Turkey, earthquake, there was also&lt;br/&gt;major damage due to liquefaction-induced lateral spreads and coastal&lt;br/&gt;subsidences along the coasts of the Bay of Izmit and Lake Sapanca. The&lt;br/&gt;objective of this proposed exploratory research is to measure ground&lt;br/&gt;deformations caused by surface faulting and liquefaction during the 1999&lt;br/&gt;Kocaeli and Duzce, Turkey earthquakes. This information, which will be&lt;br/&gt;disseminated to researchers and practitioners via the Internet, will&lt;br/&gt;contribute to improving models for liquefaction-induced lateral spreads and&lt;br/&gt;mitigation criteria for surface faulting effects. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed exploratory research completes the work performed immediately&lt;br/&gt;after the earthquakes by the earthquake reconnaissance teams and&lt;br/&gt;subsequently by our research collaborators in Turkey. The discontinuous&lt;br/&gt;dislocations from surface faulting have already been mapped by geologists.&lt;br/&gt;However, the continuous fields of ground strain surrounding surface&lt;br/&gt;faulting have not yet been measured. The aerial photographs taken prior and&lt;br/&gt;after the earthquakes are yet to be interpreted to yield a large-scale&lt;br/&gt;understanding of ground deformation and failure mechanisms, especially in&lt;br/&gt;stepovers between two strike-slip strands (e.g., Golcuk). The same image&lt;br/&gt;processing techniques need also to be also applied for producing maps of&lt;br/&gt;liquefaction-induced ground deformations (e.g., Sapanca Lake). The&lt;br/&gt;processing and interpretation of aerial photographs will be instrumental in&lt;br/&gt;understanding the large-scale ground deformation and failure mechanisms&lt;br/&gt;observed during the 1999 Kocaeli and Duzce, Turkey, earthquakes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of the proposed exploratory research are: (1) Compilation&lt;br/&gt;and organization of existing data on surface-faulting and&lt;br/&gt;liquefaction-induced ground deformation for the 1999 Kocaeli and Duzce,&lt;br/&gt;Turkey, earthquakes; (2) Processing of aerial photographs taken prior to&lt;br/&gt;and after the earthquakes for producing maps of permanent displacement&lt;br/&gt;vectors and settlements induced by surface faulting and liquefaction; (3)&lt;br/&gt;Collection of additional ground surveys, and data on geology and&lt;br/&gt;geotechnical soil profiles (e.g., SPT and CPT soundings) in selected areas;&lt;br/&gt;and (4) Dissemination of information collected thorough a new GIS platform&lt;br/&gt;(Internet Map Server) on the Internet.</AbstractNarration>
