<AbstractNarration>In the last few of years, the mathematicians and engineers started studying the behavior of social insects (ants, termites, bees, wasps) in an attempt to use the Swarm Intelligence concept in order to develop various Artificial Systems. The development of Artificial Systems does not entail the complete imitation of natural systems, but explores into them in search of ideas and models. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It should be noted that a large number of traditional engineering models and algorithms is based on control and centralization. On the other hand, bee or ant swarm behavior in nature is primarily characterized by autonomy and distributed functioning and self-organizing. Natural systems teach us that very simple individual organisms can form systems capable of performing highly complex tasks by dynamically interacting with each other. It is of course of great importance to investigate both advantages and disadvantages of autonomy, distributed functioning and self-organizing in relation to traditional engineering methods relying on control and centralization. The basic question about the above-mentioned characteristics of social insects that should be answered is: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can we use some principles of natural Swarm Intelligence in development of Artificial Systems aimed at solving complex problems in traffic and transportation? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this research project, models inspired by the Swarm Intelligence principles will be developed for some of the following potential applications: (a) Designing transportation networks for highways and public transportation routes through complex geographic spaces (b) Locating emergency and non-emergency facilities on the transportation networks, and (c) Vehicle fleet planning and static and dynamic routing and scheduling of vehicles and crews, with emphasis on truck operations and public transportation services. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is made under the Exploratory Research on Engineering the Transport Industries (ETI) program solicitation.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
