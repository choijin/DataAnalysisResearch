<AbstractNarration>This project focuses on achieving significant increases in the skill development of students selected for the program and implementing strategies and activities to increase the students' academic performance, retention, and graduation rates. The students are being selected based on financial needs as well as other characteristics such as motivation and communication skills. Special emphasis is being made in the selection process to ensure proper representation of low- income groups including ethnic minorities, women, and students with disabilities. Formal collaboration with the local business community and two K- 12 school districts further strengthen the program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific objectives of the Computer Science, Engineering, and Mathematics Scholarhsip (CSEMS) program are the following:&lt;br/&gt;(1) To select 40 students who have financial constraints that inhibit them, but do not prevent them, from continuing their college education, and who demonstrate a motivation to succeed. &lt;br/&gt;(2) To reduce the rate of attrition of students in the CSEMS field by developing strategies that foster retention. The strategies include individual student counseling and advisement, tutoring, career planning and placement services, and guest speakers from universities and industries. &lt;br/&gt;(3) To develop formal agreements with private industries in the area to provide student workstudy opportunities during summer months. &lt;br/&gt;(4) To improve the professional skills and marketability of the CSEMS students for entering the workforce or articulating to a four- year university or college for a higher degree. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An evaluation is being conducted including both formative and summative components. The evaluation criteria measures the outcomes of the goals established under this program, such as increased retention and graduation rates, improved academic preparation and performance of students entering and progressing through the CSEMS pipeline, and increased representation of minorities, women, and students with disabilities.</AbstractNarration>
