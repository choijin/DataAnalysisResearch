<AbstractNarration>The mission of the Center for Lasers and Plasmas for Advanced Manufacturing (LPMC) is to develop a science, engineering, and technology base for laser and plasma processing of materials, devices and systems.  Laser and Plasma processing of materials is used in various manufacturing sectors such as semiconductor/electronic manufacturing , aerospace, automotive, general manufacturing, life science products, medical device manufacturing.  The focus of this center in the area of lasers and plasma processing will include:  bulk processing, surface processing, coatings, surface etching and patterning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The center will build upon the on going large number of industrial projects and state supported center for plasma and photon processing at the Applied Research Center.  This center will also take full advantage of being sited next to Free Electron Laser Facility of Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility.  The Free Electron Laser Facility is the world's most powerful, tunable laser, currently delivering kilowatt average power in the mid-infrared.  The lead institution is Old Dominion University and partner institutions are Christopher Newport University, College of William and Mary and Norfolk State University (historically black college and university).&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
