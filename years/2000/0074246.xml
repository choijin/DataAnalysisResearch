<AbstractNarration> There are three areas of research in the project ``Theory and Applications&lt;br/&gt; of Multigrid and Domain Decomposition Methods''.  The first area concerns&lt;br/&gt; the additive multigrid convergence theory, which is effective in analyzing &lt;br/&gt; the asymptotic behavior of the contraction numbers of multigrid algorithms&lt;br/&gt; with respect to the number of smoothing steps for boundary value problems &lt;br/&gt; with less than full elliptic  regularity.  The seminal result obtained by &lt;br/&gt; the PI for V-cycle algorithm with Richardson relaxation as the smoother will &lt;br/&gt; be extended to general smoothers, nonconforming finite elements,  the mixed &lt;br/&gt; formulation and the F-cycle algorithm.  The second area involves multigrid &lt;br/&gt; methods for stress intensity factors and singular solutions.  These are &lt;br/&gt; methods that can take advantage of the form of the solution of the boundary &lt;br/&gt; value problem in the regions where it does not have full elliptic regularity. &lt;br/&gt; Using this approach, usual quasi-optimal convergence rates have been obtained &lt;br/&gt; for simple finite elements on simple grids for boundary value problems on &lt;br/&gt; two-dimensional domains with reentrant corners or cracks.  The technically &lt;br/&gt; more challenging interface problems and three dimensional problems will be &lt;br/&gt; investigated in this project.  The third area is the analysis of the Finite &lt;br/&gt; Element Tearing and Interconnecting (FETI) method, a nonoverlapping domain &lt;br/&gt; decomposition method in which the (pseudo) inverse of the Schur complement &lt;br/&gt; matrix has to be preconditioned.  The goal of this part of the project is to   &lt;br/&gt; carry out an  analysis of the FETI method and some of its variants within the&lt;br/&gt; framework of additive Schwarz preconditioners, and to investigate&lt;br/&gt; new mechanisms for the global communication among the subdomains. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The methods analyzed in this project are efficient algorithms for the &lt;br/&gt; numerical solution of partial differential equations.  Such equations&lt;br/&gt; are extremely important in science and engineering since they are the&lt;br/&gt; governing equations for most physical phenomena. Part of the research &lt;br/&gt; involves the fast computation of stress intensity factors, which are &lt;br/&gt; essential indicators in fracture mechanics.  The FETI method to be&lt;br/&gt; studied in this project has already been implemented for large scale &lt;br/&gt; engineering problems using parallel supercomputers with up to a thousand &lt;br/&gt; processors.  The advances resulting from this project will therefore &lt;br/&gt; have an impact on many areas of science and technology, such as aerospace  &lt;br/&gt; engineering, fracture prediction and fluid flow problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
