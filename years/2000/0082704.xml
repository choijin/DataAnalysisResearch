    <AbstractNarration>SES 0082704&lt;br/&gt;PI: Alberto Palloni, Miguel Ceballos&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This longitudinal project studies health statistics of Mexican immigrants to Chicago, in an attempt to understand a demographic and epidemiological paradox. Despite generally better health care available in the U.S. than in Mexico, many health statistics are worse for long-term Mexican immigrants than they are for short-term immigrants. Most earlier studies of this paradox have been cross-sectional rather than longitudinal. This project uses a variety of new data sources: retrospective surveys, bimonthly clinic follow-ups, medical records, and state statistics related to health. About 300 migrants will be interviewed about their health, health practices, and services they may have used over the past ten years. Data from this study will be supplemented by other data from national samples, including the National Longitudinal Study of Youth. Analyses will include hazard models for several health outcomes: infant health, birth weight, and mortality in first year.</AbstractNarration>
