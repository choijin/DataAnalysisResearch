<AbstractNarration>0099649&lt;br/&gt;Sawyer&lt;br/&gt;This SGER award will support a feasibility study of the effect of nanoparticle strenghthening of polymers for tribological applications.  There are strong indications that polymers filled with hard nanoparticles&lt;br/&gt;will exhibit significant improvements in tribological performance as&lt;br/&gt;compared to traditional filled polymers.  Polymers are widely used in&lt;br/&gt;bearing applications because they provide quiet continuous operation, have a&lt;br/&gt;low coefficient of friction, absorb vibrations, are compliant and&lt;br/&gt;non-abrasive to the counterface, can be easily manufactured, are&lt;br/&gt;inexpensive, non-corrosive, and are generally biocompatible.  The challenge&lt;br/&gt;in designing bearings with homogeneous polymeric materials is their low wear&lt;br/&gt;resistance (high wear rates).  Hard filler particles are frequently added to&lt;br/&gt;improve the wear resistance, however these hard filler particles increase&lt;br/&gt;the abrasive wear to the counterface and increase the sliding coefficient of&lt;br/&gt;friction.  Lubricious fillers are also added to polymers and under certain&lt;br/&gt;operating conditions can reduce the wear rate and the coefficient of&lt;br/&gt;friction, however a constant supply of lubricous filler must be available at&lt;br/&gt;the wear surface and these materials are frequently sensitive to the&lt;br/&gt;environment.  The ideal filler for polymers would be inert, reinforcing,&lt;br/&gt;non-abrasive, and reduce the coefficient of friction.  There is good&lt;br/&gt;evidence that nanoparticle filled polymers may be this 'ideal' composite.&lt;br/&gt;For example, recent studies have shown that the wear resistance can increase&lt;br/&gt;in polymer composites filled with hard nanoparticles, while at the same time&lt;br/&gt;the wear of the counterbody decreases and the sliding coefficient of&lt;br/&gt;friction decreases.  This type of tribological behavior will have an impact&lt;br/&gt;in polymeric bearings covering the spectrum from industrial applications&lt;br/&gt;needing dry sliding bearings, to orthopaedic implant materials, to&lt;br/&gt;self-lubricating bearings for space environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to design composites with the optimum properties and predict&lt;br/&gt;performance, however, some severe limitations must be overcome.  First, our&lt;br/&gt;understanding of the mechanisms contributing to wear performance in filled&lt;br/&gt;polymers is poor.  For example, the role of the filler / matrix interface&lt;br/&gt;and the effect of particle size has not been well studied nor are there&lt;br/&gt;appropriate models that consider the interface or size of the filler.&lt;br/&gt;Secondly, it is unclear for non-lubricious nanoparticles what the mechanism&lt;br/&gt;is that lowers the coefficient of friction.  Finally, nanoparticle filled&lt;br/&gt;polymers have not comprehensively explored for wear applications despite the&lt;br/&gt;strong evidence suggesting large improvements in performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall scientific goal of the project is to gain a fundamental&lt;br/&gt;understanding of the wear mechanisms in filled polymers by a) experimentally&lt;br/&gt;isolating the effects of particle size (10 nm to 10 micrometers), particle&lt;br/&gt;aspect ratio (1 to 1000), dispersion, filler / matrix interface, and matrix&lt;br/&gt;properties on performance, and 2) obtaining a parametric understanding of&lt;br/&gt;the correlation between wear behavior and other mechanical properties, 3)&lt;br/&gt;modeling of the wear properties.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
