<AbstractNarration>In the past fifteen years, researchers have developed new algorithms&lt;br/&gt;for machine learning (computer programs that learn from experience)&lt;br/&gt;that have excellent theoretical guarantees on their error.  These&lt;br/&gt;so-called multiplicative weight update algorithms receive inputs (like&lt;br/&gt;an image taken by a robot), and make a prediction as to whether or not&lt;br/&gt;that image came from a particular location.  The theoretical error&lt;br/&gt;bounds imply that the number of mistakes made by these algorithms is&lt;br/&gt;guaranteed to be very small.  However, many applications of these&lt;br/&gt;algorithms require an enormous amount of time to learn and predict.&lt;br/&gt;Thus special techniques must be employed to make them efficient.  The&lt;br/&gt;investigators study new, general, theoretical techniques to make these&lt;br/&gt;algorithms faster.  This research also involves empirically evaluating&lt;br/&gt;such algorithms in new areas, including computational biology, which is&lt;br/&gt;studied extensively at the investigators' university.  Applying&lt;br/&gt;theoretical techniques to real problems creates a better understanding&lt;br/&gt;of the real-world problems and helps direct future theoretical work,&lt;br/&gt;guiding the transfer of results from theory to practice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the investigators study multiplicative weight-update&lt;br/&gt;algorithms such as Weighted Majority (WM) and Winnow, which have&lt;br/&gt;on-line mistake bounds with a logarithmic dependence on N, the total&lt;br/&gt;number of features.  This attribute efficiency allows them to be&lt;br/&gt;applied to problems where N is exponential in the input size, yielding&lt;br/&gt;great flexibility in their application areas.  Such areas include&lt;br/&gt;pruning decision trees, pruning ensembles of classifiers, learning&lt;br/&gt;finite geometric concepts, learning DNF formulas, and using&lt;br/&gt;pseudo-Bayesian predictors over finite hypothesis spaces.  However, a&lt;br/&gt;large N requires techniques to efficiently compute the weighted sums of&lt;br/&gt;these algorithms.  This research explores methods to overcome this&lt;br/&gt;difficulty, including exploiting commonalities among the features, and&lt;br/&gt;the more general approach of using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)&lt;br/&gt;methods to estimate the total weight contribution without the need for&lt;br/&gt;special structure in the problem.  The investigators also are applying&lt;br/&gt;their algorithms to various problems in computational biology,&lt;br/&gt;including drug activity prediction, analyzing microbial population&lt;br/&gt;dynamics, and identifying special types of human genes.</AbstractNarration>
