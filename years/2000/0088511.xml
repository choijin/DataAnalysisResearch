<AbstractNarration>Chemistry (12)  Computerized data acquisition is introduced in introductory chemistry laboratories through use of handheld personal computers (HPCs). This is an affordable approach that permits individual computers to be available at each student work station without crowding existing laboratory space. These computers, although much smaller than PCs, are powerful enough for most laboratory applications and operate in manner that closely matches the screen display of conventional computers. They use similar operating systems and programming languages and conventional serial data converters. Software is designed to closely match the conventional graphics windows of PCs and most experiments include Web based prelab and post lab exercises on conventional PCs, including simulations that use nearly identical commands and screen appearance. The goals are to provide a cost effective method to modify existing courses to reflect modern chemical instrumentation and the role of computers in laboratories. The types of experiments included in the curriculum and adapted for use with the HPCS are being expanded, with emphasis on selecting those with a strong visual component, such as where the data appears as a graph in a few minutes. Such short experiments permit multiple runs and allow visual comparisons of the effect of variations in experimental conditions. The program affects approximately 3000 students over the next five years and has strong potential to serve as a model at other institutions. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
