<AbstractNarration>Launched in November 1995, the University System of Maryland (USM) Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (LSAMP) is a comprehensive program that is designed to extend and increase the impact of current initiatives to increase substantially the quantity and quality of minority and other students receiving baccalaureate degrees in science, mathematics, engineering, and technology (SMET).  The proposed USM LSAMP, Phase II will continue and expand activities begun in Phase I.  It also is expected to increase the number of minority and other SMET students earning doctoral degrees and entering SMET careers, especially faculty positions.  The following SM institutions to participate as full partners in the proposed USM LSAMP, Phase II:  1) The University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC), 2) University of Maryland, College Park (UMCP); and 3) The University of Maryland, Eastern Shore (UMES), a historically black institution. Dr. Freeman Hrabowski, III, President of UMBC, will continue as the principal investigator of the proposed USM LSAMP, Phase II.  He has received national recognition for his leadership in developing innovative programs to expand education opportunities for minority SMET students.  Dr. Hrabowski received the National Science Foundation's 1994 Education Achievement Award for his outstanding commitment and dedication in the education for minorities in the fields of science and mathematics, and his latest book, Beating the Odds, focuses on the fundamentals that help Black males achieve academic excellence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also participating in the proposed USM LSAMP, Phase II will be the 18 public community colleges in Maryland.  The following community colleges are located in close proximity to the participating USM institutions and serve as the primary feeders of minority and other SMET transfer students:  1) Anne Arundel Community College; 2) Baltimore City Community College; 3) Community College of Baltimore County at Catonsville; 4)Chesapeake Community College; 5)Howard Community College; 6) Montgomery Community College; 7) Prince Georges Community College; and 8)Wor Wic Community College.  During Phase II, efforts to increase the number of minority and other SMET students transferring to USM LSAMP universities from the remaining 10 community colleges will be expanded.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In support of NSF's goal, the primary goal of the proposed USM LSAMP, Phase II is the following.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To produce approximately 574 minority SMET baccalaureate recipients by the end of the 2000-2001 academic year; approximately 648 minority SMET baccalaureate recipients by the end of the 2001-2002 school year; approximately 722 minority SMET baccalaureate recipients by the end of the 2002-2003 academic year; approximately 796 minority SMET baccalaureate recipients by the end of the 2003-2004 academic year; and approximately 887 minority SMET baccalaureate recipients by the end of the 2004-2005 academic year&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The secondary goals of the proposed USM LSAMP II are the following.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To increase the number of minority students entering SMET graduate programs.&lt;br/&gt;To increase the number of minority students entering SMET careers, especially faculty positions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based in evaluations of current and previous programs aimed at increasing minority participation in science, mathematics, engineering, and technology at the participating USM universities, the proposed USM LSAMP, Phase II's design includes the following characteristics:.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strong commitment by institutional leaders to the program's success and to its complete institutionalization beginning on January 6, 2006;&lt;br/&gt;Removal of financial barriers for minority students;&lt;br/&gt;A Summer Bridge Component;&lt;br/&gt;An Academic Year Component;&lt;br/&gt;Focus on improving knowledge and skills;&lt;br/&gt;Focus on motivation and support;&lt;br/&gt;Focus on monitoring and advising;&lt;br/&gt;Focus on academic and social interaction;&lt;br/&gt;Focus on "filter" SMET course curricula revision; and&lt;br/&gt;Involvement of feeder community colleges.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
