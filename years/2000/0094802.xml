<AbstractNarration>The Engineering Division is providing financial support to 45 students over a two- year period. These funds are used in conjunction with existing college programs to accomplish three goals: (1) increase enrollment of underrepresented groups in the engineering division, (2) improve retention rates among women and minority students within the engineering division, and (3) establish a stable cadre of women and minority students in the engineering division. In order to achieve these goals, Lafayette's Engineering Division is implementing five programs designed to complement the existing support programs. The new programs include (1) facultyalumni- administrator mentoring teams individually assembled to meet the needs of each CSEMS scholar, (2) enhanced academic support services, in particular, a big sister/ brother program, which are undertaken with the assistance of student members of the Society of Women Engineers, the Minority Scientists and Engineers Club, and Tau Beta Pi, the national engineering honors society, (3) targeted experiential engineering educational opportunities including internships and student- faculty research, (4) increased interactions with the career services staff during the students' first and second years at Lafayette, and (5) a new seminar series featuring prominent Lafayette engineering alumni.</AbstractNarration>
