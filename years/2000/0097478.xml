<AbstractNarration> The program provides a 9-week research experience designed to help student participants develop skills in the design, execution and interpretation of biological experiments and to improve their written and oral communication skills.  This experience will encourage and facilitate a career choice in scientific research.  During the program, students will work closely with faculty mentors on the identification of a project, development of an experimental design, research implementation, and dissemination of results through several on and off-campus venues.  A major role of the faculty mentors is to help students make the transition from research apprentice to independent researcher, a progression which encourages enthusiasm for research and thus a career choice in science.  Because the programmatic focus is broad (molecular biology, physiology, field ecology), emphasis will be placed on the development of collaborations between laboratories with diverse intellectual or technical foci. While the primary focus of the program is research experience, students will also participate in a variety of other activities including workshops, seminars, field trips to non-academic research sites, and symposia.  These will demonstrate the range of biological research fields and venues, and help them prepare for their careers.  During the program, all students will live on campus in university apartments and participate in social events that will promote interactions among students and faculty mentors.</AbstractNarration>
