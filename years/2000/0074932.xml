<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;CTS-0074932&lt;br/&gt;Ostafin, Agnes E.&lt;br/&gt;U. of Notre Dame&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, the physical and chemical properties of nanometer-sized&lt;br/&gt;hollow shells of silicate will be studied to provide proper foundation for their future applications in science and industry. These materials can be used to encapsulate a variety of molecules, and have real potential in a variety of applications including: development of artificial retinas, development of super high definition luminescent displays, building blocks for micro-scale electronic devices, chemical sensors, to encapsulate enzymes for use in harsh environments, and to study the&lt;br/&gt;behavior of a single molecule in a fluid environment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The realization of these applications depends on the ability to adequately manipulate shell synthesis and to understand the physical and chemical properties of the shell interior. At the conclusion of this project, the following aspects of silicate nano-shells will be better understood: 1) the control of the size and thickness of the shells 2) the shell's permeability to ions and molecules and 3) some important microscopic properties of the shell interior, such as micro-viscosity, solvent order and pH. This knowledge will be applied in the future to develop a general model for microscopic control of chemical reactions in a broad range of nano-scale systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The POWRE Award would come at an opportune time for the PI because of a recent move from a chemistry department in which the fundamental nature of physical and chemical processes are the primary concerns to a chemical engineering department in which applications are considered also important. The PI has already built experience in nano-scale particles and is in need of an opportunity to develop them into practical areas. The research will take place in the context of an emerging program in nano-scale and biological materials engineering in the Chemical Engineering Department at the University of Notre Dame. The POWRE award will enable the PI's full participation in existing and to-be-&lt;br/&gt;developed nano-scale bioengineering research initiatives that include the&lt;br/&gt;establishment of a new Materials Research Center at the University of Notre Dame. At the end of this project, the PI will be able to establish a strong and vital program in the engineering of nano-scale silicate shells for practical applications.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
