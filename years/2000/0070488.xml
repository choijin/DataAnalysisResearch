<AbstractNarration>The proposer plans to continue his work on inverse boundary problems. For&lt;br/&gt;the case of Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) he plans to consider the&lt;br/&gt;problem in which one makes electrical measurements only on part of the&lt;br/&gt;boundary. In EIT he also plans to consider the case of conductivities&lt;br/&gt;having jump type singularities as well as the identifiability problem for&lt;br/&gt;anisotropic conductors. Another inverse boundary problem that the proposer&lt;br/&gt;plans to consider is whether the geodesic distance (travel times) between&lt;br/&gt;points on the boundary of a domain or Riemannian manifold with boundary,&lt;br/&gt;satisfying certain conditions, determines uniquely the metric in the&lt;br/&gt;interior up to an isometry which is the identity on the boundary. The&lt;br/&gt;third inverse problem is the problem of Reflection Seismology. In&lt;br/&gt;particular the proposer plans to consider the problem of seismic migration&lt;br/&gt;when caustics are present and the case in which the Earth is modeled as an&lt;br/&gt;anisotropic elastic medium instead of an acoustic medium.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inverse boundary problems are a class of problems in which one seeks to&lt;br/&gt;determine the internal properties of a medium by performing measurements&lt;br/&gt;along the boundary of the medium. These inverse problems arise in many&lt;br/&gt;important physical situations, ranging from geophysics to medical imaging&lt;br/&gt;to the non-destructive evaluation of materials. The proposer plans to&lt;br/&gt;consider the case of Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT). The&lt;br/&gt;measurements in this case are voltage and current measurements from which&lt;br/&gt;one attempts to infer the internal conductivity of the medium. EIT has&lt;br/&gt;been proposed as a diagnostic tool in medicine since organs and tissues&lt;br/&gt;have quite different conductivities. Another important inverse boundary&lt;br/&gt;value problem arising in geophysics that the proposer plans to consider is&lt;br/&gt;Reflection Seismology. In this case one attempts to determine the&lt;br/&gt;substructure of the Earth by measuring the response at the surface&lt;br/&gt;produced by impulses located also on the surface. One of the main&lt;br/&gt;applications of this inverse problem is in locating hydrocarbons.Other&lt;br/&gt;potential applications are to improving ultrasound and sonar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
