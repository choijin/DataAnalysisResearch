<AbstractNarration>0002932&lt;br/&gt;Vaezy&lt;br/&gt;This project will investigate the real-time visualization of high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) therapy, using diagnostic ultrasound imaging.  HIFU is a therapeutic energy modality, capable of destroying tissues and cells in a few seconds, providing a method of treatment for benign and malignant tumors.  Due to the penetration capability of ultrasound, HIFU can be focused to a deep-seated region of tissue to treat tumors in a non-invasive approach.  The intervening tissue layers, where the ultrasound beam is unfocused and thus has low intensity, are spared from treatment.  What remains to be integrated with this therapeutic modality is a method of targeting and monitoring to provide guidance and assessment of the treatment.  The key component of a successful non-invasive application of HIFU is real-time visualization of the treatment site of HIFU to achieve image-guided therapy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Visualization of HIFU treatment site (focal point of HIFU) can be done in real-time, using commercial medical ultrasound imaging systems.  While this system allows the determination that ultrasound imaging is capable of visualizing HIFU focus, a complete integration of HIFU and ultrasound imaging systems is required to investigate the real-time visualization in complex image settings and therapeutic requirements.  The integration will be achieved using electronically-controlled HIFU and an ultrasound imaging system with open-architecture structure.  First Aim is to develop an ultrasound imaging system for real-time visualization of HIFU treatment. Second Aim is to calibrate and test the integrated system in-vitro (phantom and excised animal tissue). Third Aim is to determine the physical and biological mechanisms involved in visualization of HIFU treatment site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of the proposed project will provide the technological knowledge that would permit the development of image-guided HIFU therapy systems.  The research proposed here will also provide a knowledge base on the complex interactions of physical mechanisms of high intensity ultrasound with biological media.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
