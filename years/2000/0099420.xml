    <AbstractNarration>This proposal requests support for the 12th International Workshop on Plant Membrane Biology to be held at the University of Wisconsin, Madison WI, August 11-16, 2001. This meeting, the most prestigious in the field, is held somewhere in the world every three years. The aim is to provide an opportunity for researchers to exchange the most recent information and ideas relating to the biology of plant membranes, a field that is rapidly advancing through the application of biophysics, cell biology, genetics, and genomics. The conference will address topics such as Hormone Responses, Environmental Signal Perception, Nutrient Acquisition, Membranes and Development, Source/Sink Transport, Water Relations, Comparative Genomics, Evolution of Transporters, Structure/Function Relationships, and Practical Applications of Membrane Research. Oral and poster presentations will be thematically grouped and sessions will include a representative mixture of experimental and intellectual approaches to important topics in plant membrane biology. Talks will be either 30 min or 15 min. Some speakers will be invited in advance and some will be selected from the submitted abstracts. Participation of relatively young PIs, postdoctoral fellows, and graduate students is a goal to be achieved through their special consideration for financial support and invitations to speak. Based on experience, we expect approximately 450 participants.</AbstractNarration>
