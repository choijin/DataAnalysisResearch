<AbstractNarration>0000237&lt;br/&gt;Walder&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This two-year award for U.S.-U.K. collaboration on lava-flow interactions with snow and ice involves Joseph Walder of Portland State University and the Cascades Volcano Observatory of the U.S. Geological Survey in Vancouver, Washington, and R. Stephen J. Sparks of the Centre for Environmental Geophysical Flows, University of Bristol.  The research collaboration is aimed at understanding flood generation and debris flows caused by the movement of lava over snow and glacier ice.  Several distinct sets of experiments are proposed.  Simulated lava flows will be released over ice and artificial snow, and the rate of meltwater production will be determined as a function of lava temperature, viscosity, discharge rate and ice-surface slope.  Simulated lava flows will also be released over ice blocks containing features that emulate glacial crevasses and a glacial meltwater drainage system.  Experimental results will be compared to theoretical models that then can be scaled to make predictions about real-world phenomena.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The U.S. investigator brings to this collaboration expertise in glaciology and the interaction of hot volcanic grain flows with snow.  This is complemented by the U.K. investigator's expertise in physical volcanology.  The Bristol Centre is the best facility in the world for experimental work on ice-lava interactions and has specialized equipment for simulating lava flows over ice.  The project will advance understanding of how flooding occurs and may be used to predict flooding caused by eruptive volcanic activity.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
