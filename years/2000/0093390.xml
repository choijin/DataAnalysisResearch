    <AbstractNarration>Complex geometry becomes increasingly common in applications&lt;br/&gt;arising in diverse areas. Plastic surgeons use computer&lt;br/&gt;models to plan and perform operations. Mechanical engineers&lt;br/&gt;virtually assemble and test cars and planes. Animators&lt;br/&gt;create complex characters and effects indistinguishable from&lt;br/&gt;reality. Geometric modeling has found its way into art&lt;br/&gt;conservation: it is now feasible to create computer models&lt;br/&gt;of sculptures capturing the most subtle of details.&lt;br/&gt;Increasing complexity of geometric data calls for new&lt;br/&gt;efficient representations and algorithms. The goal of our&lt;br/&gt;long-term research plan is to study representations of&lt;br/&gt;complex geometric data, surfaces in particular. We plan to&lt;br/&gt;launch a broad and fundamental program to explore three&lt;br/&gt;types of representations: piecewise-smooth surfaces,&lt;br/&gt;multiscale surfaces and combined volume-surface&lt;br/&gt;representations. Our approach to designing complex surface&lt;br/&gt;representations is based on the concept of subdivision, a&lt;br/&gt;powerful technique for modeling smooth surfaces. Subdivision&lt;br/&gt;algorithms, while being more flexible and general, retain a&lt;br/&gt;number of useful properties of splines. Most importantly,&lt;br/&gt;the surfaces generated by these algorithms have a natural&lt;br/&gt;hierarchical structure and are computed using efficient&lt;br/&gt;local rules; subdivision algorithms can be easily extended&lt;br/&gt;to represent multiscale data. The general goal of our&lt;br/&gt;research is to design representations supporting efficient&lt;br/&gt;algorithms for construction, rendering, manipulation,&lt;br/&gt;processing, transmission and storage of surface data. We&lt;br/&gt;will explore in close coordination both theoretical&lt;br/&gt;properties of these representations (regularity, convergence&lt;br/&gt;rates, fairness, stability) and their practical&lt;br/&gt;applications. The specific goal of the proposed project is&lt;br/&gt;to generalize to surfaces the signal processing tools that&lt;br/&gt;were designed and are extensively used for images. The&lt;br/&gt;research program is integrated with the education plan,&lt;br/&gt;which has three main goals: (1) prepare graduate students&lt;br/&gt;for research in computer graphics and related areas, (2)&lt;br/&gt;incorporate the latest advances in research into curriculum&lt;br/&gt;at all levels, including undergraduate, and engage motivated&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate students in research (3) transfer knowledge&lt;br/&gt;about latest research advances to professionals in the&lt;br/&gt;industry.</AbstractNarration>
