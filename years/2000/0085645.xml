<AbstractNarration>Pipeline systems are widely used in transportation industries. Examples are transportation of coal, iron ore, mineral concentrates, ore tailings, sewage sludge, and nuclear waste. In many of these applications, transported slurries are complex multi-species mixtures. In the past, most of the theoretical and experimental studies dealt with only single-component slurries such as sand- or coal-water mixtures; little is known about multi-species slurries. The design of pipeline systems based on the studies of single-component slurries causes substantial limitation of safety and efficiency. Thus, there is a significant need to study multi-species slurry transportation in order to build a scientific basis for better pipeline system design in the future. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is proposed to study multi-species slurry transportation both experimentally in the lab-scale flow loop and numerically, using commercially available solvers as well as developing new computer codes. Both two- and three-component slurries will be used in the study to focus research on the effects of slurry component density on transport characteristics. Materials such as glass particles, sand, aluminum oxide, and nickel oxide will comprise slurry components in studying density ratios of heavier to lighter material in the range of 1.2 to 5.0. Different particle sizes of slurry components in the range of 50m to 500m and different relative component concentrations in the slurry will be tested. In addition, we will study solids concentrations in the range of 5% to 40% by volume for each slurry recipe. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A flow loop for slurry transport experiments will be constructed. The flow loop and its instrumentation will be calibrated by performing experiments with clear water. Next, slurry transport experiments in the flow loop will be performed. Important engineering parameters such as critical deposition velocity and pressure drop versus flow velocity will be of interest. Flow patterns associated with different flow regimes will be examined by using flow visualization techniques such as Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). A wide range of Reynolds numbers from 500 to 100000 will be considered to cover laminar, transitional, and turbulent flow regimes. Critical deposition velocity will be determined by visual observations of particle settling and from the turn point on the pressure drop versus mean flow velocity curve. Rheology studies of slurries under investigation will be performed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A reasonable numerical model of multi-species slurry flow will be developed. Experimental data will be used to improve numerical model. Improved model will then be used for parametric study to obtain detailed information about the effects of solids densities, particle sizes, and solids concentrations on slurry transport characteristics. In addition, we will study re-suspension phenomenon to investigate pipeline restart feasibility and characteristics. Slurry will be allowed to fully settle in the loop and then mean slurry velocity will be increased gradually until the settled bed is completely removed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Correlations and numerical models obtained from this research will be useful in designing next-generation pipeline systems for multi-species slurry transportation. The study will also contribute to the improved fundamental understanding of physical phenomena associated with multi-phase flows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is made under the Exploratory Research on Engineering the Transport Industries (ETI) program solicitation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
