<AbstractNarration> The geometry of a separable infinite dimensional Banach space&lt;br/&gt;X can be studied and better understood through a study of its spreading&lt;br/&gt;models and  asymptotic structure (those finite dimensional bases that&lt;br/&gt;can be found inside X, but arbitrarily spread out).  Knowledge of these&lt;br/&gt;structures does not always pass through to infinite dimensional information&lt;br/&gt;about X but sometimes, surprisingly, it does.  The author will study a&lt;br/&gt;number of open problems of this nature using the tools of infinite&lt;br/&gt;combinatorics, analysis and logic. For example if a Banach space has only&lt;br/&gt;one spreading model, must it contain a copy of one of the classical Banach&lt;br/&gt;spaces?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This project concerns the study of the geometry of normed linear&lt;br/&gt;spaces.  The easiest example of such a space is ordinary three dimensional&lt;br/&gt;Euclidean space.  However one may, even in two or three dimensions, have&lt;br/&gt;other geometries than Euclidean.  For example in the "taxicab" space&lt;br/&gt;distances between points in the plane are computed by traveling the&lt;br/&gt;shortest route along roads that run only horizontally or vertically.  In&lt;br/&gt;this geometry the set of all points equidistant from a fixed point is&lt;br/&gt;diamond shaped rather than a circle.  Applications of such alternate&lt;br/&gt;geometries are numerous in physics, engineering, signal processing and&lt;br/&gt;many other sciences. The state of a system or a signal may be given by a&lt;br/&gt;sequence of numbers and one may have to have a way of computing the&lt;br/&gt;distance between two states or signals to see how close they are. And in&lt;br/&gt;these applications one has to often use finite dimensional spaces of&lt;br/&gt;larger dimension than three or even spaces of infinite dimension.  The&lt;br/&gt;author will be exploring the latter  case by studying the &lt;br/&gt;"asymptotic" structures of these alternate geometries. This is a method of&lt;br/&gt;linking finite and infinite dimensional structure.  The techniques to be &lt;br/&gt;used are a combination of analysis, infinitary combinatorics and&lt;br/&gt;logic.  The problems that arise could also impact and motivate development&lt;br/&gt;in these latter areas as well.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
