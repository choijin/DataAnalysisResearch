<AbstractNarration>Research in theoretical elementary particle physics will include analyses of Quantum ChromoDynamics (QCD - the strong force which binds quarks and gluons to form ordinary&lt;br/&gt;protons and neutrons), possible top quark and Higgs boson signals at future colliders, studies of the interactions between photons and neutrinos in situations of astrophysical&lt;br/&gt;interest, and the role of gravity in particle physics.&lt;br/&gt; The detailed interactions of QCD are very complex.  Therefore, in order to gain insight into this theory it is essential to study its effects in specific processes.  New&lt;br/&gt;techniques will be used to investigate the production of heavy quarks at colliders over a range of energy scales and also to study the QCD scattering of particles at very high&lt;br/&gt;energies.  In addition, the effects of QCD on the production and analyses of top quarks and Higgs bosons at colliders will be investigated.&lt;br/&gt; The number of Higgs bosons as well as their masses and charges must be determined in order to fully understand the origin of mass and the underlying symmetry of elementary&lt;br/&gt;particle theory. Photon-neutrino interactions are only appreciable under extreme conditions such as those found in the early universe or in compact astrophysical objects.&lt;br/&gt;Understanding these interactions may alter our view of the relic neutrino sea or the way in which heavy objects lose energy. Ordinary gravity is too weak to affect elementary&lt;br/&gt;particle interactions, but recent developments in string theory suggest that some gravitational effects could be observable in high energy collisions.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
