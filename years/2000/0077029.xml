<AbstractNarration>Symposium FF entitled "Interfaces, Adhesion and Processing in Polymer Systems", is being organized by the Materials Research Society (MRS) in San Francisco from April 24-28th as part of their 2000 Spring MRS Meeting.  This symposium is being organized by Professors Spiros Anastasiadis (Foundation for Research and Technology, Greece) and Gregory Ferguson (LeHigh University), and Dr. Alamgir Karim (Polymers Division, NIST).  The purpose is to hold an international meeting attended by leading polymer scientists in the area of polymer interfaces, adhesion and processing.  The choice of the symposium topic derives from recent demands placed upon polymer performance that have paralleled the growth in applications and driven the development of sophisticated multiconstituent polymer formulations with superior physical, mechanical and interfacial properties.  The symposium aims at addressing both the fundamental scientific aspects and the advances in applications of polymers at interfaces and in processing.  To bring new ideas to these topics, the meeting will have a more multidiciplinary nature by having joint sessions with two other symposiums, "Interfacial Aspects of Soft Biomaterials", and "Nanostructures in Polymers".  Biomaterials and biological interfaces are expected to play a key role in promising areas of biotechnology for the future.  Likewise, recent interest in nanomaterials is driven by opportunities for improving material properties.  Processing and interfacial aspects are expected to be important for both of these areas and hence the proposed joint sessions.&lt;br/&gt;*** &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
