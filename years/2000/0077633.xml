    <AbstractNarration>Impulsive, inattentive and hyperactive children have greater social and academic problems than their peers, at least in the U.S. Teachers and parents find these behaviors difficult to manage, especially in mid-childhood. This research will use a comparative, cross-cultural design to clarify whether these behaviors are similar, have the same consequences for children, and pose the same challenges to parents and teachers, in different countries. This has significant implications for child learning and development in cross-cultural circumstances, whether in multi-ethnic classrooms in the U.S. or internationally. It also has implications for conditions in which children's behavior becomes classified as problem behavior, and how interventions for these behaviors might be designed to promote academic and social wellbeing for children and their caregivers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The comparison will be made between children in three countries: US (Texas), Mexico, and Belize. These cultural settings have been chosen because they have varying teacher and parent values about children's talkativeness and activity. Social and academic consequences of impulsive, inattentive, and hyperactive behaviors will be compared across these settings. Children's behavior will be assessed at home, in the classroom and on the playground, using a combination of anthropological, biological, and psychological methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Particular attention will be paid to sex differences in behavior, because previous clinical studies have shown that severe levels of impulsive, inattentive and hyperactive behavior are much more likely to be found in boys. By using a biocultural research design, focusing on both biological and cultural contexts of the behaviors, this study will be able to clarify the roles of cultural and biological variation in producing sex differences in these behaviors. Currently, there is a poor understanding of the girls' and boys' behavior patterns, and the different reactions they may get from teachers, parents and other children. This research also has implications for children's academic and social well being, and why it may vary by sex and ethnicity. Most previous studies have focused only on pathological or extreme degrees of these behaviors, ignoring the fact that most children display these behaviors at least occasionally. Yet, even lesser degrees of impulsive, inattentive and hyperactive behavior may also have significant positive or negative consequences for many children. This study will provide the first clear evidence of the naturally occurring range of these behaviors and should be of interest to researchers in the fields of anthropology, psychology and education.</AbstractNarration>
