<AbstractNarration>CMS0085270&lt;br/&gt;Title: "Development of a Database from the Duzce-Bolu Region in Turkey to Enable Testing Hypotheses Relating Urban Building Damage to Structural, Geotechnical, and Geological Parameters"&lt;br/&gt;PI: R. Frosch&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Purdue University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific and sole objective of the proposed work is to gather, collate, and archive for distribution data related to the assessment of urban building seismic vulnerability in the Duzce-Bolu region in Turkey.  The work will focus on the damage caused by the 12 November event and will be carried out by faculty and students of Purdue University cooperatively with the University of Notre Dame, the University of Illinois, and The Middle East Technical University, Ankara.  The Turkish State Waterworks and the Turkish Directorate for Resettlement and Natural Disasters have committed to allow free access to their databases on geological, geotechnical, and seismological information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The distinctive feature of the project is that the final product will include a database (initiated already at www.AnatolianQuake.org) containing information selected by a cohesive group of structural engineers, geotechnical engineers, and geologists and presented in a manner to be understood by researchers in all three disciplines so that cross-cutting hypotheses about urban earthquake-risk can be tested.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The plan is to include basic building data (damage level, number of stories, framing type, footprint, critical member sizes, location coordinates) for approximately 750 buildings in Duzce, Bolu, and Kaynasli.  The geotechnical data will include geological and geotechnical surface maps as well as hydrogeological maps of the Duzce-Bolu region.  In GIS format, it will also include borehole logs with soil characterization and available field and laboratory data such as SPT, CPT, permeability, and shear vane.  In addition to the currently available line maps of the fault, geological data will include detailed information on ground fracturing and deformation to be obtained by the project staff.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Availability of these data, focused on specific locations of heavy and light damage to the built environment, will provide a rich and useful database to geologists, geotechnical engineers, and structural engineers working jointly or independently to test and develop methods for assessment of earthquake vulnerability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
