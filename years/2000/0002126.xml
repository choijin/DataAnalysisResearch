    <AbstractNarration>Education Development Center, Inc. proposes to refine and offer -- along with WestEd, TERC, IDRA, and Eisenhower Clearinghouse -- the online gender equity course for middle school math and science teachers entitled "Engaging Middle School Girls in Math and Science." Utilizing a qualitative methodology, we will research over a two-year period the impact of this training on participants' attitudes and practices, among other things, identifying key aspects of course design and delivery that aid in positive impacts.&lt;br/&gt; This project will provide vital data on the effectiveness of one type of online gender equity training, as well as the suitability of various aspects of gender equity training to this delivery format. It will also strengthen infrastructure by building a community of math and science teachers trained in gender equity who communicate and support each other as they translate a critical framework into strategies and activities for classroom change. The leadership development aspect of the course will begin a process of wider institutionalization. Finally, the project will build on current networks, working to create new conversations that will evolve over time and make the necessary linkages among math and science, gender equity, and educational technology professionals.</AbstractNarration>
