    <AbstractNarration>Abstract for proposal EAR0003505 (PH # 12x)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Evaluating Static and Dynamic Stress Transfer Triggering&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI's: S. Gross, University of Colorado&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this research is to study the triggering of earthquakes, especially aftershocks. The clear association of aftershocks with their mainshocks suggests that mainshocks trigger their aftershocks, but the mechanisms of that triggering are still debated. Triggering studies have repeatedly shown that aftershocks occur preferentially in fault zones upon which stresses have been concentrated as a result of permanent fault offset. This is surprising because these stress changes can be very small, orders of magnitude smaller than the stress change on an earthquake source. Recent results reveal that the much larger transient stress changes, generated by passing seismic waves, are also a viable triggering model. In order to decide which models are best, I will apply similar statistical measures to each model and apply them to the same data to compare them as fairly as possible. With this aim, I will study both static and dynamic stress transferred in both the 1992 Landers and 1999 Hector Mine earthquake sequences. I will evaluate the correlation of stress changes with aftershock distributions, using a unified battery of statistical tests so that the most consistent models may be identified and the influence of model errors quantified. In addition to comparing static and dynamic triggering models, I will explore models that include stresses due to postseismic processes, and see if inversions for the background stress state are consistent between the two sequences.</AbstractNarration>
