    <AbstractNarration>Abstract: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is to try to obtain a better understanding &lt;br/&gt;of the structure of bounded linear operators acting on a complex, &lt;br/&gt;separable, infinite dimensional Hilbert space. The principal investigator plans to continue her research on the theory of commutant lifting theorem, including the numerical &lt;br/&gt;aspect and the generalization to the multioperator setting. &lt;br/&gt;At the same time, the principal investigator will continue her &lt;br/&gt;research on sums of eigenvalues of self-adjoint operators, &lt;br/&gt;and its connections with intersection theory in algebraic &lt;br/&gt;geometry, Young tableaux, and representation theory. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is to try to obtain a better understanding of the theory of linear&lt;br/&gt;operators acting on Hilbert space (``operator theory''). There are two main &lt;br/&gt;research areas that this proposal will focus on. &lt;br/&gt;One is in the area of the theory of commutant lifting thorem, &lt;br/&gt;which has proven to be useful in control theory in engineering. &lt;br/&gt;The other one is on a problem about eigenvalues of sums of (self-&lt;br/&gt;adjoint) operators. This problem originated in a celebrated &lt;br/&gt;paper of Weyl in 1912 while he was studying partial &lt;br/&gt;differential equations. Only recently that there was a &lt;br/&gt;significant break through and the solution depends on &lt;br/&gt;some very deep theorems in algebraic geometry. It is our &lt;br/&gt;hope that this project will bring some insight into the &lt;br/&gt;problem from the operator theory point of view. Furthermore we want &lt;br/&gt;to extend the existing theory to a setting that can be applied to &lt;br/&gt;quantum physics.</AbstractNarration>
