<AbstractNarration>Abstract 0077721&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In July of 1998 a massive tsunami struck the north coast of Papua New Guinea, severely damaging four communities and killing thousands of villagers. This project will investigate the impact of the disaster and subsequent relief efforts on traditional social networks in the four coastal communities. These villages were linked by extensive social, economic, and ritual networks that were studied by the PI in previous research. One of the unanticipated consequences of international rehabilitation aid and NGO reconstruction following disasters is often the disruption and destruction of the local social networks that previously organized community social life; this has long-term implications for the viability of affected communities.The PI will analyze the extent to which these networks have been disrupted, altered, or maintained following the tsunami disaster Methods include participant observation, structured interviews, and the collection of oral narratives. The PI will work closely with officials and students from the Papua New Guinea National Museum and and the University of New Guinea. The project will contribute to our understanding of how communities and social networks respond to natural dissasters, and how aid efforts may unintentionally reshape communities; this has important policy implications for future relief efforts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
