<AbstractNarration>Biological Sciences (61)&lt;br/&gt;This project is using inquiry-based cooperative learning and research training in a culturally diverse setting to 1) improve undergraduate preparation in Molecular Biology; 2) enhance application of the scientific method; and 3) encourage team projects that promote interactions among culturally diverse learners. Funds are being used to upgrade a sequence of two courses and undergraduate research facilities. Specifically an existing course in Molecular&lt;br/&gt;Biology is being modified to involve students in an inquiry based cooperative learning project where students learn from their peers and the professor serves as a facilitator in the process. The effort is an adaptation of a laboratory manual "Unraveling DNA," developed with NSF support. The laboratory component of the course is being expanded to include subcloning and sequence analysis of the luxA gene from the Lux operon that is cloned in the existing course. Students, working in groups, use the polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing and analysis to study their clones. In the second course, Advanced Topics, cooperative learning continues as students read and discuss original research articles that assist them in applying the principles and techniques of molecular biology and the scientific method to a novel situation. Students develop and submit a research proposal to external sources or the established University student/faculty research program for funding consideration. Students complete the proposed research as an undergraduate research project and present the results at the annual student symposium as either a poster or an oral presentation. The goals of the project are consistent with the department's mission that promotes cooperative learning and undergraduate research as a capstone course. Funds are being used for instrumentation, course development and evaluation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
