    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0072197&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Steven R. Bell&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prof. Bell has shown that the Bergman, Szego, and Poisson kernels&lt;br/&gt;associated to a finitely connected region in the plane are&lt;br/&gt;elementary combinations of only three, and sometimes even two,&lt;br/&gt;analytic functions of one complex variable related to geometric&lt;br/&gt;constructions associated to the domain. Bell will study deeper&lt;br/&gt;questions about complexity in potential theory posed by his&lt;br/&gt;recent findings and he will extend these results to finite&lt;br/&gt;Riemann surfaces. Bell has also formulated a unique continuation&lt;br/&gt;property for the inhomogeneous Cauchy-Riemann equations that he&lt;br/&gt;has shown yields information about the behavior of holomorphic&lt;br/&gt;mappings between domains in complex space. He will attempt to&lt;br/&gt;verify the property on important classes of domains such as the&lt;br/&gt;strictly pseudoconvex domains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mathematical objects of potential theory and conformal&lt;br/&gt;mapping are ubiquitous in Science, Mathematics, and Engineering.&lt;br/&gt;They carry encoded within them a vast amount of information about&lt;br/&gt;geometric properties of regions in the plane. Although these&lt;br/&gt;objects are familiar and well studied, they continue to be a&lt;br/&gt;source of interesting and applicable new mathematics. Professor&lt;br/&gt;Bell will express the classical objects of potential theory&lt;br/&gt;associated to a two dimensional region with holes in terms of&lt;br/&gt;much simpler analytic objects. These results will give rise to&lt;br/&gt;new and practical methods for understanding the solutions to many&lt;br/&gt;classical problems in differential equations, conformal mapping,&lt;br/&gt;and potential theory that should be of interest to scientists and&lt;br/&gt;engineers. Bell will explore applications of his ideas to more&lt;br/&gt;complicated constructions in the subject and he and his students&lt;br/&gt;will test the efficacy of the numerical methods stemming from the&lt;br/&gt;work. Because humans best perceive higher dimensional objects by&lt;br/&gt;taking a series of two dimensional slices, the tools developed by&lt;br/&gt;Bell could find many applications.</AbstractNarration>
