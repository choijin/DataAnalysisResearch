<AbstractNarration>The project is in the realm of Number Theory. More specifically, it is in&lt;br/&gt;the area of automorphic forms and representation theory.&lt;br/&gt;The most ambitious enterprise in automorphic forms is the&lt;br/&gt;Langlands program,&lt;br/&gt;and, especially, the issue of functorial lifting.&lt;br/&gt;Loosely speaking, it postulates the formation of automorphic forms on&lt;br/&gt;a bigger group from those on a smaller group.&lt;br/&gt;This bounds together some of the most outstanding open problems in Number&lt;br/&gt;Theory, such as the Artin's Conjecture&lt;br/&gt;and the Ramanujan Hypothesis.&lt;br/&gt;So far, the advance in the Langlands program was accomplished along&lt;br/&gt;three major themes which are inter-related: explicit constructions of&lt;br/&gt;automorphic forms&lt;br/&gt;(e.g. using theta-kernels or Fourier coefficients of residues of&lt;br/&gt;Eisenstein series), the theory of L-functions combined with&lt;br/&gt;converse theorems, and the trace formula in its various guises.&lt;br/&gt;The focus in this project is on the trace formula approach.&lt;br/&gt;All trace formulas have their origin in expressing the kernel function&lt;br/&gt;in two different ways -- geometrically and spectrally.&lt;br/&gt;The application to functoriality comes about&lt;br/&gt;when trace formulas of two different groups are compared.&lt;br/&gt;The project deals with analytical aspects of the spectral expansion&lt;br/&gt;of a trace formula for {\em symmetric spaces} (also called a&lt;br/&gt;relative trace formula), inaugurated by Jacquet.&lt;br/&gt;This is a major step in establishing functoriality in such instances&lt;br/&gt;as quadratic base change, and characterizing cusp forms having&lt;br/&gt;a non-zero period integral over certain period subgroups.&lt;br/&gt;The project has 3 parts and it is a collaboration with&lt;br/&gt;Jonathan Rogawski from UCLA (first 2 parts), and&lt;br/&gt;Steve Rallis and Herve Jacquet (third part).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is a basic research in the realm of Number Theory.&lt;br/&gt;The more specific area is called&lt;br/&gt;automorphic forms and representation theory.&lt;br/&gt;The most ambitious enterprise in this field is the&lt;br/&gt;Langlands program.&lt;br/&gt;In a nutshell, the goal is to establish relationships between&lt;br/&gt;various objects which "live" on completely different worlds,&lt;br/&gt;and seemingly have little in common.&lt;br/&gt;Such relations are extremely deep.&lt;br/&gt;A spectacular and relatively recent example is a correspondence between&lt;br/&gt;modular forms and elliptic curves, which was&lt;br/&gt;a keystone in Wiles' proof of Fermat's Last Theorem.&lt;br/&gt;Roughly speaking, an elliptic curve is a "doughnut"&lt;br/&gt;which is described as the locus of two equations&lt;br/&gt;of degree 3 in 4 variables.&lt;br/&gt;A modular form on the other hand can be thought of,&lt;br/&gt;in the simplest cases, as&lt;br/&gt;a sequence which is obtained by assigning to each integer&lt;br/&gt;the sum of all its divisors (or powers of them).&lt;br/&gt;Beside their inherent significance in many branches of mathematics,&lt;br/&gt;modular forms and their related objects have found applications&lt;br/&gt;in physics, cryptography and communication systems.</AbstractNarration>
