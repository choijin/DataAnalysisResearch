<AbstractNarration>     Broadband satellite systems have an important role to play in the delivery of multimedia applications.&lt;br/&gt;In this proposal we concentrate on GEO (geo-synchronous) based satellite networks. GEO based systems&lt;br/&gt;deliver continuous services to a specific region with a single satellite. They play an ever-increasing role in&lt;br/&gt;the public and private Internets, due mostly to their large geographic coverage, inherent broadcast&lt;br/&gt;capabilities and fast deployment. They are attractive to support data, audio and video streaming; bulk data&lt;br/&gt;transfer such as software updates or dissemination of Web caches; and applications involving limited&lt;br/&gt;interactivity such as distance learning. They are also attractive to provide broadband access to users who are&lt;br/&gt;either beyond the reach of the terrestrial network, or have particular needs for broadcast/multicast&lt;br/&gt;applications or fast deployment.&lt;br/&gt;     We will focus in this proposal on Next Generation Satellite Networks that comprise one (or more) GEO&lt;br/&gt;satellite with some form of onboard processing (OBP). Two of the essential issues regarding broadband&lt;br/&gt;satellite network are 1) end-to-end resource management, and 2) network availability.&lt;br/&gt;     Resource management is key to deliver acceptable Quality of Service (QoS) to services while providing&lt;br/&gt;adequate efficiency. It is central to any satellite system, be it a bent pipe or an onboard processing (OBP)&lt;br/&gt;satellite system. Indeed, in order to offer flexibility and efficiency to bursty applications, the capacity of the&lt;br/&gt;multiple access uplink has to be managed using some bandwidth on demand (BoD) scheme.&lt;br/&gt;     We define network availability as the ability for the network to offer some level of services to some&lt;br/&gt;applications even during degraded periods. Most of the next generation systems will be using the Ka band,&lt;br/&gt;which is known for its very difficult transmission characteristics. Many solutions involving variable rate&lt;br/&gt;coding, power control, and/or variable modulation have been proposed to make this band friendly to&lt;br/&gt;broadband applications. This proposal will not study directly those layer 1/2 mechanisms but rather study&lt;br/&gt;how their use affects BoD and more generally end-to-end resource management.&lt;br/&gt;     Hence the final objective of our proposal is to design and evaluate end-to-end resource management&lt;br/&gt;for the Next Generation of Satellite Networks that interworks efficiently with the range of solutions&lt;br/&gt;proposed by the air-interface designer to improve the availability of the transmission. In particular, we&lt;br/&gt;want to understand the trade-off in terms of efficiency and system complexity.&lt;br/&gt;     To achieve this ultimate objective, we will study:&lt;br/&gt;1. Static end-to-end resource management for large GEO OBP systems. The term static refers to the&lt;br/&gt;fact that the coding and modulation are fixed. The focus here will be to develop and evaluate&lt;br/&gt;mechanisms that are scalable, robust, flexible and protect the OBP (i.e., the switch in the sky). We&lt;br/&gt;will build upon our extensive previous work in the domain where we developed scalable, robust,&lt;br/&gt;flexible end-to-end resource management for large GEO bent pipe systems.&lt;br/&gt;2. Network availability. One of the main concerns of satellite network designers is to offer an&lt;br/&gt;"appropriate" level of service to the users in spite of the difficult characteristics of the frequency&lt;br/&gt;band. However it is not very clear what is meant by "an appropriate level of service" since it may&lt;br/&gt;vary from a user to another or from an application to another. Most of the studies have focussed on&lt;br/&gt;link availability without taking into account the networking and applications aspects. We believe&lt;br/&gt;that coordinating the lower layers with the upper layers will give us a flexible and cost-efficient&lt;br/&gt;solution allowing the system to deliver different levels of network availability to the users&lt;br/&gt;depending on their need and their willingness to pay. Hence network availability can be seen as a&lt;br/&gt;QoS requirement and should be defined and studied that way.&lt;br/&gt;3. Designing end-to-end resource management for a system comprising layer 1/2 mechanisms to&lt;br/&gt;dynamically improve the uplink availability so as to offer flexible and cost efficient services to the&lt;br/&gt;users. We need to propose solutions and to evaluate them to ensure that the increase in complexity&lt;br/&gt;is worthwhile in terms of efficiency. We will also propose and study some dynamic pricing schemes&lt;br/&gt;integrated with the BoD so as to allow the users to indicate their willingness to pay for capacity in a&lt;br/&gt;context where the total available capacity is variable due to link impairment.</AbstractNarration>
