<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0072438&lt;br/&gt;Lisa G. Stanley&lt;br/&gt;Department of Mathematics&lt;br/&gt;Univeristy of Montana&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Engineers, mathematicians and other scientists who use mathematical &lt;br/&gt;models to describe physical systems often need to answer the question: &lt;br/&gt;``How does the system response change as system parameters change?'' &lt;br/&gt;For example, how does the airflow around an airplane wing change as&lt;br/&gt;the shape of the wing changes, and how does this affect drag? &lt;br/&gt;Sensitivity analysis seeks to answer such questions.  The sensitivity&lt;br/&gt;provides quantitative information which can be useful as a &lt;br/&gt;mathematical tool to gain insight into the behavior of a system.&lt;br/&gt;This proposal deals with the analysis and design of&lt;br/&gt;computational methods for approximating sensitivities for a very specific &lt;br/&gt;class of problems.  The research focuses on shape sensitivity calculations&lt;br/&gt;for interface problems.  These problems arise in the analysis&lt;br/&gt;of a variety of physical systems such as groundwater flow through &lt;br/&gt;different types of sediment as well as manufacturing processes such as die &lt;br/&gt;casting problems and alloy solifidification problems.&lt;br/&gt;In die casting, for example, there is an interface&lt;br/&gt;between the solidifying part and the mold itself.&lt;br/&gt;When analyzing such a process, the mold and the part may be considered &lt;br/&gt;as one composite material, and in order to optimize the casting process, &lt;br/&gt;the designer needs to determine the sensitivity of the temperature &lt;br/&gt;throughout the composite material to small changes in the thickness &lt;br/&gt;of the respective component materials.   Since the mold and the &lt;br/&gt;manufactured part consist of different materials which have different &lt;br/&gt;heat conductivity properties, the mathematical equation governing &lt;br/&gt;the cooling process has a solution which lacks smoothness at the &lt;br/&gt;interface.  For these types of problems, computing the sensitivity &lt;br/&gt;requires a different, and more clever, approximation scheme than &lt;br/&gt;that which is typically used to determine the temperature.  The &lt;br/&gt;current research attempts to analyze and exploit the mathematical &lt;br/&gt;structure of these problems and to modify existing numerical methods &lt;br/&gt;in order to develop a computational algorithm which is accurate, &lt;br/&gt;efficient and reasonable to implement.  Estimates regarding inclusion &lt;br/&gt;of such techniques in the design of rocket engines show that design &lt;br/&gt;cycle time could be reduced from one year to one month.  Results&lt;br/&gt;of this magnitude make the development of such &lt;br/&gt;computational tools critical for the national interest&lt;br/&gt;both in cost savings during the design stage and in remaining&lt;br/&gt;on the forefront of new technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates the use of&lt;br/&gt;domain decomposition techniques for the development of &lt;br/&gt;accurate and efficient computational algorithms for shape &lt;br/&gt;sensitivity calculations.  Specifically, the work involves&lt;br/&gt;the implementation of Continuous Sensitivity Equation&lt;br/&gt;Methods (C-SEMs) in order to derive infinite dimensional&lt;br/&gt;sensitivity equations which usually take the form of&lt;br/&gt;partial differential equations.  The research focuses&lt;br/&gt;on elliptic interface problems containing &lt;br/&gt;parameters which determine the spatial &lt;br/&gt;location or the shape of the interface.  The  resulting shape &lt;br/&gt;sensitivities exhibit discontinuities across the interface.  &lt;br/&gt;Efficient computational algorithms for this&lt;br/&gt;class of problems rely on two essential components.  The first &lt;br/&gt;is the mathematical analysis needed to establish fundamental &lt;br/&gt;properties such as existence, uniqueness and regularity.  &lt;br/&gt;The second component is &lt;br/&gt;the clever choice of a numerical method which is suitable&lt;br/&gt;for solving the equations.  The theoretical analysis guides&lt;br/&gt;the construction of a computational method which exploits &lt;br/&gt;the problem structure.  Specifically, an iterative, nonoverlapping&lt;br/&gt;domain decomposition algorithm is used to accurately capture &lt;br/&gt;discontinuities in the sensitivity variable.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
