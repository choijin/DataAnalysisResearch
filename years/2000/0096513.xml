<AbstractNarration>A fundamental question in cell biology is how metabolic pathways are integrated and controlled to produce a balanced, efficient metabolism.  The long-term goal of this research is to gain a molecular understanding of regulatory and metabolic interactions amongst pathways.  A solid understanding of such metabolic integration is needed as a foundation for efforts to predict the response of cells to environmental change and developmental switches, efforts to develop metabolic modeling systems, and efforts targeting metabolism for rational drug design and/or production of small molecules.  The biosynthesis of thiamine in the bacterium Salmonella enterica serves as a model system to address pathway integration.  The system was chosen because several metabolic processes and the function of several uncharacterized open reading frames are required for optimal thiamine synthesis.  Critical for the hypotheses being tested in this project were the findings that the aerobic synthesis of  thiamine requires glutathione and genes involved in the synthesis or repair of [Fe-S] centers. With this project the investigator will i) determine the role of the YggX protein, specifically how it prevents damage and/or facilitates repair of oxidatively damaged [Fe-S] centers, and ii) determine the function and structural characteristics of the ThiH protein, a thiamine biosynthetic enzyme. Chemical, biochemical, molecular biological, and genetic techniques will be employed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study of the biochemical function of the YggX and ThiH proteins should provide insights into the integration of metabolic processes. Ultimately this work should contribute to the understanding of global metabolic strategies that Salmonella enterica uses to survive in its natural environment.  These strategies are likely to represent those used by other cells to respond to developmental and environmental stimuli. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
