    <AbstractNarration>The Second International Conference on Proteins that Bind RNA will be held at the Lakeway&lt;br/&gt;Inn Conference Center in Austin, Texas, from March 4-8, 2001. The First International&lt;br/&gt;Conference on Proteins that Bind RNA was held in May 1998 in Avalon, New Jersey. This&lt;br/&gt;series of international meetings brings together molecular biologists and structural&lt;br/&gt;biologists who share a common interest in RNA-binding proteins. The meetings focus on the&lt;br/&gt;biological role of RNA-binding proteins and how structural analysis provides insights into&lt;br/&gt;the function of RNA-protein complexes. The format is designed to maximize the exchange of&lt;br/&gt;information, foster collaborations, and to set the stage for future directions in&lt;br/&gt;research. Speakers include an interdisciplinary mix of established scientists and young&lt;br/&gt;investigators in the areas of molecular biology, genetics and structural biology of&lt;br/&gt;RNA-binding proteins. The format includes a mix of distinguished invited speakers and&lt;br/&gt;talks chosen from submitted abstracts. Extensive poster sessions provide breadth to the&lt;br/&gt;meeting and encourage cross-talk among investigators and students. Meeting topics include&lt;br/&gt;the role of RNA-binding proteins in the following processes: post-transcriptional RNA&lt;br/&gt;processing (such as splicing, editing, nuclear transport and mRNA decay), transcriptional&lt;br/&gt;termination, the function of ribozymes in-vivo, enzymatic RNP molecules, translation,&lt;br/&gt;developmental control, viral replication and human disease.</AbstractNarration>
