<AbstractNarration>As information technology has become more widespread, it is now increasingly&lt;br/&gt;possible for decision makers, such as CEOs and legislators, to obtain advice from&lt;br/&gt;a variety of experts with di!ering areas of expertise. Conventional wisdom suggests&lt;br/&gt;that, as a result, the decision maker will reach better decisions. This, however, ignores&lt;br/&gt;the fact that experts may withhold or distort information in the hope of influencing&lt;br/&gt;the decision in a direction favorable to them. Thus, a decision maker needs to consider&lt;br/&gt;how the structure of communication -- the conversation --affects how informative is&lt;br/&gt;the advice received from experts. This project investigates how the structure of&lt;br/&gt;communication a!ects the quality of decisions.&lt;br/&gt;The first part of the project concerns conversations between an uninformed deci-&lt;br/&gt;sion maker and an informed expert. When the expert sends a written report, unac-&lt;br/&gt;companied by any dialogue, this results in substantial information loss. A face-to-face&lt;br/&gt;meeting between a decision maker and an expert, however, leads to an improvement&lt;br/&gt;in the informativeness of expert advice--even though the decision maker is completely&lt;br/&gt;uninformed. Both the decision maker and the expert benefit from the conversation.&lt;br/&gt;This leads us to examine the following questions: How much information can be cred-&lt;br/&gt;ibly transmitted in a face-to-face meeting? Is it possible to induce the expert to fully&lt;br/&gt;disclose his information?&lt;br/&gt;In many situations, the decision maker himself may be knowledgeable about some&lt;br/&gt;aspects of the decision. As an example, an entrepreneur may have detailed knowl-&lt;br/&gt;edge about the growth prospects of his product, but still require financial expertise in&lt;br/&gt;taking his company public. The second part of the project concerns communication&lt;br/&gt;in such situations--where both the decision maker and the expert have some rele-&lt;br/&gt;vant information. Once again, the structure of communication can critically affect&lt;br/&gt;the amount of information exchanged. For instance, there are many circumstances&lt;br/&gt;where back-and-forth communication does not lead to information gains--even if the&lt;br/&gt;decision maker is informed--and we identify these circumstances. This leads us to&lt;br/&gt;ask the following questions: Is the situation improved by adding more rounds of com-&lt;br/&gt;munication? Is a face-to-face meeting superior to a back-and-forth exchange, such as&lt;br/&gt;via E-mail?&lt;br/&gt;The third part concerns situations where decisions are multi-faceted and informa-&lt;br/&gt;tion is dispersed among many "specialist" experts. For instance, a piece of legislation&lt;br/&gt;may impact both employment and the environment. Different lobbying groups are&lt;br/&gt;likely to possess expertise in each of these areas. We study whether providing experts&lt;br/&gt;with an opportunity to communicate with one another improves the informativeness&lt;br/&gt;of their advice. Is the situation improved if the decision maker also participates? Is&lt;br/&gt;the situation improved if there is overlap in the experts' specialized knowledge?&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
