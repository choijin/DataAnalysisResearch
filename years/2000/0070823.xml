<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0070823&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Under this grant, Stefanov plans to work in two areas: (1) Inverse Problems and&lt;br/&gt;(2) Resonances (scattering poles). In the area of Inverse Problems, he plans to&lt;br/&gt;study some inverse problems for partial differential equations and related&lt;br/&gt;inverse problems in geometry. Some of the problems of interest are inverse&lt;br/&gt;problems in anisotropic media. Mathematically, they lead to problems of&lt;br/&gt;recovering a Riemannian metric from boundary data or scattering data. One&lt;br/&gt;example is the inverse kinematic problem, where one has to recover a Riemannian&lt;br/&gt;metric in a bounded domain from the lengths of geodesics connecting each two&lt;br/&gt;boundary points. This problem has natural applications in geophysics and is&lt;br/&gt;closely connected to the inverse problem of recovering a metric from the&lt;br/&gt;associated hyperbolic Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DN) map on the boundary. The PI&lt;br/&gt;plans to study this problem for larger classes of metrics than already known and&lt;br/&gt;to prove also stability estimates. The related linearized problem - recovery of&lt;br/&gt;tensors from integrals along geodesics will also be studied. The PI will also&lt;br/&gt;work on the (elliptic) anisotropic inverse boundary value problem. The&lt;br/&gt;possibility of developing an abstract approach to obtaining conditional&lt;br/&gt;stability estimates will be also studied and the PI plans to find sufficient&lt;br/&gt;conditions that would guarantee that one can derive a stability estimate (and&lt;br/&gt;therefore uniqueness) directly from the injectivity of the linearized problem.&lt;br/&gt;The PI will also conduct research in the area of resonances (scattering poles).&lt;br/&gt;The PI plans to study some physical systems where one can construct non-real&lt;br/&gt;quasimodes and to show that those quasimodes are close to resonances not&lt;br/&gt;converging to the real axis. Two such systems are the transmission problem and&lt;br/&gt;scattering by a strictly convex obstacle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The motivation for this project comes from its possible applications. Inverse&lt;br/&gt;Problems have numerous applications to geology, medicine, non-destructive&lt;br/&gt;evaluation of materials, etc. The anisotropic inverse problems are related to&lt;br/&gt;recovering parameters of media with properties (conductivity, wave speed, etc.)&lt;br/&gt;depending not only on the position but also on the direction. Conditional&lt;br/&gt;stability estimates show that small changes of the parameters of the system lead&lt;br/&gt;to small changes in the measured data under additional assumptions usually&lt;br/&gt;requiring sufficient smoothness of the coefficients. This demonstrates that the&lt;br/&gt;corresponding inverse problem is conditionally well-posed. Resonances arise&lt;br/&gt;naturally as resonance frequencies for systems in unbounded domains. They&lt;br/&gt;correspond to peaks in the measured data. For some systems, we plan to describe&lt;br/&gt;the asymptotic distribution of the resonances in some neighborhood of the real&lt;br/&gt;axis, which provides computational and qualitative tools for understanding those&lt;br/&gt;systems.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
