<AbstractNarration>0079796&lt;br/&gt;McEllistrem&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scanning tunneling microscope has done much to broaden our understanding of&lt;br/&gt;Semiconductors and metals, providing a unique view of material surfaces available by no&lt;br/&gt;other technique. Specifically, the microscope's ability to resolve individual surface&lt;br/&gt;atoms has lead to an improved understanding of the chemistry and physics of solid&lt;br/&gt;surfaces. How a chemical reaction proceeds on a surface, or how different surface atoms&lt;br/&gt;diffuse, segregate, or combine can be literally watched on an atomic scale. The awarded&lt;br/&gt;instrument will be used to investigate the formation of metal silicides on silicon, since&lt;br/&gt;metal/semiconductor interfaces continue to impact device fabrication. At a more&lt;br/&gt;fundamental level, understanding the processes that lead to metal silicide formation will&lt;br/&gt;allow the controlled formation of nanoscale particles, particles that are driven to self-assemble&lt;br/&gt;by their reactivity. The instrument will also be used to investigate how reactions proceed &lt;br/&gt;on gallium nitride (from which electro-optic devices that emit in the blue/violet can be &lt;br/&gt;made). In particular, the dynamics of hydrogen on the gallium nitride surface is of &lt;br/&gt;technological interest, and can also be used as a probe of local surface reactivity. &lt;br/&gt;Since gallium nitride surfaces are also polar (N- vs. Ga-terminated), the impact of &lt;br/&gt;surface polarity on surface reactions will also be studied.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Semiconductors are widely used in electronic and electro-optic devices. Nearly all&lt;br/&gt;computer chips, for example, are fabricated from silicon. Compound semiconductors&lt;br/&gt;(the so-called III-V semiconductors) are often found in devices which convert electrical&lt;br/&gt;energy into light, namely light-emitting diodes, found in nearly all consumer electronics,&lt;br/&gt;and laser diodes, which form the heart of a solid state laser, the engine in laser printers &lt;br/&gt;and compact disc players.  Research into semiconductors has lead to the development of &lt;br/&gt;faster, smaller computer chips (and thus computers), and novel electro-optic devices. &lt;br/&gt;The scanning tunneling microscope has done much to broaden our knowledge of &lt;br/&gt;semiconductors and metals, providing a unique view of material surfaces unavailable by &lt;br/&gt;any other technique.  Specifically, this microscope is capable of attaining atomic &lt;br/&gt;resolution images of surfaces.  With it, surface physics and chemistry can observed on &lt;br/&gt;an atomic scale. In short, how atoms move and distribute themselves on a surface, or &lt;br/&gt;how a chemical reaction proceeds on a surface, can be imaged directly with a scanning &lt;br/&gt;tunneling microscope. The awarded instrument will be used to further our understanding of &lt;br/&gt;how metals interact with silicon, and to investigate the surface chemistry of novel &lt;br/&gt;semiconductor materials used in electro-optic applications.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
