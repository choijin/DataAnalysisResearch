<AbstractNarration>The Memphis City Schools, currently in its fifth year of the National Science Foundation's Urban Systemic Initiative, proposes the improvement of K-12 mathematics and science student achievement through the extension of previous accomplishments and the implementation of a rich and comprehensive full-scale standards-based program districtwide.  The Memphis Urban Systemic Program's (MUSP) instructional plan focuses on the implementation of K-12 mathematics and science standards-based curricula in 100% of the schools through professional development that provides over 100 hours of learning experiences to teachers.  The proposed professional development comprises subject content, pedagogical approaches, integration of learning technologies, and alignment of student assessment with both curriculum and instruction.  Teacher networks and action research will be used as tools to expand teachers' abilities to reflect on their students' learning and their own instructional process.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Summer camps and Saturday academies will be implemented to assist students meeting the new standards, and parental involvement activities will be conducted in schools to promote their understanding of the ongoing standards-based reform efforts.  Furthermore, the MUSP expects to improve the quality of current teacher preparation programs and the science and mathematics teacher shortage by developing a strong sequence of undergraduate and pre-service education courses in close and intense collaboration with the University of Memphis, LeMoyne-Owen College, and Christian Brothers University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The MUSP proposal constitutes a potential urban district reform model, especially by illustrating appropriate alignment among standards-based curriculum implementation, professional development, and student assessment-one of the most critical components of and a necessary condition for successful educational reform.  The development of a seamless teacher education program addressing teacher recruitment and certification, preservice, and in-service activities depicts a promising undertaking as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Success of the MUSP will be determined by the degree to which students meet or exceed the performance benchmarks established over the five years of the proposed program.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
