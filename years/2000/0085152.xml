<AbstractNarration>  &lt;br/&gt;Near Field Bridge Response Library for the Chi-Chi Earthquake&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gongkang Fu, Department of Civil Engineering, Wayne State University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent seismic failures of bridges indicate or allude to inadequacy of today's US design code, including that (1) near field effects are not well understood and not covered, and (2) involved uncertainties are not explicitly addressed.  These issues even will not be systematically addressed in the new AASHTO LRFD seismic design code under development, due to lack of knowledge and field performance data.  The 1999 Chi-Chi earthquake in Taiwan offers an opportunity to improve the knowledge in these aspects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project's objective is to develop a web-based comprehensive data library containing information on bridge behavior/performance and ground motion in the Chi-Chi earthquake, with an emphasis on near field effects.  The project will also include a preliminary study on these effects.  The research objective is to be reached by fulfilling the following tasks. (1) Review the latest developments in relevant areas. (2) If warranted based on Task 1, immediately visit Taiwan to collect time-sensitive data that are likely to be destroyed soon. (3) Develop a detailed plan and structure for the data library.  (4) Collect detailed field data.  (5) Conduct a preliminary study on near field effects.  (6) Develop the data library and post it on the World Wide Web.  (7) Prepare a final report.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Useful applications of the data library may include, but certainly not limited to, the following. 1) Calibrating numerical models for predicting seismic behavior and performance of bridges, particularly for including near field effects. 2) Calibrating performance based design codes for consistent reliability of bridge performance.  3) Comparison with other earthquakes for developing prediction models for ground motion and response spectra.  4) Educating engineering students and practicing engineers about earthquake engineering and bridge engineering.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
