<AbstractNarration> &lt;br/&gt;This proposal seeks funding for the "VIII. International van der Ziel Symposium on Quantum 1/f Noise and&lt;br/&gt;Other Low Frequency Fluctuations, Mainly in GaN, Quantum, or Nanometric Devices," organized by the author and A. L. Chung at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, St. Louis, MO, on June 5-6, 2000.  This&lt;br/&gt;International Symposium will bring together researchers from universities, industrial and governmental research laboratories, working in the field of Quantum 1/f noise and other low frequency fluctuations. This time the Symposium is focused primarily on GaN bulk material, thin sheets, quantum structures and devices. These are particularly important for opto-electronic devices and integration.  Lower quantum 1/f noise is predicted for wide-band-gap materials and devices, because of their larger effective&lt;br/&gt;masses of the current carriers. This proposal focuses on the description of the present state and of the research directions in the field of quantum 1/f noise. Funding of this Conference is important, because high technology is becoming more and more a race between signal and noise in devices performing previously impossible tasks; the lowest noise infrared detectors, SQUIDs, logic boards or NMR machines will have the competitive edge. Quantum 1/f noise is a fundamental form of quantum chaos present in all physical cross sections and currents, which limits the performance of most high-technology devices. Furthermore, electronic noise has become important in the quality control of electronic devices. The study of electronic noise now represents an important diagnostic tool that provides important information on the nature and life time of the current carriers, as well as on the nature of the processes which limit the mobility of the&lt;br/&gt;carriers. The main objective of the participants at the present Symposium is to cooperate in this new&lt;br/&gt;field, in order to further reduce the 1/f noise in the known devices, and to extend the application to new devices which are now being developed, in particular involving high T c superconductors. The Focus of the Symposium also includes further development of the quantum 1/f theory in most rigorous terms, and its connection to studies of quantum and classical deterministic chaos. Finally, it is expected that this Symposium to benefit virtually all high-tech applications, through general low 1/f noise design and optimization principles, and to improve the understanding of the quantum 1/f effect as a technically important fundamental law of nature.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
