<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;The research aspect of this CAREER proposal focuses on a novel and&lt;br/&gt;fundamental approach for fabricating and engineering tunable band gap and lattice&lt;br/&gt;constant multi-component semiconductor substrates for optoelectronic, photonic, high&lt;br/&gt;speed electronic, spintronic, micro-electro-mechanical systems and photovoltaic&lt;br/&gt;applications. The proposed substrate engineering technology is based upon several&lt;br/&gt;advanced concepts recently developed in the areas of ternary and quaternary bulk crystal&lt;br/&gt;growth from melts, thermodynamic modeling of multi-component alloys, and interfacial&lt;br/&gt;defect generation by the principal investigator. As a part of this career award, a new&lt;br/&gt;Substrate Engineering Reactor will be designed and installed for compatible multi-component&lt;br/&gt;substrate growth and hetero-epitaxy. Multi-component engineered substrates&lt;br/&gt;of III-V compounds and related device structures will be fabricated by employing the&lt;br/&gt;new fundamental approach.&lt;br/&gt;The integration of the proposed research with undergraduate and graduate&lt;br/&gt;education at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute will include: (a) development of new&lt;br/&gt;introductory level interdisciplinary course for undergraduates in the area of compound&lt;br/&gt;semiconductor materials and device structures with specific focus towards&lt;br/&gt;microelectronics, optoelectronics, and spintronics, (b) development of a graduate level&lt;br/&gt;course on emerging materials and high performance device technologies, (c) research&lt;br/&gt;opportunities for at least two doctoral students and several undergraduate and master's&lt;br/&gt;students in the areas of substrate engineering and device fabrication on multi-component&lt;br/&gt;alloys with specific focus towards new device architectures. The introduction of the&lt;br/&gt;above topics into the undergraduate and graduate curriculum is in synergy with&lt;br/&gt;Rensselaer's educational plans and will enable and enhance student's exposure to rapidly&lt;br/&gt;growing modern and future semiconductor technologies.</AbstractNarration>
