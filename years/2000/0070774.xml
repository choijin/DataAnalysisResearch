<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nachtergaele will work on a variety of problems in quantum statistical &lt;br/&gt;mechanics. In a first group of problems he will study quantum spin systems&lt;br/&gt;as models for magnetic materials. The main focus here is on equilibrium&lt;br/&gt;and non-equilibrium properties of domain walls and other structures&lt;br/&gt;such as droplets. With Messager, he proposes a new quantum solid-on-solid &lt;br/&gt;model for the 111 interface in the Heisenberg XXZ ferromagnet. For this &lt;br/&gt;model the stability of the interface at strictly positive temperatures will &lt;br/&gt;be studied. The universality of fluctuations of interfaces will be investigated &lt;br/&gt;in a class of one-dimensional models. Another goal is to prove the existence &lt;br/&gt;of droplets in quantum spin models at zero temperature and to make first steps &lt;br/&gt;towards the study of their dynamics. In continuum quantum statistical mechanics&lt;br/&gt;Nachtergaele will work on the derivation of the Euler equations from the&lt;br/&gt;Schroedinger dynamics of interacting fermions, and on a characterization of &lt;br/&gt;the various types of Bose condensation.  The latter is a project in&lt;br/&gt;collaboration with Zagrebnov and Bru. The first is work already begun with &lt;br/&gt;HT Yau.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Quantum statistical mechanics is an area of growing interest because many of &lt;br/&gt;the phenomena that are being discovered and studied today in condensed matter&lt;br/&gt;physics and material science are intrinsically quantum mechanical: Bose&lt;br/&gt;condensation, superfluidity, superconductivity, quantum optics, quantum&lt;br/&gt;computation, and many of the most interesting aspects of magnetism at the&lt;br/&gt;microscopic scale. In addition to the implications in material science, this&lt;br/&gt;work will provide new insights in fundamental problems of quantum statistical&lt;br/&gt;mechanics and lead to analytical methods for their solution. The mathematical&lt;br/&gt;models of quantum statistical mechanics, though related to problems in partial&lt;br/&gt;differential equations, representation theory, spectral theory of operators, &lt;br/&gt;and probability theory, pose new mathematical challenges of their own.  &lt;br/&gt;Many fascinating questions have so far resisted existing analytical and &lt;br/&gt;numerical methods. The results of this project will contribute to our&lt;br/&gt;understanding of the fundamental mathematical structures of quantum mechanical&lt;br/&gt;models and, in the long run, may lead to innovations in numerical work&lt;br/&gt;on quantum mechanical models, which is increasingly needed in pure and &lt;br/&gt;applied science.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
