<AbstractNarration>Modeling Material Failure in High Strain Rate Problems&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;R. C. Batra&lt;br/&gt;Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An hyperbolic heat equation along with the equations expressing the&lt;br/&gt;balance of mass, linear momentum and moment of momentum for&lt;br/&gt;thermoviscoplastic materials will be used to delineate the initiation&lt;br/&gt;and propagation of adiabatic shear bands (ASBs) during high strain rate&lt;br/&gt;deformations of such materials.  An ASB is a narrow region of intense&lt;br/&gt;plastic deformation that usually precedes the ductile failure of most&lt;br/&gt;metals and some polymers deformed at high strain rates.  The heat&lt;br/&gt;generated due to plastic deformations of the material, heat conduction&lt;br/&gt;and thermal stresses induced will be accounted for.   The finite element&lt;br/&gt;mesh will be refined adaptively and the time increment used to integrate&lt;br/&gt;the coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations obtained by the&lt;br/&gt;Galerkin approximation of the governing equations will be adjusted&lt;br/&gt;adaptively so as to compute the stable solution within the prescribed&lt;br/&gt;accuracy.  The energy dissipation rate within the shear banded material,&lt;br/&gt;rate of energy conducted out of the edges of the band, and the energy&lt;br/&gt;used to raise the temperature of the shear banded material will be&lt;br/&gt;computed during the development of the shear band.  Its speed will be&lt;br/&gt;ascertained by locating its edges at different times.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By modeling an ASB as a singular surface, we will determine its speed of&lt;br/&gt;propagation and compare it with that computed above numerically.  It&lt;br/&gt;should be noted that an ASB is not a wave in the classical sense and it&lt;br/&gt;propagates edgewise rather than normal to its surface.  This speed will&lt;br/&gt;be related to the state of deformation of the material within and&lt;br/&gt;adjacent to the edge of the ASB.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
