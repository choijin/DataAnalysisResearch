<AbstractNarration>0076017&lt;br/&gt;Rabolt &lt;br/&gt;This GOALI proposal, which involves the University of Delaware and Dupont Corporate Research and &amp; Development Lab, is jointly funded by the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in MPS and the Instrumentation for Materials Research program in DMR. The award  supports the development and construction of a fiber-optic IR spectrograph that uses an InSb focal plane array detector and, as such, has no moving parts. The dramatic success of FTIR over the last 30 years is directly attributable to the multiplex and throughput advantages offered by interferometric instrumentation. However the use of such scanning instruments in a process environment can significantly reduce if not eliminate these advantages, due to the elevated noise level which couples with the scanning mechanism of such instruments. With the advances in optical design and material technology, dispersive instruments can now compete with FTIR in terms of throughput while keeping the multiplex advantage. With zero moving parts, the noise can be time-averaged by the spectrograph design. For this reason we believe that such a portable dispersive focal plane array spectrograph may offer significant advantages for infrared spectroscopy in a process environment where sample fluctuation is common.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This GOALI proposal, which involves the University of Delaware and Dupont Corporate Research and &amp; Development Lab, is jointly funded by the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in MPS and the Instrumentation for Materials Research program in DMR. The award supports the construction of a "first-of-its-kind" fiber optic IR spectrograph at the Materials Science and Engineering Department of the University of Delaware. This is a powerful analytical tool with no moving parts. It employs an ultrafast focal plane array detector for real-time studies of different chemical species. The success of this instrumentation project will enable an entire family of analytical tools that will find applications in on-line process monitoring, environmental protection and forensic sciences. The use of fiber optics and a focal plane array makes this infrared instrument portable, allowing it to be brought to the location of interests, e. g., to a production line of thin polymer films. In addition, The involvement of an industrial partner in this project is a good example of how a strong R &amp; D project can provide a valuable experience for students who will spend part of their time doing research in an industrial laboratory, providing them with additional work-force-ready skills. The students and postdoctoral fellows involved in this projects will be exposed to both the state-of-the-art instrumentation and real-life industrial environment, which are both crucial educational components for a successful career in engineering.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
