<AbstractNarration>Practical Persistent Data Structures&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The legal phrase "status quo ante" refers to reverting to a previous&lt;br/&gt;state of affairs.  The same concept frequently arises in computer&lt;br/&gt;science.  For example, most word processors include an "undo" feature that&lt;br/&gt;nullifies the most recent changes and returns the document to its previous&lt;br/&gt;state.  Unfortunately, most current methods of organizing data do not&lt;br/&gt;support the ability to revert to previous states, or at least do not do&lt;br/&gt;so efficiently.  This research involves designing and evaluating practical&lt;br/&gt;techniques for supporting such an ability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technically, a data structure is called "persistent" if updating the data&lt;br/&gt;structure creates a new version without destroying the old version.  After&lt;br/&gt;the update the two versions co-exist, and future operations can refer to&lt;br/&gt;either or both.  Persistent data structures are sometimes called immutable.&lt;br/&gt;Persistent data structures have applications in computational geometry,&lt;br/&gt;transaction processing, editing, functional programming, compilers, and&lt;br/&gt;many other areas.  In addition, persistent data structures have several&lt;br/&gt;important non-algorithmic benefits, including elimination of certain&lt;br/&gt;families of bugs, increased security, and decreased need for synchronization&lt;br/&gt;among multiple processors.  The objectives of this project include - inventing&lt;br/&gt;new persistent data structures, with an emphasis on practicality  rather than&lt;br/&gt;merely theoretical efficiency,  - extracting from these new data structures new&lt;br/&gt;design and analysis techniques suitable for a persistent environment, and -&lt;br/&gt;experimentally evaluating the practical efficiency of competing persistent&lt;br/&gt;data structures.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
