    <AbstractNarration>0077979&lt;br/&gt;Pruitt&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Land plants are exposed to a variety of environmental fluctuations and &lt;br/&gt;challenges that require biological adaptations at the outermost surface &lt;br/&gt;or "skin" of the plant. A better understanding of the biology of this &lt;br/&gt;surface has significance not only for plant growth and development but &lt;br/&gt;also pertains directly to the effective use and application of man-made &lt;br/&gt;agents such as agricultural herbicides. Arabidopsis thaliana, a member &lt;br/&gt;of the mustard family, has been chosen as the model organism for these &lt;br/&gt;studies. Significant progress toward elucidating biological features of &lt;br/&gt;the plant surface have already been made using this plant. The research &lt;br/&gt;described here will expand upon this body of work. The biology of the &lt;br/&gt;plant surface as it pertains specifically to its biochemical and &lt;br/&gt;molecular properties will be studied using a collection of plants with &lt;br/&gt;altered surface properties. Using these plants it will be possible to &lt;br/&gt;identify additional components involved in the building and maintenance &lt;br/&gt;of the plant outer "skin". By identifying the constituents that make up &lt;br/&gt;this complex outer layer and developing a guide for how this surface is &lt;br/&gt;put together, a better understanding of how plants mediate responses and &lt;br/&gt;adaptations to their environment will be achieved. Insight into these &lt;br/&gt;fundamental processes may possibly have far reaching economic &lt;br/&gt;consequences by ultimately diminishing the cost of weed management and &lt;br/&gt;the impact of weed-based losses in crop productivity. A reduction in &lt;br/&gt;herbicide use would have the added benefit of decreasing the &lt;br/&gt;environmental impact of modern crop management practices.</AbstractNarration>
