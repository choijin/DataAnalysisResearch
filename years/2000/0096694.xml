<AbstractNarration>. Abstract of the proposed activity.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;   The Fred and Lois Gehring Special Year at the University of Michigan&lt;br/&gt; 2001/2002 is devoted to Complex Analysis, Complex Dynamics and their&lt;br/&gt; interaction. There are several Experts in Complex &lt;br/&gt; Analysis and in Complex Dynamics at the University of Michigan,&lt;br/&gt; and in addition there will be several senior long-term visitors&lt;br/&gt; and several junior faculty hired in these areas and a good number&lt;br/&gt; of short term visitors. Also there will be two conferences highlighting&lt;br/&gt; recent developments and bringing in experts from around the world.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; 2. Abstract of Proposed Research.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;  Many phenomena in nature and human society, such as the weather,&lt;br/&gt; or the stock market, are chaotic and hard to predict and analyze. In &lt;br/&gt; fact any time three or more entities interact, the behaviour tends to &lt;br/&gt; have chaotic features as the interaction between any two of them is &lt;br/&gt; constantly interfered with by the third and the effects of these third&lt;br/&gt; person interferences accumulate and backfire. Large systems&lt;br/&gt; are beyond our ability to calculate completely. One can only understand&lt;br/&gt; with complete precision lower dimensional systems and then one can hope&lt;br/&gt; to infer from these which phenomena can happen in larger systems.&lt;br/&gt; Complex dynamics provides the low dimensional setting with the most&lt;br/&gt; tools available for such analysis. The theory of complex analysis provides&lt;br/&gt; powerful methods for complex dynamics. It is also exciting that complex &lt;br/&gt; dynamics provides tools back to complex analysis. So getting these groups&lt;br/&gt; together for an extended period should have strong impact on both areas.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;  One of the main tools in complex dynamics is (pluri)potential theory,&lt;br/&gt; which is a key area in complex analysis. Using Green functions from&lt;br/&gt; potential theory one can get invariant currents and measures for the&lt;br/&gt; dynamics via the complex Monge ampere operator. A basic problem&lt;br/&gt; here is that in some cases it is difficult to define this operator&lt;br/&gt; due to the fact that one needs to multiply distributions. Kobayashi&lt;br/&gt; hyperbolicity is another key concept. Invariant regions which are&lt;br/&gt; Kobayashi hyperbolic gives rise to nonchaotic behaviour because iterates&lt;br/&gt; are then a normal family. It is however difficult to decide which regions&lt;br/&gt; in complex manifolds are Kobayashi hyperbolic.  The best results on the&lt;br/&gt; embedding problem for Riemann surfaces in C^2 use complex dynamical &lt;br/&gt; techniques, but there are many open cases still. And these are only a&lt;br/&gt; few of the topics that will be investigated by this huge group of&lt;br/&gt; researchers&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
