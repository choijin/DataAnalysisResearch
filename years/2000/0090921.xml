<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mature CD4+CD8- and CD8+CD8- (single positive or SP) T lymphocytes develop from immature CD4+CD8+ (double positive or DP) thymocytes during transit through the thymus. The transition of cells from the DP to the SP stage is governed by signals generated by interactions between the T cell receptor (TCR) and MHC/antigen complexes encountered in the thymus. Depending on the affinity of the interactions, and involvement of select co-stimulatory molecules, DP cells will either mature or undergo cell death (apoptosis). In particular, high affinity signals mediated by the TCR induce the death of immature DP thymocytes. However, once they mature to the SP T cell stage, they respond quite differently to high affinity TCR stimulation. Instead of inducing apoptosis, SP T cells are induced to proliferate. This project reflects an interest in the molecular basis for this difference in response to TCR signals between precursors and product cell populations.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the previous NSF funding period, a marked cellular difference in the response of immature and mature T cells to TCR signals was demonstrated. The investigators found that, unlike mature SP T cells, immature DP thymocytes failed to recruit lipid rafts to the site of TCR stimulation.  Lipid rafts are specialized subdomains in the lipid membrane that are enriched for a variety of critical signaling molecules and targets that can modulate quantitatively and qualitatively TCR signaling. The data further indicated that lipid raft recruitment required PI 3-kinase activity in mature SP T cells and led the investigators to advance a mechanistic model for raft recruitment. The investigators postulated that immature DP thymocytes failed to recruit lipid rafts because they failed to optimally activate the lipid kinase, PI-3 kinase, in response to TCR signals. Further, they suggested that the failure to recruit rafts increased the susceptibility of DP thymocytes to TCR- induced cell death by compromising the activation of a critical regulator of survival and proliferation, Akt/PKB. These hypotheses will be directly addressed by this research.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
