<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0090101&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Steven A. Bleiler&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will provide partial support for speakers and others at&lt;br/&gt;semiannual conferences in the series known as the ``Cascade Topology&lt;br/&gt;Seminar,'' over a three-year period beginning in 2001. These&lt;br/&gt;conferences will be held at various universities in the northwestern&lt;br/&gt;United States and southwestern Canada, including the Universities of&lt;br/&gt;Oregon, Washington, and Puget Sound, and Boise, Portland, and Oregon&lt;br/&gt;State Universities.  Typically there will be half a dozen principal&lt;br/&gt;speakers on topics ranging widely over geometry and topology, the&lt;br/&gt;majority from outside the home institutions of the Seminar, and more&lt;br/&gt;than fifty participants altogether, roughly half of them faculty and&lt;br/&gt;half of them graduate students, as well as an occasional undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;student. Participation by younger mathematicians, by women, and by&lt;br/&gt;underrepresented minorities is encouraged.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mathematics presented in meetings of the Cascade Topology Seminar&lt;br/&gt;ranges widely over topology and geometry.  Topological issues include&lt;br/&gt;algebraic and geometric methods for describing and characterizing&lt;br/&gt;spatial problems such as the challenge of recognizing whether two&lt;br/&gt;knotted curves in three-space are essentially identical.  Geometric&lt;br/&gt;topics addressed in the Seminar include differential geometry, which&lt;br/&gt;emphasizes measures of the curvature of spaces and the consequences of&lt;br/&gt;curvature for analytic problems, as well as algebraic geometry, which&lt;br/&gt;has its roots in the study of families of solutions to polynomial&lt;br/&gt;equations.&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0090101&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Steven A.
