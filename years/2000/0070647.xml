<AbstractNarration>This proposal ties together several areas of mathematics: finite groups of Lie &lt;br/&gt;type, integral lattices and linear codes, and finite permutation groups. The &lt;br/&gt;main unifying ingredient is the representation theory. The PI continues his&lt;br/&gt;investigation on some problems on representation theory of finite groups of Lie &lt;br/&gt;type; progress on these problem will lead to important applications in the &lt;br/&gt;integral lattice theory and in the theory of finite primitive permutation&lt;br/&gt;groups. The PI proposes to determine the complex representations of a finite&lt;br/&gt;group of Lie type, which are irreducible modulo the defining characteristic.&lt;br/&gt;He also intends to classify cross-characteristic representations of finite&lt;br/&gt;groups of Lie type of low dimension. The PI then applies the results on these&lt;br/&gt;two projects to achieve significant progress on a number of applications: the&lt;br/&gt;Thompson-Gross problem on classifying globally irreducible lattices, the problem&lt;br/&gt;of finding the minimum of Euclidean integral lattices, the ``lifting'' problem,&lt;br/&gt;and the problem on maximality of certain quasi-simple subgroups of finite&lt;br/&gt;classical groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main area of research in this proposal is group theory and the&lt;br/&gt;representation theory of groups of Lie type. Groups in mathematics grew out of&lt;br/&gt;the notion of symmetry. The symmetries of an object in physics, chemistry, or&lt;br/&gt;mathematics, are encoded by a group, and this group carries a lot of&lt;br/&gt;important information about the structure of the object itself. The&lt;br/&gt;representation theory allows one to study groups via their action on vector&lt;br/&gt;spaces. It has fascinated mathematicians for a century and had&lt;br/&gt;many important applications in physics and chemistry. Thus, the representation&lt;br/&gt;theory of Lie groups played a vital role in quantum mechanics and in the theory &lt;br/&gt;of elementary particles. The finite analogs of Lie groups - finite groups of Lie&lt;br/&gt;type - and their representations have already proved valuable in coding theory&lt;br/&gt;and cryptography, and are expected to play an important role in the new era of&lt;br/&gt;computers and communications. The PI's research is and will be mostly focused &lt;br/&gt;on the representation theory of this important class of groups and its &lt;br/&gt;applications.</AbstractNarration>
