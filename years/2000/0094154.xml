    <AbstractNarration>CRHSP-28 is a novel Ca 2+ -sensitive regulatory protein, abundant in epithelial cells that are&lt;br/&gt;specialized in exocrine protein secretion. This includes Paneth cells that secrete antimicrobial&lt;br/&gt;peptides, chief and pancreatic cells that secrete digestive enzymes, lacrimal cells for corneal&lt;br/&gt;function and goblet cells that secrete mucin for tissue barrier protection. Introduction of&lt;br/&gt;recombinant CRHSP-28 into permeabilized acinar cells completely reverses the decreased Ca 2+ -dependent&lt;br/&gt;secretory capacity caused by the leakage of cytosolic proteins from the cell interior,&lt;br/&gt;indicating a direct role for CRHSP-28 in the secretory pathway. Consistent with a coiled coil&lt;br/&gt;interaction motif near its amino terminus, CRHSP-28 exists as a dimer in cytosolic extracts, and&lt;br/&gt;is associated with a large molecular complex in membrane/cytoskeleton fractions. Further,&lt;br/&gt;CRHSP-28 is concentrated around secretory granules in the apical regions of exocrine cells, and&lt;br/&gt;specifically associates with a 70 kDa binding protein (pp70) that co-purifies with secretory&lt;br/&gt;granule membranes. Significantly, soluble forms of this binding protein associate with taxol-stabilized&lt;br/&gt;microtubules when analyzed in the absence of Ca 2+ ; however, when exposed to&lt;br/&gt;elevated Ca 2+ , pp70 undergoes a complete translocation to an actin-rich detergent insoluble&lt;br/&gt;fraction. Based on biochemical and immunohistochemical data, CRHSP-28 and its associated&lt;br/&gt;proteins are proposed to regulate the delivery and movement of secretory granules through the&lt;br/&gt;subapical actin cytoskeleton in a Ca 2+ /calmodulin dependent manner. The triggering mechanism&lt;br/&gt;for this effect is theorized to entail the acute serine phosphorylation of CRHSP-28 by the&lt;br/&gt;multifunctional CaM kinase II. Thus, the primary objective of this project is to elucidate the&lt;br/&gt;precise biochemical and molecular mechanisms by which this novel CRHSP-28-mediated&lt;br/&gt;pathway regulates Ca 2+ -stimulated exocrine secretion. The Specific Aims of this project are:&lt;br/&gt;1). To test the idea that the Ca2+/calmodulin regulated phosphorylation of CRHSP-28 is a&lt;br/&gt;key signaling mechanism by which the protein modulates secretion. Experiments will first&lt;br/&gt;address the identity of the Ca 2+ -sensitive serine phosphorylation sites on CRHSP-28.&lt;br/&gt;Phosphorylation sites will be mapped in vitro and in intact cells, and verified by transfection of&lt;br/&gt;phosphorylation mutants into cultured T84 cells. The effects of normal and mutated forms of&lt;br/&gt;CRHSP-28 will then be evaluated for their ability to alter secretagogue-stimulated mucin release&lt;br/&gt;from these cells. Similarly, CRHSP-28 mutants will be expressed and purified in bacteria and&lt;br/&gt;tested in permeabilized acinar cells to assess their effects on digestive enzyme secretion.&lt;br/&gt;2). To evaluate the concept that CRHSP-28 functions in the secretory pathway of exocrine&lt;br/&gt;cells through dynamic interactions with other key regulatory proteins. These studies will be&lt;br/&gt;centered on identifying the molecular identity of the 70 kDa CRHSP-28 binding protein that &lt;br/&gt;copurifies with secretory granule membranes, binds to taxol-stabilized microtubules,&lt;br/&gt;and translocates to detergent-insoluble cytoskeletal fractions in the presence of elevated Ca 2+ .&lt;br/&gt;CRHSP-28 affinity chromatography and cDNA library screening will be used as purification&lt;br/&gt;techniques. Following cloning, tagged proteins will be expressed in cells to characterize the&lt;br/&gt;molecular interactions of CRHSP-28 with itself (as a dimer) and the 70 kDa binding protein&lt;br/&gt;using coimmunoprecipitations and dual immunofluorescence labeling. This approach will allow&lt;br/&gt;for identification of the specific sites that mediate these interactions, as well as the effects of&lt;br/&gt;second messengers and phosphorylation in regulating binding. Complementary studies will be&lt;br/&gt;conducted using tagged recombinant proteins for in vitro binding assays. Identification and&lt;br/&gt;characterization of CRHSP-28 protein interactions within the cell is key to understanding its&lt;br/&gt;regulatory function.</AbstractNarration>
