<AbstractNarration>Engineering - Other (59)&lt;br/&gt;This is a "proof-of-concept" project which is demonstrating the feasibility of using the Web to deliver next-generation, inquiry-based, active learning educational resources for biofilm engineering and science. A prototype "hypertextbook" blending standard text, graphics, interactive animations of key concepts, voice, and sound into a seamless whole is being developed and formally evaluated. Standard Web-site creation technologies is being applied to ensure that the prototype can be used with any of the usual Web browsers on all platforms, making it accessible to anyone in the world without the need to purchase special software or hardware. The prototype will serve as a general model for the development of hypertextbooks, inspiring the creation of similar resources in other engineering and science disciplines. Such hypertextbooks will be made available on CD-ROM or DVD media, obviating the need for excessive download time over the Internet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Biofilm engineering and science has been the subject of intense research efforts by a growing number of professionals over the past decade, led by the NSF-supported Engineering Research Center at Montana State University. Biofilms are of great concern to many industries, as the cost of dealing with them involves billions of dollars each year. Yet educational opportunities in biofims are currently nonexistent. The Center (now called the Center for Biofilm Engineering, or CBE) is beginning a focus on education in parallel with its continuing mission of biofilm research. Web-based educational tools-represented by the prototype of this project-will allow students in traditional settings to learn better and at their own paces, will support distance or self-taught learners, and will allow institutions with no resident experts in the subjects to provide the opportunity to learn important, new concepts. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
