<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to develop high performance, low cost, composite resins from soy oil and other natural oils for liquid molding and sheet molding manufacturing applications.  The proposed new technology for the environment project will examine the fundamental issues pertaining to the cost-effective synthesis and manufacture of soy-based high modulus resins using chemically modified triglycerides.  The research significantly expands on recent patented inventions of the Principal Investigator and is expected to develop the fundamental science to support the bio-based products by providing an affordable replacement for petroleum based materials.  The focus of the research will be on:   (1) the optimization and synthesis of liquid molding resins designed for mass-production manufacturing such as Resin Transfer Molding, VARTM and SCRIMP (This will be accomplished by chemical modification of model triglyceride and monoglyceride systems involving hydroxylation, glycerolysis, maleinization, epoxidation and acrylation of oils with known fatty acid distribution functions and degrees of unsaturation.), and  (2) the development of Sheet Molding Compound (SMC) from these reactive liquids.  The resulting SMC, when blended with glass and natural fibers forms the equivalent of sheet metal that is extensively used for mass production in the auto, trucking and ag-equipment industries. Computer simulations of network structure evolution during reactions will be conducted to provide insight into the fractal structure of the crosslinked molecular networks obtained.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is anticipated that the thermal, mechanical, and durability property analysis of the resulting bio-based materials, coupled with their low cost will provide suitable commercialization incentives for industrial partners in the subsequent research.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
