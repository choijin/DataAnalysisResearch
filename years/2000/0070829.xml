    <AbstractNarration>The principal investigator will study questions related to&lt;br/&gt;so-called nonlinear "functional differential equations" and, separately,&lt;br/&gt;to questions concerning iterates of maps which do not increase&lt;br/&gt;distance in some metric. Roughly speaking, a functional differential&lt;br/&gt;equation is one in which the rate of change of an unknown function&lt;br/&gt;x(t) depends not just on the value of x(t) itself but on the value of&lt;br/&gt;x at certain earlier times. Such equations arise naturally in models&lt;br/&gt;from physiology and nonlinear optics. Mappings which do not increase&lt;br/&gt;distance with respect to a norm on a finite dimensional vector space&lt;br/&gt;come up in many contexts, e.g., scheduling problems (the so-called&lt;br/&gt;"sup norm") and nonlinear generalizations of the theory of&lt;br/&gt;column-stochastic matrices (the so-called "ell-one norm"). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The principal investigator will study questions concerning certain&lt;br/&gt;classes of nonlinear functional differential equations. An example of&lt;br/&gt;interest is the the equation ax'(t)=f(x(t),x(t-r)), r:=r(x(t)), where&lt;br/&gt;f and r are given functions and one is interested in the limiting&lt;br/&gt;"shape" of periodic solutions of such equations as a approaches&lt;br/&gt;zero. In a different direction the principal investigator will study&lt;br/&gt;iterates of maps which are "nonexpansive", i.e., do not increase&lt;br/&gt;distance with respect to a given metric. If the metric is the ell-one&lt;br/&gt;norm on a finite dimensional vector space, one is led to a variety of&lt;br/&gt;generalizations of the classical theory of column stochastic&lt;br/&gt;matrices. The case that the metric comes from the sup norm arises in&lt;br/&gt;many applications and has led to intriguing and apparently difficult&lt;br/&gt;conjectures concerning the maximal cardinality of a periodic orbit for&lt;br/&gt;a map which is nonexpansive in the sup norm on a finite dimensional&lt;br/&gt;vector space.</AbstractNarration>
