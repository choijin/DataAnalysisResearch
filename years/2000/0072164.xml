<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0072164&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Jose F. Escobar&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Escobar proposes to work in three different variational&lt;br/&gt;problems: The first one is on conformal deformation of&lt;br/&gt;metrics. He proposes to work on the scalar curvature problem on&lt;br/&gt;scalar flat manifolds of dimension five or more.  In addition, he&lt;br/&gt;will study the prescribed scalar curvature and prescribed mean&lt;br/&gt;curvature problem on manifolds with boundary; particular&lt;br/&gt;attention will be given to this problem when the manifold is the&lt;br/&gt;Euclidean ball and the dimension is three.  Earlier&lt;br/&gt;investigations indicate that the problem in three dimensions is&lt;br/&gt;special. The second topic he proposes to study is estimates for&lt;br/&gt;the first non-zero Steklov eigenvalue on compact manifolds with&lt;br/&gt;boundary. Escobar proposes to study relations between the&lt;br/&gt;geometry of the space and the first non-zero eigenvalue and apply&lt;br/&gt;this information to problems in conformal geometry, heat flow&lt;br/&gt;problems, and to the study of eigenvalues of minimal&lt;br/&gt;surfaces. The third topic is to study Einstein metrics on&lt;br/&gt;manifolds with boundary. There are three different kinds of&lt;br/&gt;equations that arise naturally as a variational problem of a&lt;br/&gt;functional introduced by the proposer; they are Einstein metrics&lt;br/&gt;satisfying that the boundary is totally geodesic or, more&lt;br/&gt;generally, that the boundary is umbilic, and Ricci flat metrics&lt;br/&gt;with umbilic boundary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The three problems above have their roots in Riemannian geometry&lt;br/&gt;as well as in physics. The Steklov problem initially appeared in&lt;br/&gt;physics, then in harmonic analysis, partial differential&lt;br/&gt;equations, conformal geometry, and minimal surfaces.  In physics,&lt;br/&gt;it describes the temperature of a body where the flux through out&lt;br/&gt;the boundary is proportional to the temperature. We will&lt;br/&gt;investigate how the geometry of the space influence the first&lt;br/&gt;non-zero eigenvalue, that is, the smallest nonzero constant of&lt;br/&gt;proportionality. The Einstein equation proposed in this project&lt;br/&gt;is the generalization of the Einstein's equation in boundaryless&lt;br/&gt;spaces studied by Hilbert and Einstein in general relativity to&lt;br/&gt;the case of spaces with boundary.  The boundary conditions we&lt;br/&gt;will imposed are the natural ones if one studies this problem&lt;br/&gt;from the point of view of the calculus of variations. The scalar&lt;br/&gt;curvature equations that we will investigate are the average&lt;br/&gt;version of the Einstein equation on manifolds with boundary.&lt;br/&gt;Nowadays they are known as the Yamabe type equations. These&lt;br/&gt;equations appear in relativity and in other branches of physics.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
