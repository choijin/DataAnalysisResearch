    <AbstractNarration>Lipshitz and Robinson propose to continue their collaborative investigation&lt;br/&gt;into the model theory of valued fields with analytic structure. Classical &lt;br/&gt;rigid analytic geometry is based on rings of strictly convergent power series,&lt;br/&gt;i.e., power series convergent on products of "closed" discs. The proposers have &lt;br/&gt;introduced new rings of power series convergent on products of "closed" and &lt;br/&gt;"open" discs. These rings of separated power series share many of the &lt;br/&gt;desirable algebraic properties of the smaller rings of strictly convergent &lt;br/&gt;power series. In addition they are particularly well suited for model &lt;br/&gt;theoretic applications. Lipshitz and Robinson propose to continue to develop &lt;br/&gt;the commutative algebra of rings of separated power series and the corresponding &lt;br/&gt;rigid geometry in analogy to the classical case. On the model theory side they &lt;br/&gt;propose to broaden their investigation to consider the model theory of &lt;br/&gt;non-algebraically-closed valued fields with analytic structure and also to &lt;br/&gt;consider questions of uniformity over different fields in the theory of rigid &lt;br/&gt;subanalytic sets. The methods to be employed come from model theory, &lt;br/&gt;commutative algebra and algebraic geometry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sets of points in Euclidean space over the field of real numbers defined&lt;br/&gt;by systems of equations and inequalities among analytic functions are called&lt;br/&gt;semi-analytic sets. This class of sets is basic to analytic geometry. The&lt;br/&gt;projection (i.e. the shadow) of a semi-analytic set on a lower dimensional&lt;br/&gt;subspace is called subanalytic. There are more subanalytic sets than &lt;br/&gt;semi-analytic sets, and their behavior is more complicated. There is a &lt;br/&gt;natural interest in subanalytic sets. These are exactly the sets that can be&lt;br/&gt;mathematically defined from the semi-analytic sets, in the sense of formal&lt;br/&gt;logic. Furthermore, real subanalytic sets arise in several branches of&lt;br/&gt;mathematics such as differential equations and geometry. Similar classes of &lt;br/&gt;sets arise naturally, for example in number theory, over fields different from &lt;br/&gt;the real numbers, where the notion of distance has rather different properties. &lt;br/&gt;Such fields are called non-Archimedean. The corresponding subanalytic sets, &lt;br/&gt;however, share many of the nice properties of their real cousins. Lipshitz and &lt;br/&gt;Robinson will continue their investigation of the properties of these non-Archimedean &lt;br/&gt;subanalytic sets, using methods from mathematical logic, commutative algebra and&lt;br/&gt;algebraic geometry. Having developed key elements of theory in the Non-Archimedean &lt;br/&gt;case, they propose to apply their ideas to extend the classes of fields to which&lt;br/&gt;these results apply. In particular, they plan to apply ideas developed in&lt;br/&gt;the non-Archimedean setting to the real case, thereby enlarging the class of&lt;br/&gt;real sets whose nice geometric properties can be established by these means.&lt;br/&gt;Since many of the procedures used to extract geometric information about&lt;br/&gt;these sets do not vary from field to field, the also plan a careful study of the&lt;br/&gt;nature of this uniformity.</AbstractNarration>
