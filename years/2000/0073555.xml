<AbstractNarration>In this project, algebraic techniques are in use two to tackle &lt;br/&gt;two classes of problems related to improving the throughput and/or&lt;br/&gt;reliability of a communication link are under study.  The first class&lt;br/&gt;of problems under study is the design of long and efficient&lt;br/&gt;error-correcting codes.   Such codes are of interest as longer&lt;br/&gt;error-correcting codes tend to ``average'' out the noise and hence&lt;br/&gt;provide better performance.      The second class of problems relates&lt;br/&gt;to the design and analysis of families of signature sequences that are&lt;br/&gt;used to distinguish between the signals of different users in a&lt;br/&gt;multi-user environment.  Examples of multi-user environments include&lt;br/&gt;Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) cellular and personal&lt;br/&gt;communication systems.   More details on example problems drawn from&lt;br/&gt;each class are provided below.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since the early 80's, the promise of algebraic geometric (AG) codes&lt;br/&gt;has been the delivery of a sequence of error-correcting codes of&lt;br/&gt;increasing length whose asymptotic performance exceeds the&lt;br/&gt;Gilbert-Varshamov bound and for which efficient and practical  &lt;br/&gt;encoding and decoding algorithms are available.  Computationally&lt;br/&gt;efficient decoding algorithms for AG codes are now available and there&lt;br/&gt;now exist explicit descriptions of algebraic curves of the type&lt;br/&gt;required to construct these long codes.  Construction of good codes on &lt;br/&gt;these curves requires the determination of a basis for a certain type&lt;br/&gt;of vector space of functions defined on these curves.  The&lt;br/&gt;investigators study efficient methods of generating such bases.  The&lt;br/&gt;use of novel algebraic geometry techniques to generate pseudo-random&lt;br/&gt;sequences is an example of the type of problem belonging to the second&lt;br/&gt;class.  The investigators examine methods of generating sequences&lt;br/&gt;having pseudo-random properties such as low correlation and large&lt;br/&gt;linear span.  Also under investigation are more efficient means of&lt;br/&gt;assessing the performance of pseudo-random sequences in a multi-user&lt;br/&gt;setting, for example, more efficient means of determining the minimum&lt;br/&gt;Euclidean distance between adjacent multi-user signals.  The&lt;br/&gt;performance in a multi-user setting, of a a specific sequence family,&lt;br/&gt;known as family S(2) and previously co-designed by the PI is also&lt;br/&gt;under study.</AbstractNarration>
