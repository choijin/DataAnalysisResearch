<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: Melissa M. Rieger &lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Oklahoma&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 0093881&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This CAREER grant combines research and educational initiatives in the area of electrochemical engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research plan focuses on nanomaterials and electrochemistry for use in energy storage and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS).  Carbon nanotubes offer promise for chemical sensing, chemical processing, electrochemical storage and mechanical manipulation.  This research is intended to further the understanding of carbon nanotube electrochemistry and materials science.  The PI intends to study the electrochemical behavior of carbon nanotubes for use as intercalation electrodes for lithium batteries and potential chemical sensors.  The project will be divided into three main areas: (1) electrode fabrication and carbon nanotube growth, (2) electrochemical evaluation, and (3) surface morphology and chemical modification.  Techniques such as cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy will be employed to characterize the chemical and physical structure of the carbon nanotube electrodes.  Also, the physical and chemical structure of the electrode materials will be studied and related to the chemical mechanism for intercalation and surface adsorption.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Complementing the research plan is the PI's commitment to women in engineering.  As faculty adviser for the Society of Women Engineers (SWE), she is working with other women engineers on the primary issue of recruiting and retaining women in engineering.  To increase retainment of undergraduate women in engineering, a Women in Engineering Orientation for freshman and a Women in Research Seminar Series will be implemented.  Through contacts with SWE, one female engineering student will also be recruited to serve as undergraduate assistant in the PI's lab.  The PI is working with teachers and students involved with Oklahoma Network for Excellence in Education (ONE) on education in engineering and science.  The plan is to build partnerships between local elementary schools and the College of engineering.  These partnerships will be coordinated through SWE and ONE to promote science and engineering principles in surrounding elementary schools.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
