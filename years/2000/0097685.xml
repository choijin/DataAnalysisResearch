    <AbstractNarration>The proposed REU site program will provide students with intensive summer research experience in the Department of Biology at the University of Massachusetts Boston. Consistent with the mission of the University, the project aims to involve a diverse group of students, including non-traditional students from urban environments, minorities underrepresented in science, and women. Ten undergraduates, recruited locally and nationally, will participate in research with faculty sponsors, enrichment activities that help students understand the issues surrounding modern biology, and field trips designed to create a better understanding of the environment and a spirit of fellowship among students. Students will interact with faculty, graduate students, and other undergraduates pursuing research on campus to gain first-hand knowledge of the research process. The program begins with a three-day retreat to a field station on Nantucket Island, MA, where students learn about the history and biology of Nantucket, discuss their expectations of the REU program, and form bonds and friendships that enhance their REU experience. After returning from Nantucket, students engage in individual research projects in which each student works closely with an advisor/mentor and participate in weekly group discussions where students confront ethical issues, learn about the practical aspects of doing science, and become familiar with the research of their fellow students. Potential research topics span the breadth of modern biology, including neurobiology, genetics, ecology, immunology, and cell and developmental biology. At the conclusion of the program each student will prepare a report and present research results in a student research symposium. The focus of the ethics component will be the research process and contemporary topics in biomedical ethics, such as the Human Genome Project. Participants will also visit several field sites and learn directly about other student projects. A hands-on workshop on molecular techniques will demonstrate the great potential of such methods for many aspects of biological research. The REU Program in Biology will continue UMass Boston's tradition of successful and productive undergraduate research.</AbstractNarration>
