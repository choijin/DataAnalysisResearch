<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to develop database technologies that address the demands of data-intensive applications, which handle distributed, spatial and multimedia data sources. The research effort focuses on: (1) the development of new spatial query processing algorithms that can be dynamically and flexibly reordered and adapted during query execution to address the fluctuation in response time and the unexpected delays from the various input web-based spatial data sources; (2) the development of indexing techniques and technologies to facilitate the embedding of non-traditional spatial and high-dimensional indexing structures into database systems; and (3) the development of disk scheduling algorithms that scale up towards achieving multiple quality of service requirements for multimedia applications. The techniques generated by these research tasks will facilitate the efficient support of modern applications in database systems and will allow database systems to match the dynamically changing demands of these applications. The education effort focuses on: (1) the involvement of both undergraduate and graduate students in hands-on research activities and experimentation; (2) the development of several curriculum elements including two courses and three educational tools, and the introduction of these tools into the existing and newly developed courses; (3) the development of a multimedia database and information systems laboratory to facilitate the integration of research results and education; and (4) facilitating industrial interaction for students. The outcomes of this project -- including newly developed database technologies, research tools, and curriculum elements -- will be publicly disseminated and shared with colleagues, students, and industrial collaborators in the database systems area.</AbstractNarration>
