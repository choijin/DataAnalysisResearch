<AbstractNarration>DMS-0072202&lt;br/&gt;Viktor L. Ginzburg&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The present proposal focuses on several long-term projects&lt;br/&gt;and continues principal investigator's previous work funded &lt;br/&gt;by an NSF grant. The first question addressed in the proposal&lt;br/&gt;is the Hamiltonian Seifert conjecture or, more specifically, &lt;br/&gt;the existence problem for Hamiltonian dynamical systems without periodic orbits on a sequence of regular energy levels. The &lt;br/&gt;Hamiltonian Seifert conjecture is closely related to the next &lt;br/&gt;group of questions considered in the proposal. These questions &lt;br/&gt;lie in the area of symplectic topology and concern the existence &lt;br/&gt;of periodic orbits for Hamiltonian systems describing the motion &lt;br/&gt;of a charge in a magnetic field.  The second part of the proposal includes a series of problems in Poisson geometry. Among these &lt;br/&gt;problems are, for example, the existence questions for equivariant Poisson moment maps and the construction of Poisson traces corresponding to the leaves of the symplectic foliation. A &lt;br/&gt;general program relying on applications of equivariant cobordisms &lt;br/&gt;to the study of Hamiltonian actions of compact groups is the &lt;br/&gt;subject of the concluding part of the proposal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hamiltonian dynamical systems describe many classes of &lt;br/&gt;physical processes in which dissipation of energy can be &lt;br/&gt;neglected. For example, planetary motion in celestial &lt;br/&gt;mechanics and some electro- or magneto-dynamical processes &lt;br/&gt;can be, and usually are, treated as Hamiltonian dynamical &lt;br/&gt;systems. One of the classical subjects in the theory of &lt;br/&gt;dynamical systems is the study of periodic orbits &lt;br/&gt;(i.e. cyclic motions). Periodic motion is the simplest &lt;br/&gt;and most common type of motion after equilibrium.&lt;br/&gt;It is believed that a vast majority of Hamiltonian systems &lt;br/&gt;have periodic orbits. The first problem addressed in the&lt;br/&gt;proposal is the construction of Hamiltonian systems without &lt;br/&gt;periodic orbits. This is a question of considerable &lt;br/&gt;importance for the theory of Hamiltonian dynamical systems &lt;br/&gt;because examples of such systems would further advance our understanding of Hamiltonian dynamics. The next problem &lt;br/&gt;concerns the existence of periodic orbits for Hamiltonian &lt;br/&gt;systems describing the motion of a charge in a magnetic field. &lt;br/&gt;This class of Hamiltonian systems naturally arises in &lt;br/&gt;applications in physics and mechanics. However, few of the &lt;br/&gt;extremely powerful general methods that have been recently &lt;br/&gt;developed in symplectic geometry are applicable to this &lt;br/&gt;class of systems. The investigation of these systems should &lt;br/&gt;extend the limits of existing methods and result in the &lt;br/&gt;development of novel ones. Other problems considered in &lt;br/&gt;the proposal concern the study of connections between&lt;br/&gt;geometrical properties of classical-mechanical systems &lt;br/&gt;and certain quantum-mechanical phenomena. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
