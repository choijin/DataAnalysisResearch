    <AbstractNarration>0088450&lt;br/&gt;Tedesco&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Radiometric measurements of Near-Earth Asteroids (NEAs) at wavelengths of 0.55 micrometers and 10.6 micrometers are used to derive albedos and diameters to refine asteroid thermal models. NEA population's size frequency distribution enables an accurate estimate of the population density distributoin. The origin and evolution of the NEA's are derived from these measurements. This information is critical to our understanding of the origins and the evolution of asteroids within the solar system provides fundamental research insight into the probability of an asteroid striking the earth. Asteroids striking the earth are now believed to have contributed to several very significant changes in life on the surface of our planet. There appear to be three or four times since life first appeared on the earth that the effects of asteroids striking the earth have eliminated almost all forms of life for thousands of years. This innovative proposal will lay the foundation for future understanding of solar-system interactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Radiometric measurements are recorfded using the 3.67-meter Advanced Electro-Optical System of the US Air Force in this joint NSF/Air Force program.&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>
