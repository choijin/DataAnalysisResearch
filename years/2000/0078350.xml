    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (sbir) Phase II project will demonstrate use of the novel low-frequence sonic technology for application as an advanced fermentation process. This project objective will establish a fundamental understanding of the low-frequency sonic technology capabilities to increase the productivity and yield of various aerobic fermentation processes, e.g., bacteria, yeast and mycelial. The Phase II program includes the development, design and demonstration of a prototype processing system as an efficient and cost-effective method for advanced fermentation applications. The Phase I objectives were fully achieved and feasibility of the innovative technology was demonstrated to provide extraordinarily high rates of gas mass transport into liquids, at low energy values and at low shear rates. The quality and amount of scientific and engineering data exceeded expectations, providing a solid base for a Phase II success. Post-Phase II experimentation was undertaken, which demonstrated a specific commercial applications that have market-pull for use of the innovative fermentation methods. Several potential Phase III commercial fermentation applications have been identified. A commercial partner for Phase II co-funding and Phase III funding has been obtained. The commercial partner has also agreed to purchase equipment from Montec for their newly acquired fermentation business.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Commercial applications for fermentation processes include large quantity drug production for enhancement of both human and animal health, amino acids such as lysine for animal feeds and phenylalanine for production of aspartame, food preservatives such as ascorbic acid (vitamin C), vitamins and a plethora of other commodity compounds. In general, the production of an increasing number of biologically active compounds is shifting from traditional organic synthesis to fermentation. In these areas, the development of a lower cost, higher productivity technology has strong commercial appeal both in new and retrofit situations. Fermentation is the commercial end of the genetic engineering revolution and is virtually used in all of the cutting edge therapeutics.</AbstractNarration>
