<AbstractNarration>For the past twenty years, theories of social choice have emphasized the &lt;br/&gt;important effects of institutions. However, the cognitive structures with which &lt;br/&gt;individuals represent a decision context are also important. These mental &lt;br/&gt;models, or knowledge structures, create categories and relationships among &lt;br/&gt;alternatives, thereby influencing the existence and characteristics of an &lt;br/&gt;equilibrium. In previous papers it was shown that in both cooperative games such&lt;br/&gt;as social choice and non-cooperative games such as coordination problems, the &lt;br/&gt;prospects for stability are greatly improved when players have shared mental &lt;br/&gt;representations (despite having conflicting preferences). These results are &lt;br/&gt;broadly referred to as a "knowledge-induced equilibrium."&lt;br/&gt; Although a knowledge-induced equilibrium is immune to manipulation by insincere&lt;br/&gt;voting, the more interesting question is the extent to which players can &lt;br/&gt;manipulate others' mental representations--such as through framing, discourse, &lt;br/&gt;or persuasion--in order to influence the collective outcome. This "second-order"&lt;br/&gt;strategic behavior is much closer to William Riker's concept of heresthetics. The task &lt;br/&gt;of this project is to explore the possibilities and characteristics of &lt;br/&gt;manipulation in the knowledge-induced equilibrium framework. More specifically, &lt;br/&gt;the investigator constructs a game model where players can send signals to a subset of other players to which they are persuasive in an attempt to alter the mental &lt;br/&gt;representations of the decision context and thereby altering the collective &lt;br/&gt;outcome. Players' strategies include heresthetical tactics such as arguing &lt;br/&gt;relationships among alternatives, adding or removing alternatives from the &lt;br/&gt;choice set, and influencing the distribution and depth of other players' &lt;br/&gt;knowledge representations. Results from the project contribute to several &lt;br/&gt;topics, including (1) explanations of the endogenous emergence of shared &lt;br/&gt;knowledge structures through strategic dialogue, (2) the identification of &lt;br/&gt;structural positions or contexts that are "lever points" in that a player has &lt;br/&gt;disproportionate ability to direct the outcome through strategic persuasion, (3)&lt;br/&gt;a formalization of a set of heresthetical maneuvers along the lines called for &lt;br/&gt;by Riker, (4) applications to bargaining and negotiation theory, and (5) the &lt;br/&gt;development of an alternative index of power based on equilibrium opportunities &lt;br/&gt;for strategic persuasion rather than on the combinatorics of coalitions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
