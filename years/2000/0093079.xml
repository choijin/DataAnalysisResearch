    <AbstractNarration>0093079&lt;br/&gt;Langreth&lt;br/&gt;This theoretical project is comprised of several related topics. One of them is density functional theory of both long-range and short-range interaction between microscopic and mesoscopic bodies. Another looks at a theory of electronic dissipation, non-adiabatic charge transfer and potentials and rates for atoms and molecular species moving and reacting at a solid surface. A third component is the theory of transport in quantum dots using techniques previously developed for non-adiabatic charge transfer. This work is related to the properties of metals and insulators at a surface. It explores the new physical phenomena which are seen as an electron, an atom, or a molecular species moves near a surface. These include very subtle, long-range and technologically important questions of forces between small bodies and between a small grain and a surface. They include complex questions of charge transfer, dissipation and energy transfer, when do they happen and how. Finally there are attempts to understand transport in single electron transistors, consisting of very small artificial structures embedded in metallic layers on semiconductor surfaces.&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;This is a theoretical project comprised of a number of related topics including ones dealing with the interactions of small objects (electrons, atoms, molecules) with larger ones (surfaces and quantum dots). Included are fundamental issues related to nanoscale phenomena and nanodevices.&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>
