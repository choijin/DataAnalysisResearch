<AbstractNarration>DMS-0071693&lt;br/&gt;Washington Mio and John Bryant&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Topological n-manifolds are spaces locally homeomorphic to &lt;br/&gt;Euclidean n-space. The simple local structure of manifolds &lt;br/&gt;lends them a very special role in mathematics since phenomena &lt;br/&gt;modeled on these spaces are amenable to a vast array of &lt;br/&gt;methods and tools. The study of the structure of manifolds &lt;br/&gt;has been an important theme in geometric topology for many &lt;br/&gt;decades.  More recently, spaces called generalized manifolds, &lt;br/&gt;with the large-scale properties of topological manifolds but &lt;br/&gt;very intricate local structure, were discovered by the proposers &lt;br/&gt;in joint work with S. Ferry and S. Weinberger. Previously &lt;br/&gt;conjectured not to exist, the first theoretical evidence that &lt;br/&gt;they might exist appeared in the work of F. Quinn.  This &lt;br/&gt;project proposes to continue the investigation of the topology &lt;br/&gt;of generalized manifolds. This study is intimately related to &lt;br/&gt;important structural properties of manifolds, such as the &lt;br/&gt;conjectural rigidity of aspherical manifolds and the &lt;br/&gt;Siebenmann periodicity phenomenon. Other indications of &lt;br/&gt;the relevance of these spaces are present in areas as &lt;br/&gt;diverse as Dynamical Systems, Geometric Group Theory and C-star-algebras.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The long-term goal of this project is to probe the local &lt;br/&gt;structure of generalized manifolds and establish a deeper &lt;br/&gt;parallel between generalized manifolds and topological &lt;br/&gt;manifolds by showing that these exotic spaces satisfy most &lt;br/&gt;of the fundamental properties of manifolds, such as topological homogeneity, the s-cobordism theorem, and the alpha-approximation theorem. More immediate goals of the proposed investigation &lt;br/&gt;include the study of control improvement problems, submanifold &lt;br/&gt;and map transversality questions, normal bundle and embedding &lt;br/&gt;problems for generalized manifolds. These are elements that &lt;br/&gt;arise naturally in the study of the core problems, and they &lt;br/&gt;also represent important ramifications of independent interest. &lt;br/&gt;The main technique to be employed is controlled topology, &lt;br/&gt;including controlled homotopy theory, controlled K-theory, &lt;br/&gt;and controlled surgery applied to patch representations of &lt;br/&gt;generalized manifolds and, ultimately, to generalized manifolds themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
