<AbstractNarration>Physics (13) Reform movements in calculus and in physics education have shown the advantage of active methods in lively applications for improving students' conceptual understandings. Research has shown that the learning of diverse groups of students is enhanced by the use of multimedia. The Mathematics Across the Curriculum projects supported by the NSF have shown the efficacy of embedding mathematics within other disciplines. This project brings all of these insights together with interesting human applications of physics to reform the algebra- based physics course. This project is developing a complete set of course materials and background physics notes that can be used in a wide variety of institutional settings to offer a reformed algebra-based physics course to diverse student audiences. In addition to the human applications, the interactive learning methods encouraged by these materials are especially helpful to enable the students to learn by methods of inquiry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project co-PIs at UNL, Texas Tech University, Mercy College and Doane College are developing content topics with the help of a mathematics consultant. The materials are being field-tested and assessed in cooperation with the evaluation consultant. Materials developed at each institution are being field-tested at the other cooperating institutions, and tested materials will be made available for commercial distribution. By the end of the project completely reformed algebra-based physics course materials featuring human applications supported by interactive multimedia and mathematical modeling will be available for use across the nation. Faculty enhancement institutes will be held using these materials. The use of these materials for the learning of physics concepts by inquiry methods will be advocated. The appropriateness of the multimedia and mathematical modeling materials for a wide range of students will be demonstrated. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
