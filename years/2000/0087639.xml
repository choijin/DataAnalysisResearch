<AbstractNarration>The purpose of this work is to support the understanding and development of protocols&lt;br/&gt;that can provide personal privacy over the Internet. While there have been some protocols&lt;br/&gt;proposed and implemented that hide the IP address of network communicators, there has been&lt;br/&gt;no systematic study of such protocols, nor have methods of analyzing the anonymity and security&lt;br/&gt;of those protocols been developed. A thorough understanding of anonymity is important not only&lt;br/&gt;for the development, analysis, and use of anonymous protocols for personal privacy, but also for&lt;br/&gt;understanding how network attackers can hide their location and for developing methods to track&lt;br/&gt;those attackers. Our eventual goal is to develop new techniques and protocols for anonymity,&lt;br/&gt;including a \logic of anonymity" similar to those developed for authentication protocols that&lt;br/&gt;can be used to describe and analyze anonymous protocols.&lt;br/&gt;This proposal considers a number of contributions on this research area. Our first contri-&lt;br/&gt;bution will be to take a more general view of anonymous communication than previous work&lt;br/&gt;by considering protocols and techniques for hiding the identity of a responder from all other&lt;br/&gt;parties, and for providing completely anonymous communication in which both the initiator and&lt;br/&gt;responder are anonymous to each other and all other parties. The former technique is useful&lt;br/&gt;for anonymous web sites (rather than just anonymous web browsing); the later technique is&lt;br/&gt;useful for true two-party privacy over the Internet. Our second class of contributions will be to&lt;br/&gt;consider generalized protocol construction. This extends our past work, which de-coupled the&lt;br/&gt;forward and reverse paths of anonymous communication, giving rise to a large family of anony-&lt;br/&gt;mous protocols. We will continue investigation of those protocols, and examine what network&lt;br/&gt;support is available for anonymous communication and what support might best be provided in&lt;br/&gt;the future. Our third contribution will be to provide a formalism for anonymous protocols such&lt;br/&gt;that beliefs regarding entity identities can be reasoned by stating assumptions and deriving log-&lt;br/&gt;ical conclusions from following steps of defined protocols. Fourth, we will consider the network&lt;br/&gt;performance of anonymous routing protocols in an in-depth fashion, including not only latency&lt;br/&gt;and traffic, but also requirements of streaming media applications and traditional TCP-based&lt;br/&gt;bulk-data transfer applications. Finally, we will consider heretofore ignored security concerns&lt;br/&gt;of existing protocols, initially considering path analysis attacks and attacks that cause some&lt;br/&gt;participants to be unfairly accused by third parties. The formalism provided by our proposed&lt;br/&gt;logic of anonymity will be a foundational component of our security analysis work.&lt;br/&gt;Collaboration between these our two institutions will allow us to leverage the existing&lt;br/&gt;strength in networking at the University of Massachusetts and the existing strength in secu-&lt;br/&gt;rity at Purdue.&lt;br/&gt;1</AbstractNarration>
