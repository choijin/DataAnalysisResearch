<AbstractNarration>Livebearing fishes of the Family Poeciliidae exhibit a variety of developmental strategies. In the&lt;br/&gt;guppy, young develop in the ovary from the energy stored in large, yolky eggs (lecithotrophy), whereas in&lt;br/&gt;the least killifish, the eggs are very small, with little yolk, and most energy for development and growth is&lt;br/&gt;transferred from the mother to the embryo through a placenta-like structure (obligate matrotrophy). Other&lt;br/&gt;species exhibit a mixed strategy in which energy stored in relatively large eggs is supplemented by&lt;br/&gt;maternal transfer of nutrients during embryonic development (supplemental matrotrophy). The type of&lt;br/&gt;strategy exhibited by a given species has been suggested to reflect the productivity of the environment&lt;br/&gt;that it inhabits. Obligate matrotrophs are predicted to occur only in highly productive environments where&lt;br/&gt;food for the mother is abundant and predictable. In less productive or less predictable environments,&lt;br/&gt;lecithotrophy is the expected strategy. Species that exhibit supplemental matrotrophy may inhabit&lt;br/&gt;unpredictable environments but be capable of exploiting excess food if it occurs and passing extra energy&lt;br/&gt;on to developing offspring (facultative supplemental matrotrophy).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The largespring gambusia has traditionally been considered to be strictly lecithotrophic, but&lt;br/&gt;recent studies have demonstrated mother-to-embryo transfer of nutrients in this species despite the&lt;br/&gt;absence of an obvious placental structure. This study proposes to use radiolabeled nutrients to quantify&lt;br/&gt;matrotrophic contribution in largespring gambusia in order to address the following questions: What is&lt;br/&gt;the nature of the mother-embryo transfer surface and how does it limit the amount or types of nutrients&lt;br/&gt;transferred? To what extent does the largespring gambusia exhibit matrotrophy under natural conditions?&lt;br/&gt;How does matrotrophic contribution vary with environmental conditions within a given population and&lt;br/&gt;among different populations? Understanding the occurrence of facultative matrotrophy, both across&lt;br/&gt;habitats and temporally within habitats, may help explain the variety of developmental strategies within&lt;br/&gt;the Family Poeciliidae and the relationship of those strategies to environmental productivity. Furthermore,&lt;br/&gt;the strategy of facultative matrotrophy itself may reflect an adaptation to unpredictable environments that&lt;br/&gt;allows species exhibiting this strategy to occupy habitats that undergo natural environmental variation.&lt;br/&gt;This strategy, then, may provide an important buffer against human-induced environmental changes.</AbstractNarration>
