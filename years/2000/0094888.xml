<AbstractNarration>The Computer Science, Engineering, and Mathematics Scholars (CSEM Scholars) program is increasing the number of students completing certificate programs, obtaining associate degrees, or transferring to four-year institutions in the areas of computer science, computer technology, engineering, engineering technology, or mathematics. The scholarships are for traditional age college students from public and private county high schools. The targeted students are being identified with the help of high school guidance counselors and teachers. The program seeks to identify minority populations, especially women and persons with disabilities, who meet the scholarship eligibility requirements. The specific program goals include recruiting graduating high school seniors to attend the college with a declared major in computer science, computer technology, engineering, engineering technology, or mathematics; identifying and recruiting female or disabled students; providing a summer institute and job shadowing for incoming scholarship recipients; developing new joint ventures between the public schools and the college; increasing the number of county residents with skills to meet high tech needs of business and industry, and developing a comprehensive assessment plan to evaluate the effectiveness of planned activities.</AbstractNarration>
