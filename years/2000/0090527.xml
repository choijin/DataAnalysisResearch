<AbstractNarration>Cell walls are carbohydrate and protein structures that surround and separate plant cells.&lt;br/&gt;As plant cells expand in a regulated fashion they must necessarily modify and enlarge&lt;br/&gt;their cell walls to permit the subsequent increase in volume. The cell wall itself might&lt;br/&gt;influence this expansion process. Thus the cell has the potential to influence almost every&lt;br/&gt;aspect of plant function simply because of its position and physical properties. For this&lt;br/&gt;reason many have speculated on its role in a plant's development and response to the&lt;br/&gt;outside world. Cell growth can occur in many dimensions, such as the polarized&lt;br/&gt;expansion of a pollen tube tip, the creation of elongated cells characteristic of many&lt;br/&gt;vegetative tissues, the establishment of a meristem, or even the jigsaw-like arrangement&lt;br/&gt;of cells at the leaf surface. Currently the understanding of how cell wall architecture is&lt;br/&gt;coordinated with programmed and hormone regulated cell expansion events during&lt;br/&gt;development is not well understood in angiosperms.&lt;br/&gt;Recent studies have identified a number of proteins at the cell surface that could&lt;br/&gt;directly regulate cell wall functions, and the Cell Wall Associated Kinases, or WAKs, are&lt;br/&gt;among these. There are five cell wall associated kinases in Arabidopsis and&lt;br/&gt;representatives in other angiosperm families. WAKs each have a cytoplasmic&lt;br/&gt;serine/threonine protein kinase domain, span the plasma membrane and extend a domain&lt;br/&gt;into the cell wall. WAKs physically link the plasma membrane to the carbohydrate matrix&lt;br/&gt;and are unique in that they have the potential to directly signal cellular events through&lt;br/&gt;their kinase domain.&lt;br/&gt;The WAK extracellular domain is variable between the five isoforms, and collectively&lt;br/&gt;the family is expressed in all organs. WAK1 and WAK2 are the most ubiquitously and&lt;br/&gt;abundantly expressed of the five tandemly arrayed genes, and their messages are present&lt;br/&gt;in vegetative meristems, junctions of organ types, and areas of cell expansion. They are&lt;br/&gt;also induced by pathogen infection and wounding. The WAK1 but not WAK2 cell wall&lt;br/&gt;domain binds to a glycine rich protein (GRP) of the cell wall in in vitro assays. WAK1&lt;br/&gt;and GRP can be co-immunoprecipitated from leaf or seedling extracts, and this WAK is&lt;br/&gt;phosphorylated. Recent experiments demonstrate that antisense WAK expression leads&lt;br/&gt;to the loss of cell expansion, and preliminary results indicate that antisense GRP&lt;br/&gt;production causes an enhancement of cell expansion (and eventual cell death). Thus GRP&lt;br/&gt;may be a negative regulator of WAK activity. A large amount of WAK is also covalently&lt;br/&gt;linked to pectin, and most of WAK that is bound to pectin is also phosphorylated. The&lt;br/&gt;data support a model where WAK1 is bound to GRP as a phosphorylated kinase, and also&lt;br/&gt;binds to pectin. How WAKs are involved in signaling from the pectin extracellular matrix&lt;br/&gt;in coordination with GRPs will be key to the understanding of the cell wall's role in cell&lt;br/&gt;growth.&lt;br/&gt;WAKs are poised to provide a direct signal from the cell wall to the cytoplasm of many&lt;br/&gt;cell types during the development of Arabidopsis. In order to characterize the&lt;br/&gt;associations and roles of GRPs and WAKs in plants it will be necessary to generate&lt;br/&gt;additional (partial) loss of function alleles of the two predominant WAKs and of GRP.&lt;br/&gt;These alleles can then be used to determine the relationship of WAK mediated cell&lt;br/&gt;expansion to other known signaling pathways. WAK kinase substrates will be also&lt;br/&gt;identified and used to assay the activation of WAK by wall components and&lt;br/&gt;developmental cues, and eventually mutant alleles of these substrates will help in the&lt;br/&gt;analysis of WAKs and cell elongation. The goal is to understand how WAKs in&lt;br/&gt;association with GRP and pectins regulate cytoplasmic components so that the cell wall&lt;br/&gt;is coordinated with processes of cell growth.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
