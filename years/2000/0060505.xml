    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is for the development of a neutral, high&lt;br/&gt;flux/fluence nitrogen atom beam source for application to the high rate growth of III-V nitride&lt;br/&gt;semiconducting materials over large areas. The proposed source is based on Physical Sciences Inc.'s&lt;br/&gt;(PSI's) proprietary MID-JET technology. This technology employs an electrode-less discharge&lt;br/&gt;contained by vortex flow, rather than a dielectric tube commonly used in traditional sources. The&lt;br/&gt;discharge is formed at 1 atm which results in efficient Ion recombination and a charge-free beam.&lt;br/&gt;Previously, high flux, high fluence oxygen and fluorine atom beams have been demonstrated using a&lt;br/&gt;MID-JET with a gas temperature of ~ 3000 K. However, to produce a nitrogen atom beam, the basic&lt;br/&gt;configuration of the MID-JET must be changed to obtain the &gt; 5000 K temperatures required to&lt;br/&gt;dissociate nitrogen. In Phase I, PSI will examine at least two new configurations via modeling, select&lt;br/&gt;one, and fabricate and test an experimental source for nitrogen. Techniques for combining the nitrogen&lt;br/&gt;beam with a gallium source will be examined via detailed numerical modeling. If successful, PSI will&lt;br/&gt;demonstrate a charge-free nitrogen atom source with a fluence of about 10 21 atoms/s, 2 to 3 orders of&lt;br/&gt;magnitude higher than that generated by currently available sources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop a charge-free, high flux/fluence nitrogen atom beam for the growth of III-V&lt;br/&gt;nitride materials which can replace existing plasma-based tools. The source can allow higher growth&lt;br/&gt;rates over larger areas of high quality material with application to the fabrication of high power/high&lt;br/&gt;temperature semiconductor devices and blue illumination sources (including those for flat panel&lt;br/&gt;displays).</AbstractNarration>
