<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;     This summer initiative will familiarize selected high-school&lt;br/&gt;students with Bioinformatics, an increasingly important field with strong&lt;br/&gt;potential for growth in the coming decades. This course is oriented toward&lt;br/&gt;female high school students. This program will be offered in the summer of &lt;br/&gt;2001, and will be open to qualified young women who have&lt;br/&gt;just completed their third year of high school. Particular encouragement&lt;br/&gt;will be given to young women who are members of minority groups; who are&lt;br/&gt;from low-income families; and who lack strong role models in science and&lt;br/&gt;technology. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;     Upon conclusion of the program, the participants will be able to:&lt;br/&gt;- Describe, apply, and analyze principles of molecular biology; &lt;br/&gt;- Use the Internet, Microsoft Office, and Bioinformatics tools; &lt;br/&gt;- Use problem-based learning techniques; &lt;br/&gt;- Distinguish the outcomes of their data entries and manipulations; &lt;br/&gt;- Comprehend Bioinformatics as a field of study; &lt;br/&gt;- Know the roles that women can achieve in science and information &lt;br/&gt;    technology; and &lt;br/&gt;- Value group process as a means of learning .&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;     In the program, participating young women will live on campus during&lt;br/&gt;the five-week program period; take courses during the day; participate in&lt;br/&gt;hands-on lab work; work together as members of small teams; benefit from&lt;br/&gt;presentations from and discussions with working professionals in the field;&lt;br/&gt;and travel to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, government&lt;br/&gt;laboratories, and other sites to complement their coursework, and learn how&lt;br/&gt;Bioinformatics is used in the scientific field. The program will use the&lt;br/&gt;NSF-funded Biology Student Workbench (BSW) program as the part of the&lt;br/&gt;curriculum, and the program organizers will work closely with the staff of&lt;br/&gt;that project in order to implement it appropriately. Using a problem-based&lt;br/&gt;learning approach, the investigators will teach via student-centered group&lt;br/&gt;interaction, and will create specific scenarios for student research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The program will be designed to encourage young women to pursue &lt;br/&gt;Bioinformatics as a field of study, and ultimately as a profession. Participants &lt;br/&gt;will strengthen their general computer skills and their ability to use the&lt;br/&gt;Internet as an interactive tool. By working in teams they will increase&lt;br/&gt;their problem solving abilities, communication skills and ability to&lt;br/&gt;interact with others. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Upon conclusion of the program, information will be&lt;br/&gt;disseminated to encourage the replication of the program at other sites&lt;br/&gt;nationwide through presentations and publications, as well as work with&lt;br/&gt;BioQuest and the Biology Student Workbench team. The program organizers&lt;br/&gt;except to extend the benefits to other high school students and teachers,&lt;br/&gt;and encourage many young women to enter computer technology, mathematics,&lt;br/&gt;and science fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
