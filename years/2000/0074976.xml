<AbstractNarration>The goal of this research is to develop a low-cost, robust, automated on-line monitoring system, which controls the painting process based, in part, upon perceived surface appearance.  This program will focus on the following objectives: determination of an efficient way to integrate human perception into a vision system hardware and software design which uses reflectance models as a rational basis; an investigation of the best image attributes and processing techniques to exploit the link between this vision system and perceived surface appearance; and prototype development of an expert system within the vision system software which facilitates as assessment of surface quality based on captured image data.  The project utilizes a four-prong approach, which includes small-scale experiments, simulation, prototype testing and on-site testing in parallel with existing methods.  This effort will expand the small-scale setup and use simulation to develop a methodology for capturing images and obtaining and analyzing derived attributes which are readily interpreted by both system software and line operators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research should provide direction to a more robust method to characterize, monitor and control surface quality.  The educational plan for the program includes collaborative, hands-on research experiences and mentoring for a diverse population, and enhancement of the principal investigator's ability to build and maintain a competitive research program, which attracts a well-prepared, diverse group of students.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
