<AbstractNarration>Engineering - Other (59)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cooper Union is creating a new learning environment in the interdisciplinary curricula of fluid mechanics and engineering mechanics. The new environment, based on the classroom-studio concept originally developed at Renssalaer Polytechnic Institute, seeks to better integrate the process of design education into engineering education. Further, in its most innovative aspect, the project involves using the studio-classroom, combined with a prototyping studio, to improve design education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To that end, the Cooper Union is equipping two closely related Learning Laboratories, one for fluid mechanics and one for engineering mechanics. The Learning Labs add an interactive mode to the traditional classroom lecture format, adapting standard, proven bench-scale equipment used in typical engineering education&lt;br/&gt;for fluid and engineering mechanics. The new facilities take full advantage of new educational technologies to create a dynamic, engaging learning and teaching environment especially suited to these basic subjects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A third element, a Prototyping Studio to be supplied by Cooper Union, is adding the vital element of fabricating prototypes, which are to be conceived and iteratively tested, analyzed, and redesigned in the Learning Labs. In this way, analysis is more fully integrated into the design process, advancing design education; and practice is more closely juxtaposed with theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Learning Labs are providing pedagogical tools to seamlessly integrate conceptualization, analysis, communication, teamwork, and fabrication. They are also promoting research in engineering education and serve as a model for a new teaching methodology in other disciplines as well.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
