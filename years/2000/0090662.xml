<AbstractNarration>The electrical activity of many organs is shaped by potassium selective ion&lt;br/&gt;channel proteins. Defects in potassium channels produce several types of&lt;br/&gt;electrophysiological disturbances including cardiac arrhythmias and&lt;br/&gt;epilepsy.  These channels are the targets of many therapeutic drugs&lt;br/&gt;including the Class III anti-arrhythmic compounds.  While many types of&lt;br/&gt;potassium channels have been cloned, many of their most basic properties,&lt;br/&gt;including ion discrimination and permeation, remain poorly understood.  This&lt;br/&gt;project is designed to probe the mechanism of the interaction between&lt;br/&gt;tetraethylammonium ions (related to some Class III drugs) in the pore in&lt;br/&gt;these channels.  This will be accomplished through a combination of&lt;br/&gt;molecular biological techniques with electrophysiological recordings and&lt;br/&gt;measurements of radio-labeled unidirectional ion fluxes. An additional&lt;br/&gt;component of this work will be the development of new forms of ion&lt;br/&gt;permeation models.  These models will be developed as quantitative&lt;br/&gt;descriptions of the ion permeation mechanism but, more importantly, will be&lt;br/&gt;used to design new experiments and test competing mechanisms.  A Web site&lt;br/&gt;will be established in order to facilitate wide distribution of these models&lt;br/&gt;for teaching and scientific uses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results from this work will aid the understanding of selectivity and&lt;br/&gt;permeation in ion channel proteins.  Since many therapeutic drugs interact&lt;br/&gt;with the pore in these channels and with ions in the pore, understanding the&lt;br/&gt;mechanisms of permeation and block may lead to the development of better&lt;br/&gt;drug therapies.  The modeling tools that will be developed and broadly&lt;br/&gt;disseminated will help educate students and other scientists about these&lt;br/&gt;fundamental properties of ion channel proteins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
