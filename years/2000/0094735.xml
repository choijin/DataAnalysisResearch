<AbstractNarration>The project entitled "Advancing Diversity and Excellence in Mathematics and Computer Science" enhances existing retention and graduation programs in mathematics and replicates these successful activities in the program in computer science. The goal is to increase the percentage of ethnic minorities and women who enroll in the two target disciplines at California State University, Dominguez Hills, and who graduate in a timely manner with a Bachelor's degree. The focus is on junior transfer students who enter these two majors and on the overall number of female who select one of these majors. In addition to the scholarship assistance provided by the grant, the project institutes a program of mentoring by faculty and staff and a series of presentations by individuals representing the local industries that hire many of the institution's graduates. A center for computer science majors is developed; this is based on a model that has enjoyed success in the mathematics program. On- campus employment in various labs and tutoring centers is arranged for those students interested in gaining additional practical experience, and the program rewards and recognizes excellence in its students by placing as many as possible in summer research experiences. The ultimate goal of the project is the training and entry into the workforce of individuals who for reasons of poverty, cultural background, or gender might not otherwise enter or complete programs in the fields of mathematics and computer science.</AbstractNarration>
