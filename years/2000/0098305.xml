<AbstractNarration>Group communication services form important building blocks for applications in dynamic&lt;br/&gt;distributed systems, where processors and communication links can repeatedly fail and recover.&lt;br/&gt;Such dynamic behavior is especially descriptive of mobile environments, in which processors can&lt;br/&gt;change their physical location continually. The key features of a group communication facility are&lt;br/&gt;(1) indicating to each processor with which other processors it can currently communicate, and (2)&lt;br/&gt;letting processors within a group communicate with each other in an ordered and reliable manner.&lt;br/&gt;A typical approach to developing fault-tolerant software is to assume certain limitations on the&lt;br/&gt;behavior of faulty components. However, in reality there is a non-zero probability that any such&lt;br/&gt;assumptions will be temporarily violated; in fact, this probability grows with time. In particular,&lt;br/&gt;mobile communication networks are exposed to environmental noise whose level is hard to predict&lt;br/&gt;in advance. Thus, it may be too optimistic to approach correctness by assuming that the system&lt;br/&gt;is consistent initially and each subsequent step maintains consistency. Self-stabilizing algorithms&lt;br/&gt;cope with temporary faults in an elegant way. A self-stabilizing algorithm can be started in any&lt;br/&gt;global state, which could be reached due to an arbitrary combination of failures, and always en-sures&lt;br/&gt;that the task of the algorithm is achieved, assuming that the designer's assumptions hold for&lt;br/&gt;sufficiently long intervals.&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this research is to design self-stabilizing group communication services and apply&lt;br/&gt;these services to mobile networks.&lt;br/&gt;One part of the research will focus on the specification and design of initialized group services,&lt;br/&gt;in which the establishment of a new group ensures that messages related to previous incarnations&lt;br/&gt;are discarded. Various synchrony assumptions will be considered in order to identify the necessary&lt;br/&gt;and sufficient conditions for the specified initialized group services. One approach to be investi-gated&lt;br/&gt;is using transient fault detectors that will trigger the establishment of a new group whenever&lt;br/&gt;inconsistency is detected. Impossibility results will be developed to indicate which system assump-tions&lt;br/&gt;are necessary; lower bound results will be proved to shed light on the degree of optimality of&lt;br/&gt;the solutions obtained. A second part of the research will study how different mobile applications&lt;br/&gt;can take advantage of the self-stabilizing group communication services developed. A third part&lt;br/&gt;of the research will explore the interactions between the group communication services and other,&lt;br/&gt;lower level, mobile services.&lt;br/&gt;Group communication services have been incorporated in several existing academic and indus-trial&lt;br/&gt;distributed systems. However, none of them is self-stabilizing and none of them is specifi-cally&lt;br/&gt;tailored for mobile environments. Self-stabilization and group communication are important&lt;br/&gt;paradigms for the design of dynamic communication networks, and in particular wireless net-works.&lt;br/&gt;There is no doubt that the new methods developed in this project will contribute to future&lt;br/&gt;implementations of robust group communication systems.</AbstractNarration>
