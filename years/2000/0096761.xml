    <AbstractNarration>This award supports the continuation of measurements of high-resolution temperature-dependent photoabsorption cross sections of N2 and O2 in the spectral regions near strong dayglow emissions of N+ and O+ as well as a major spectroscopic band system of N2 near 100 nm. The range of temperatures that would be explored in these measurements is from room temperature to ~900 K. Also included in the award is support for the measurements of temperature-dependent fluorescence cross sections for the production of N and N+, O and O+ emissions through photodissociative excitation and dissociative photoionization excitation of N2 and O2, respectively. The cross section measurements would be obtained at the Japanese Photon Factory, and the fluorescence measurements would be obtained with a new position-sensitive detector at the Advanced Light Source facility at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory. These laboratory results are important for the improved modeling of the dayglow emission production and solar radiation transmissions through planetary atmospheres.</AbstractNarration>
