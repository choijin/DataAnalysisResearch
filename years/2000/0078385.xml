    <AbstractNarration>The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to demonstrate the operation of a commercially viable boron deposition source based on vacuum arc technology. The source is for the deposition of boron-based, self-lubricious coatings of hardness comparable to diamond, which are also compatible with high-temperature applications. A special sintering method, developed in the Phase I, produced boron cathodes that survive the severe vacuum arc environment, when properly supported and heated. This patentable&lt;br/&gt;Phase I technology will be applied in the Phase II to demonstrate the production of the desired films. The emphasis will be in ultra-hard forms of nearly-pure boron, although some compounds are also of interest. Water cooling of the anode and surrounding structures will be used to avoid damage in continuous operation of the source. Well established wall conditioning techniques will be used to reduce contamination of the films from the inner surfaces of the vacuum chamber. Partnering with both a major coatings company and with a&lt;br/&gt;major manufacturer of heavy machinery, that require low-friction, hard-coatings for components, will enhance this Phase II project with valuable in-kind support, as well as a clear path to the Phase III commercialization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Boron coatings have excellent hardness, tribological (low friction) and corrosion resistance properties. Their high temperature and combustion environment compatibility would make them ideal for advanced automotive applications. For example, such coatings could potentially eliminate the need for added lubricants in high temperature, low heat loss diesel engines, leading to substantial reduction in particulate emissions.</AbstractNarration>
