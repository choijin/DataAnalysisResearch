<AbstractNarration>0002997&lt;br/&gt;Perkins&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary goal of this project is to create a University of North Dakota (UND) Geoscience Digital Image Library (GeoDIL).  This library will follow the mission outlined by the Digital Library for Earth System Education (1999): it will "serve educators and students of all types, at all grade levels, and in all locations  ".  Users will access the system via a standard point and click Web page interface.  GeoDIL will intuitively easy to use, both for the public and librarians.  It will contain an archive of 10,000 high-quality, well-documented images after two years.  A sophisticated search engine will allow users to browse the library and to load selected images into virtual carousels for viewing at remote locations.  Educators and researchers around the globe will have access to a wealth of well-documented visual information that otherwise would most likely be unavailable to them.  GeoDIL will be a resource for educators at all levels.  It will be a visual learning environment that provides an opportunity for excitement to K-16 students and instructors.  They will use it to explore the Earth, to make connections between different processes and materials, and to develop ideas about the Earth system.  It will be especially useful for small schools or colleges that do not have well-developed teaching materials.  GeoDIL will support research by facilitating virtual field trips and by providing fundamental information and field data to people stuck in a library or laboratory.  GeoDIL will also allow the public to explore geology and selected Earth system phenomena in a way not previously available.  The library will enhance scientific and technological understanding and permit better understanding of the Earth system's science.  GeoDIL will consist of an ODBC (Open Database Connectivity) compliant relational database with a custom-designed World Wide Web interface.  The database will be invisible to all users.  Much of the initial project activity will be database creation and interface software design.  A second goal of this project is to design this Web-based interactive library so that it can serve as a model for others.  Technical information about GeoDIL (hardware, software, system requirements, etc.) will be available for people engaged in other digital image projects.  GeoDIL will be one of the first "rooms" in comprehensive federated digital libraries, as they are developed.  We will design it to be consistent with guidelines developed by DLESE and other community library efforts.  It will connect seamlessly with the Geoscience Digital Library and other comprehensive libraries.  This project is a joint project between the UND's Department of Geology, Energy and Environmental Research Center, and the Center for Aerospace Sciences.  UND is supporting this effort by providing $75,000 in matching funds.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
