    <AbstractNarration>In 1988 with support from the Division of Polar Programs and the Informal Science Education Program of the National Science Foundation, Sesame Workshop created Antarctica, a 20-page full-color booklet for students and teachers. This interdisciplinary resource, which was revised and expanded in 1996, was created for use in formal and informal settings in conjunction with a week of 3-2-1 Contact programs about Antarctica. It includes information about Antarctica's geography, climate, plant and animal life, the scientists who work there, explorers, ongoing research, adaptation to the cold, and international cooperation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both the National Science Foundation and Sesame Workshop have widely distributed the booklet at national and regional conferences of science and mathematics teachers, as well as at dozens of science workshops conducted by the Sesame Workshop School Services group, and the supply of these booklets has been seriously depleted. Because the booklet continues to be popular and requests keep coming in, the Office of Polar Programs of the National Science Foundation requested that Sesame Workshop (formerly Children's Television Workshop) prepare a proposal to update and expand a four-color interdisciplinary booklet for eight-to-twelve year-olds about Antarctica and to create a simple website that supports the booklet.</AbstractNarration>
