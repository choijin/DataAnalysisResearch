<AbstractNarration>Smith&lt;br/&gt;0071937&lt;br/&gt;     The investigator studies the mechanisms responsible for the&lt;br/&gt;generation of slow, large-scale motions from fast, small-scale&lt;br/&gt;motions in stratified turbulence and rotating, stratified&lt;br/&gt;turbulence.  Because the earth's atmosphere and oceans are&lt;br/&gt;stratified fluids in a rotating frame, the work is highly&lt;br/&gt;relevant to geophysical applications.  Many aspects of&lt;br/&gt;wave-turbulence interactions are yet to be understood.  For&lt;br/&gt;example, it is not clear if, when and how small-scale 3D&lt;br/&gt;turbulence in the presence of waves can organize into large-scale&lt;br/&gt;coherent structures (as in 2D flows).  In purely rotating flow,&lt;br/&gt;the investigator previously showed that white-noise forcing at&lt;br/&gt;small scales leads to the generation of slow, large-scale,&lt;br/&gt;cyclonic vortical columns, if the Rossby number is below a&lt;br/&gt;critical value of order one.  This is surprising because recent&lt;br/&gt;work using multiple scales analysis shows, at first order,&lt;br/&gt;decoupling between fast, small-scale motions and slow,&lt;br/&gt;large-scale motions for a variety of wave-turbulence systems&lt;br/&gt;including rotating flow.  Several second-order mechanisms may be&lt;br/&gt;responsible for the upscale energy transfer to slow modes in&lt;br/&gt;rotating turbulence.  This project goes a step further towards&lt;br/&gt;understanding the large-scale dynamics in geophysical flows, by&lt;br/&gt;investigation of upscale energy transfer in 3D stratified and&lt;br/&gt;rotating, stratified turbulence.  The investigator explores the&lt;br/&gt;necessary conditions leading to such upscale transfer and seeks&lt;br/&gt;to identify the underlying mechanisms.  Simplified systems of&lt;br/&gt;dispersive wave turbulence are used to test understanding and for&lt;br/&gt;the development of statistical models.  To complement numerical&lt;br/&gt;simulations and analysis, she has also planned laboratory&lt;br/&gt;experiments in a rotating tank, where the turbulence is driven by&lt;br/&gt;differentially-rotating, rough top and bottom plates.&lt;br/&gt;     Over relatively short time periods in rotating and/or&lt;br/&gt;stratified flows, there is both experimental evidence and&lt;br/&gt;mathematical support for the decoupling of slow, large-scale&lt;br/&gt;motions from fast, small-scale motions.  This means that, on time&lt;br/&gt;scales of perhaps days in the atmosphere and weeks in the oceans,&lt;br/&gt;large-scale eddies and currents evolve independently from&lt;br/&gt;small-scale turbulence.  Another implication is that short-term&lt;br/&gt;climate change is independent from rapid fluctuations of the&lt;br/&gt;conditions in the atmosphere and oceans.  Our numerical&lt;br/&gt;simulations for longer times, however, show the generation of&lt;br/&gt;large-scale, coherent structures from small-scale turbulence, and&lt;br/&gt;this coupling may be important for long-term weather prediction,&lt;br/&gt;ocean circulaton and climate change.  In the context of the&lt;br/&gt;atmosphere, one might ask, can small-scale cumulus convection at&lt;br/&gt;length scales of about ten kilometers generate large-scale eddies&lt;br/&gt;of several thousand kilometers in extent?  The transfer of energy&lt;br/&gt;from fast, small-scale motions to slow, large-scale motions in&lt;br/&gt;three-dimensional, wave-turbulence systems such as rotating and&lt;br/&gt;stratified flows has only recently been discovered, even though&lt;br/&gt;such transfer has been studied for decades in two-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;flows.  The present study involves numerical simulations, modeling&lt;br/&gt;and analysis, and laboratory experiments in a rotating tank.  The&lt;br/&gt;goals are to deepen our understanding and improve our capability&lt;br/&gt;to predict geophysical phenomena.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
