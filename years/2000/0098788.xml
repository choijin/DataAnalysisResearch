<AbstractNarration>The project is devoted to dynamical systems of physical origin, &lt;br/&gt;including Lorentz gases (both in equilibrium and under external &lt;br/&gt;forces), hard ball systems, billiards, ideal gases with a massive &lt;br/&gt;test particle, and open Hamiltonian systems. Most of these are &lt;br/&gt;known (or expected) to have chaotic behavior. Due to recent works &lt;br/&gt;of D. Dolgopyat, D. Ruelle, Ya. Sinai, L.-S. Young and others, &lt;br/&gt;mathematical tools in the theory of hyperbolic and chaotic &lt;br/&gt;dynamical systems appear to be developed far enough to attack many &lt;br/&gt;open problems that have been so far only studied heuristically or &lt;br/&gt;numerically by physicists, if at all. In particular, we plan to &lt;br/&gt;investigate the nature of nonequilibrium steady states by means of &lt;br/&gt;Sinai-Ruelle-Bowen measures, time correlation functions that &lt;br/&gt;appear in transport laws and diffusion equations, open Hamiltonian &lt;br/&gt;systems that admit conditionally invariant  measures, the motion &lt;br/&gt;of a massive particle in an ideal gas by using an appropriate &lt;br/&gt;space-time limit, etc. In each case we aim at obtaining exact &lt;br/&gt;results and providing solid rigorous proofs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The general goal of the project is to conduct mathematical studies &lt;br/&gt;of facts and phenomena that have attracted attention in physical &lt;br/&gt;community and have applications outside of mathematics. In &lt;br/&gt;particular, the results would contribute to the mathematical &lt;br/&gt;foundation of statistical mechanics and thermodynamics and could &lt;br/&gt;strengthen the link between the theory of dynamical systems and &lt;br/&gt;physics and other sciences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
