<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will investigate the feasibility of a novel hybrid three dimensional (3D) imaging and animation technique for custom-design and custom-fit eyeglass frames, based on the 3D imaging technology recently developed by Genex Technologies, Inc (GTI). The 3D camera is able to acquire both 2D and 3D face images of a customer in a snapshot. The digital 3D face model is then converted and immersed into a virtual simulation environment, dubbed as the "VirtualFit(TM)", that allows customers to select a large number of eyeglass frames in a variety of styles, sizes and colors to try them on the realistic 3D face model of themselves. The VirtualFit(TM) also performs digital measurement of all critical dimensions from the 3D-face model and offers recommendations to assist the custom-fitting process. The 3D model can also be transferred over Internet to frame manufacturers for custom-made frames. Low-cost 3D-camera hardware prototype and virtual simulation software will be developed and tested in Phase 1. The fully functional prototype system will be developed in Phase 2 and field tests will be performed in retail store to obtain feedback for improvement. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enormous commercial potential virtually guarantees the deployment of the VirtualFit system as a widespread E-Commerce tool for optical spectacle industry.  The VirtualFit technology can be applied to many other applications, such as apparel fitting, shoe fitting, hairstyle selection, furniture selection, and ergonomic product design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
