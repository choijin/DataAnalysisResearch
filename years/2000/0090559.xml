<AbstractNarration>0090559  &lt;br/&gt;Bashford  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is to Arizona State University to support the activity described below for 36 months.  The proposal was submitted in response to the Partnerships for Innovation Program Solicitation (NSF 0082).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Partners&lt;br/&gt;The partners are Arizona State University; Partnership for Advancing Technology in Housing; Home Building Association in Central Arizona; Del Webb Corporation; Pulte Homes; Eagle Homes; Trend Homes; Maracay Homes; Gateway Community College.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposed Activities&lt;br/&gt;The partners are doing the following: identification of challenges faced by home builders where technology could change the process significantly; identification of technologies to address the challenges; research on new materials, products, and processes (especially where manufacturing can lower cost and increase quality); modeling and simulation of home construction; develop prototypes and work techniques to apply them; education/training of a workforce to use the new building technology developed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposed Innovation&lt;br/&gt;Housing is the industry that missed the innovation revolution in America.  The industry is mature and extremely fragmented, making innovation very difficult.  The proposed innovation activities include research and a management plan to incorporate new materials, manufacturing practice with obvious economic and quality control benefits, training of skilled craftsmen, energy savings, and modification of building codes could modernize the house construction industry with enormous savings for the US economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Potential Economic Impact&lt;br/&gt;The following economic impacts are likely: improve durability and reduce maintenance costs for new homes by 50% by 2010; reduce cost of new homes by 20% by 2010; reduce energy costs by 50%; increased safety of construction workers.  The housing industry is a huge driver in the national economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Potential Societal Impact&lt;br/&gt;Active recruitment of Hispanics through chamber of commerce activities and Gateway Community College will help provide opportunity for this group to participate in the program.  Affordable and maintainable housing will provide obvious benefits to all Americans, especially Americans who can afford custom homes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
