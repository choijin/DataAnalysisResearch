<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to enhance support of low-income, academically talented computer science, engineering and mathematics (CSEM) students through scholarships and expanded student-support programs as part of the CSEM Scholars Program. The associated objectives are to increase the retention of students in the computer science, dual degree engineering and mathematics programs through graduation; to increase the number of students from underrepresented groups studying computer science, engineering and mathematics; to increase the participation of students in professional development opportunities; to strengthen partnerships between the university and local industry; and to strengthen partnerships between the university and local community colleges. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Forty scholarship recipients are selected based on their academic record, financial need, a recommendation from an instructor, counselor or employer, and a brief essay. The scholarships are awarded to students in the computer science, engineering and mathematics programs in ratios that approximate the department's student population. Selected students receive the National Science Foundation scholarship, and Texas Instruments, Inc is matching the amount. In addition each student is assigned faculty, industry, and peer mentors. Students in the CSEM Scholars Program participate in departmental student organizations, campus-wide student organizations, student research opportunities, cooperative education opportunities, campus-wide professional development workshops, campus-wide graduate school preparatory workshops, visits to local professional association meetings, and travel to professional conferences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to increase the number of CSEM students and the pool of applicants, recruitment efforts are being expanded through increased cooperation with area community college faculty and staff, faculty and staff of universities serving as partners to the 3+2/Dual Degree Engineering Program and the university admissions office. The program is evaluated by monitoring retention and graduation rates, growth in the number of undergraduate and graduate students within the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, and the participation rate of students in departmental and university professional development opportunities. In addition, participating students are tracked to follow job placement and advanced degree achievement.</AbstractNarration>
