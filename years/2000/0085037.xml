<AbstractNarration>The LA-USP, building upon the infrastructure and improved student outcomes emanating from previous funding under the National Science Foundation's Urban Systemic Initiative effort, focuses on enhancing the capacity of the system as a whole, and the instructional workforce in particular, in order to support all students in learning and mastering standards-based mathematics and science at a level sufficient for successful matriculation to university or the workforce.  Building upon the accomplishments of the LA-USI, LAUSD proposes specific goals that are congruent with the USP solicitation goals and exemplify a core vision of success for all.  Through the LA-USP, LAUSD intends to: &lt;br/&gt;(1) raise the district's capacity to bring the highest quality of mathematics and science instruction to students; &lt;br/&gt;(2) substantially increase all students' achievement, pass rates, access to college and careers in mathematics, science, and technology, with special attention to underrepresented minorities; &lt;br/&gt;(3) scale-up implementation of standards-based curricula, pedagogy, and assessment for all students through Differentiated Professional Development (DPD); &lt;br/&gt;(4) align mathematics and science instruction so that grade-appropriate content and processes lead progressively to higher level science and mathematics for all students; &lt;br/&gt;(5) increase the number of college-eligible students and the number majoring in mathematics and science by increasing enrollment in Advanced Placement (AP) mathematics and science courses; &lt;br/&gt;(6) improve instructional workforce quality in collaboration with universities by developing appropriate pre- and in-service courses in mathematics and science; &lt;br/&gt;(7) work with university and district partners to connect teachers' in-service professional development to the standard-based student expectations; &lt;br/&gt;(8) engage parents in advocacy and action roles related to enrollment in advanced mathematics courses, as well as promote parental interactions with preservice teachers in order to encourage such interactions with families by teachers in the future; and &lt;br/&gt;(9) effectively use internal and external research and evaluation to assess progress for all students, and to identify interactive factors that foster present gains as foundational for increased future gains.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to accomplish these goals, the LA-USP staff will (A) use Differentiated Professional Development (DPD), a platform for in-service, that shapes sessions to fit teacher needs; (B) increase dissemination of program information to the community; (C) accelerate collaboration with higher education to equip teacher graduates with new skills needed for LAUSD's multilingual, multicultural, multiethnic enrollment; and (D) restructure instructional services to fit the reorganization of the LAUSD's administrative structure in order to meet the system's need for DPD and accountability for student achievement.   Central to the implementation of the USP is the expansion of the MST Centers and attendant Resource Teachers to serve all of the recently formulated eleven (11) local school districts that comprise the united district that is the Los Angeles Unified School District.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
