<AbstractNarration>Chemistry (12)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fluorescence spectroscopy is widely used in research, industry, medicine, forensics, and other technological areas as a tool for investigating chemical structure and properties, chemical interactions, biomolecular structure and function, lifetime imaging, quantitative analysis, atom-tagging in immunoassays, metabolic monitoring via luminescent reporter genes, and many other applications. The ability to use fluorescence spectroscopy in the science curricula is enhancing student learning by 1) allowing for the development of practical skills in the operation and collection of fluorescent measurements and 2) using real data to help students understand spectroscopic theory by assimilating the underlying principles of quantum mechanics and electronic/ energy transitions. This project is focusing on the immediate adaptation and implementation of experiments from the research and educational literature into the curriculum at all levels: general, analytical, instrumentation, biochemistry, and physical. The Environmental Science department is adapting and implementing fluorescence spectroscopy into the curriculum for their Site Monitoring and Analysis track. This fluorometer is also an integral part of undergraduate research projects as part of a capstone experience cooperatively administered through the Biology and Chemistry departments. After this initial implementation, fluorescence spectroscopy will be integrated into new curricular offerings at Carroll College, including a new Forensic Science emphasis within the Chemistry major, a newly proposed Biochemistry major, and a restructured, modular instrumentation course offered jointly with Biology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
