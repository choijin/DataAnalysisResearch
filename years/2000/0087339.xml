<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT:&lt;br/&gt;The author proposes to study a set of problems in harmonic analysis and&lt;br/&gt;related areas where the Gaussian curvature, the determinant of the&lt;br/&gt;differential of the Gauss map taking the point on a hypersurface to the&lt;br/&gt;unit normal at that point, plays an important role. More specifically,&lt;br/&gt;the author proposes to study the following three basic problems:&lt;br/&gt;regularity of averages over surfaces, distribution of lattice points in&lt;br/&gt;convex domains, and the existence of orthogonal exponential bases for&lt;br/&gt;domains in Euclidean space. In the context of averages over surfaces, we&lt;br/&gt;propose to find a set of necessary and sufficient conditions for the&lt;br/&gt;Lebesgue space boundedness of these averages in terms of natural and&lt;br/&gt;easily computable geometric criteria. In the context of lattice points&lt;br/&gt;in convex domains, we propose to compute a sharp rate of growth for the&lt;br/&gt;discrepancy between the volume of a dilated convex body and the number&lt;br/&gt;of lattice points trapped inside, again in terms of natural geometric&lt;br/&gt;properties of the boundary. In the context of orthogonal exponential&lt;br/&gt;bases, we propose to make progress towards the proof of the Fuglede&lt;br/&gt;Conjecture, which says that a domain has orthogonal exponential basis if&lt;br/&gt;and only if it is possible to tile Euclidean space with disjoint&lt;br/&gt;translates of this domain. Combinatorial and number theoretic methods&lt;br/&gt;are expected to play an important role.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study of the maximal averaging operators and other similar operators&lt;br/&gt;in harmonic analysis is partially motivated by the following interesting&lt;br/&gt;question: How close can we come to recovering a set of data from the&lt;br/&gt;various kinds of averages of that data? The question is of potential&lt;br/&gt;practical value since scientists are often called upon to make&lt;br/&gt;predictions based on average information. For example, meteorologists&lt;br/&gt;make predictions about the rainfall in a particular location based on&lt;br/&gt;the average rainfall in years past in nearby towns.&lt;br/&gt;Seismologists make earthquake predictions based on the pattern of shocks&lt;br/&gt;in the surrounding area. The tradeoff involved in the study of these&lt;br/&gt;phenomena is, roughly speaking, the following. If the data is very&lt;br/&gt;precise, then it can, generally speaking, be recovered from any kind of&lt;br/&gt;a reasonable average. If the data is less precise, then we have to make&lt;br/&gt;sure that the averaging process compensates for the deficiencies of the&lt;br/&gt;data. The main thrust of this project is to study the averaging&lt;br/&gt;phenomenon when the data is given by a certain kind of a mathematical&lt;br/&gt;function, and the average is taken over a curved surface. The study of&lt;br/&gt;the distribution of lattice points in convex domains and the associated&lt;br/&gt;discrepancy function is motivated by the desire to approximate discrete&lt;br/&gt;information, for example integer points in the plane, by more easily&lt;br/&gt;computable continuous information, in this case the area. Finally, the&lt;br/&gt;study of orthogonal exponential bases is motivated by an important&lt;br/&gt;practical problem of approximating functions by trigonometric functions.&lt;br/&gt;These types of approximations have numerous applications in physics,&lt;br/&gt;engineering, and many other areas of science and technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
