<AbstractNarration>     Exponentially increasing multimedia information content has become a problem at the&lt;br/&gt;heart of modern communication networks. This is a paradigm shift from traditional com-&lt;br/&gt;munication networks, where the primary function is information transmission, and where&lt;br/&gt;quality of service improvements are attainable through better dimensioning of bandwidth&lt;br/&gt;and switching resources. However, in networks where information storage plays a central&lt;br/&gt;role, major improvements in quality of service can not be successful without the help of&lt;br/&gt;caching, prefetching and/or mirroring of information. It can be argued that even if an&lt;br/&gt;unlimited amount of free bandwidth were available, the concentration of information on a&lt;br/&gt;small number of servers would cause server overloads, resulting in unacceptable download&lt;br/&gt;latencies.&lt;br/&gt;      This general problem has created the explosion of research studies that are to be found&lt;br/&gt;in the network systems engineering literature on Web caching. Although this work has&lt;br/&gt;contributed important engineering solutions, much of it is ad hoc and informal. Indeed, in&lt;br/&gt;the large literature on caching research, it is rare to find papers dealing with mathematical&lt;br/&gt;foundations, especially those underpinning stochastic models. Also, one rarely finds proofs in&lt;br/&gt;a rigorous setting of nontrivial stochastic or average-case properties of caching structures and&lt;br/&gt;algorithms. It is our thesis here that more systematic approaches are needed. This proposal&lt;br/&gt;describes a project to meet this need; more generally, we outline a systematic treatment&lt;br/&gt;that focuses on fundamental design issues, one that, in dealing with these issues, integrates&lt;br/&gt;experimentation, analysis and statistical measurements.&lt;br/&gt;      Network cache design objectives are reductions in access latency, traffic congestion, and&lt;br/&gt;server loads. These objectives can be attained only through a thoughtful design that ad-&lt;br/&gt;dresses many important and challenging research topics. Some of the fundamental questions&lt;br/&gt;that remain without definitive answers include: dynamic caching and caching with expiration&lt;br/&gt;times; design and analysis of easily implemented heuristic algorithms; impact of locality in&lt;br/&gt;request sequences on caching performance; caching and prefetching in low bandwidth access&lt;br/&gt;environments, with a special emphasis on wireless Web accesses; cache allocation and sizing&lt;br/&gt;problems; and Web-graph performance modeling. Extending the knowledge base and deep-&lt;br/&gt;ening our insight into these and several other equally fundamental caching system design&lt;br/&gt;problems is the main theme of this proposal. The ultimate goal is to utilize this improved&lt;br/&gt;knowledge base to develop an experimental testbed for achieving practically feasible and&lt;br/&gt;efficient network caching systems.&lt;br/&gt;      The inherent complexity of the research topics identified here, and the network caching&lt;br/&gt;problem as a whole, necessarily call into play all available research tools. Thus, methodologi-&lt;br/&gt;cally, the scope of the proposed research ranges from mathematical modeling and analysis to&lt;br/&gt;statistical measurements and experimentation. The impact of our results, by their interdis-&lt;br/&gt;ciplinary nature, will not just be limited to designing multimedia network caching systems,&lt;br/&gt;but will potentially lead to improved problem solving techniques in related fields of computer&lt;br/&gt;algorithms, software engineering, probability theory, and operations research.</AbstractNarration>
