<AbstractNarration>This program provides extensive support to students in an effort to significantly increase the number of low- income students earning degrees in computer science, computer technology, engineering, engineering technology, and mathematics by providing scholarships to talented but financially disadvantaged students. The project has four major objectives: 1) increasing the number of low- income, academically talented students studying computer science, engineering, and mathematics at the associate degree level; 2) improving the rate of academic success for students in these fields of study; 3) facilitating transfer of CSEMS graduates to employment or the baccalaureate level; and 4) strengthened partnerships between educational institutions and related employment sectors. These objectives are met by providing students with a comprehensive network of support services including tutoring in the Learning Achievement Center; academic, personal and career counseling in the Counseling and Advisement Centers; and Student Success Seminars. In addition, CSEMS scholars participate in The Pre- College Summer Institute and Enrichment Seminars to strengthen math and science skills, to study special topics in the CSEMS disciplines, and to develop the mindset necessary to study computer science, engineering, or mathematics.</AbstractNarration>
