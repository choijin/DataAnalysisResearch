<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;Beginning in the summer of 2001, Clark Atlanta University will offer summer research experiences for ten undergraduate students in the areas of cellular and molecular biology and biological chemistry.  Undergraduate students from Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) in the Southeastern United States will primarily be recruited as applicants for this program.  Junior and senior students recruited into the program will be involved in basic biological and chemical research in the laboratories of faculty members who are experienced in the training and mentoring of undergraduate students.  The purpose of this research training will be to expose students from small, non-research oriented schools to approaches to some of the most critical research problems of today and to state-of-the-art instrumentation.  Projects on which students will work range from investigations on  the phenomenon of signal transduction in mammalian cells to discoveries of new synthesis techniques for chiral compounds.   With these types of exposure, the students will not only gain new scientific knowledge and have their classroom lectures reinforced, but they can also learn firsthand about the career possibilities available in the research arena.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
