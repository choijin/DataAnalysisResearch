<AbstractNarration>Earth Systems Science (40) This special project will support the Digital Library for Earth System Education (DLESE) Leadership Workshop: Building the Community. The purpose of this workshop is to inform leaders in the Earth system education community about the National SME&amp;TE Digital Library initiative, and ongoing work in the development of DLESE. The workshop will also provide a forum to obtain feedback from community leaders that will be used in the design and development of DLESE collections, services, and related functions. Workshop activities will include hands-on demonstration of successful computer-assisted learning activities, networking and community building activities across all interests in Earth system education, and focus groups to become acquainted with the work of the DLESE Users, Collections, services, and Technology Committees. Participants will be provided with information and tools to become regular users of, and contributors to, DLESE functions, and to recruit broader participation among their home constituencies. Participants will be invited from among the leaders of Earth system education from K-12, undergraduate, and community outreach instructional settings. the outcomes of the workshop will be posted on the DLESE webpage (www.dlese.org), and reported in newsletters of professional societies. This workshop will be the first opportunity to engage the full spectrum of Earth system educators in the development of DLESE.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
