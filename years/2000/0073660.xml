<AbstractNarration>0073660&lt;br/&gt;Pados&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adaptive antenna arrays and DS/CDMA communication systems are &lt;br/&gt;two subjects with their own individual challenges that have &lt;br/&gt;separately generated significant research interest over the past &lt;br/&gt;several years. When brought together at the integrated antenna-array&lt;br/&gt;CDMA-receiver system level, these challenges are magnified and &lt;br/&gt;new problems of both theoretical and practical interest arise.&lt;br/&gt;This proposed research on antenna array DS/CDMA communications&lt;br/&gt;is characterized by the following three attributes: (i) The principle &lt;br/&gt;of joint space-time processing is maintained. (ii) Low optimization &lt;br/&gt;complexity is sought, therefore matrix inversions and/or &lt;br/&gt;eigen-decompositions are viewed as undesirable operations.&lt;br/&gt;(iii) Superior adaptive system performance on short data records,&lt;br/&gt;as opposed to ideal asymptotics, is the objective.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  In terms of projected contributions to science and engineering&lt;br/&gt;principles, this proposed research is intended to build on past work&lt;br/&gt;of the PIs during the last four years -supported by seed funding by &lt;br/&gt;the National Science Foundation- that led to initial understanding and&lt;br/&gt;preliminary development of new linear filter optimization criteria and&lt;br/&gt;procedures. The focus is on low bias and low short-data-record variance &lt;br/&gt;adaptive optimization procedures that the investigators of this proposal &lt;br/&gt;have developed and termed ``auxiliary-vector (AV)'' filtering. AV filtering &lt;br/&gt;may touch many aspects of multidisciplinary engineering that are presently&lt;br/&gt;hampered by the ``curse of dimensionality'' and could benefit from adaptive&lt;br/&gt;filtering and/or adaptive system optimization through limited input data.&lt;br/&gt;Variations of AV filtering schemes are currently considered in diversified &lt;br/&gt;areas that include temporal-only processing of CDMA signals, synchronization, &lt;br/&gt;adaptive robust spread-spectrum receiver designs, adaptive array radars,&lt;br/&gt;Direction-Of-Arrival estimation problems, and jam-resistant GPS. This present&lt;br/&gt;research plan covers aspects varying from basic algorithmic developments and &lt;br/&gt;theoretical analysis to DSP and FPGA hardware prototyping and testing through&lt;br/&gt;the use of the SPW (R) block-level communications systems simulator, &lt;br/&gt;a programmable antenna array testbed with 12 complete receive chains, &lt;br/&gt;an anechoic chamber with range in excess of 7 meters, and a DSP/FPGA &lt;br/&gt;board-level implementation testbed.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
