<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is concerned with research on singular integrals, the theory of&lt;br/&gt;weights, with applications to linear elliptic partial differential &lt;br/&gt;equations of second and of higher order. There are three main areas of&lt;br/&gt;current focus. First, we study the elliptic measure associated to&lt;br/&gt;a second order elliptic operator - both divergence and nondivergence &lt;br/&gt;form. Second, we are studying the boundary values of solutions to&lt;br/&gt;certain higher order elliptic operators in non-smooth domains. The third&lt;br/&gt;part of this proposal concerns the maximal functions and singular&lt;br/&gt;integrals associated to certain product domains - such operators involve&lt;br/&gt;nonisotropic dilations and results require a study of the geometry of&lt;br/&gt;families of rectangles arising from this dilation structure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the middle of this century, revolutionary ideas in analysis were&lt;br/&gt;being forged on two fronts: the theory of singular integrals in &lt;br/&gt;harmonic analysis (the Calderon-Zygmund school of analysis) and the&lt;br/&gt;theory of elliptic equations (Di Giorgi, J. Nash). Each of these&lt;br/&gt;subjects has provided fascinating applications - the first in such&lt;br/&gt;areas as applied harmonic analysis/wavelets/Fourier analysis, and the&lt;br/&gt;second in the theory of nonlinear partial differential equations, of&lt;br/&gt;tremendous value in applications. But at the beginning of these studies, and&lt;br/&gt;for a period of twenty or so years, the development of each of these&lt;br/&gt;subjects proceeded independently, and with little interaction. However,&lt;br/&gt;since the early 1980's, the connections between these areas have&lt;br/&gt;been increasingly exploited and understood, to the great benefit of&lt;br/&gt;the fields of harmonic analysis and partial differential equations.&lt;br/&gt;This proposer's research is in this field of harmonic analysis, with&lt;br/&gt;an emphasis on its connection to and inspiration from partial &lt;br/&gt;differential equations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
