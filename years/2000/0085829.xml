<AbstractNarration>The problems associated with building complex heterogeneous systems &lt;br/&gt;composed of computer, human, and electromechanical components are starting&lt;br/&gt;to overwhelm system and software engineers, resulting in failed projects&lt;br/&gt;and accidents related to software behavior.  As the complexity of the &lt;br/&gt;systems grows, so does the difficulty of ensuring safety.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Model-based system and software engineering is an approach to building &lt;br/&gt;complex systems that is based on common models and specification languages &lt;br/&gt;that are understandable and reviewable by all the engineers on the project &lt;br/&gt;and by those who must interact with and use the automation as well.  The &lt;br/&gt;research topics to be investigated are: (1) enhancing requirements &lt;br/&gt;specification reviewability, (2) assisting engineers in creating large, &lt;br/&gt;complex specifications, (3) minimizing the disruptions caused by changes &lt;br/&gt;in requirements, and (5) specifying and analyzing safety-related &lt;br/&gt;properties using the models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To ground the research, the new approaches will be applied experimentally&lt;br/&gt;to the advanced air traffic control systems being developed and&lt;br/&gt;validated by Eurocontrol (the European Organization for the Safety of&lt;br/&gt;Air Navigation).  ATC provides a challenging testbed but the results&lt;br/&gt;of the research should be equally applicable to medical, defense,&lt;br/&gt;transportation, manufacturing, and other complex, real-time systems.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
