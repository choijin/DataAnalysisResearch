<AbstractNarration>This project from the University of Puerto Rico,Pio Piedras Campus aims to motivate and prepare talented Hispanic undergraduate students for careers in the Cellular Molecular Biology fields of biology.  The long-term goal is to increase the number of undergraduate students from underrepresented minorities that continue research  oriented  careers.    Ten students from small colleges and universities with no or little access to research in the cellular and molecular areas  will be selected   based on GPA, research interest as well as on their  motivation and potential for Graduate Studies.   Students  are housed at the University Residential facilities or nearby the University premises during their  internship.  The central  objective of this ten week summer program is to provide the students an intensive hand-on research  experience in one of the  on-going  projects of the  participating  faculty from the Department of Biology.   Students are exposed to a wide range of  topics that have as a central theme  " the use of cellular and molecular techniques to address a biological problem".   Each student  is assigned  a specific research project to be developed under the supervision of a mentor.   Projects include topics such as: "cellular and molecular analysis of development", "gene cloning and gene expression", "molecular neurobiology and neuroendocrinology", "hormones and neurotransmitters action",  "cellular interactions".    A series of complementary  activities  to develop research related skills include workshops and colloquia on  literature searches  and computing literacy,  writing and  communication in science and  bio-ethical issues and practices.   To  place the students in the Graduate School's track  a series of workshops on topics related to admission and requirements are also offered.  In addition,  activities such as eco-trips  and social activities are included in the program to fully expose and integrate the students into the scientific community.  This research site provides  for a cultural diversified and bilingual environment. &lt;br/&gt;It is expected that by integration on the every day activities of  research laboratories  students will learn modern concepts and techniques  and most important  will understand the significance of modern research in all biological areas, thus providing  a nurturing environment that triggers their development as researchers. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
