<AbstractNarration>This proposal was jointly assessed with  the EPDT Program Director Dr. James Mink as truly Integrative Systems in nature. It draws on the ideas from the electromechanical wave propagation for a novel approach to the transient stability analysis problem in large-scale electric power systems. The proposal deals with development of a macro-scale analytical tool for electromechanical wave propagation phenomena in electric networks. The proposal and the activity proposed are based on the assumption that their previous research on the wave propagation theory is valid and accepted for power system transient analysis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The problem addressed in these proposals is that of developing efficient models for the study of electromechanical wave propagation on very large scale, extensive networks.  This phenomenon is poorly understood, but could have significant harmful effects on the national power system in the future.  The PIs draw on their extensive relevant experience to outline a comprehensive novel approach to modeling and studying of the problem.  The proposal is to study the network as a continuum in which sources and sinks with their pertinent; physical characteristics are located at specific points. Tools developed in other fields, such as wave propagation in plasmas, are utilized, along with the availability of data from synchronized satellite-based simultaneous measurement of rotor angles over wide areas. Work on this project has been underway for several years, in which time techniques have been developed for obtaining the continuum model from real time system data.  The proposed methodology could turn out to be widely applicable and of significant usefulness as restructuring advances toward much more complex operation than has ever been envisioned in the past.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
