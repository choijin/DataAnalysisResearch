<AbstractNarration>Research will be done to establish the phenomenon of localization&lt;br/&gt;for physically relevant models of disordered media where existing&lt;br/&gt;methods have widely failed in the most relevant case of dimension&lt;br/&gt;three. Particular models to be investigated are the&lt;br/&gt;Bernoulli-Anderson model, the Poisson model, and the Random&lt;br/&gt;Displacement model. The main obstacle to overcome is the lack of&lt;br/&gt;monotonicity properties for these models, which causes significant&lt;br/&gt;differences to the more successfully studied Anderson model. In&lt;br/&gt;previous work, the PI and his collaborators have shown that&lt;br/&gt;methods from scattering theory can be used to establish&lt;br/&gt;localization for one-dimensional non-monotonic models. These&lt;br/&gt;methods will lead to further results in one dimension and provide&lt;br/&gt;new tools in higher dimension such as using the total scattering&lt;br/&gt;cross section of single sites to identify energies where extended&lt;br/&gt;states exist. Some related goals are to establish Wegner estimates&lt;br/&gt;for the eigenvalues of finite box hamiltonians and Lifshitz tail&lt;br/&gt;asymptotics for the integrated density of states in the above&lt;br/&gt;models, as well as to understand the effects of correlations&lt;br/&gt;arising from long range single site scatterers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mathematical theory of disordered media aims at understanding&lt;br/&gt;the spectral and scattering theoretic properties of irregular&lt;br/&gt;solids such as, for example, crystals with impurities, alloys,&lt;br/&gt;materials with lattice deviations and amorphous media. Different&lt;br/&gt;models of random operators are used to describe the various types&lt;br/&gt;of disorder. This provides a mathematical framework to decide on&lt;br/&gt;conductivity properties: If localization of states can be&lt;br/&gt;shown, then the solid is electrically insulating, while the&lt;br/&gt;existence of extended states characterizes a conducting material.&lt;br/&gt;The PI's research aims at establishing these properties for models&lt;br/&gt;of high physical relevance, which have so far resisted a rigorous&lt;br/&gt;mathematical treatment. For example, localization properties are&lt;br/&gt;not yet understood for realistic models of alloys. Ideas from&lt;br/&gt;statistical physics and solid state physics will be combined with&lt;br/&gt;methods from scattering theory, spectral theory and harmonic&lt;br/&gt;analysis to make progress.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
