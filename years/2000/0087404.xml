<AbstractNarration>     With the tremendous growth of the Internet and the ability to transport information at very high data&lt;br/&gt;rates has come the realization that traditional assumptions on the stochastic nature of network traffic&lt;br/&gt;ows are inadequate. A number of recent studies have demonstrated that long-range-dependence is&lt;br/&gt;an important characteristic of traffic ows in current networking infrastructures. On the other hand,&lt;br/&gt;the performance of networks and their ability to offer Quality of Service (QoS) depend on accurately&lt;br/&gt;capturing (and exploiting) probabilistically rare phenomena. Studies of network performance with&lt;br/&gt;long-range-dependent inputs are still very much in their infancy, and to-date have addressed only the&lt;br/&gt;computation stationary buffer over ow probabilities.&lt;br/&gt;     In contrast, there is a crucial need to study the rare excursions of the underlying stochastic pro-&lt;br/&gt;cesses which capture the salient characteristics of network ows, and to understand how such excursions&lt;br/&gt;affect network dynamics. These issues are important from the point of view of transient characteristics&lt;br/&gt;of networks. For example the QoS perceived by users depends not only on the magnitude of loss but&lt;br/&gt;how it takes place. In some applications consecutive losses even if rare can make transmissions to be&lt;br/&gt;severely degraded while in TCP, losing a small number packets often can result in deterioration in&lt;br/&gt;performance. To study these effects we must develop new results on the duration of over ows and the&lt;br/&gt;amount of information lost during typical over ows.&lt;br/&gt;     The goal of our research is to provide analytic insights, quantify performance, develop approaches&lt;br/&gt;to measure relevant traffic parameters and provide rules-of-thumb for use in resource management and&lt;br/&gt;scheduling traffic in networks with long-range dependent characteristics to meet QoS requirements.&lt;br/&gt;The specific tasks that will be pursued to achieve our objectives are:&lt;br/&gt;    Study the buffer over ow asymptotics for multi-buffered systems with heterogeneous longtailed&lt;br/&gt;    inputs.&lt;br/&gt;    Develop results for the heterogeneous sub-exponential case.&lt;br/&gt;    Characterize the transient behavior during over ow periods for systems with longtailed and&lt;br/&gt;    sub-exponential inputs with a view to understanding actual QoS given to users.&lt;br/&gt;    Develop methods for differentiating between traffic types and estimating relevant parameters.&lt;br/&gt;   Incorporate the insights obtained from the above analyses into our overall objective to define&lt;br/&gt;   engineering rules for resource management and scheduling various types of sessions in networks.&lt;br/&gt;     As a result of these investigations we will have a complete catalog of results to handle the very&lt;br/&gt;diverse types of traffic which are present in networks. By considering both the stationary and transient&lt;br/&gt;characteristics we will provide insights on the dynamics of loss which is essential to provide fine tuning&lt;br/&gt;in order to deliver QoS at the application/user level which stationary analyses do not provide.&lt;br/&gt;     The research spans fundamental modeling and analysis as well as statistical testing. On the theo-&lt;br/&gt;retical side the implications go beyond the traffic engineering context and are expected to contribute&lt;br/&gt;to applied probability, queueing analysis and asymptotic approximation. On the applications side, the&lt;br/&gt;proposed work will provide insights and results of potential use in next generation networks.</AbstractNarration>
