<AbstractNarration>0090523  &lt;br/&gt;Kohn   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is to Rutgers University to support the activity described below for 36 months.  The proposal was submitted in response to the Partnerships for Innovation Program Solicitation (NSF 0082).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Partners&lt;br/&gt;The partners are Rutgers University; University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, New Jersey Institute of Technology; New Jersey Center for Biomaterials, which includes 15 industrial members.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposed Activities&lt;br/&gt;The activities in this award include implementation and evaluation of better models for academic-industrial partnerships; improved business assessment and planning tools for the innovation process; development of marketable technology from underutilized intellectual property within the industrial sector; engage faculty from business school entrepreneurship programs and public policy departments; education of graduate students in innovation and entrepreneurship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposed Innovation&lt;br/&gt;The innovation goals are the implementation and evaluation of better models for innovation including Technology Enablement Partnership (TEP) and Virtual Research Organization (VRO).  TEP model is for more efficient utilization of underdeveloped intellectual property within the academic sector by improved business assessment and planning.  VRO is for development of marketable technology from underutilized intellectual property within the industrial sector by novel interactions with academia.  Business schools and public policy departments are participating, as well as scientific and engineering departments from academia.  Business and government agencies complete the partnerships with their traditional strengths.  The models and their evaluations will be disseminated through normal channels plus a public Innovation Workshop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Potential Economic Impact&lt;br/&gt;Workforce needs for innovation in the form of graduate student education will provide the infrastructure to enable innovation in the biomaterials sector.  The models will be evaluated and the results will be disseminated.  Any business enterprises from the commercialization activities will also have economic impact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Potential Societal Impact&lt;br/&gt;Biomaterials have many applications that will be important to medicine and public health.  In addition, new jobs in the technology sector will be a benefit in New Jersey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
