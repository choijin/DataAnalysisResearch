<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;Northwest Indian College, in collaboration with three other post secondary institutions, three Tribes, three ATE Centers, three professional societies and the Northwest Indian Fisheries Commission, is pursuing a three-year Adaptation and Implementation project to adapt and expand its highly successful NSF funded Tribal Environmental and Natural Resources Management pilot project for a two year AAS degree program. This new project provides a launching pad for Native American students to pursue a four year degree in enviromnental sciences at one of the several participating four- year institutions, or to access environmental technician and management positions at the 40 Tribes within the region. The pilot project was one of a very few in the country to teach Environmental Technology from a Native perspective, and the only one to focus on Marine science. It developed and pilot tested cohort-based integrated curriculum, infused with Native examples and Native American traditional perspectives, deeply infusing into the curriculum Native environmental issues that are vitally important to Tribes. Addressing the Tribes' expressed needs, and with the continuous input of Tribal communities and representatives on the Advisory Committee are the foundation of this project. The TENRM pilot project produced student retention rates over two years of over 71 % -- the highest of any program ever developed by Northwest Indian College. This new project expands the successful pilot effort to meet Tribal needs for Natural Resources Managers and technicians who are well-grounded in the natural sciences of their field, comfortable with emerging technologies, and cognizant and respectful of the Native worldview.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
