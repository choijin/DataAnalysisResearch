    <AbstractNarration>This research develops a novel framework for the design and better&lt;br/&gt;understanding of data compression algorithms. This framework facilitates &lt;br/&gt;the use of ideas and techniques from statistics in order to:&lt;br/&gt; (a) Design efficient practical algorithms for specific applications; &lt;br/&gt; (b) Precisely characterize the performance of such algorithms. &lt;br/&gt;These algorithms provide easily implementable, high-compression methods. &lt;br/&gt;Their construction is done in three stages: A precise correspondence is &lt;br/&gt;first established between data compression algorithms and statistical &lt;br/&gt;models. In the second stage, statistical techniques are applied to &lt;br/&gt;identify a suitable "model" for the data, and in the third stage the &lt;br/&gt;selected model is turned into a practical algorithm. Virtually all of the &lt;br/&gt;algorithms that are currently used in compression applications can be &lt;br/&gt;incorporated into this framework. In view of the tremendous practical &lt;br/&gt;importance of the basic problem (lossy data compression), especially in&lt;br/&gt;the area of multimedia, even modest advances can have a strong impact. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using ideas and techniques from the area of adaptive statistical model-&lt;br/&gt;selection, this study develops practical algorithms and attempts to&lt;br/&gt;advance theoretical understanding of the fundamental issues involved &lt;br/&gt;in lossy data compression, by investigating the following basic questions:&lt;br/&gt;1. What are the fundamental limits of performance (in terms of redundancy &lt;br/&gt; and complexity), for compression with finite amounts of data? What is&lt;br/&gt; the best achievable rate at which optimality can be reached using &lt;br/&gt; reasonable computational resources?&lt;br/&gt;2. How can the trade-off between implementation complexity and compression &lt;br/&gt; performance be balanced in practice?&lt;br/&gt;3. What is the natural _lossy_ analog of the well-known correspondence &lt;br/&gt; between algorithms and codebooks in lossless compression, and how can &lt;br/&gt; model-selection be employed to construct practical algorithms?&lt;br/&gt;On the side of applications, the primary emphasis is on adaptive methods &lt;br/&gt;that can be implemented in real-time systems, and which are based on &lt;br/&gt;concrete theoretical guidelines. These will provide low-complexity, &lt;br/&gt;universal algorithms. In terms of the theory, the focus is on determining&lt;br/&gt;the natural mathematical framework, within which the above issues can&lt;br/&gt;be analyzed. This development builds on recent work in information&lt;br/&gt;theory, centered around a natural "lossy" generalization of the &lt;br/&gt;Asymptotic Equipartition Property and its refinements.</AbstractNarration>
