<AbstractNarration>This project targets low-income computer science, mathematics, engineering or engineering technology lower-division students and 1) increases the number of low- income, academically talented SDSM&amp; T students in CSEMS fields, who successfully enter the major after completing two years of undergraduate study, 2) increases the number of these students qualifying for departmental scholarships, 3) increases awareness of and interaction with industry among these students, 4) provides these students with opportunities for relevant employment experience while undergraduates, and 5) increases the supply of qualified graduates to technology based industry, especially to local and regional employers. The project provides upper- level student mentors to work with CSEMS Scholars to ensure that they maximize their use of available support resources. Student mentors are responsible for conducting monthly coordination sessions, scheduling individual conferences as needed, providing assistance with issues/ problems, assisting in identifying academically related employment opportunities, keeping documentation records and tutoring/ directing students. Four specific activities ensure that CSEMS Scholars are introduced to the profession and are given opportunities to obtain relevant work experience while in school. These are 1) industry seminars, either on- site or via teleconferencing, 2) an alumni mentoring program, 3) activities with recruiters, and 4) local employment and co- op opportunity promotion.</AbstractNarration>
