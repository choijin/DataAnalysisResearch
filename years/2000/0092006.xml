<AbstractNarration>The State Science &amp; Technology Institute (SSTI) annual conference, "Beyond the Hype: Tools for Building Tech-Based Economics", will focus on practical applications of successful techniques employed for science and technology policy.  The conference will include a series of sessions tailored to examine the role of universities in today's economy.  The conference will help serve as forum for nurturing the alliances between university and economic development officials necessary for regions to compete in New Economy. One third of the sessions will be geared to topics addressing investment in universities and commercialization of university research.  A proposed series of university-related sessions would be incorporated into SSTI's promotional and marketing materials for the entire conference.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
