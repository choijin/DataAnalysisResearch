<AbstractNarration>Blackfeet Community College (BCC) proposes to examine past activities of Phase I, look at&lt;br/&gt;what was learned, and continue into Phase II as a development grant. Phase I efforts in&lt;br/&gt;developing and maintaining a comprehensive and sustainable systemic reform effort in&lt;br/&gt;mathematics, science, and technology fell short of expected activities and BCC has learned&lt;br/&gt;from its past activities.&lt;br/&gt;BCC will utilize the lessons learned from Phase I activities and will continue to promote&lt;br/&gt;the NSF drivers while at the same time seek current strategies to assist in their effort&lt;br/&gt;to have a comprehensive program that will catapult Blackfeet Indian reservation and its&lt;br/&gt;students to meet the National standards. Special emphasis will be placed on a holistic&lt;br/&gt;approach to community reform using RSI activities as a springboard for a comprehensive&lt;br/&gt;reform effort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are fourteen K-8 schools (1,814 students) and two high schools (563 students) in the&lt;br/&gt;service area of BCC. BCC will work with eight of these schools in a comprehensive effort&lt;br/&gt;for systemic reform, impacting 1,777 (98%) in the K-8 area and 563 (100%) of the High&lt;br/&gt;School students. BCC will work with mathematics and science teachers and administrators&lt;br/&gt;through existing channels established during Phase I in setting goals and objectives for&lt;br/&gt;Phase I implementation activities. A task force made up of reservation school&lt;br/&gt;administrators will be chaired by the BCC college administrator and will include all&lt;br/&gt;school administrators of schools served. A mathematics task force will be developed and&lt;br/&gt;will include area mathematics instructors (recommended by school site administrators) and&lt;br/&gt;BCC mathematics instructors. It is this group that will examine, recommend, and assess&lt;br/&gt;efforts in mathematics. Another task force in the sciences will be formed composed of all&lt;br/&gt;service area science teachers and BCC science instructors. They will work closely with&lt;br/&gt;the science curriculum of area schools and look at how they are involved in the overall&lt;br/&gt;reform effort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Phase II developmental efforts will continue to promote systemic reform in math&lt;br/&gt;and science education at two school districts consisting of six different school buildings&lt;br/&gt;located in rural Montana. The utmost goal of the program is to develop and maintain a&lt;br/&gt;population that is prepared to meet the needs of a technologically competent work force.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
