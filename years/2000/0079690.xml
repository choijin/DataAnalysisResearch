<AbstractNarration>0079690&lt;br/&gt;Klein&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant supports the acquisition of equipment that will enhance the strength of a multidisciplinary group in performing research in fundamental areas of chemical engineering, chemistry, and materials science and engineering. The interdisciplinary group of scientists and engineers on this proposal has a common interest in studying the chemistry occurring at solid surfaces. A high-pressure reaction cell and a chemical-vapor deposition (CVD) chamber attached to a common analysis chamber will enable the studies envisioned by the group. This proposal is for the acquisition of the common analysis chamber, which would include X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and ion-scattering spectroscopy (ISS). This chamber will be attached to an existing CVD chamber for characterization of materials growth in situ. A high-pressure reaction cell equipped with a mass spectrometer will also be attached so that sample can be exposed to gases at reaction conditions and subsequently analyzed without exposure to air. With in situ surface characterization, the science behind the growth or reaction becomes obtainable and the studies more confident and complete. The proposed equipment will also be used as a learning tool in several undergraduate and graduate classes that teach laboratory analytical techniques.  In addition to the education of graduate students on this equipment, this team of investigators is committed to the participation of undergraduates in research in order to prepare promising students for graduate school or a career in research and development. These undergraduates will have the opportunity to obtain hands-on experience in materials characterization and reaction engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As our ability to build devices extends into the nanometer dimension, understanding the surface phenomena occurring during the device building and use is becoming increasingly important. This award will be used to purchase a surface analysis system comprising of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, ion scattering spectroscopy and a mass spectrometer in order to study the chemical nature of surfaces. The powerful set of techniques will enable us to make advances in three very important areas; ultrathin (&lt;10 nanometer) coatings for high speed data storage media that exhibit resistance to corrosion wear and oxidation, ultrathin high-dielectric-constant films for advanced field effect transistors used in the chip industry and catalyst development for on board generation of hydrogen in automobile fuel cells. The analysis system will be added to a thin film chemical vapor deposition system and a high-pressure reactor cell so that materials may be prepared, treated and studied in-situ without the contamination of laboratory air and humidity. This represents the unique nature of the proposed system. Graduate and undergraduate research students will be trained to use the proposed system by the interdisciplinary team of researchers involved. The proposed system is unique in its abilities but the various techniques are commonly used in industry and therefore the student researchers will be well trained to make the transition from academic to industrial positions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
