<AbstractNarration>0096519&lt;br/&gt;Gelmont&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As high-frequency devices are extended farther into the terahertz (THz) regime, the&lt;br/&gt;electron physics will, for the first time, be impacted by polar optical phonon resonance&lt;br/&gt;(POP) that typically lies above 1 THz. In this frequency region, the dispersion of the&lt;br/&gt;permittivity in all heteropolar materials can not be neglected. At the POP frequency, the&lt;br/&gt;permittivity has a singularity that influences and perturbs all physical processes within&lt;br/&gt;heterostructure barrier devices. Thus, the emerging area of THz electronics requires the&lt;br/&gt;development of new physical theories for the analysis of the heterojunction interface in&lt;br/&gt;the vicinity of the POP frequencies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the last two years, the new theory of POP effects within depletion layers of GaAs&lt;br/&gt;barrier heterostructures has been proposed [1-2]. This physical phenomenon is based upon&lt;br/&gt;dramatic change in complex permittivity of electronic material near the polar&lt;br/&gt;optical-phonon resonance frequency which cause highly nonlinear behavior of depleted&lt;br/&gt;heterostructure modified by the interaction between the lattice and the electric field.&lt;br/&gt;While this simplified theory to date has considered only forward bias conditions and has&lt;br/&gt;ignored neutral layer and external parasitic effects, it predicts a strong POP&lt;br/&gt;influence. Specifically, it predicts that the POPs present within the electron-depleted&lt;br/&gt;region influence the barrier charging dynamics near the semiconductor resonant frequency, directly modify the potential barrier, perturb the spatial dependence of the electric field within the depletion-region and strongly alter the nonlinearity associated with the heterostructure current. This strong and highly-localized frequency-space phenomenon has broad implications to all polar-semiconductor-based heterostructure devices that utilize nonlinear electron transport effects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of this exploratory research project is to develop a new quantitative and&lt;br/&gt;physics-based model for investigating the high frequency dynamics of semiconductor&lt;br/&gt;interfaces. In particular, a research investigation is proposed to study the nonlinear&lt;br/&gt;behavior of forward and reversed bias heterostructures. The physical model will be&lt;br/&gt;integrated with a circuit-embedding algorithm to conduct computer simulation of dynamic&lt;br/&gt;behavior of heterojunction based high frequency devices operating within realistic&lt;br/&gt;situations. This work will also consider the physical operation of interfaces that are&lt;br/&gt;constructed from novel materials systems which can be used to release Schottky interfaces&lt;br/&gt;with good barriers heights and very low resonance frequencies (~600 GHz).&lt;br/&gt;These particular scientific investigations hold great promise for introducing new degrees&lt;br/&gt;of freedom into the functionality and performance of semiconductor-based electronic&lt;br/&gt;devices. For example, the possibility of enhancing the nonlinearity, and therefore the&lt;br/&gt;innate harmonic generation capacity, of heterojunction structures would have a profound&lt;br/&gt;impact on the search for high-efficiency harmonic multiplier sources operating at THz&lt;br/&gt;frequencies.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
