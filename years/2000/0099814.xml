<AbstractNarration>This project addresses problems in dimension theory of&lt;br/&gt;dynamical systems and ergodic theory of tilings and substitutions.&lt;br/&gt;In the first direction, it is proposed to study the dimension&lt;br/&gt;characteristics of invariant sets for non-conformal dynamical&lt;br/&gt;systems and natural measures on them. These questions are related&lt;br/&gt;to problems on self-similar sets with overlap and arithmetic sums&lt;br/&gt;of Cantor sets. The second direction concerns non-periodic self-affine&lt;br/&gt;tilings, their generalizations, and symbolic analogs. There are many&lt;br/&gt;links between the two directions; for instance, self-affine tiles often&lt;br/&gt;have fractal boundaries, and number-theoretic issues&lt;br/&gt;(e.g., the appearance of PV-numbers) are prominent in both areas.&lt;br/&gt;The problems to be studied are concerned with dynamical and diffraction&lt;br/&gt;spectra of tilings and substitutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mathematical chaos theory deals with the appearance of chaotic&lt;br/&gt;motions in dynamical systems (which are mathematical models of&lt;br/&gt;various phenomena in physics, biology, economics, etc.). These&lt;br/&gt;chaotic motions are often associated with various "fractal" phenomena.&lt;br/&gt;The modern dimension theory uses a wide variety of tools to&lt;br/&gt;study the fine structure of these motions and their invariant sets&lt;br/&gt;(such as "strange attractors"). Still, many aspects of this&lt;br/&gt;"fractal chaotic world" remain mysterious, and the proposed research&lt;br/&gt;aims to get further insights into them. The second part of the project&lt;br/&gt;is concerned with the so-called "aperiodic order," the hallmark&lt;br/&gt;of which is the remarkable class of solids, discovered in the&lt;br/&gt;early 1980's and called quasicrystals, which exhibit sharp diffraction&lt;br/&gt;spectrum with a forbidden 10-fold symmetry. Penrose tilings,&lt;br/&gt;discovered in the 1970's in a purely mathematical development, turned&lt;br/&gt;out to be a good model for certain quasicrystals, but many open problems&lt;br/&gt;remain, both on the mathematical and on the physical side.&lt;br/&gt;The second part of the proposed research investigates some of these&lt;br/&gt;problems using the techniques of ergodic theory and symbolic dynamics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
