    <AbstractNarration>Pseudospectral (PS) methods are high-accuracy alternatives to finite&lt;br/&gt;difference (FD) and finite element methods (FEM) for the numerical solution&lt;br/&gt;of PDEs. They are particularly effective for solving convection-dominated&lt;br/&gt;equations over long times and in relatively simple geometries. Both the&lt;br/&gt;algorithms themselves and the analysis of them have traditionally been&lt;br/&gt;closely tied to expansions in different classes of orthogonal functions.&lt;br/&gt;The recent book "A Practical Guide to Pseudospectral Methods" (by the&lt;br/&gt;present investigator) notes that a large body of generalizations,&lt;br/&gt;enhancements and insights can be gained by viewing PS methods instead as&lt;br/&gt;special cases of FD methods. Several such opportunities were explored under&lt;br/&gt;the grant DMS-9706916. Building on these experiences, we will now introduce&lt;br/&gt;radial basis functions (RBFs) as an additional component to be integrated&lt;br/&gt;with PS schemes. Although computationally quite costly, the spectral&lt;br/&gt;accuracy of RBFs, combined with their extreme geometric flexibility, would&lt;br/&gt;seem to make them ideally suited to complement PS methods in the vicinity&lt;br/&gt;of irregular boundaries. To realize this requires much research regarding&lt;br/&gt;the basic features of RBF approximations, as well as research on issues&lt;br/&gt;related to interfacing them with PS and FD methods. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pseudospectral (PS) methods were first proposed in the early 1970's (in&lt;br/&gt;connection with meteorology and turbulence modeling). They have since been&lt;br/&gt;shown to be extraordinary effective for high-accuracy calculations in&lt;br/&gt;numerous other fields, such as computational electromagnetics and nonlinear&lt;br/&gt;waves. Strategically important application areas include simulating the&lt;br/&gt;radar scattering from airplanes, the electrical interference between&lt;br/&gt;components on computer chips, and the transmissions of signals in optical&lt;br/&gt;fibres. The main weakness with PS methods has been the difficulty to apply&lt;br/&gt;them in complex geometries. Some of this has been overcome in recent years&lt;br/&gt;(usually by splitting a complicated domain in simpler parts, and then&lt;br/&gt;applying some suitable computational means for coupling of the subdomains).&lt;br/&gt;A quite different and highly promising approach will be introduced and then&lt;br/&gt;explored under this grant. This involves combining 'classical' PS methods&lt;br/&gt;with the geometrically extremely flexible approach known as radial basis&lt;br/&gt;functions (RBFs). This has never been attempted, and the research falls in&lt;br/&gt;the 'high risk, high gain' category. Success is by no means certain, but if&lt;br/&gt;it happens, it could have a major impact, particularly on computational&lt;br/&gt;electromagnetics in applications such as simulation of radar scattering /&lt;br/&gt;stealth properties of objects.</AbstractNarration>
