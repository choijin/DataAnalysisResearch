    <AbstractNarration>Abstract for Granville's proposal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support the research of the investigator and several&lt;br/&gt;graduate students on various topics in number theory. In the last few years &lt;br/&gt;the investigator, in collaboration with Soundararajan, has been revisiting &lt;br/&gt;the central topic of mean values of multiplicative functions, and strengthening known results as well as adding several new perspectives. In particular they &lt;br/&gt;have shown that such questions are in some sense equivalent to problems about &lt;br/&gt;integral delay equations. Granville proposes continuing this work, particularly looking at the range of values taken and to solve some thorny optimization &lt;br/&gt;problems. This, in turn, should give new results on known problems about &lt;br/&gt;values of (Dirichlet and Hasse-Weil) L-functions at 1, bounds on least&lt;br/&gt;mth power residues, and perhaps even distribution of zeros of L-functions.&lt;br/&gt;The investigator also proposes continuing his work, with Stark, on the &lt;br/&gt;connection between the abc-conjecture and Siegel zeros: On the one hand, &lt;br/&gt;looking further at Diophantine equations satisfied by modular functions;&lt;br/&gt;on the other hand, with Tucker, looking at whether the unproved abc-conjecture &lt;br/&gt;can be replaced by a weaker but feasibly provable hypothesis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator, with collaborators, is looking at the finer aspects of the&lt;br/&gt;distribution of multiplicative functions. The functions turn up in many &lt;br/&gt;different areas in mathematics, physics and cryptography.&lt;br/&gt;The investigator recently showed how an understanding of such questions&lt;br/&gt;is closely related to the seemingly unrelated area of `integral delay &lt;br/&gt;equations'' which are analyzed extensively in understanding how&lt;br/&gt;various biological mechanisms work. Thus results and conjectures &lt;br/&gt;about mean values of multiplicative functions can be ``translated'' into&lt;br/&gt;results and conjectures about integral delay equations, so that the &lt;br/&gt;perspectives of one field can be brought to bear on the other, and vice-versa.&lt;br/&gt;This has already led to some new results and fresh questions in integral-delay&lt;br/&gt;equations, and the investigator has been asked to present his ideas in a &lt;br/&gt;series of lectures at a major conference in that area, to stimulate further&lt;br/&gt;interaction. In addition the investigator has been working with students, &lt;br/&gt;particularly from the Deep South, to get their PhDs, and obtain good positions &lt;br/&gt;in research, education, industry and government, with a training that will help &lt;br/&gt;them bring a fresh perspective to their future professions. This group was&lt;br/&gt;recently ranked tenth in the US.</AbstractNarration>
