<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator wants to study two topics in Several Complex Variables.&lt;br/&gt;The first is on holomorphic embeddings. By constructing holomorphic functions,one seeks to embed complex manifolds as closed submanifolds of some complex Euclidean space of as low dimension as possible.&lt;br/&gt;The second is on envelopes of holomorphy.&lt;br/&gt;In constructions of holomorphic functions, one is faced with the&lt;br/&gt;restriction that sometimes they all extend past certain boundary points,&lt;br/&gt;for example, in higher dimensions no holomorphic function can have an&lt;br/&gt;isolated singularity. Isolated boundary points belong to the envelope of&lt;br/&gt;holomorphy.The investigator will study, more generally, envelopes of&lt;br/&gt;holomorphy. In particular, there is a great need for investigation of a&lt;br/&gt;large variety of examples.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Complex analysis is a basic tool in many fields of mathematics and in other sciences. Even problems described with real numbers are often dealt with more naturally after extending into the&lt;br/&gt;complex domain. A foundational problem of the subject is how to construct holomorphic&lt;br/&gt;functions with required properties. This basic problem has motivated much&lt;br/&gt;of the work of the proposer in the past and is also the motivation for&lt;br/&gt;this proposal. For example how can one find a holomorphic function tending&lt;br/&gt;to infinity at a certain boundary point, or has some other singularity&lt;br/&gt;there?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
