<AbstractNarration>This award from the Instrumentation for Materials Research program will enable Rutgers University to acquire a variable temperature scanning probe microscope (scanning tunneling microscope and atomic force microscope, or STM/AFM) with spectroscopic capabilities for shared use in the Laboratory for Surface Modification (LSM) at Rutgers University. The LSM is a multidisciplinary laboratory with research in many areas in the science and engineering of surfaces and thin films. The instrument will be used, in conjunction with other techniques, for several different projects. These include imaging and characterizing charge stripe phases in highly correlated materials, roughening, structural and electrical properties of ultra thin gate oxides for microelectronic applications, and vacancy diffusion, quantum size effects and nano-faceting of metal surfaces and ultrathin metal films. Rutgers will also integrate the SPM into materials education and outreach programs, including developing some web-based classroom training modules. The latter activity will link research-active postdocs and graduate students with middle and high school students and their teachers, and with undergraduates.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;This award from the Instrumentation for Materials Research program will enable Rutgers University to acquire a variable temperature scanning probe microscope (scanning tunneling microscope and atomic force microscope, or STM/AFM) with spectroscopic capabilities for shared use in the Laboratory for Surface Modification (LSM) at Rutgers University. The LSM is a multidisciplinary laboratory with research in many areas in the science and engineering of surfaces and thin films. The instrument will be used, in conjunction with other techniques, for several different research projects that require state of the art imaging of surfaces at the atomic scale. Today, the need for truly atomic level imaging of surfaces is compelling. Scanning tunneling microscopy and other scanning probe techniques have revolutionized surface science and been applied to a wide range of problems related to interfaces. The SPM will be integrated into materials education and outreach programs, including developing some web-based classroom training modules. The latter activity will link research-active postdocs and graduate students with middle and high school students and their teachers, and with undergraduates.&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
