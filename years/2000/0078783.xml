<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Stewart # 0078783 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; What is necessary for good judgment in uncertain situations?  For any&lt;br/&gt; given judgment problem, some people perform better than others.  This is&lt;br/&gt; true both for everyday judgments, such as a driver judging a safe speed or&lt;br/&gt; a consumer judging the quality of a product, and for professional&lt;br/&gt; judgments, such as a physician judging the severity of a child's illness&lt;br/&gt; or a weather forecaster judging the probability that a storm will spawn&lt;br/&gt; tornadoes.  Are the differences in judgmental performance simply a result&lt;br/&gt; of differences in experience and training, or do they reflect differences&lt;br/&gt; in fundamental cognitive abilities necessary for good judgment?&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt; This study will examine three cognitive abilities and how they relate to&lt;br/&gt; good judgment:  (a) intelligence (b) good statistical reasoning and (c)&lt;br/&gt; the ability to learn to use information accurately in new situations.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt; Members of the local community and expert weather forecasters will be&lt;br/&gt; recruited to participate.  For both groups, two everyday judgment problems&lt;br/&gt; will be used to measure judgment performance.  In addition, the weather&lt;br/&gt; forecasters' professional judgment performance will be assessed based on&lt;br/&gt; their track record as forecasters and their performance on a new task.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt; The data will be used to explore how judgmental skill in everyday and&lt;br/&gt; professional judgment tasks is related to other cognitive abilities.  The&lt;br/&gt; study results will improve our understanding of what goes into accurate&lt;br/&gt; judgment.  They will also contribute to the training of professionals and&lt;br/&gt; to the design of systems to support better judgment and decision making in&lt;br/&gt; uncertain situations.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
