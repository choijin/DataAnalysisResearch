<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;van Gorkom, Jacqueline&lt;br/&gt;"An HI Survey of Clusters in the Local Universe"&lt;br/&gt;AST-0098249&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will image twelve nearby clusters of galaxies in neutral hydrogen using the VLA (460 hours have been granted), and supplement the data with deep optical multicolor imaging and optical spectroscopy. As a byproduct of the neutral hydrogen survey, deep radio continuum images will be obtained. The entire volume of the clusters will be probed out to two Abell radii.  The work will simultaneously study the low density outer regions and the dense cluster cores. The selected clusters are in varying degrees of dynamical relaxation, some contain starburst and post starburst galaxies, and most have a central X ray source. The goal is to study the evolution of galaxies as they travel from the low density outer regions into the dense cores of clusters and to assess the dynamical state of the clusters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
