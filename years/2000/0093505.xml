<AbstractNarration>The present widespread interest in the use of computers for online learning at all levels from primary school to university and adult  education presents an unprecedented opportunity for leveraging the computational medium's strengths for learning. Along with this opportunity comes profound responsibility to adopt these technologies in ways specifically proven to support learning. Research on learning shows that social processes such as collaboration and mentoring play an important role.  Likewise, many disciplines make use of rich forms of visual representations, and research has shown that proper use of visual representations can impact on learning.  Yet, existing software for online learning provides only primitive support for manipulation of representations other than text, and there is a lack of research on how representational tools and online discussion tools may be constructively combined. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Collaborative Representations project is exploring ways to design interactive software in which learners can easily collaborate online while learning with rich representations.  The project is also studying how the representations themselves may be designed to guide learners into knowledge-building discourse.  Software for online learning is being developed in collaboration with teachers and scientists to help ensure suitability for instructional objectives.  Controlled experiments are being undertaken to refine the software design and to assess the effects of the representations on discourse processes and on learning outcomes.  Instructional and assessment strategies are being developed in the context of authentic research projects involving students, teachers and scientists, and will be disseminated to teachers through professional development activities. Continued work in this area will contribute to a scientifically tested theory of representationally rich collaborative learning, and inform the design of the next generation of software and associated instructional and assessment strategies for online learning.  This work is being undertaken with the assistance of graduate students who are receiving training in methodologies for the design and evaluation of educational technologies. &lt;br/&gt;Additionally, new courses are being proposed for our degree program, courses specifically designed to expose future information technology workers to the importance of addressing the human dimension of information systems, particularly in educational and training applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
