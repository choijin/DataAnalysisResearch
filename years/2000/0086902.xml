<AbstractNarration>Whereas decoding the entire genomes of procaryotic and eucaryotic organisms was a major&lt;br/&gt;biological challenge of the nineties, this new decade seeks to capture an understanding of the&lt;br/&gt;protein interactions of a cell. This understanding has the potential to yield enormous societal&lt;br/&gt;benefit via predictions of total cellular responses to new pharmaceutical compounds, infectious&lt;br/&gt;agents, environmental toxins, or disruptions in particular regulatory pathways. The research&lt;br/&gt;described in this proposal aims to address this grand challenge by establishing a fundamentally&lt;br/&gt;new and highly sensitive optical measurement technique that permits rapid, simultaneous&lt;br/&gt;detection and quantification of multiple protein molecules involved in regulating intracellular&lt;br/&gt;signaling pathways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research described in this proposal fuses principles of optics in liquid crystalline&lt;br/&gt;media with the design of nanostructured surfaces to create a fundamentally new optical tool that&lt;br/&gt;has the potential to be broadly applicable to studies aimed at unraveling the complex behavior of&lt;br/&gt;cellular systems at the protein level. The first goal is to establish the use of biophotonic methods&lt;br/&gt;based on liquid crystals for analysis of key regulatory signaling pathways in cells. Such a&lt;br/&gt;technology could impact drug discovery, pharmacodynamic monitoring, regulation of gene&lt;br/&gt;expression, protein-protein interactions, and our understanding of carcinogenesis. The second&lt;br/&gt;broad goal is to demonstrate that liquid crystals can form the basis of a general and powerful&lt;br/&gt;methodology that permits detection of post-translational modifications to proteins. Because the&lt;br/&gt;identification of specific chemical modifications of a protein can reveal its cellular location,&lt;br/&gt;biological lifespan and activation status, classification of proteins by their post-translational&lt;br/&gt;modification would be enormously useful in studies elucidating the complex behavior of cells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We propose to explore the use of liquid crystals to monitor cellular expression and&lt;br/&gt;activation of regulatory signaling proteins such as Ras, and to detect the interaction of Ras with&lt;br/&gt;target proteins in the multiple signaling pathways that mediate its biological activity. Although&lt;br/&gt;our initial focus will be on detecting the binding of Ras to anti-Ras IgG and, when activated, its&lt;br/&gt;binding to the down stream effector molecular RAF1, this system is prototypical and will,&lt;br/&gt;therefore, be generalizable to a broad class of regulatory signaling proteins. We propose to&lt;br/&gt;demonstrate the generality of the methodology by using liquid crystals to screen simultaneously&lt;br/&gt;for post-translational modifications of multiple proteins involved in a common regulatory&lt;br/&gt;pathway.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First, we will design surfaces that permit coupling of biomolecular recognition&lt;br/&gt;events between total Ras and anti-Ras IgG, and between activated Ras and RAF1, to the&lt;br/&gt;orientations of liquid crystals. Second, we will determine the sensitivity and capability to&lt;br/&gt;quantitate photonic methods based on liquid crystals using as examples detection of total Ras&lt;br/&gt;and activated Ras. Third, we will integrate photonic principles based on liquid crystals with&lt;br/&gt;microfluidics so as to minimize sample size and enable detection of minute amounts of&lt;br/&gt;captured proteins (~104 molecules). We will provide simultaneous measurement of total Ras and&lt;br/&gt;activated Ras, and integrate the delivery of the sample and the liquid crystal. Fourth, we will&lt;br/&gt;demonstrate the generality of the above described methodology based on liquid crystals by&lt;br/&gt;rapidly screening for the post-translational modifications of multiple proteins involved in a&lt;br/&gt;common regulatory pathway (MAPK, JNK, ERK 1/2).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although the principles we propose to develop are broadly applicable to fundamental&lt;br/&gt;studies in cell and molecular biology, they also have the potential for a tremendous impact on&lt;br/&gt;biomedical investigators. One such example is in the detection of the activation states of&lt;br/&gt;intracellular regulatory proteins. It is the activation state of these proteins that determines which&lt;br/&gt;intracellular signaling cascades are initiated, and these in turn determine the fundamental&lt;br/&gt;behaviors of cells. As such, the rapid determination of the activation states of these regulatory&lt;br/&gt;proteins will represent a boon to the study of diverse medical conditions that result from&lt;br/&gt;inappropriate signaling events such as those linked to neoplastic transformation and immune&lt;br/&gt;mediated disorders.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
