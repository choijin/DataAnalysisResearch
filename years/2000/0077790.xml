<AbstractNarration>Kuang&lt;br/&gt;0077790&lt;br/&gt;     All organisms are composed of multiple chemical elements&lt;br/&gt;such as carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus.  Recent research in the&lt;br/&gt;area known as ecological stoichiometry has highlighted the&lt;br/&gt;ecological importance of the relative abundance of chemical&lt;br/&gt;constituents, known to vary considerably among species and across&lt;br/&gt;trophic levels.  However, most theoeretical studies in ecology&lt;br/&gt;have until very recently ignored the sources and consequences of&lt;br/&gt;this chemical heterogeneity.  The investigator and his colleagues&lt;br/&gt;undertake theoretical investigations of ecological stoichiometry.&lt;br/&gt;They develop a relatively new theoretical framework for&lt;br/&gt;ecological dynamics that explicitly incorporates stoichiometric&lt;br/&gt;constraints.  This base model involves a stoichiometric&lt;br/&gt;counterpart of the familiar Rosenzweig-MacArthur equations in&lt;br/&gt;which the effective carrying capacity of the resource species and&lt;br/&gt;the transfer efficiency of the consumer species are constrained&lt;br/&gt;by stoichiometric principles.  Introduction of stoichiometric&lt;br/&gt;considerations in these equations (here, akin to "food quality")&lt;br/&gt;allows for a rich array of ecologically realistic dynamics,&lt;br/&gt;including deterministic extinction of the consumer species when&lt;br/&gt;resources are abundant but of poor quality.  They expand this&lt;br/&gt;model in five different directions, to explore ecological&lt;br/&gt;realities (i.e., complications) whose consideration has proved&lt;br/&gt;illuminating in other, non-stoichiometric settings.  Specifically,&lt;br/&gt;they analyze the dynamics of 1) a multi-nutrient model; 2)&lt;br/&gt;trophically complex models in which multiple consumer species&lt;br/&gt;share a resource; 3) time delays in nutrient recycling that are a&lt;br/&gt;realistic component of terrestrial ecosystems; 4) two patch&lt;br/&gt;models featuring habitat heterogeneity and dispersal of the&lt;br/&gt;consumer; and 5) age structured models in which juvenile and&lt;br/&gt;adult consumers differ in their nutrient requirements.  The&lt;br/&gt;project aims to provide an analytically rigorous foundation for&lt;br/&gt;burgeoning empirical research into ecological stoichiometry.&lt;br/&gt;     All living things, including humans, are constructed of&lt;br/&gt;approximately the same set of basic building blocks, chemical&lt;br/&gt;elements such as carbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and&lt;br/&gt;several dozen more in smaller amounts.  However, different&lt;br/&gt;organisms contain different proportions of these key elements in&lt;br/&gt;their biomass and thus must extract these elements from their&lt;br/&gt;environment to differing degrees.  In many situations, the&lt;br/&gt;environment does not provide these key nutrient elements in the&lt;br/&gt;abundance and proportions that are optimal for organism growth&lt;br/&gt;and reproduction.  Thus, the chemical environment of life may set&lt;br/&gt;limits on the success of organisms in various situations.  In this&lt;br/&gt;project the investigators use mathematical models to simulate the&lt;br/&gt;flow of multiple chemical elements in natural food webs to better&lt;br/&gt;understand how the requirements of living things for multiple&lt;br/&gt;chemical elements establish key feedbacks between the living and&lt;br/&gt;non-living world.  This work is important for two reasons.  First,&lt;br/&gt;it may provide a better fundamental understanding of how chemical&lt;br/&gt;elements move through food webs.  Second, improved fundamental&lt;br/&gt;knowledge of how nutrients move in the environment and how to&lt;br/&gt;simulate those movements with mathematical tools may help predict&lt;br/&gt;and manage natural and human-dominated ecosystems, including&lt;br/&gt;those affected by nutrient inputs from human activities (e.g.  N&lt;br/&gt;and P inputs from fertilizer, sewage) or by global change (e.g.&lt;br/&gt;effects of increased atmospheric carbon dioxide on C and nutrient&lt;br/&gt;flow in the environment).&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
