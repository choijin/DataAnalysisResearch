<AbstractNarration>To date, virtually all analyses of an international nature have relied on data deriving from national or political boundaries. This research project will develop and analyze economic data on a geophysical (latitude and longitude) basis. By developing data on a geophysically gridded basis, it will be possible to  promote insight and understanding into the relationship between socioeconomic&lt;br/&gt;data and geophysical data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The central task of the research will be to develop a global, geophysically scaled data set on economic output. This data set is called the Geophysically Scaled Economic Data Set (GSEDS). The GSEDS will be a gridded data set a 1 degree latitude by 1 degre longitude resolution. This scale is approximately 100 by 100 km, which is somewhat smaller  than the size of the major subnational political entities for most large countries. The economic activity concept will be gross value added (gross regional product) measured both at market exchange rates, and at purchasing-power parity exchange rates. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The utility of the GSEDS will be to open up a wide range of research that is currently not possible with existing data. By linking economic and geophysical data, it will be possible to examine the environmental impacts of economic activity as well as the economic dimensions of geography and geophysical phenomena.</AbstractNarration>
