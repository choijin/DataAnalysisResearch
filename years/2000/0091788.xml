<AbstractNarration>Professor Royce Murray and his colleagues at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill are examining the chemistry and electrochemistry of metal nanoparticles containing a few hundred atoms and coated with a monolayer of thiolate ligands.  With the support of the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, this project focusses on the synthesis of these monolayer protected clusters, and their characterization using various chemical and electrochemical means. In addition, this group studies electron transfer dynamics in mixed valent molecular molten salts.  The goal of the work is to understand the basic properties of nanoparticulate matter and electron transfer dynamics in these systems and in the semi-solid molecular molten salts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The synthesis and characterization of a novel class of molecular nanoparticles is the goal of this research project at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill.  Using thiolate ligands to protect metal particles of a few hundred atoms, materials that can be manipulated and characterized using electrochemical methods are being developed.  This research project also includes the study of electron transfer processes in mixed valent molecular molten salts.  Both aspects of the research are directed to a basic understanding of charge transfer in nanomaterials and solids.</AbstractNarration>
