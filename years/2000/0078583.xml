    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is to develop a new computer peripheral: a Volumetric Image Display system that displays 3D images in a real space. Many viewers can walk around the display and see the 3D images from omni-directions without special glasses. The overall business objectives corresponding to this project are to develop and implement the technologies required for building the VID product, to demonstrate the market viability, and to complete the financial preparation for Phase III. In order to speed up commercialization, a Basic Model product will be completed in year 1. It will feature a flexible configuration and good specifications to address the initial need in various fields. Marketing will then begin in year 2 to test market and seek business alliances, using the Basic Model as a demonstration platform as well as an evaluation product. A low-volume manufacturing procedure will be established to support initial sales. In year 2, techniques that further improve product color and gray scale will be developed and demonstrated. We already have a Phase III funding commitment. Based on the demonstrated market viability and technical readiness, a new business plan will be prepared to raise additional funding commitments to complete the finance preparation for Phase III. The marketing goals also include obtaining at least one development contract from a major corporation, as part of the Phase III finance. Market analysis indicates great commercial potential in four major segments: medical, computer aided design and engineering, visual data analysis, and computer gaming.</AbstractNarration>
