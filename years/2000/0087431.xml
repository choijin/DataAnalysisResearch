<AbstractNarration>Allmendinger&lt;br/&gt;0087431&lt;br/&gt;The Atacama fault zone can be traced for nearly 1000 km in the &lt;br/&gt;forearc of the Central Andes.  The northern terminus of the fault zone &lt;br/&gt;occurs just south of Iquique, Chile, in a series of complex blocks &lt;br/&gt;bounded by strike-slip, thrust, and normal faults.  Digital topography &lt;br/&gt;produced from satellite radar imagery shows that this area is one of &lt;br/&gt;the most tectonically active parts of the entire fault system.  The &lt;br/&gt;area overlies the general region where the Iquique ridge on the Nazca &lt;br/&gt;plate is being subducted beneath South America, and correlates well &lt;br/&gt;with a seismic gap in the Benioff zone that many seismologists &lt;br/&gt;believe will be the site of the next major earthquake on this plate &lt;br/&gt;boundary.  We are dating these young faults using Ar/Ar and Uranium &lt;br/&gt;series isotopic methods, and are also studying their kinematics using &lt;br/&gt;measurements of slip directions on the well-exposed faults.  These &lt;br/&gt;field data are being combined and analyzed in a map view block &lt;br/&gt;restoration program developed at the Universite de Rennes (France), &lt;br/&gt;which will allow us to quantify the strain and rotation in the &lt;br/&gt;region.  Then, we can evaluate block rotation versus oroclinal bending &lt;br/&gt;hypotheses spurred by paleomagnetic data, as well as investigate the &lt;br/&gt;origin of proposed arc parallel compression.  Finally, our fieldwork &lt;br/&gt;and digital elevation model provides a well-documented "before" &lt;br/&gt;picture to compare to the "after" picture to be obtained following &lt;br/&gt;the next great earthquake along this plate boundary, site of the &lt;br/&gt;largest earthquake on record.  Thus, eventually we will be able to &lt;br/&gt;document how the forearc of a major ocean continent convergence &lt;br/&gt;system deforms during Benioff zone seismicity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
