<AbstractNarration>This project supports the PI's sabbatical year at The Boeing Company.  The research involves investigations of the chatter instability in high-speed machining.  Chatter is a self-excited oscillation between the machining tool and the workpiece that limits productivity of machining operations, reduces the quality of the product and shortens machine tool life.  Up until recently all models of chatter have been linear, with delay effects in the case of regenerative chatter.  These models only partially explain the instabilities observed in the machining process.  Nonlinear models are currently being developed, and have had some success in predicting behavior that may be described in part by low dimensional systems.  In the aircraft industry this problem has received intense scrutiny, and the work of the P.I.'s collaborator at Boeing (Dr. E. Askari) has been in the development of finite element models for metal cutting. A union of two techniques, large scale numerical simulation and low dimensional models, is the goal of the research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project should be viewed as part of the department's efforts to build an industrial math program, and support its newly created Master of Science in Industrial Mathematics.  The lynch pin of the new degree is an industry project and summer internship, where students are brought into existing industry/faculty collaborations.  The development of such collaborations will be enhanced by the PI's involvement with the scientists at The Boeing Company.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is jointly supported by the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) and the Division of Mathematical Sciences.</AbstractNarration>
