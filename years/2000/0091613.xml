<AbstractNarration>This collaborative project between Michigan Technological University (MTU) and Southwest&lt;br/&gt;Texas State University (SWT) focuses on the fabrication and testing of photonic crystals in magnetic&lt;br/&gt;oxides for novel integrated photonic device prototyping. The project responds to the growing interest in&lt;br/&gt;photonic crystals for device applications based on their unique optical band gap properties. While various&lt;br/&gt;novel optical band-gap structures have been fabricated in non-magnetic dielectric media for highly efficient&lt;br/&gt;waveguiding, filtering and resonator applications, very little work has been done on photonic crystals in&lt;br/&gt;magnetic systems. One-dimensional structures have received some attention, although this work is still&lt;br/&gt;very limited and remains mostly theoretical. Higher dimensional systems have not been investigated at all.&lt;br/&gt;Given the novelty of the field of magnetic systems in photonic crystal applications, the proposed project&lt;br/&gt;will consist of a one-year exploratory effort to assess the applicability of magnetic materials in photonic&lt;br/&gt;band-gap structures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The non-reciprocal properties of magnetic oxides, such as yttrium iron garnet (YIG), make these&lt;br/&gt;materials a unique choice for optical isolator and circulator fabrication. Optical fiber telecommunications&lt;br/&gt;have developed to the point where the monolithic integration of different optical components is a serious&lt;br/&gt;issue to reduce costs in local area networks and long-distance data transmittal. In particular, noise&lt;br/&gt;suppression at the source is an important driver for the development of on-chip optical isolators. However,&lt;br/&gt;conventional systems utilizing non-planar geometries are both bulky and expensive. Photonic crystal&lt;br/&gt;structures provide a novel alternative to address this problem since they can significantly enhance the Kerr&lt;br/&gt;and Faraday response, making it possible to build smaller and cheaper isolators and circulators&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A program to develop photonic crystal devices based on magnetic systems is a high-risk high-&lt;br/&gt;payoff undertaking. It is high-risk because the use of photonic crystals in magnetic systems is a completely&lt;br/&gt;new and virgin field. Most of the work developed thus far has been theoretical, although a few&lt;br/&gt;experimental successes have been reported. Certain aspects of the sputtering work required for the&lt;br/&gt;fabrication of one-dimensional magnetic photonic crystals remain partly unexplored and may require&lt;br/&gt;particularly careful fine-tuning of the sputtering conditions. In particular, special attention must be paid to&lt;br/&gt;the formation of highly smooth interfaces in the magnetic photonic crystal stack given the large number of&lt;br/&gt;layers that make up these structures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The essence of the innovation presented by the use of photonic crystals in magneto-optic isolators&lt;br/&gt;is that of a tremendous reduction in length in the polarization rotator afforded by a corresponding&lt;br/&gt;enhancement in Faraday rotation. However, the impact of this program, if successful, would not be just the&lt;br/&gt;development of ultra-short isolators but the enabling of actual on-chip commercial integration of magneto-&lt;br/&gt;optic isolators. This is because the integration of these devices onto planar structures has been hindered by&lt;br/&gt;the presence of linear birefringence in optical waveguides. The difficulty arises because waveguide&lt;br/&gt;dimensions comparable to the optical wavelength induce a phase mismatch between transverse-electric&lt;br/&gt;(TE) and transverse-magnetic (TM) modes, degrading the isolation efficiency. The qualitative reduction in&lt;br/&gt;device length envisaged by the use of photonic crystal structures promises to eliminate the phase matching&lt;br/&gt;stumbling block to the integration of isolators into photonic circuits. In that sense, this program has the&lt;br/&gt;potential to revolutionize optical communications technology, by allowing the on-chip fabrication of a&lt;br/&gt;critical component for communications systems.</AbstractNarration>
