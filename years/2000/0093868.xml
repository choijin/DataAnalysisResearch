<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;This PECASE award combines multi-disciplinary, multi-scale, research and education programs to study the innovative use of shape-memory alloys (SMAs) as seismic dampers in Civil engineering structures.  Shape memory alloys are a class of alloys that display several unique characteristics, including high damping characteristics.  The research program ranges from micro-scale studies to full-scale proof-of-concept experimental tests.  The research plan has the following tasks: (1) Determine the effects of thermo-mechanical heat treatment on the mechanical properties of shape memory alloys; (2)  Develop SMA-based passive dampers for use in seismic resistant design and retrofit; (3) Develop analytical models for SMAs; (4) Conduct full-scale tests of structures with SMA dampers; and (5) Develop code procedures for using shape memory alloy dampers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The integration of research and education is accomplished through a Research Experience for Undergraduates program in the area of "smart materials."  Students from interdisciplinary fields such as materials science, mechanical engineering, as well as civil engineering will work collaboratively on both experimental and analytical aspects of the applications of smart materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will provide a unique database of experimental results on large-scale shape memory alloy material, which can be used as a basis for the development of a new family of innovative energy dissipating devices.  The research will also lead to the development of analytical tools and methodologies to allow practicing engineers to determine potential benefits of a variety of applications of shape memory alloys.  Finally, the research will lead to code development and implementation for using shape memory alloys in Civil  Engineering structures.  In light of the recent economic losses in major earthquakes, this research will lead to innovative, simple, and highly effective methods for seismic rehabilitation of structures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
