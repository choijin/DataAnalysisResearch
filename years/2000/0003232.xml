In addition, at lease 20 (67 percent) of the 30 HBCUs participating in the invitational regional workshops in years one and two will submit HBCU-UP proposals, at lease 10 (50 percent) of which will be successful the following year in obtaining HBCU-UP awards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In year two, special workshop sessions will be held for institutions whose proposals were unsuccessful in the previous year's competition.  HBCUs that participated in the workshops in year one but did not submit proposals in the next Program competition will be replaced with new HBCUs if they do not demonstrate sufficient commitment to submitting a proposal during the next competition.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
