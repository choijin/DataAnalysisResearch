    <AbstractNarration>With National Science Foundation support Dr. Sharon Steadman and her &lt;br/&gt;colleagues will conduct two field seasons of archaeological research in the Yozgat province of &lt;br/&gt;central Turkey (Anatolia), at the site of Cadir Hoyuk. The team consists of &lt;br/&gt;field archaeologists, specialists in faunal analysis, paleobotany, lithics analysis, and ceramic &lt;br/&gt;analysis. Investigation will concentrate on the prehistoric occupation at the site of &lt;br/&gt;Cadir Hoyuk in the north central Anatolian plateau, primarily on the Chalcolithic and Early &lt;br/&gt;Bronze I periods (ca. 5000-3000 B.C.) prior to the rise of the early second millennium state-level &lt;br/&gt;societies. The lack of extensive prehistoric remains in this region has left a large gap in the &lt;br/&gt;understanding of the transition in the north central plateau culture history from the early &lt;br/&gt;farming/herding settlements in the fifth/fourth millennia to the rise of the Hittite Empire/State in the &lt;br/&gt;early second millennium B.C.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Previous work in this region has demonstrated that the Chalcolithic and &lt;br/&gt;Early Bronze periods witnessed extensive socio-economic changes, including &lt;br/&gt;the rise of long-distance ("international") trade, the influx of a new, migratory, population, and the &lt;br/&gt;development of increasingly complex society (culminating in the second millennium Hittite &lt;br/&gt;empire). However, previously excavated sites were lacking in continuous occupation, making the &lt;br/&gt;documentation of a lengthy and coherent occupational sequence impossible. Dr. Steadman's previous work at Cadir Hoyuk has demonstrated that this is a multi-period site, with a long occupational sequence.The NSF-funded research program will focus on the following three &lt;br/&gt;investigative goals:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; 1. What was the nature of the indigenous Chalcolithic/EB occupation in this &lt;br/&gt;region of&lt;br/&gt; Anatolia? &lt;br/&gt; 2. What was the nature and extent of long-distance trade in the north central &lt;br/&gt;plateau region?&lt;br/&gt; 3. What impact did the Late Chalcolithic arrival of a new population (later &lt;br/&gt;to become the second millennium Hittite State) have on the indigenous Anatolian &lt;br/&gt;socio-economic&lt;br/&gt; organization? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed fieldwork provides previously unavailable insight into the north &lt;br/&gt;central plateau occupational history before, during, and after two important events in this &lt;br/&gt;region's prehistoric sequence: the florescence of long-distance exchange, and the arrival of &lt;br/&gt;immigrants who forever after changed the nature of central Anatolian demographics. The site &lt;br/&gt;of Cadir Hoyuk has the utmost potential to provide answers to the proposed research &lt;br/&gt;questions and will go far in enabling us to establish a secure prehistoric cultural sequence for this &lt;br/&gt;little understood region of the Anatolian plateau.</AbstractNarration>
