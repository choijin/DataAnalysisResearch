    <AbstractNarration>Septins are a conserved family of cytoskeletal proteins. Proteins of this family are&lt;br/&gt;required for cytokinesis in both fungal and animal cells. During cytokinesis, and in post-mitotic cells, septins are often located near regions of active membrane extension. However, the molecular role of&lt;br/&gt;septins in membrane growth remains obscure.&lt;br/&gt; The prospore membrane is an intracellular membrane formed during sporulation&lt;br/&gt;in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which packages the haploid nuclei produced by&lt;br/&gt;meiosis into spores. Septin behavior during prospore membrane formation resembles that&lt;br/&gt;of septins in higher cells; septins follow the leading edge of the membrane as it grows.&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on illuminating the function of septins during formation of the&lt;br/&gt;prospore membrane.&lt;br/&gt; A combination of cell biological, genetic, and biochemical methods will be used&lt;br/&gt;to investigate this problem. The possible co-localization of septins with the protein&lt;br/&gt;phosphatase, Gip1p/Glc7p, as well as with proteins required for vesicle fusion will be&lt;br/&gt;examined. Additionally, proteins that can bind to both septins and the Gip1p subunit of&lt;br/&gt;the phosphatase will be sought.&lt;br/&gt; These experiments will shed light on the molecular function of septins in&lt;br/&gt;promoting the growth of the prospore membrane and the development of spores.&lt;br/&gt;Because of the evolutionary conservation of septins, insights gained into the function of&lt;br/&gt;these proteins in sporulating yeast cells may provide insight into septin function in higher&lt;br/&gt;cells.</AbstractNarration>
