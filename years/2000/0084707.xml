<AbstractNarration> ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: James B. Rawlings &lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Wisconsin&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 0084707&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"Chemical Process Control (CPC) VI" will bring together engineers and scientists from universities and industry.  It will provide a forum for assessing the current status and the future needs and challenges in the field of process control.  The first five CPC conferences were successful in establishing a constructive dialogue between control theoreticians and industrial practitioners.  Common research goals were defined and steps were taken to narrow the gap between the theory and practice of process control.  As a continuation of these efforts, CPC VI will examine recent advances in process control vis a vis the current trends in the chemical and allied industries, and attempt to define the needs and intellectual research challenges for the next decade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, this CPC will explore the evolving "Researcher - Manufacturer - Vendor" tripartite relationship that is emerging as a viable paradigm for the efficient development and deployment of novel process control technologies for broad application in the manufacturing industries.  The theme of the conference is: "Future Needs and Challenges in Process Control."  Specific goals of CPC IV are:&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;            - To gain an appreciation of the state of process operations and control practice in industries                               currently or potentially employing, and supported by, process control engineers and chemical                         engineers with systems backgrounds.&lt;br/&gt;            - Present tutorial overviews for nonspecialists in each of the important areas of   &lt;br/&gt;               systems and control theory, particularly emerging and new areas.&lt;br/&gt;           - Provide a forum for in-depth discussions between university researchers,    &lt;br/&gt;                industrial practitioners and commercial control technology vendors.&lt;br/&gt;           - Provide practitioners and vendors with a current understanding of the new   &lt;br/&gt;              and significant tools emerging from the research community in order to &lt;br/&gt;              stimulate wider implementation.&lt;br/&gt;              Provide a forum for assessing promising research directions for the next    &lt;br/&gt;              decade.&lt;br/&gt;          - Assess needs and challenges in the process industries, as well as evaluate   &lt;br/&gt;             opportunities for increased activity and application in non-traditional   &lt;br/&gt;              industries.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
