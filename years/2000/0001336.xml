<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;CTS-0001336,  United Engr Trustees&lt;br/&gt;Charles V. Freiman and John A. Herbst&lt;br/&gt;Partial travel support for invited speakers and U.S. young researchers participating at the "Population Balance Modeling of Particulate Systems" conference in Kona, Hawaii, on January 23-28, 2000, has been requested.  The objective of this meeting is to evaluate the current research results in the field, and identify research needs and new research directions and technological developments.   Engineers, chemists and physicists from academe and industry will attempt to identify common principles and approaches and develop collaborations.  The conference is organized in nine technical sections, including overviews on modeling and simulation, mineral systems, biological/environmental systems, advanced materials, chemical/petroleum systems, model solutions, research needs and directions, and applications.  Established and young researchers from Americas, Europe, Asia and Australia will participate.  There will be about 80 participants. &lt;br/&gt;This workshop is addressing topics modeling particulate systems with a broad area of relevance.  Despite its importance, this field received less attention in the last 5-10 years and a new reassessment and redirection of the research is timely. Ample time will be allowed for questions and discussions.  The workshop is expected to be an interactive forum for participants, particularly younger researchers, to debate actual technical issues, collaborations and professional activities.  A purpose of the meeting is to facilitate the establishment of long term cooperation among researchers in academe and industry in the area of population balance modeling.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
