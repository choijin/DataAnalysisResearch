<AbstractNarration>0076276&lt;br/&gt;Drobny&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award to the University of Washington is for the development of high fields solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (SSNMR) console for biomaterials research and student training. A common challenge in the molecular bioengineering field is the characterization of biomolecules at material surfaces. SSNMR has the potential to fill a particularly crucial gap in our knowledge by defining the secondary structure of proteins adsorbed onto material surfaces, determining protein dynamics at surfaces, and by providing high-resolution structural maps of protein-surface interactions. This award will allow the University of Washington to upgrade a 500 megahertz, 15 years old solid state NMR console. The new console will dramatically expand the biomaterials program at the university by enabling scientsists to perform NMR studies of biomaterials at high magnetic fields and at reduced temperatures. The NMR console will also be equipped with a refrigeration system for cooling samples to temperatures as low as 200K. The console will also be capable of performing SSNNM experiments at Larmor frequencies as high as 1,000 MHz. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award to the University of Washington is for the development of high fields solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (SSNMR) console for biomaterials research and student training.

The instrument will be used in student traing.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
