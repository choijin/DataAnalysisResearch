<AbstractNarration>This study investigates cognitive models of scientific inquiry skills in middle school science.  It creates pedagogical approaches that enable students to develop widely applicable cognitive skills needed for collaborative inquiry and reflective learning.  It would investigate a number of hypotheses concerning how to achieve these objectives.  The study expects to result in creating a learning theory that links metacognition and reflective practices to the development of expertise in scientific inquiry.    The central hypothesis is that scientific inquiry can be taught, or facilitated, through computer tools that support cognitive modeling and reflective practice.  The investigators would create a support environment that houses several software advisors that can give strategic advice and guide students as they conduct research projects in science and reflect on their processes of investigation.  Also, the investigators would create assessments of students' expertise and evaluate the use of these models increases their understanding and performance of scientific inquiry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
