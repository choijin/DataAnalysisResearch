<AbstractNarration>0001583&lt;br/&gt;Reilinger&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description: This award is to support a collaborative project by Dr. Robert Reilinger, Principal research Scientist, Department of Earth, Atmospheric &amp; Planetary Sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Cambridge, Massachusetts and Dr. Salah M. Mahmoud, Associate Professor, the National Research Institute of Astronomy and Geophysics (NRIAG) in Helwan, Egypt.  These scientists plan to study present-day motion of the Sinai block, NE Africa and the implications for the earthquake hazards in the region.  They plan to use Global Positioning System (GPS) to directly measure the motion of the Sinai block relative to Africa and Arabia.  Determining the ongoing motion of the Sinai block and how this motion is accommodated (i.e. location and active faults bounding the block) is fundamental to our understanding of the regional tectonics of North Africa and earthquake hazards in the heavily populated areas of greater Cairo and the Nile Delta.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scope: The US PI and the Egyptian teams have long experience in the study of the tectonics and seismicity of the eastern Mediterranean.  Dr. Reilinger is a principal researcher in a multinational effort involving several countries in the Middle East to monitor plate tectonics in the region.  This project is an extension of the MIT team's effort to install GPS stations in several countries in the Middle East.  The two institutions, MIT and NRIAG, have complementary facilities and capabilities needed for this research.  The project will involve a US postdoctoral researcher at MIT, providing that person with an international research experience.  This proposal meets the INT objective of supporting collaborative research in areas of mutual interest.  This project is being supported under the US-Egypt Joint Fund Program, which provides grants to scientists and engineers in both countries to carry out these cooperative activities. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
