<AbstractNarration>An International Conference, "Homogenization and Materials Science", in&lt;br/&gt;honor of the late Professor Ulrich Hornung of Bundeswehr University Munich,&lt;br/&gt;Germany, will take place at the University of Akron, Akron, Ohio, during&lt;br/&gt;September 15 - 17, 2000.  The purpose of this interdisciplinary conference&lt;br/&gt;is to bring together researchers from interacting areas of Materials&lt;br/&gt;Science.  In particular special focus will be paid to the latest scientific&lt;br/&gt;and industrial developments concerning homogenization theory and methods.&lt;br/&gt;Homogenization is a powerful mathematical tool for solving, both static (effective&lt;br/&gt;properties) and dynamic (wave propagation, transport equations) problems in&lt;br/&gt;inhomogeneous materials with periodic and random microstructure. This&lt;br/&gt;includes prediction of mechanical and dielectrical properties of&lt;br/&gt;composites, shape memory materials,  materials undergoing phase&lt;br/&gt;transitions, and polymeric composites. Solutions of these problems provide&lt;br/&gt;guidance in the design of new materials possessing the specific properties &lt;br/&gt;required by modern technological needs. The conference shall address both &lt;br/&gt;modeling and computational aspects of these problems. This conference will bring&lt;br/&gt;together the leading scientists from Europe and the U.S. who are working on&lt;br/&gt;homogenization problems and applications in materials science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Modern electronic and mechanical devices require materials with specific&lt;br/&gt;properties in their design.  For example, the automotive industry seeks&lt;br/&gt;lightweight yet very strong materials.  Such materials do not necessarily&lt;br/&gt;occur naturally.  Hence, these materials must be engineered from existing&lt;br/&gt;resources.  One approach is to form a composite material.  A composite&lt;br/&gt;material is made from a blend of other materials.  Fundamental questions in&lt;br/&gt;the design of composites are (1) what materials should be used to form the&lt;br/&gt;composite, (2) how much of each material should be used in the composite,&lt;br/&gt;and (3) how should the materials be combined to form the composite?  In the&lt;br/&gt;latter case the geometric patterns of the combined materials (think of&lt;br/&gt;plywood) play an important role.  Materials scientists and engineers try to&lt;br/&gt;answer the above keeping in mind the specific properties required from the&lt;br/&gt;resulting composite.  Practical experience and trial and error approaches&lt;br/&gt;are common means of obtaining answers.  Within the past two decades many&lt;br/&gt;new tools have been developed by the applied mathematics community to help&lt;br/&gt;answer these questions.  These tools fall under the heading of what is&lt;br/&gt;called homogenization theory.   One reason for holding this conference will&lt;br/&gt;be to highlight the use of these new tools.  A second purpose of the&lt;br/&gt;proposed conference will be to highlight the formulation and solution of&lt;br/&gt;new homogenization problems arising in materials design.  For example, one&lt;br/&gt;area that may further benefit from the utilization of homogenization tools&lt;br/&gt;is polymer-based composites.  Hence, the conference should help answer two&lt;br/&gt;questions: (1) what should be the future directions in homogenization&lt;br/&gt;theory based upon the current needs of modern technology (in short, which&lt;br/&gt;problems should be solved), and (2) what is the best way of utilizing newly&lt;br/&gt;developed mathematical tools to solve these problems in order to enhance&lt;br/&gt;the use of homogenization methods in materials design?  These questions&lt;br/&gt;will be answered through both speaker presentations and a panel discussion,&lt;br/&gt;which will summarize the current state of the subject and future trends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
