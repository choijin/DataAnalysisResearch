<AbstractNarration>The general concept of energy production and the various forms of energy are easy for most students to grasp.&lt;br/&gt;In fact, environmental groups have effectively worked with K-12 science programs to make today's children aware of and concerned about the environmental consequences of energy production in the U.S. and around the world.  Today's students have also been exposed to energy efficiency and conservation, and can relate to the fact that changes come with economic consequences. Therefore, various engineering concepts can be introduced to students at all levels using a forum that they can visualize, but more importantly, see the practical connection that is often needed for a student to fully comprehend a concept.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI proposes to integrate his research on thermodynamic and economic modeling into the classroom. The&lt;br/&gt;thermodynamic modeling proposed deviates from the traditional approach of maximizing energy efficiency by&lt;br/&gt;focusing on optimizing exergy losses and economic efficiency while minimizing the environmental impact.&lt;br/&gt;Results from the modeling are used to identify novel concepts and future research areas that will be required to overcome barrier issues that currently limit the optimization of the electric power industry. While the PI is a new PhD, his modeling efforts will draw on over 20 years of experience on advanced power systems accumulated while working for a contract research organization.</AbstractNarration>
