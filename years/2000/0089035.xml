<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Engineering - Mechanical (56)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is essential for the modern engineer to have a high degree of technological sophistication and computer literacy, and so learning commercial engineering analysis software packages has become a significant part of many engineering courses. Although the use of these commercial software packages may aid in teaching fundamental concepts to students, it can often have the opposite effect when valuable course time is taken up in teaching students the basics of using the software. The primary objective of this project is to put students in a position where they can quickly and easily learn necessary software, and then use that software to reinforce course concepts. This is being accomplished through the development of full-screen, audio-visual, interactive tutorials for software that is used extensively in four Mechanical Engineering courses, beginning with a freshman course (Engineering Graphics) and continuing in three upper-level courses (Measurements and Instrumentation, Kinematics and Dynamics of Machines, and Computer-Aided Engineering). In addition, a "Faculty Multimedia Tools Development Toolbox" is being assembled to facilitate development of software tutorials and interactive instructional tools by faculty in any discipline.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The Principal Investigator for this project previously developed interactive computer tutorials, games, and quizzes for a freshman Engineering Graphics course, which has been recognized and awarded regionally and nationally for excellence in instructional courseware. In the first year of the three-year grant, the Engineering Graphics materials are formatively evaluated, enhanced, and implemented at the University of Texas-Pan American (UTPA), and development begins on materials for the other three project courses. In the second year, the Engineering Graphics course is implemented and evaluated at other cooperating institutions-South Texas Community College (in McAllen, Texas), North Central Technical College (in Mansfield, Ohio), and the University of Nevada-Reno. UTPA is a minority institution, with a population that is 85% Hispanic. Implementing and assessing the materials at multiple institutions verifies that it is effective for diverse audiences. Furthermore, in the second year, the materials developed for the other three project courses are implemented and assessed at UTPA. In the third year, the materials developed in the first two years are published and tested at other institutions and the "Faculty Multimedia Tools Development Toolbox" is created. This "Toolbox", created out of the experience of the investigators in developing such tools for diverse courses and diverse audiences, allows faculty in other locations and other disciplines to create similar software tutorials and teaching aids for their own applications with minimum effort. The course materials and "Toolbox" will be published and distributed through a major publisher of academic materials.</AbstractNarration>
