<AbstractNarration>This program provides scholarships annually for two years to low-income undergraduates in computer science, computer technology, engineering, and engineering technology majors. The primary goal of the program is to increase the number of talented but financially disadvantaged residents of the region who achieve higher education degrees in computer science, computer technology, and engineering. This project focuses on the recruitment and retention of these students to degree achievement. The primary objectives include increased participation and retention of academically talented, low income students and underrepresented groups; increased grade point averages of students; enhanced professional development opportunities for students; and improved placement of participating students in baccalaureate transfer programs and related employment. The scholars participate in a wide range of retention-related activities utilizing an exemplary student services program. Scholars also have an opportunity to participate in an engineering and information technology summer institute which includes field trips to engineering and information technology industries in the region and to four- year schools with whom the institution has an articulation agreements in engineering and information technology majors. This project serves as a model for other community colleges in areas where high unemployment has forced entire regions to change their economic base.</AbstractNarration>
