<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project from Orbital Research Inc. will design and test an affordable, multiline refreshable Braille display system (RBDS) able to display computer screen information either from the hard drive or the Internet.  The proposed RBDS will combine state-of-the-art microelectromechanical (MEMS) actuators with cutting edge electronic assembly technology to assure ease in manufacturing and robustness.  Additionally, Orbital Research will implement a modular architecture that allows for unprecedented versatility through tailoring the Braille surface for various applications requested by the end users.  Traditionally, MEMS actuators are very small, cost efficient and low power.  However, traditional packaging of the MEMS devices results in a much larger and much more expensive component.  In Phase I of this project, Orbital Research as produced a MEMS actuator capable of producing Braille dots.  In this phase, Orbital Research will integrate a flexible assembly process to overcome the traditional complexities associated with packaging MEMS actuators.  Orbital Research will take full advantage of the features offered by cutting edge manufacturing processes such as MEMS, IC processing, flip-chip and surface mount technologies to assure the final proposed RBDS is light weight and small in size, cost affordable, robust, modula, enables tactile acuity, and is "user friendly."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The refreshable Braille Display system proffered by Orbital Research will enhance access to electronic information on the job or at home.  It will also provide for enhanced educational and employment opportunities for visually impaired individuals in line with the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act.  This device will create employment and research opportunities for the visually impaired, especially for those whose interests extend to mathematics, scientific, and technical fields that require frequent access to reference works in order to perform their tasks efficiently.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
