<AbstractNarration>This grant provides funding to develop the theoretical modeling as well as experimental research of the wiresaw technology.  Research issues and the implementation of the next-generation re-configurable wiresaw integrated with on-line and real-time metrology, such as the real-time monitoring of wire wear and wire web management, will be investigated.  Innovative modeling integrating the "rolling-indenting" mechanism, elasto-hydrodynamics, fracture mechanics, plasticity, vibration, and stiffness control will facilitate the integrated modeling of the wiresaw manufacturing process.  Such sound theoretical methodology is particularly important for the production of large wafers to avoid typical trial-and-error approaches at the expense of quality and consistency.  The research objectives include: (1) investigation of both theoretical and practical issues of the novel agile wiresaw, with integrated monitoring and metrology that can be adapted to slice different materials, sizes, configuration, and other characteristics; (2) development of in-situ, real-time sensors for monitoring of wire wear and on-line wire web management; (3) research of the next-generation shadow moire measurement of the whole wafer surface using the phase shifting technique to render high precision and resolution; and (4) design and application of smart MEMS transducers for the wiresaw machine.  The research also features collaboration between academic institution with industrial partners to strengthen the relevance of this research and application in industry. This collaborative research will make it possible to establish a superior technology for the next-generation wiresaw.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research will enable us to further the technology of wiresaw and to facilitate the advancement of semiconductor technology by providing high-quality and low-cost substrates in the fabrication of microelectronics, MEMS, and microsystems.  The wiresaw research results and applications of smart MEMS transducers can be utilized for the development of the next-generation, re-configurable, and smart wiresaw for wafer production; as well as optical metrology, such as shadow moire technique with phase shifting, to enhance the capability of both in-situ and post-process measurements and controls of wiresaw manufacturing process parameters and topology of wafer surfaces.  In addition, the breakthrough in fundamental research and technology advancement will feature a very promising enabling technology in the manufacturing of not only large diameter silicon wafers but also silicon carbide, lithium niobate, III-V and II-VI semiconductors, ceramic, and composite materials.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
