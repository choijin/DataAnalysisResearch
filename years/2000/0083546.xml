<AbstractNarration>Ongoing research examining the complex interactions among human and natural systems have demonstrated the need for more frequent and cohesive communication among social and natural sciences.  This Biocomplexity Incubation Activity award will support a project that consists of a series of workshops and other activities designed to integrate research on environmental change and its effects on biocomplexity being carried out by ecologists, who generally work on spatially explicit models of population dynamics, and social scientists, who tend to do research on the social, economic and institutional bases for human modification of environments.  The project will involve two workshops.  Each workshop will run for three to five days and will involve 30 to 45 participants; including roughly equal numbers of ecologists and social scientists.  The first workshop will center on the construction of preliminary models and the exploration of issues that have to be resolved in order to integrate the insights and working methods of ecology and social science.  Preliminary models will be developed and tested over the following year in a sequence of graduate seminars.  Web-based materials will be developed to maintain contact among the participants.  A substantial portion of the second workshop will be devoted to preparing proposals for further research on biocomplexity and biodiversity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ecologists and environmental social scientists have been addressing related issues although they have emphasized different research questions and have used dissimilar models and methods.  Despite their differences in research traditions, these two fields have reached a stage where intensive interactions in a series of workshops should be very fruitful.  Both groups have been heavily concerned with the destruction or transformation of habitat, a set of processes that probably pose the greatest threat to biodiversity.  Both groups have also addressed these processes in ways that make spatial processes explicit and important.  Among ecologists, space has become an extremely important component in the logic of theoretical models of ecological processes.  Among social scientists, spatial frameworks have become crucial as basis for gathering and organizing information about environmental change.  This project will use these common concerns with habitat destruction and spatially explicit modeling to develop a set of research projects that integrate the work of ecologists and environmental social scientists.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
