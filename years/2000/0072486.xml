<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0072486&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Robert M. Hardt&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project lies in the area of geometric variational calculus,&lt;br/&gt;treating the behavior of singularities and energy concentration&lt;br/&gt;for various optimal or stationary functions, fields, or geometric&lt;br/&gt;structures subject to geometric or analytic constraints. Specific&lt;br/&gt;investigations focus on the relation between energy and&lt;br/&gt;topological obstruction in mappings between manifolds,&lt;br/&gt;ferromagnetic and liquid crystal materials, improper slicing of&lt;br/&gt;polynomial varieties, compactness of currents in Carnot groups,&lt;br/&gt;and the regularity of relaxed energy minimizers. We will&lt;br/&gt;investigate the energy concentration along area-minimizing sets&lt;br/&gt;for limits of singularities of p-energy minimizing maps as p&lt;br/&gt;approaches a critical power.  In various higher dimensional&lt;br/&gt;cases, energy concentration of limits of smooth mappings may&lt;br/&gt;occur along sets of infinite measure and is related to&lt;br/&gt;homotopically nontrivial mappings of spheres. Singularities in&lt;br/&gt;ferromagnetic and liquid crystal materials will be also studied&lt;br/&gt;in both stationary and dynamic contexts. The theories of improper&lt;br/&gt;intersections of polynomial zero sets from algebraic geometry&lt;br/&gt;will be investigated to understand related behavior in analysis&lt;br/&gt;and partial differential equations. A theory of currents in&lt;br/&gt;Carnot groups will be studied with an eye on applications to&lt;br/&gt;variational problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Underlying many physical phenomena is a least-energy principle&lt;br/&gt;whereby certain configurations or fields or geometric shapes are&lt;br/&gt;distinguished by their property of having less energy or area&lt;br/&gt;than competing objects. The external constraints often lead to&lt;br/&gt;singularities, which are special points characterized by rapid&lt;br/&gt;changes of structure occurring in very small spatial regions. For&lt;br/&gt;example, one observes dislocation faults in solids under stress,&lt;br/&gt;domain walls in magnetized materials, vortices in superconducting&lt;br/&gt;materials, liquid edges and corners in soap films, and point,&lt;br/&gt;curve, and surface defects in various liquid crystal&lt;br/&gt;materials. We deal with new mathematical structures and theories&lt;br/&gt;necessary to explain and predict such phenomena.  In these&lt;br/&gt;problems, the theoretical studies of pure mathematics, the&lt;br/&gt;numerical computational studies of applied mathematics, and the&lt;br/&gt;phenomenological studies from physics all benefit each other and&lt;br/&gt;all have a crucial scientific role.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
