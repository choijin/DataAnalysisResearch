<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Guentner&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research comprises two distinct projects; the&lt;br/&gt;relationship between the Novikov and exactness conjectures for&lt;br/&gt;discrete groups, and the use of global analytic techniques to study&lt;br/&gt;quantum mechanical systems.  The first is motivated by the observation&lt;br/&gt;that the classes of groups for which the Novikov and exactness&lt;br/&gt;conjectures are known coincide to a large degree; both classes contain&lt;br/&gt;amenable groups, hyperbolic groups and Coxeter groups, for example.&lt;br/&gt;This project is joint with J. Kaminker.  The second is based on the&lt;br/&gt;idea that the Berezin-Toeplitz quantization can be analyzed using&lt;br/&gt;spectral properties of family of Dirac-type operators.  This project&lt;br/&gt;is joint with J. Trout.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Novikov conjecture, one of the most important problems in&lt;br/&gt;topology, has stimulated a tremendous amount of mathematical research&lt;br/&gt;over the last thirty years.  The exactness conjecture is purely&lt;br/&gt;analytic.  That there could exist a connection between these two&lt;br/&gt;conjectures from entirely different branches of mathematics is&lt;br/&gt;somewhat surprising, but nevertheless is supported by empirical&lt;br/&gt;evidence.  We plan to develop more fully the relationship between&lt;br/&gt;these conjectures.  This research has bearing on a number of important&lt;br/&gt;outstanding problems including the Baum-Connes Conjecture.  At the&lt;br/&gt;heart of the connection between mathematics and physics is the theory&lt;br/&gt;of quantum mechanics.  We propose a new method to analyze quantum&lt;br/&gt;mechanical systems based on geometric properties of certain systems of&lt;br/&gt;differential equations.  This work should lead to a better&lt;br/&gt;understanding of a number of quantum mechanical systems from&lt;br/&gt;mathematical physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
