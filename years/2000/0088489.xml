<AbstractNarration>Engineering - Electrical (55)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the last decade, the semiconductor industry has significantly increased its demand&lt;br/&gt;for engineering talent, yet the supply of recent graduates with relevant experience has declined, especially in the areas of analog and mixed-signal integrated circuit design. This project addresses the problem by measurably increasing the number of undergraduates with direct experience in integrated circuit design, specifically in the areas of (i) digital, analog and mixed-signal circuit design, (ii) layout and fabrication techniques, and (iii) design for test. Key topics from graduate-level VLSI curricula are being adapted to form a new curriculum targeted towards undergraduates. Course notes and laboratory manuals from VLSI courses offered by Iowa State University and the University of Tennessee at Knoxville serve as the primary source material.&lt;br/&gt;The two-course elective sequence focuses on digital and mixed-signal design at the circuit and layout levels. Laboratory experiences reinforce the course material, and encourage students to use commercial-grade CAD tools such as Cadence to implement and simulate designs, and to gain experience with mixed-signal test instruments including mixed-signal oscilloscopes and arbitrary waveform generators. VLSI chips designed by students are fabricated by the MOSIS service and tested in the laboratory. It is anticipated that 30% of each graduating class of Rose-Hulman electrical and computer engineering students will participate in the program. Course notes, lab manuals, and example design projects resulting from the curriculum development work will be disseminated via an Internet web server.</AbstractNarration>
