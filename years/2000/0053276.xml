<AbstractNarration>PROJECT SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is a collaboration among Rockford's public middle and high &lt;br/&gt;schools, NIU's Colleges of Engineering and Engineering Technology and Liberal Arts and Sciences, Rock Valley Community College, and local businesses and industries. It builds on the success of a pilot study &lt;br/&gt;undertaken in five Rockford high schools. The goal is to improve math, science, technology and English education for all students in grades 7-12 in the Rockford School system, but with a special emphasis on the needs of those who do not traditionally take higher level science, mathematics and technology classes, including minorities, females, and a range of average students. A multi-disciplined project staff will work with teams of teachers from all middle and high schools in the district. During the first year, the project will train teachers in interdisciplinary problem- and project-based learning; integrated curricula; new assessment procedures, including improved traditional strategies and procedures and non-traditional (authentic) ones; national and state standards; and a broader variety and repertoire of teaching techniques. During the second and third years, the project staff will act as mentors and coaches, providing in-classroom support for teachers as they fieldtest new methods, techniques and procedures in the classroom. Teachers will also be taught how to network constructively across disciplines and the operational design of the project will ensure that all teachers from all schools hear the same message, thereby eliminating confusion. This project will be the key implementation element in Rockford's education reform initiative and will form the basis for a fundamental and ongoing change in teaching philosophy and methods. It is designed to motivate and inspire students by helping them to acquire the necessary skills to solve real-world science, math and technology problems and to feel connected to their community. In addition to improving the teaching and learning environment one tangible product of this project willbe the design and production of multidisciplinary curriculum modules that can be used throughout the district and beyond.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
