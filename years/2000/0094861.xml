<AbstractNarration>The fundamental objective of this project is enabling talented but financially disadvantaged students pursuing careers in computer science, mathematics and engineering (CSEM) to achieve higher education degrees. Our objectives include 1) increasing the number of math, engineering, and computer science scholarships available to individuals who are underrepresented in these fields; 2) increasing the awareness of the variety of job opportunities available for advanced degree graduates; 3) facilitating a mentoring relationship between the scholar and a person already working in their chosen field; and 4) encouraging scholars to gain leadership experience by acting as peer mentors. The primary participants are 40 CSEMS students each year for two years who receive scholarships based on financial need and academic excellence. Targeted recruiting efforts as well as a myriad of student support services and advanced pedagogical practices including clubs and organizations, application oriented experiences for students, a project-based Capstone course, and internship/field experiences, and an active-learning curriculum result in improved recruitment and retention rates of CSEMS student. A strong Tech Prep partnership program allows student to enter this program in the 11th grade and transition seamlessly to the associates degree program. Students are encouraged to transfer to 4-year institutions to complete a bachelor degree in their chosen discipline.</AbstractNarration>
