<AbstractNarration>     The widespread need and ability to connect machines across the Internet, in a world where intelligent objects rather than documents are exchanged, has caused the network to be more vulnerable to intrusions and has facilitated break-ins of a variety of types. Most of the methods currently available to deal with network&lt;br/&gt;vulnerability to abuse and attacks are either inadequate, inefficient oroverly restrictive. Compounding the&lt;br/&gt;problem is the need to maintain an acceptable level of quality of service (QoS).&lt;br/&gt;     The proposed research project considers a heterogeneous network environment where servers, which&lt;br/&gt;provide different levels of QoS support to clients through a contract protocol, are prone to faults and denial&lt;br/&gt;of service attacks. The research project assumes the existence of intrusion detection mechanisms, and aims&lt;br/&gt;at investigating new and potentially revolutionary approaches for the development of scalable and efficient&lt;br/&gt;service deployment strategies and network resource management schemes to maintain acceptable levels of&lt;br/&gt;QoS and security, despite faults. Two types of faults, namely, benign malfunctions and malicious intrusions,&lt;br/&gt;will be considered. The former can be caused by a faulty, yet legitimate client that accidentally loses control&lt;br/&gt;over its behavior, while the latter occurs with the intent to cause damage, such asDenial of Service (DoS).&lt;br/&gt;Both types of faults can severely affect the performance of the network and compromise the integrity and&lt;br/&gt;security of its services.&lt;br/&gt;    These faults can manifest themselves in the form of a protocol breach or a contract violation. The former&lt;br/&gt;is exemplified by an authorized clients (impersonation may take place) who attempt to deliberately breach&lt;br/&gt;the contract protocol and impact the behavior of the server to eventually cause its failure. Contract violation&lt;br/&gt;occurs when a client attempts to acquire a level of service beyond what has been agreed upon in the service&lt;br/&gt;contract. In order to protect the servers and the network, we propose two new techniques: fault avoidance,&lt;br/&gt;based on the concept of replicated elusive servers, and fault tolerance, based on resource management schemes through the creation of a Virtually Isolated Network (VIN).&lt;br/&gt;     The concept of replicated elusive servers espouses ideas such as roaming addresses and frequent frequency&lt;br/&gt;changes in wireless networks. Replication is coordinated through group communication supported by an&lt;br/&gt;underlying multicast mechanism. VINs, on the other hand, provide the basis to achieve both physical and&lt;br/&gt;logical separation (in space and time) of the resources reserved for each service, client, or class of clients.&lt;br/&gt;     Efficient management of network resources is achieved based on an integrative approach which considers&lt;br/&gt;network performance, fault tolerance and security asintegral components of a multi-dimensional QoS space.&lt;br/&gt;QoS support can then be perceived as a multi-layered optimization process which considers security, fault-&lt;br/&gt;tolerance, resource allocation, communication protocol optimization and user level application management&lt;br/&gt;as inhabitants of the same QoS spectrum and seeks to exploit tradeoffs in order to reach anoptimal operating&lt;br/&gt;point. The techniques developed will be designed to handle multiple coordinated intrusions, clustered in&lt;br/&gt;both space and time. A coordinated/clustered fault model will be developed and a study of its effect on the&lt;br/&gt;developed techniques and algorithms will be conducted.&lt;br/&gt;     The proposed research will build on a foundation of prior work developed by the PIs which have a&lt;br/&gt;strong track record of success in a wide range of research topics related to fault-tolerance, operating system&lt;br/&gt;development and resource management for QoS support in wired and wireless networks. It is anticipated&lt;br/&gt;that through algorithms development and analysis, simulation and testbed implementations, the results of&lt;br/&gt;this project will lead to a better understanding of how to provide efficient support to QoS performance,&lt;br/&gt;fault-tolerance and securityin an integrated manner, both in wired and wireless environments. An equally&lt;br/&gt;important contribution of this project will be the training of high quality students in a field where expertise&lt;br/&gt;is scarce.</AbstractNarration>
