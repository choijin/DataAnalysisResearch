<AbstractNarration>0076501&lt;br/&gt;Jacobson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an instrument acquisition award to upgrade a user facility and provide a new capability at the University of Houston and at Rice University. With this new capability, variations in the chemistry and the composition of materials can be detected, even if these changes occur within less than one nanometer within the material. The key to the new technique is the ability to form very small electron probe (less than 0.2 nanometer in diameter) and the ability to precisely position and control the probe. Electrons transmitted through the material contain information about the chemistry of the material at the location of the electron probe. This new capability allows researchers to analyze these electrons. These electrons can also be used to generate a "compositional" image of the material, in addition to the "structural" image. It is anticipated that the close collaboration between the users at the University of Houston and at Rice University initiated with this proposal will lead to transfer of knowledge in modern electron microscopy techniques benefiting the education of undergraduate and graduate students. Educational opportunities will be provided as formal courses in electron microscopy including a laboratory component and through multi-user materials characterization facility (MCF) research experience programs. MCF is also an important component in this educational outreach programs designed to increases K12 student interest and achievement in science and provide opportunities for the development of teachers.  &lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;This is an instrument acquisition award to upgrade a user facility and provide a new capability at the University of Houston and at Rice University.
