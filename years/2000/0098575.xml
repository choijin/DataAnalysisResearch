<AbstractNarration>The annual IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, sponsored by the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society, has become the largest annual conference in robotics and automation worldwide, and serves as a key forum where international researchers gather to exchange ideas on emerging technologies as well as technical problems and their solutions.  It is important that the U.S. be well-represented at each of these conferences, which unfortunately are often held in places to which it is difficult for some of our best researchers to travel due to the cost involved.  The purpose of this funding is to bolster U.S. participation at ICRA'01 by helping U.S. researchers who could not otherwise afford to attend the conference.   The availability of NSF travel assistance will be announced in the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society Magazine as well as on the web site of ICRA'01.   A 4-member selection committee will be formed by the conference organizers to screen applicants according to a set of criteria, such as:  the applicant's technical area of interest;  the expected impact of conference participation on the applicant's professional development;  the opportunities for planned visits, talks, and interactions by the applicant before, during, and/or after the conference;  and any other sources of funding available to the applicant to help defray the cost of attending.  With this funding we hope to have a strong U.S. presence at ICRA'2001.</AbstractNarration>
