<AbstractNarration>Professor Vladimir Bulovic recently demonstrated a new general method for tuning the&lt;br/&gt;energy level structure of organic materials by adjusting the strength of the local electric&lt;br/&gt;field inside the organic films with intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions. His group&lt;br/&gt;will now apply this "solid state solvation" (SSS) effect to demonstrate practical, efficient&lt;br/&gt;organic optoelectonic devices such as organic LEDs, lasers, and solar cells, and develop a&lt;br/&gt;theoretical understanding of this phenomenon. The SSS effect is present in every&lt;br/&gt;molecular organic solid, but is most clearly observed in strongly polar materials and&lt;br/&gt;composites. It originates from dipole-dipole interactions between neighboring molecules&lt;br/&gt;that generate strong local electric fields, stretching the intramolecular bond lengths and&lt;br/&gt;deforming charge distributions on molecules. This physical change in the molecular&lt;br/&gt;structure is manifested in the modified energy level structure for the molecule, which we&lt;br/&gt;can utilize to optimize performance of organic optoelectronic devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prof. Bulovic previously demonstrated that local electric fields generated in dipole-dipole&lt;br/&gt;interactions between polar organic molecules in a solid thin film can result in a shift of&lt;br/&gt;molecular energy levels by more than 0.25 eV, tuning the luminescence of the same&lt;br/&gt;molecular species from yellow to orange to red. In this program his group will extend the&lt;br/&gt;initial studies and utilize dipole-dipole interactions to tune the carrier injection properties&lt;br/&gt;at organic heterojunction interfaces, modify exciton energy transfer rates from the host to&lt;br/&gt;the dopant in mixed organic layers, and access triplet energy levels in efficient&lt;br/&gt;phosphorescent organic materials. These effects will be optimized to improve&lt;br/&gt;luminescence efficiencies of organic LEDs, lower lasing thresholds of organic lasers, and&lt;br/&gt;increase photogeneration efficiency of organic solar cells. The theoretical framework&lt;br/&gt;quantifying intermolecular interactions in molecular organic thin films is not presently&lt;br/&gt;known and will be developed within this program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Findings discovered in the course of this program are fundamental in nature and will have&lt;br/&gt;a strong impact on practical applications of molecular organic solids in optoelectronic&lt;br/&gt;devices. They will enhance the understanding and the applicability of the vast field of&lt;br/&gt;molecular organic materials, influencing treatment of organic thin films, heterojunctions,&lt;br/&gt;multilayers, quantum wells, and nano-patterned organic materials. These findings will be&lt;br/&gt;incorporated in the graduate "Seminar on Organic Optoelectronics" that Prof. Vulovic is&lt;br/&gt;presently preparing for the MIT graduate curriculum.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
