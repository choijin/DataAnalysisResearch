<AbstractNarration>The advance of high-speed deep-submicron VLSI technology requires chip&lt;br/&gt;interconnect and packaging to be modeled by distributed circuits. Such a&lt;br/&gt;detailed modeling level eventually results in large scale linear circuits to&lt;br/&gt;be analyzed. Thus, the research objective is to develop new circuit order&lt;br/&gt;reduction approach to evaluate the circuit performance and characteristics&lt;br/&gt;in a reasonable time period and with a guaranteed performance, as required&lt;br/&gt;by real design practice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on the following tasks:&lt;br/&gt;a) Develop new order reduction approaches that provide guaranteed performance;&lt;br/&gt;b) Derive correspondingly high efficiency numerical methods;&lt;br/&gt;c) Investigate the methods of maintaining preferred characteristics in the&lt;br/&gt;reduced order system as well as related implementation issues;&lt;br/&gt;d) Investigate wavelet method application in model order reduction and&lt;br/&gt;analysis; and&lt;br/&gt;e) Contribute to graduate education at UT- Dallas and UNC-Charlotte.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The expected research results will provide efficient and performance&lt;br/&gt;guaranteed methods for order reduction and analysis of VLSI interconnect&lt;br/&gt;circuits, and their corresponding algorithms and software for simulation&lt;br/&gt;test.  It will also contribute to engineering and science aspects by the&lt;br/&gt;expected research results and software, as well as to graduate education.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
