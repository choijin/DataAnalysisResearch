<AbstractNarration>The goal of the proposed research is to develop a comprehensive &lt;br/&gt;understanding of the spatial aspect of distributed computing in &lt;br/&gt;mobile systems. Traditionally, events in a distributed computation &lt;br/&gt;are ordered by time. Scalar and vector clocks are used to represent &lt;br/&gt;logical time and causal dependencies. However, the mobility of nodes &lt;br/&gt;injects a new spatial dimension into the problem. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The physical and network distances between nodes in a mobile&lt;br/&gt;network are not correlated. Moreover, some wireless links in a mobile &lt;br/&gt;network may be unidirectional. Hence, unlike physical distance, the &lt;br/&gt;network distance between nodes is not a symmetric relation. Finally, &lt;br/&gt;if requests of two mobile nodes are being prioritized on the basis of &lt;br/&gt;their respective distances from a third (resource) node, their relative &lt;br/&gt;priority can change with time. This is in contrast to the immutable &lt;br/&gt;relative ordering of events based on time. Hence, if distance is one of &lt;br/&gt;the criteria for ordering requests, existing solutions for problems &lt;br/&gt;like mutual exclusion (using logical clocks) cannot be efficiently used &lt;br/&gt;for resource allocation in mobile computing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We will develop a new formal representation of the spatial-temporal&lt;br/&gt;relationship between events in mobile computing. Space-time vectors are &lt;br/&gt;a step in this direction. A theory for a possibly immutable ordering &lt;br/&gt;of events based on their spatial-temporal coordinates will be developed. &lt;br/&gt;Such an ordering of requests could be used for resource deadlock free, &lt;br/&gt;starvation free and fair resource management. New protocols will be &lt;br/&gt;developed at the MAC sub-layer enabling nodes to communicate using &lt;br/&gt;unidirectional wireless links. We will develop new routing protocols that &lt;br/&gt;utilize this MAC sub-layer protocol, and can correctly route packets&lt;br/&gt;in a wireless mobile network with a combination of unidirectional and&lt;br/&gt;bidirectional links.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Subsequently, the performance of these solutions will be evaluated&lt;br/&gt;through simulation experiments and prototyping. Graduate and undergraduate &lt;br/&gt;students will actively participate in every stage of the project. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
