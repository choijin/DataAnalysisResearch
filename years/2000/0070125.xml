<AbstractNarration>1.3-mm vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) is an enabling device for future optical 10Gbit Ethernet and local area network. In the present proposal, we propose a novel approach to make 1.3 mm VCSELs on GaAs substrates with a single step epitaxial growth. The basic idea is to use an InxGa1-xAs/GaPyAszSb1-y-z/InxGa1-xAs type-II quantum well (QW) structure as the active region. Our preliminary theoretical and experimental studies of the proposed type-II QW structure have shown that the idea is feasible. A detailed theoretical model has been used to calculate the transition energies, overlaps between electron and hole wavefunctions, and gain spectra for the type-II QW structures. The results show that a gain of 8000 cm-1 can be reached under an electric injection of 10.1018 cm-3. Based on the theoretical design, several test samples for photoluminescence and LED structures have been grown by a specially configured molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) machine.   TEM images clearly show well-defined QW structures.  Strong room temperature photoluminescence from the QW samples and electroluminescence from the LEDs have been clearly observed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the present proposed program, we will focus on three major tasks: 1) Further detailed theoretical modeling of gain spectra and optimized device structures of different variation of the proposed InGaAs/GaPAsSb type-II QWs; 2) MBE growth and materials characterization of the new QW structures to understand various growth related issues and find the optimized growth conditions for the VCSELs; 3) Detailed physics study of the carrier life time and optical properties of the InGaAs/GaPAsSb type-II QWs using low temperature cw and time resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy; 4) Device demonstration of cw VCSELs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the proposed program, 2 PhD students will be supported.  There will be also several undergraduate students to be involved in part of the program through their senior design projects. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
