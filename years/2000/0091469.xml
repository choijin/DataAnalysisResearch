<AbstractNarration>The Computer Science and Engineering Technology (CSET) Scholars program is providing scholarships in computer science and engineering technologies, with special consideration to underrepresented groups (women and minorities) from the community's federally designated enterprise community and state designated enterprise zone. Participants are pursuing associate of applied science degrees in webmastering, e- commerce, computer programming, computer networking, computer maintenance, digital media design, electrical and computerized control systems, robotics, laser electro- optics, chemical technology, semiconductor manufacturing, biomedical equipment, medical imaging, facilities maintenance engineering, drafting and design, manufacturing engineering, machine shop operations, and other applied engineering programs. Program objectives are recruitment of qualified students, implementation of support systems to aid in retaining students once enrolled, course instruction, and job placement upon graduation. A support system provides mentoring and tutoring services to CSET Scholars, with additional support as required provided by the Deaf and Disabled Student Services Office and the Women's Resource Center. Participants meet biweekly with a small advisory committee comprised of representatives of these campus support offices, with each meeting designed to address unmet needs and troubleshoot problems which may be preventing the CSET Scholar from achieving success in his or her area of study. Job placement at the program's conclusion is being facilitated through the major course of study, as each department has an industrial advisory committee and other liaisons with industry which assist with graduate employment. Evaluation of program success is based on grade point average, attendance, completion rates, survey responses, and graduation placement.</AbstractNarration>
