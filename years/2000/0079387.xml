<AbstractNarration>This award will add an 800 MHz NMR spectrometer to the National Magnetic Resonance Facility at Madison (NMRFAM), a shared instrumentation facility. The presence of  this instrument will enable researchers to solve new problems and to achieve definitive answers to scientific questions about biomolecular  structure-function relationships. The spectrometer will be devoted to experiments that require its uniquely-high field strength: studies of  larger molecules, investigations of field-dependent molecular ordering effects, studies of the field dependence of chemical exchange and  relaxation phenomena, and functional studies of proteins, nucleic acids, and other biomolecules that require exceptional resolution and/or sensitivity. The instrument will be used by a core group of about 40  principal investigators from all around the country, who work on a variety  of problems. The improved resolution and sensitivity of the proposed  spectrometer will ease the limitation of low solubility, lower the time requirements (and molecular stability requirements) for biomolecular data collection, and increase the accuracy of NMR measurements. The increased  sensitivity of the instrument, coupled with new data acquisition protocols (such as TROSY-based pulse sequences), promise to roll back the molecular weight limit for structure-function investigations and improve the feasibility of solution structures of membrane proteins and functional RNA molecules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 800 MHz NMR spectrometer will serve as a focal point for hands-on training in biomolecular NMR spectroscopy. On average, the National Magnetic Resonance Facility at Madison trains about 30 new users each year. These generally are graduate students and postdoctoral research associates.  The facility regularly hosts visiting scientists who come for periods of one week to one year to receive training in biomolecular NMR spectroscopy. Training is primarily by hands-on activities supervised by the staff of the facility.  All new internal and external users are required to receive orientation and training, which is tailored to their previous experience. The large number of users of the facility and the many maintenance tasks required lead to unique training opportunities. Staff members also train graduate students and advanced undergraduates to assist in the performance of routine maintenance and testing of the spectrometers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
