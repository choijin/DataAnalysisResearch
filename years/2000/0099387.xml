<AbstractNarration>This award is to support the research activities of two professors,&lt;br/&gt;their graduate students and a Senior Research Associate at Kent State&lt;br/&gt;University in the area of experimental medium-energy nuclear physics. &lt;br/&gt;The general objectives are the study of the structure of the nucleon&lt;br/&gt;(neutron or proton) and the nature of the nuclear force.  This group is&lt;br/&gt;involved in experiments being performed, or to be performed at the&lt;br/&gt;Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (Jlab) in Virginia and at the&lt;br/&gt;Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC) on Long Island, New York.  An&lt;br/&gt;experiment is in progress at Jlab to determine the charge distribution&lt;br/&gt;inside the neutron.  The neutron, while neutral overall, is known to&lt;br/&gt;consist of objects with both positive and negative charges.  These&lt;br/&gt;objects are called "quarks".  The quarks are held together by the&lt;br/&gt;exchange of particles called "gluons".  Exactly how the quarks combine,&lt;br/&gt;move, and interact inside the neutron is not known.  A precise&lt;br/&gt;measurement of the charge distribution, called the Electric Form Factor,&lt;br/&gt;will provide one of the most sensitive tests available of various models&lt;br/&gt;of the neutron structure.  These measurements are only recently possible&lt;br/&gt;and require the electron beam characteristics now available at Jlab and&lt;br/&gt;involve the use of a large-volume neutron polarimeter developed by this&lt;br/&gt;group in experiments performed during the last decade at other&lt;br/&gt;accelerator facilities.  The development, installation, calibration, and&lt;br/&gt;operation of the polarimeter represents the unique contribution of this&lt;br/&gt;group to this important experiment.  This group plans also to perform&lt;br/&gt;another experiment at Jlab to study short-range correlation between&lt;br/&gt;nucleons inside nuclei.  Such short-range correlations are known to&lt;br/&gt;exist, but the exact nature and strength of such correlations are only&lt;br/&gt;poorly determined.  This group will bring its expertise with neutron&lt;br/&gt;detectors to help study such correlations involving neutrons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This group has recently joined an effort planned to study interactions&lt;br/&gt;between colliding beams of polarized protons using the "STAR" detector&lt;br/&gt;at RHIC (STAR stands for Solenoidal Tracker at RHIC).  The object of&lt;br/&gt;this study is to determine the exact origin of the intrinsic angular&lt;br/&gt;momentum, or spin, of the proton.  The spin, like the charge&lt;br/&gt;distribution, arises from the existence, interactions and movements of&lt;br/&gt;the constituents of the proton, generally believed to be the quarks and&lt;br/&gt;gluons.  To date, only the contributions from the quarks has been&lt;br/&gt;determined;  this project offers the possibility of determining the&lt;br/&gt;contribution to the spin of the proton due to gluons.  In order to&lt;br/&gt;measure these contributions, it is necessary to observe hadronic jets&lt;br/&gt;produced at relatively small angles in the collisions.  This group,&lt;br/&gt;together with a collaboration of other researchers from Indiana&lt;br/&gt;University, Argonne National Laboratory, and others, will construct a&lt;br/&gt;new "end-cap calorimeter" to be installed at one end of the present STAR&lt;br/&gt;detector at RHIC.  It will be this group's responsibility to provide&lt;br/&gt;characterizations and calibrations of the multi-anode photomultiplier&lt;br/&gt;tubes used for particle detection in this new calorimeter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
