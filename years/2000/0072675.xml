<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0072675&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Daniel S. Freed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The geometry group at the University of Texas proposes to carry&lt;br/&gt;out a variety of research projects, most of which are related to&lt;br/&gt;physics.  Dan Freed's current research focuses on questions in&lt;br/&gt;geometry and topology arising from string theory.  These include&lt;br/&gt;the construction of determinant line bundles on manifolds with&lt;br/&gt;boundary and the understanding of anomalies of actions which&lt;br/&gt;arise in quantizing lagrangian field theories.  Karen Uhlenbeck's&lt;br/&gt;current research involves the geometric theory of integrable&lt;br/&gt;systems, as well as a non-linear Schroedinger equation arising in&lt;br/&gt;macroscopic theories of a ferro-magnetic continuum. These two&lt;br/&gt;researchers are starting a project aimed at understanding the&lt;br/&gt;appearance of integrable systems in conformal field theories.&lt;br/&gt;Bob Williams is applying his expertise on attractors to the&lt;br/&gt;construction of tiling spaces.  Constantin Teleman is pursuing&lt;br/&gt;several projects in the cohomology of infinite dimensional Lie&lt;br/&gt;Algebras. He and his coworkers are making progress on the&lt;br/&gt;MacDonald conjectures, and are also giving geometric&lt;br/&gt;interpretations in terms of the Hodge cohomology of flag&lt;br/&gt;varieties of loop groups.  He is also interested in homotopy&lt;br/&gt;equivalences between holomorphic and continuous mapping&lt;br/&gt;spaces. Postdoctoral members of the group are Nurit Krausz, who&lt;br/&gt;is working on direct computations for quantum field theory in&lt;br/&gt;Minkowski space, and Adrian Vajiac who uses equivariant&lt;br/&gt;localization techniques to study topological quantum field&lt;br/&gt;theories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At this point in time, geometry is a rapidly developing area of&lt;br/&gt;mathematics.  While research in geometry, like most of pure&lt;br/&gt;mathematics, consists of the construction and development of&lt;br/&gt;abstract concepts, the origins and ultimate applications for&lt;br/&gt;these constructions are invariably examples and applications in&lt;br/&gt;more applied fields. The influence of theoretical physics on&lt;br/&gt;geometry is strong.  For example, large numbers of geometers are&lt;br/&gt;currently working on questions related to quantum groups, mirror&lt;br/&gt;symmetry and quantum cohomology. Our group attempts not to work&lt;br/&gt;on problems which have already been identified by mathematicians&lt;br/&gt;as central, but in contrast we look at current ideas in physics&lt;br/&gt;of all sorts and then find, clarify, and work on the&lt;br/&gt;mathematically interesting questions more directly.  Dan Freed's&lt;br/&gt;work on string theory connects the physics ideas of quantization&lt;br/&gt;with the mathematical subject of algebraic topology.  His joint&lt;br/&gt;project with Karen Uhlenbeck on the appearance of integrable&lt;br/&gt;systems in certain quantum field theories requires an&lt;br/&gt;understanding of field theory, integrable systems, and the very&lt;br/&gt;important and basic ideas of symmetry.  Constantin Teleman's work&lt;br/&gt;deeply involves fundamental ideas of symmetry, as well as delving&lt;br/&gt;into the question of how closely very messy functions can be&lt;br/&gt;approximated qualitatively by polynomial-like objects. Some of&lt;br/&gt;the geometric ideas come from other branches of physics, such as&lt;br/&gt;the ferro-magnetic equations studied by Uhlenbeck.  The tiling&lt;br/&gt;spaces of William's come from beautiful examples such as those&lt;br/&gt;constructed by Roger Penrose.  Our efforts bring new ideas and&lt;br/&gt;techniques into mathematics, rather than concentrating on&lt;br/&gt;projects which are already popular.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
