<AbstractNarration>AST 0098438&lt;br/&gt;Wilcots&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Irregular galaxies are the most common types of galaxy in the Universe and of all the facets of their evolution, none is more important than the influence of the most massive stars.  Through exceptionally strong winds and subsequent explosions as supernovae, massive stars deposit tremendous amounts of energy into their environments, triggering the formation of new generations of stars, dispersing newly formed chemical elements, and driving the evolution of the host galaxy.  This project focuses on this dynamic and often violent relationship between massive stars and their environments. Using a combination of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory's Very Large Array and the new fiber-optic technology on the WIYN (Wisconsin-Indiana-Yale-National Observatories) optical telescope, the participants will measure the impact of stars on their environment and measure the ability of an individual galaxy to mitigate the effects of these massive stars.  This systematic investigation will unravel the mysteries of how irregular galaxies have evolved over time, and how they continue to evolve today. &lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
