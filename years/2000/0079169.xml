<AbstractNarration>This award to Professor Andrew Bocarsly of Princeton University is a renewal of an earlier award and is supported by the Advanced Materials and Processing Program in the Chemistry Division.  The focus of the award will be to develop the chemistry of cyanogels based on multi-metal cyanides prepared by sol-gel processing.  Systemic development of cyanogel chemistry, their characterization for catalysis, and low temperature processing of them in ceramics, semiconductors and coatings for electrodes will be part of this award.  Studies with cyanogel to absorb and preconcentrate carbon dioxide and finally to reduce to methanol will be carried out under this award.  Also, multimetal cyanogel will be evaluated as electrocatalysts at low temperatures for combinatorial chemistry.  Teaching and training of students in materials science at all levels from high school to graduate school including teachers from high school are parts of the award. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cyanogels prepared from multi-metal cyanides by sol-gel processing will be characterized for functional properties and for applications in catalysis, and for the preparation of ceramics, semiconductors and coatings for electrodes. Use of cyanogels for the absorption and preconcentration of carbon dioxide and its reduction of methanol, will have a lasting improvement in the environment in general, and in the energy sector in particular. In addition, the research program will provide a rich multidisciplinary education and training opportunity in materials chemistry to postdoctoral and graduate students, and students and teachers from high schools.</AbstractNarration>
