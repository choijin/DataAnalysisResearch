    <AbstractNarration>Li&lt;br/&gt;0078250&lt;br/&gt; The investigator develops mathematical models to investigate&lt;br/&gt;several important epidemiological and ecological factors for the&lt;br/&gt;emergence, re-emergence and persistence of infectious diseases.&lt;br/&gt;The project has three goals: (1) to develop a new mathematical&lt;br/&gt;framework in epidemiological modeling that links the human&lt;br/&gt;population to its environment, (2) to introduce and develop a new&lt;br/&gt;mathematical approach to the analysis of epidemic models, (3) to&lt;br/&gt;stimulate mathematical development of more effective analytical&lt;br/&gt;and numerical tools for resolving important computational issues&lt;br/&gt;arising from the model analysis. The work is carried out along&lt;br/&gt;two main themes: Theme I. Develop a mathematical framework in&lt;br/&gt;epidemiological modeling using network models that takes into&lt;br/&gt;account the full cycle of a disease in nature and encompasses&lt;br/&gt;three interconnected key elements: human hosts, intermediate&lt;br/&gt;hosts and disease vectors, and environment. Theme II. Develop an&lt;br/&gt;approach to the analysis of epidemic models using the method of&lt;br/&gt;singular perturbation to further our understanding of several key&lt;br/&gt;biological issues such as robust mechanisms for cyclic temporal&lt;br/&gt;patterns in disease incidence and the short-term evolution of&lt;br/&gt;disease pathogenicity. Computational issues arising from the&lt;br/&gt;large scale systems in network models and from the multiple time&lt;br/&gt;scales that are inherent in disease transmission processes are&lt;br/&gt;also investigated.&lt;br/&gt; The global spread of infectious diseases and the emergence&lt;br/&gt;of drug-resistant disease agents are causes for alarm at the end&lt;br/&gt;of the 20th century. As the world population continues to&lt;br/&gt;explode, the world economies continue to become globalized,&lt;br/&gt;individual interactions and international travel continues to&lt;br/&gt;increase, and the environment around the globe continues to be&lt;br/&gt;devastated, the effective control and prevention of the global&lt;br/&gt;spread of infectious diseases is destined to be one of the grand&lt;br/&gt;challenges facing mankind in the new millennium. Essential to our&lt;br/&gt;success in meeting this challenge is a renewed effort in&lt;br/&gt;epidemiological studies, a better understanding of the&lt;br/&gt;transmission and spread mechanisms of various diseases, and more&lt;br/&gt;effective disease control and prevention measures based on these&lt;br/&gt;studies and the new understanding. While the nature and scale of&lt;br/&gt;the problems at hand inevitably limit the effectiveness of&lt;br/&gt;experimental approaches, mathematical modeling has proven to be a&lt;br/&gt;valuable approach and an indispensable tool for understanding the&lt;br/&gt;problems, for testing hypotheses, and for predicting effective&lt;br/&gt;measures of control and prevention. It is expected that results&lt;br/&gt;from the project can advance our understanding of the basic&lt;br/&gt;ecological and epidemiological mechanisms for the emergence,&lt;br/&gt;re-emergence and persistence of infectious diseases and their&lt;br/&gt;associated temporal patterns, and improve the present theoretical&lt;br/&gt;basis for effective disease control and prevention strategies.</AbstractNarration>
