<AbstractNarration>This project, strengthening the microelectronics program in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department (ECE), proposes to establish an electrical characterization and test laboratory which will provide the capability for measuring electrical properties of materials, devices, and circuits. Electrical test equipment for the measurement and characterization of dielectric materials, devices, and circuit components, will be acquired in order to provide students with hands-on experience in electrical measurements complementing the other labs in the ECE Department. In addition to providing training in microelectronics testing, the facility will allow for expanded research in the area of solid-state electronics. Focusing on material characterization, including thin films and novel gas-sensor, the project pursues the following objectives for the proposed lab:&lt;br/&gt;Characterizing electronic thins films,&lt;br/&gt;Enabling systematic characterization of novel devices including gas-sensors, and&lt;br/&gt;Providing a state-of-the-art capability for testing custom-designed integrated circuits.&lt;br/&gt;The amount of time needed to adequately test integrated circuits has been increasing with the greater level of integration in modern microelectronics. Continued increases in the density of the microelectronic circuits push against fundamental limits of device operation, driving the need for novel devices and new electronic materials. Hence, the microelectronic community should exhibit interest in a systematic approach to testing and characterization of new materials, devices, and circuits. Synergistic with existing programs at the University of Maine (e.g., sensor development, new materials development, and materials and device modeling), the project will contribute to strengthen the relationship between the ECE Department and the semiconductor industry in Maine, provide students with skills needed by these companies, and help forge relationships with research groups involved in electronic materials development.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
