<AbstractNarration>Animation is a tremendously powerful medium of expression.&lt;br/&gt;Ideas that would be complex or even impossible to express&lt;br/&gt;with still images or words can easily be conveyed using&lt;br/&gt;animated sequences. Unfortunately, even when the concept to&lt;br/&gt;be conveyed via animation is simple, the process of&lt;br/&gt;producing the animation is inordinately difficult. Indeed,&lt;br/&gt;this is one of the reasons computer animation has become so&lt;br/&gt;dominant - it holds the promise of automating, and thus&lt;br/&gt;significantly simplifying, the production process. Sadly,&lt;br/&gt;the process of transferring ideas into computer animations&lt;br/&gt;is still far from simple. For example, the animated feature&lt;br/&gt;film Toy Story 2 required extremely hard work by as many as&lt;br/&gt;200 highly skilled computer and animation experts for more&lt;br/&gt;than three years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My career goal is to develop the concepts and algorithms&lt;br/&gt;that will enable effortless, rapid development of realistic&lt;br/&gt;animations that effectively convey the creator's purpose.&lt;br/&gt;This research hopes to create the theoretical and&lt;br/&gt;experimental foundation for building much more powerful&lt;br/&gt;animation tools than exist today. Such tools will sharply&lt;br/&gt;reduce the production time needed by skilled animators and,&lt;br/&gt;more importantly, enable average computer users to express&lt;br/&gt;their ideas through animation. Such tools will also help&lt;br/&gt;educators teach more effectively and allow each one of us to&lt;br/&gt;become creators and directors of personal and fictional&lt;br/&gt;stories. Only when animation production is easier will&lt;br/&gt;animation be as commonplace on the web as images and text&lt;br/&gt;are today. Moreover, intuitive methods for creating&lt;br/&gt;realistic human motion will further enable the creation of&lt;br/&gt;human avatars in tele-presence applications, new&lt;br/&gt;anthropomorphic human-computer interfaces, and realistic&lt;br/&gt;digital actors in feature films and video games. Computer&lt;br/&gt;animation will not achieve its full potential until 1)&lt;br/&gt;animation tools require little or no skill, 2) an animator's&lt;br/&gt;creativity is not stifled by the limitations of the&lt;br/&gt;animation tools, and 3) the animation systems are available&lt;br/&gt;to every person with a computer and a story to tell. I hope&lt;br/&gt;to significantly contribute towards these goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the heart of this research is the observation that the&lt;br/&gt;animator's creativity will not be fully realized until it&lt;br/&gt;becomes easier to produce realistic motion sequences. This&lt;br/&gt;problem is tremendously challenging because the underlying&lt;br/&gt;physical models of motion are difficult to create and&lt;br/&gt;control. I believe that the solution lies in the creation of&lt;br/&gt;highly-flexible realistic motion libraries, together with&lt;br/&gt;tools to modify them intuitively and extensively. The power&lt;br/&gt;of libraries stems from the ability to reuse already&lt;br/&gt;existing high-quality motion, reducing the need for&lt;br/&gt;animation skills. In this paradigm, the process of animation&lt;br/&gt;turns into selecting the specific motion library, and&lt;br/&gt;modifying a set of motion properties that transform the&lt;br/&gt;original motion into a final animation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In my research, I propose to develop a methodology for&lt;br/&gt;creating and using realistic motion libraries flexible&lt;br/&gt;enough to be used in a wide range of applications. In 1995,&lt;br/&gt;I proposed the use of motion transformation as new way to&lt;br/&gt;create animations  - a method fundamentally different from&lt;br/&gt;the traditional way of creating animations from scratch.&lt;br/&gt;This transformation approach is particularly useful for&lt;br/&gt;modifying realistic motion data captured from real-world&lt;br/&gt;actors. Unfortunately, during the transformation process,&lt;br/&gt;much of the realism tends to be lost. Recently, I published&lt;br/&gt;a novel transformation approach which demonstrates that&lt;br/&gt;animations can be intuitively transformed into a wide range&lt;br/&gt;of new sequences without violating the fundamental dynamic&lt;br/&gt;properties of motion. The realism is preserved by&lt;br/&gt;maintaining a model of the dynamic and biomechanic&lt;br/&gt;properties of the animated character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the future, I will further develop mathematical models&lt;br/&gt;that can be combined with real-world data to create reusable&lt;br/&gt;motion libraries. Aside from preserving the realism of&lt;br/&gt;motion, the most important requirement for effective motion&lt;br/&gt;libraries is the flexibility with which the libraries can be&lt;br/&gt;adjusted to meet the needs of an animator. I plan to achieve&lt;br/&gt;this flexibility by decomposing a character's motion into a&lt;br/&gt;fundamental component and a style component in a way&lt;br/&gt;that allows us to independently transfer these components to&lt;br/&gt;new characters. For example, the animator can produce a&lt;br/&gt;child's cheerful run sequence by starting with a running&lt;br/&gt;motion library extracted from the captured human run. This&lt;br/&gt;motion can be modified by applying a happy, exuberant motion&lt;br/&gt;style, which is then transferred to an animated character of&lt;br/&gt;a small child. Such decoupling of the fundamental motion,&lt;br/&gt;style, and performing character provides an extremely&lt;br/&gt;powerful and flexible animation paradigm that can produce a&lt;br/&gt;wide range of animations from a very small motion dataset.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main goal of the educational component of this proposal&lt;br/&gt;is to demonstrate the utility of advanced animation tools in&lt;br/&gt;education and story-telling. I am particularly interested in&lt;br/&gt;introducing these new animation tools to Seattle high-school&lt;br/&gt;students to verify that our research does indeed empower&lt;br/&gt;every story-teller with an accessible medium of expression.&lt;br/&gt;I am also planning a project-oriented animation course&lt;br/&gt;intended for undergraduate and graduate students involved in&lt;br/&gt;animation research, as well as in art and music. Together,&lt;br/&gt;the students will work on using our tools to create an&lt;br/&gt;artistic short film project. This synergistic effort will&lt;br/&gt;expose the artists to the latest animation technology and&lt;br/&gt;provide direct user feedback to students involved in&lt;br/&gt;research. In addition, the created motion libraries as well&lt;br/&gt;as the animation tools, will be freely distributed through&lt;br/&gt;the web and CDs with the hope that they will help animation&lt;br/&gt;become an effective communication medium across educational,&lt;br/&gt;economic and cultural boundaries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
