<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;Irrigation agriculture was the economic backbone of the ancient civilizations that flourished on Peru's desert coast.  With support from the National Science Foundation, Dr. Frances Hayashida and collaborators will explore the technology and organization of late prehispanic coastal agriculture through interdisciplinary fieldwork on the Pampa de Chaparri in the Lambayeque region of the north coast of Peru. Archaeological evidence indicates that the pampa was cultivated when Lambayeque was under the rule of the Chimu and Inka empires (early 14- early 16 Centuries).  Fields were watered by one of the few well-preserved canal systems on the north coast that has not been destroyed by historic and modern cultivation and settlements.  Researchers thus have the unusual opportunity to investigate late prehispanic agriculture in the region and to explore the broader question of how large-scale agriculture was structured in ancient states. What were the political, social, and environmental factors that informed decisions about land use, water distribution, and crops? To what degree were these decisions directed by the state? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During a six-month field season in 2000, data will be collected on (1) the distribution and chronology of settlements, canals, fields, roads, and other features, (2) the ancient environment and changes since the prehispanic occupation, and (3) crops and cultivation practices.  Fieldwork will include systematic archaeological survey and site mapping and test excavations of canals, fields, and settlements.  Team members will also collect data on the modern and ancient environment though study of soils, geomorphology, modern vegetation, and pollen and other botanical remains from the excavations.  In 2001, researchers will return to Peru for 2.5 months to analyze material from the 2000 season.  The results of these two seasons will yield information on crop and water management, the scale of production, the organization of labor, and the role of the state versus local polities in planning and management.  Results will also establish the direction of future fieldwork. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fieldwork on the Pampa de Chaparri will contribute to studies of ancient civilizations by providing a detailed case examination of the relationship between water, land, crops, people, and politics in the past.  By focusing on the articulation of states with farmers and by recording agricultural practices and technologies that persisted over centuries, the research can also contribute to modern development policies and projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
