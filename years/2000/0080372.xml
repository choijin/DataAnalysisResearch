    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase II project addresses the need for rapid, reliable instrumentation for the detection of pathogenic microorganisms in food and environmental screening. The proposed system is based on MEMS-based, optical fiber, extrinsic Fabry-Perot (EFPI) biosensors. During Phase I, Luna Innovations (formerly F&amp;S, Inc.) optimized the EFPI sensing platform for refractive index measurements, applied affinity films to measure kinetic binding with specific antibodies and non-hazardous proteins, and integrated the sensors with an inexpensive signal conditioning system for a complete detection combination. The newly developed system is capable of cost effective, robust, operationally simple detection. It is easily adapted to incorporate microfluidics or other sampling system interfaces thereby offering improvements in refractive index measurements, as well as biosensing capabilities. During Phase II, this sensing system will be incorporated with microfluidic sampling systems and used to demonstrate simple&lt;br/&gt;detection of proteinacious targets of Escherichi coli and Vibrio cholerae, and will later be expanded for other high priority pathogens found in raw and processed food products, contaminated water and soil, and biological warfare agents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anticipated Benefits/Potential Commercial Applications of the Research or Development: The prototype system has already generated tremendous interest from many companies involved in refractive index measurements for process control, target screening within the food industry, and other biological research applications. The EFPI as a refractometer has found applications within the beverage industry for milk processing, and the petroleum and chemical industry for distillation processes and concentration monitoring. As a biosensor, the EFPI will find widespread application in multibillion dollar annual markets in food, environmental, medical, and industrial applications.</AbstractNarration>
