<AbstractNarration>Abstract: 0002972&lt;br/&gt;The Association for Women in Science and the National Science Foundation will co-sponsor the Conference, "Forum on Women in Science and Technology", one part of the international Beijing Plus Five Conference, New York, 2000. The forum will be held on June 5/6, 2000. Participants will represent members of the scientific and technical communities, members of the President's Interagency Council on Women, various non-governmental organizations, and official delegates from various foreign countries. The goals of the forum are: 1) "To clarify the value and importance of science and technology in relation to the relevant critical areas of concern from the Beijing Platform for Action, and increase the visibility of women in science in the global arena" and 2) "To foster participation and understanding of the scientific community, including professionals and students, in the role they can play in policy initiatives such as Beijing Plus Five." The agenda focuses on issues of women in science and technology as they relate to education and training, health, the economy, power and decision-making, institutional mechanism, and the environment. The format includes major international speakers, breakout groups that focus on particular areas of concern, and the development of lists of action items. An exhibit that includes displays on women and girls in science, female science mentors, science education, and hands-on science material and resources will accompany the various presentations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
