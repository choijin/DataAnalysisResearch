<AbstractNarration>This award supports international travel for fifteen U.S. graduate students who would not otherwise be able to attend the Second AgentLink European Agent Systems Summer School being held in Saarbrucken, Germany, from August 14-18, 2000. AgentLink, Europe's ESPRIT-funded Network of Excellence for agent-based computing, organizes the school (http://www.agentlink.org). It is a world-class event that will bring together internationally recognized researchers in the area of autonomous agents and multi-agent systems to present introductory and advanced courses in the theoretical and practical aspects of agent-based computing. The objective of this award is to encourage and enable U.S. graduate students of outstanding merit who are interested in research in agent systems but have no current funding to attend this event. This travel grant will cover their travel, hotel, registration fees, and some subsistence. The Europeans are giving similar support to their graduate students (i.e., those at European universities who are registered AgentLink members). This travel grant allows a strong and diverse group of US graduate students to attend EASSS 2000 rather than just a small group of elite researchers. Further, because the summer school is in Europe, it provides a unique opportunity for American researchers to have direct contact with their European colleagues.</AbstractNarration>
