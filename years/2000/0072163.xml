<AbstractNarration>Some of the most impressive recent work in dynamical systems has been &lt;br/&gt;an outgrowth of the study of dynamics in one complex variable. The &lt;br/&gt;fundamental assumption motivating this proposal is that complex &lt;br/&gt;methods have an important role to play in dynamics when the number of &lt;br/&gt;dimensions is greater than one as well.  The subject of this proposal &lt;br/&gt;is a particular "model family" of dynamical systems, the polynomial &lt;br/&gt;diffeomorphisms in two complex dimensions. The complex Henon &lt;br/&gt;diffeomorphisms which are a notable special case. These are perhaps &lt;br/&gt;the simplest invertible holomorphic dynamical system with interesting &lt;br/&gt;dynamics. One of the lessons of dynamics in one variable is that &lt;br/&gt;there is a range of dynamical behaviors starting with expanding maps &lt;br/&gt;and continuing with Misurewicz maps, semi-hyperbolic and &lt;br/&gt;Collet-Eckmann maps.  The two variable analog of the expanding &lt;br/&gt;property is hyperbolicity. This proposal is focused on understanding &lt;br/&gt;the two variable analog of the semi-hyperbolic condition which we &lt;br/&gt;call quasi-hyperbolicity. In one variable these conditions are &lt;br/&gt;related to the recurrence properties of critical points.  In two &lt;br/&gt;variables the notion of critical point needs to be replaced by other &lt;br/&gt;concepts such as regularity of stable and unstable manifolds. An &lt;br/&gt;interesting example of quasi-hyperbolic diffeomorphisms are real &lt;br/&gt;polynomial diffeomorphisms of maximal entropy such as limits of &lt;br/&gt;horseshoes in the real Henon case. Though several questions about the &lt;br/&gt;behavior of such diffeomorphisms have been answered in previous work &lt;br/&gt;a number of open questions remain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The introduction of the computer has increased the usefulness of &lt;br/&gt;simple deterministic mathematical models in a number of sciences. An &lt;br/&gt;illustrative example is the logistic map which can be used to &lt;br/&gt;describe the behavior of a single insect population in successive &lt;br/&gt;years. When the mathematical model is linear there is a well &lt;br/&gt;developed underlying theory. When the model is non-linear there are &lt;br/&gt;important theoretical questions which we have not yet been able to &lt;br/&gt;address. Recently mathematicians have made important breakthroughs in &lt;br/&gt;understanding the logistic map. One technique which proved essential &lt;br/&gt;was the consideration of an associated complex dynamical system. My &lt;br/&gt;proposal addresses some of the problems of using similar complex &lt;br/&gt;techniques when the system involved has dimension greater than one &lt;br/&gt;(for example when there are two interacting populations.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
