<AbstractNarration>0096965&lt;br/&gt;Malek &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description: This award is for support of a cooperative project by Dr. R.I. Malek, Materials Research Laboratory, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania and Dr. Z. H. Khalil, Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Assiut University, Assiut, Egypt, and Dr. Said Saad Imbaby, Mining Department, Faculty of Engineering, Assiut University, Assiut, Egypt.  They plan to: a) expand the fundamental understanding of the mechanism of evolution of nanostructure in aluminosilicate frameworks, b) explore utilization of cement kiln dust (as a model industrial waste) in the manufacture of masonry and building products, c) evaluate the products and ensure their compliance with the standards specification in both the United States and Egypt, and d) provide sound scientific bases that facilitate the use of any industrial waste to produce nanostructured building products. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scope: This project combines the expertise of scientists from the United States and Egypt to develop new structural materials and to reduce environmental degradation inherent in existing systems.  Dr. Malek's laboratory at Penn State University has some of the most advanced testing equipment for materials.  Dr. Malek has worked on alternate construction materials for several years and will be responsible for much of the analytical studies and the materials characterization.  The Egyptian scientists have access to kiln dust, the material that is produced as an environmentally hazardous byproduct in cement making, and have the facility needed to manufacture usable construction material from that dust.  They will participate in the characterization work during their visits to Penn State University.  The project will have a significant impact in Egypt by providing new building material in place of the topsoil, which is no longer replenished after the building of the Aswan Dam.  The project may help provide less expensive masonry material and at the same time reduce pollution from cement factories.  The project meets INT criteria for support of cooperative projects that are mutually beneficial.  This project is supported jointly by the Division of International Programs and the Division of Civil and Mechanical Systems.</AbstractNarration>
