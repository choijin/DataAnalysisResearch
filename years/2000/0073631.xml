<AbstractNarration>Central schemes may serve as universal finite-difference methods&lt;br/&gt;for numerically solving hyperbolic conservation laws, Hamilton-Jacobi&lt;br/&gt;equations and closely related convection-diffusion equations. Such&lt;br/&gt;schemes are not tied to the specific eigen-structure of the problem,&lt;br/&gt;and hence can be implemented in a straightforward manner as black-box&lt;br/&gt;solvers for a wide variety of nonlinear equations governing the&lt;br/&gt;spontaneous evolution of large gradient phenomena. The first-order &lt;br/&gt;Lax-Friedrichs scheme is the forerunner for suchcentral schemes. The &lt;br/&gt;second-order Nessyahu-Tadmor scheme offers high resolution while &lt;br/&gt;retaining the simplicity of Riemann-solver-free approach. In the &lt;br/&gt;convective regime the improved resolution of the Nessyahu-Tadmor &lt;br/&gt;scheme and its generalizations is achieved by using high-order &lt;br/&gt;piecewise polynomial reconstructions and high-order quadrature &lt;br/&gt;formulas for computing the flux integrals. At the same time, this &lt;br/&gt;family of staggered central schemes suffers from excessive&lt;br/&gt;numerical viscosity when a sufficiently small time step is enforced,&lt;br/&gt;e.g., due to the presence of (degenerate) diffusive term.&lt;br/&gt;Recently Kurganov and Tadmor introduced a new family of central&lt;br/&gt;schemes, which retain the simplicity of staggered central schemes,&lt;br/&gt;yet they enjoy a smaller numerical viscosity. In particular, these&lt;br/&gt;schemes admit a simple semi-discrete formulation. This project aims &lt;br/&gt;to develop new, minimally dissipative fully- and semi-discrete central &lt;br/&gt;schemes for conservation laws. The main ideas behind the construction &lt;br/&gt;of these new schemes is the use of more precise information of the local&lt;br/&gt;propagation speed, and realizing the (non-smooth part of the) approximate&lt;br/&gt;solution in terms of its cell averages integrated over the nonsymmetric &lt;br/&gt;Riemann fans of varying size.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hyperbolic conservation laws, Hamilton-Jacobi equations and convection-&lt;br/&gt;diffusion equations are of great practical importance. They govern a&lt;br/&gt;variety of physical phenomena that appear in fluid mechanics, gas&lt;br/&gt;dynamics, magnetohydrodynamics, astrophysics, groundwater flow,&lt;br/&gt;meteorology, semiconductors, reactive flows, two-phase flow in oil&lt;br/&gt;reservoirs, non-Newtonian flows, front propagation and several other&lt;br/&gt;areas. Financial modeling, traffic flow, differential games, optimal&lt;br/&gt;control and image enhancement are among the most recent applications&lt;br/&gt;of the above models.Genuinely multidimensional high-resolution &lt;br/&gt;semi-discrete central schemes provide a rather simple and universal &lt;br/&gt;method for solving these problems. At the same time, the computational&lt;br/&gt;efficiency of central schemes is extremely high. For example, recent &lt;br/&gt;numerical experiments in three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics &lt;br/&gt;demonstrate that using central schemes allows to achieve the desired &lt;br/&gt;resolution about 25 times faster in comparison with other methods. In &lt;br/&gt;general, the advantage of the new semi-discrete central schemes over &lt;br/&gt;alternative upwind methods is particularly amplified when they are used &lt;br/&gt;to solve complicated multidimensional systems arising in practice.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed schemes will be also applied to such important problems&lt;br/&gt;as compressible and incompressible Euler and Navier-Stokes equations,&lt;br/&gt;multi-phase model of geometric optics, multicomponent flow and&lt;br/&gt;compressible bubbles models, moving boundaries problems, shock&lt;br/&gt;reflection problem for the unsteady transonic small disturbance&lt;br/&gt;equation and others.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
