<AbstractNarration>Mathematical Sciences (21) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this project is to develop a virtual library of Java "objects" for use by teachers and students in probability and statistics. Applets are small, self-contained programs designed to illustrate important concepts and methods. An applet can be "dropped" into a web page by a teacher with no programming expertise and then surrounded by expository text, data sets, and other elements to create custom web-based course materials. Components are building blocks of applets, and are of three basic types: virtual versions of physical objects (such as coins and dice), virtual versions of mathematical objects (such as probability distributions and data structures), and custom interface objects (such as special graphs and data tables). The components are used by teachers and students with some programming experience to create new components and applets with relative ease.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The probability/statistics object library is available on a web site maintained by the University of Alabama in Huntsville. The objects are freely available under the General Public License, so that teachers and students can download the objects, modify them, use them in projects, and redistribute them. A significant part of the project is the construction of an object model that describes the hierarchy of objects and how they relate to each other, and specifies certain basic properties, methods, and exception handling for the objects. The object model helps ensure that the objects in the library are carefully documented, that they work well with a variety of platforms and browsers, and they have a consistent user interface. There are two levels of evaluation for the library. A top-level board will function like an editorial board, particularly in the design of the object model. A larger, less formal group of peer reviewers evaluates the objects in the library in terms of performance and pedagogical value. Special efforts are made to link the library to nationally known sites, particularly those that function as larger virtual libraries or mathematical "portals." An ongoing evaluation and dissemination program is fully integrated into the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
