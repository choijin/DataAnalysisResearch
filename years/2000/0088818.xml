<AbstractNarration>Interdisciplinary (99)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is developing a two-course sequence of integrated physical science and mathematics to prepare preservice elementary and secondary teachers to teach at the middle school level. Students tend to lose interest in mathematics and science at the middle school level, a loss often attributed to ill-prepared teachers. The lack of preparation is two-fold: elementary teachers teaching at the middle school lack content in the physical sciences, while secondary teachers lack appropriate pedagogical models for teaching at the middle school level. Realizing that teachers teach as they were taught, this two-course sequence is designed to develop pedagogical models embedded in content knowledge development of preservice teachers. The objectives of the project are to: 1) Develop comprehensive knowledge of the physical sciences and applications of mathematics in the study of science in preservice middle school teachers; 2) Develop a core of university faculty who have facility in modeling teaching styles appropriate for the preservice middle school teachers; 3) Develop a curriculum package that can be adapted by other universities for the instruction of preservice middle school teachers. The objectives are being achieved by having a team of four science and one education faculty adapt proven teacher-enhancement materials in the physical science and middle school curriculum into a two-course sequence. Key elements of this adaptation are the integration of mathematics, and a research investigation that extends throughout the course so that students develop a sense of doing "real science." The project is adapting materials from Operation Physics, Operation Chemistry, Project Astro, Project Earth Science, Powerful Ideas in Physical Science, and Mission Mathematics: Linking Aerospace and the NCTM Standards. These materials are being modified by including explicit mathematical applications within the science materials as has been done within Mission Mathematics. The faculty are receiving training on teaching with the learning cycle, cooperative learning, and community building. Participation in this two-course sequence provides a model for future teachers to adapt to their classrooms. Students enrolling in these courses are at the junior level and have completed the general education science and mathematics courses: one laboratory course from any science, statistics, college algebra, and two other courses selected from biology, chemistry, geosciences, mathematics and computer science, or physics. Special efforts are being made to recruit women, minority, and non-traditional students from rural western Kansas into the new course sequence. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
