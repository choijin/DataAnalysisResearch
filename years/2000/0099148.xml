<AbstractNarration>     The explosive growth of computer networks, combined with rapid and unpredictable developments in ap-plications and workloads, has rendered network service inference and performance prediction increasingly de-manding and intractable tasks. Nonetheless, end-systems must have knowledge of internal network traffic con-ditions and servicing in order to validate, predict, or enhance performance capabilities required by demanding applications. Network service providers also have a great need for gauging the performance of their own sub-systems without recourse to global strategies. Without special-purpose network support, the only alternative is to indirectly infer dynamic network characteristics using edge-based network traffic processing.&lt;br/&gt;     The INCITE (InterNet Control and Inference Tools at the Edge) Project focuses experts from the fields of&lt;br/&gt;networking, digital signal processing, and applied mathematics towards the goal of characterizing network ser-vice based solely on edge-based measurement at hosts and/or edge routers. This project blends recent work in multifractal traffic modeling, quality of service (QoS) measurement, and network tomography to develop a unique and innovative framework for network service inference. The INCITE Project will develop new al-gorithms and implementations using the latest in DSP-driven network processor technology, providing a vital step towards better managing and understanding of Internet performance. Our effort consists of three closely inter-related research thrusts:&lt;br/&gt;1. Multifractal Traffic and Path Modeling: We will develop new, highly accurate tools for analyzing,&lt;br/&gt;modeling, and measuring the dynamics of network connections and end-to-end paths from the edge. Our&lt;br/&gt;approach to inferring the competing cross-traffic load on a path utilizes an innovative exponentially spaced&lt;br/&gt;probing sequence that is inspired by the theory of multifractal random processes. These probing packet&lt;br/&gt;chirps balance the trade-off between overwhelming the network with probes and obtaining statistics rich&lt;br/&gt;enough for accurate estimates.&lt;br/&gt;2. Multiclass Service Inference: We will develop a framework for clients to assess a network's core QoS&lt;br/&gt;functionalities based on external and passive observations. Using the theory of traffic envelopes, maximum&lt;br/&gt;likelihood estimation, and hypothesis testing, clients will be able to assess a broad set of the network's&lt;br/&gt;multi-class control mechanisms such as the service disciplines, link sharing rules and parameters, and&lt;br/&gt;policing parameters.&lt;br/&gt;3. Unicast Network Tomography: We will develop a novel methodology for network tomography that pro-vides&lt;br/&gt;link-level performance characterization of networks of arbitrary topologies based on unicast traffic&lt;br/&gt;measurements at a the network edge. A new network modeling framework based on factor graphs will&lt;br/&gt;enable the statistical inference of link-level service parameters (e.g., losses, delays, and service strate-gies).  A key strength of our envisioned methodology is that it will enable scalable, real-time tomography algorithms deployable on hosts and/or edge routers.&lt;br/&gt;     The INCITE Project will develop the theoretical underpinnings of network multifractal traffic processing,&lt;br/&gt;service inference, and link-level characterization for complex, large-scale networks, and lead to computation-ally efficient and scalable service inference algorithms based only on traffic measurement at the network edge.  Moreover, in collaboration with a leading provider of broadband Internet bandwidth (Enron) and an innovator in networked signal processing hardware (Texas Instruments), we will build a complete prototype implementation of the proposed algorithms, including modules for multifractal traffic and path modeling, service inference, and network tomography. This reference implementation will provide a first-of-its-kind platform for obtaining a deep understanding of large networks and enable principled designs of future network architectures, algorithms, and models.</AbstractNarration>
