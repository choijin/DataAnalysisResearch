<AbstractNarration>A number of new applications have recently emerged that require the storage,&lt;br/&gt;maintenance, and analysis of massive amounts of data. Examples such as web&lt;br/&gt;search engines, data warehouses, and large scientific data repositories &lt;br/&gt;often involve multiple terabytes of data that are simultaneously searched and &lt;br/&gt;explored by many users. This research project investigates fundamental &lt;br/&gt;algorithmic problems arising in the context of such large data sets, studies &lt;br/&gt;the complexity of these problems, develops new techniques for their efficient &lt;br/&gt;solution, and experimentally validates proposed techniques in the appropriate &lt;br/&gt;system and application context. The main focus is on problems arising in &lt;br/&gt;databases and in searching and analyzing the World-Wide Web.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More precisely, the research focuses on problems concerning the storage, &lt;br/&gt;maintenance, partitioning, indexing, and approximate representation of very &lt;br/&gt;large data sets, and the efficient exploration, analysis and precise and &lt;br/&gt;approximate querying of such data. The types of problems that are studied can&lt;br/&gt;be grouped into two categories, one consisting of problems motivated mainly &lt;br/&gt;by applications in the database area, and one motivated by applications in &lt;br/&gt;web search and analysis. In the first category, the project studies &lt;br/&gt;multi-dimensional data partitioning problems arising in selectivity estimation&lt;br/&gt;and indexing, feedback-based approaches to selectivity estimation, association&lt;br/&gt;rule mining problems, and the approximate and precise evaluation of complex&lt;br/&gt;queries on large data sets. The problems studied in the second category are&lt;br/&gt;concerned with online search on the web, the study of random graph models for&lt;br/&gt;the web, and efficient computing with large web graphs and hypertext &lt;br/&gt;collections.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
