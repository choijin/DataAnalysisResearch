<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;Micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) have grown from scientific speculation to&lt;br/&gt;commercial success. Still, a number of technical challenges remain which cannot be&lt;br/&gt;addressed by the private sector. One of these challenges is the integration of the power&lt;br/&gt;supply into the MEMS device. It is a further challenge to build the power source, using&lt;br/&gt;only the processing technology that was used to build the micromechanical elements and&lt;br/&gt;the electronic elements of the device. We address the technical issue of obtaining energy&lt;br/&gt;from the environment to power MEMS devices, rather than powering the device through&lt;br/&gt;external batteries or power supplies. Examples from horology provide inspiration for&lt;br/&gt;scavenging both mechanical motion and thermal energy. While a number of energy&lt;br/&gt;scavenging schemes based on capturing vibration have been proposed, we intend to take&lt;br/&gt;advantage of the high potential energy densities of thermal systems. We will develop&lt;br/&gt;scaling and design methods for thermally scavenged systems, and demonstrate a&lt;br/&gt;mechanical micromachine actuated by changes in ambient temperature. This technology&lt;br/&gt;may be used in the future development of autonomous microrobots or microsatellites.&lt;br/&gt;A problem facing higher education and high technology industry is the dearth of students&lt;br/&gt;and graduates. This is an especially acute problem for interdisciplinary fields such as&lt;br/&gt;MEMS. Upper-division students require cross-disciplinary education to become skilled&lt;br/&gt;contributors to MEMS research, and there are not enough upper-division students. We&lt;br/&gt;therefore must attract more students into the technical fields. The NSF CAREER&lt;br/&gt;program leverages on existing curriculum development efforts by turning curriculum&lt;br/&gt;development into science/engineering outreach. Project-based courses will have their&lt;br/&gt;final presentations in secondary schools, where high school students will have the&lt;br/&gt;opportunity to evaluate engineering projects. Similarly, we will develop sections of&lt;br/&gt;project-based engineering courses targeted for science teachers, with the objective of&lt;br/&gt;integrating teachers into engineering development teams. New courses will be&lt;br/&gt;modularized, so that topics can be offered as short courses or tutorials, and published&lt;br/&gt;with distance education technology. NSF funding will enable students to actually&lt;br/&gt;fabricate and test the designs their teams have designed and simulated through the NNUN&lt;br/&gt;or other multi-user foundries.&lt;br/&gt;The research results, and the research program needs, are intertwined with the&lt;br/&gt;educational development. Research findings and educational assessments will be used to&lt;br/&gt;revise and refine curriculum development and teaching methods. Similarly, project ideas&lt;br/&gt;for the courses will be drawn from the research problems.&lt;br/&gt;All of these efforts are leveraged through existing programs designed for outreach to&lt;br/&gt;disadvantaged and underrepresented groups in the sciences at the University of New&lt;br/&gt;Mexico and in New Mexico.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
