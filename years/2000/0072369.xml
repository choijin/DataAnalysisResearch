    <AbstractNarration>0072369&lt;br/&gt;Kawski&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project builds on the formalism of chronological algebras to study the &lt;br/&gt;geometric foundations of nonlinear control systems. Geometrically, the &lt;br/&gt;chronological product encodes the interaction of the components of &lt;br/&gt;controlled nonlinear dynamics. Algebraically it is the fundamental &lt;br/&gt;structure that underlies effective series expansion and formal solution &lt;br/&gt;algorithms. Areas of special focus are interconnections of systems, and &lt;br/&gt;systems that exhibit full nonlinear dependence on the control. In either &lt;br/&gt;case, specific objectives are to develop normal forms and to find effective &lt;br/&gt;series (or product) representations (using tools from algebraic &lt;br/&gt;combinatorics). Possible applications include algorithms for path &lt;br/&gt;planning, feedback stabilization, optimal control and even numerical &lt;br/&gt;integration. A complementary second thread develops interactive &lt;br/&gt;visualization tools for research (simulation and experimentation) and for &lt;br/&gt;communication. This research is motivated and driven by the desire to &lt;br/&gt;understand the fundamental, common principles that govern the &lt;br/&gt;interactions of dynamical systems on any scale, from molecular levels to &lt;br/&gt;astronomical dimensions. The diversity of possible outcomes is a &lt;br/&gt;consequence of nonlinear effects that permeate our environment: When &lt;br/&gt;combining two subsystems, the result is generally different from just the &lt;br/&gt;sum of the parts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research focuses on further developing the algebra which captures &lt;br/&gt;such nonlinear interaction, where the effect of a+b is more than just the &lt;br/&gt;sum of the effects of a and b. The chronological algebra provides the &lt;br/&gt;formal language to model such interactions where even the order in which &lt;br/&gt;pieces are put together matters, where a*b is generally different from b*a. &lt;br/&gt;The control perspective is distinguished from the basic study of dynamical &lt;br/&gt;systems as it aims beyond just descriptive understanding: The objective of &lt;br/&gt;control theory is to exploit the subtle nature of the interactions in order to &lt;br/&gt;shape complex systems -- often via only minute interference with how the &lt;br/&gt;parts interact. While this mathematical research applies to virtually any &lt;br/&gt;kind of dynamical system, including even social, medical and financial &lt;br/&gt;environments, this project will focus on mechanical systems (like large &lt;br/&gt;satellites with several moving parts) in efforts to demonstrate the general &lt;br/&gt;principles. An important component of this project is the development of &lt;br/&gt;interactive visualization tools. These are used for research, and for &lt;br/&gt;communicating the geometry of the nonlinear interactions, to demonstrate &lt;br/&gt;how the profound understanding of the fundamental mathematical &lt;br/&gt;structures leads to effective means of controlling complex systems. This &lt;br/&gt;visualization effort also provides a rich environment for undergraduate &lt;br/&gt;students to connect with advanced theoretical research. It may prove to be &lt;br/&gt;an effective means to expand the pipeline bringing new talents into &lt;br/&gt;mathematical research.</AbstractNarration>
