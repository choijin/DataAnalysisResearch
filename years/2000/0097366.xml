<AbstractNarration>In attempting to remain one of the Southwest's premier centers for undergraduate mathematics, the Mathematics Department at Trinity University recognizes the importance of the emerging role of undergraduate research and will reopen our Summer Undergraduate Research Experience in Mathematics Program, which was originally funded by the National Science Foundation during the summers of 1997, 1998 and 1999.  Our objectives in having a three year project are fourfold:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1.  To provide student participants with an understanding of, an appreciation for, and an experience in the nature of mathematical research and the life of a mathematical researcher, to a degree which will encourage them to pursue the study of the mathematical sciences on the graduate level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2.  To offer these experiences with a special eye toward students who do not typically have these opportunities.  Of particular interest to us are students who are either female or a member of an under-represented minority group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3.  To produce quality mathematical work appropriate for publication in undergraduate research journals and, when possible, in higher level research journals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4.  To gain experience in the use of computers and their interaction in mathematical research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While we envision the recruiting effort for students to be nationwide, we see, due to our location, a unique opportunity to recruit students at many colleges and universities in South Texas that have traditionally high Hispanic enrollment.  We will have an expanded recruiting effort to such schools and a revamping of our past program evaluation efforts.  This will also be an expansion of our old program from 4 faculty to 6 faculty and the number of students involved from 6 to 12.  The available research areas will include: Abstract Algebra, Difference Equations, Discrete Dynamical Systems, Mathematical Programming, Combinatorics, and Number Theory.  Our expansion is in line with Trinity University's strong commitment to undergraduate research, as demonstrated by Trinity's nationally recognized undergraduate research programs in Chemistry, Biology and Computer Science.</AbstractNarration>
