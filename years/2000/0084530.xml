<AbstractNarration>This effort is a collaboration between researchers at University of California, San Diego (UCSD) and Stanford University.  The objective is to explore and utilize advanced computational and information technologies to further develop a state-of-the-art nonlinear finite element program (CYCLIC) for earthquake ground response and liquefaction simulation.  Calibrated codes for modeling and simulation of earthquake geotechnical phenomena will be combined with advanced computational methodologies to facilitate the simulation of large-scale systems and broaden the scope of practical applications. The proposed work involves three main research elements: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Further development of the computational program CYCLIC: This development will introduce parameter sensitivity and optimization options.  The capacity of the computational program will be extended from two-dimensional (2D) to 3D simulation. In addition, a transmitting boundary feature will be included. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Parallel and distributed computing capability: CYCLIC will be significantly enhanced by incorporating state-of-the-art software paradigm and solver technologies that are designed for parallel and distributed computing environments.  Specifically, a multitask Single-Program-Multiple-Data (SPMD) program paradigm will be employed and implemented.  Furthermore, parallel sparse matrix solvers will be developed and incorporated into the computational engine to improve performance and extend the simulation capabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. Internet-based interactive web environment: In addition to the current 1D remote execution and visualization capability (http://casagrande.ucsd.edu), extensions to 2D and 3D will be facilitated through parallel computing. Novel useful features will include an extensive library of on-line input earthquake records, and a soil material library with pre-defined calibrated models for sand, silt, and clay soils. User friendliness will be addressed throughout the development process. Advanced Internet-enabled and web browsing technologies will be deployed to allow remote users to view the results in an interactive and dynamic manner.  The experience gained in the development of the Internet-enabled simulation environment will be shared with other researchers and may help make many other useful computational programs widely accessible over the Internet for future applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
