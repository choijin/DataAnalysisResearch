    <AbstractNarration>Calcium Signalling in the Regulation of Flagellar Beating in Sperm&lt;br/&gt;In mammals, fertilization takes place deep within the female reproductive tract, in the&lt;br/&gt;ampulla of the oviduct. When sperm are recovered from the ampulla and observed swimming&lt;br/&gt;on microscope slides, they swim vigorously in circles. This swimming pattern is termed&lt;br/&gt;hyperactivation. In the environment of the oviduct, hyperactivation is not so useless as it might&lt;br/&gt;seem; in fact, it assists sperm in reaching the oocyte and in penetrating the cumulus matrix and&lt;br/&gt;zona pellucida. Hyperactivation is switched on by an increase in Ca 2+ at the flagellar axoneme in&lt;br/&gt;the core of the flagellum. The goal of this project is to determine how Ca 2+ reaches the axoneme&lt;br/&gt;to switch on hyperactivation. Pharmacological agents that induce release of Ca 2+ from intracellular&lt;br/&gt;stores (thapsigargin, thimerosal, and caffeine) were found to initiate hyperactivation in bull sperm.&lt;br/&gt;There are two families of Ca 2+ stores in cells, the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor stores (IP3 R)&lt;br/&gt;and the ryanodine receptor stores (RyR). Antibodies against IP3 R revealed the presence of a store&lt;br/&gt;in the flagellum. This store may be the redundant nuclear envelope (RNE), an organelle located at&lt;br/&gt;the base of the flagellum. The RNE arises during spermiogenesis, when condensation of the&lt;br/&gt;nucleus of the spermatid leaves behind excess nuclear envelope. Rather than being discarded, as&lt;br/&gt;are all other superfluous cytoplasm and organelles, the RNE is retained and packaged neatly as a&lt;br/&gt;scroll of membranes at the base of the flagellum. It is proposed that the RNE is retained to serve&lt;br/&gt;as a Ca 2+ store. In addition to providing Ca 2+ to the base of the axoneme, the RNE could release&lt;br/&gt;Ca 2+ to mitochondria to stimulate ATP production. The RNE is quite closely associated with&lt;br/&gt;mitochondria at the base of the flagellum. These mitochondria are terminal members of the tightly-wrapped&lt;br/&gt;helix of mitochondria that surrounds the axoneme in the flagellar midpiece. The helix&lt;br/&gt;forms a barrier in the midpiece between the plasma membrane and axoneme; therefore, the&lt;br/&gt;mitochondria are also in a position to regulate Ca 2+ in the axoneme.&lt;br/&gt;Given this unique organization of RNE and mitochondria with respect to the axoneme, the&lt;br/&gt;following 4 hypotheses were developed to test how these organelles play a role in initiating&lt;br/&gt;hyperactivation. Bull sperm (Bos taurus) will be used to test the hypotheses.&lt;br/&gt;Hypothesis 1: The intracellular store that provides Ca 2+ for hyperactivation is gated by both IP3&lt;br/&gt;and ryanodine receptors. Our preliminary evidence implicates both types of receptors in releasing&lt;br/&gt;Ca 2+ to initiate hyperactivation. Highly specific agonists of the receptors will be used to confirm&lt;br/&gt;these findings. If the hypothesis is correct, it would mean that the amount of Ca 2+ released can&lt;br/&gt;occur at two or three levels, depending upon which receptor is activated: IP3 R alone, RyR alone, or&lt;br/&gt;the two in combination. Such a mechanism can control the intensity of hyperactivation, such as to&lt;br/&gt;increase flagellar bending during penetration of the zona pellucida.&lt;br/&gt;Hypothesis 2: The intracellular Ca 2+ store in the flagellum is the RNE. It is proposed that this&lt;br/&gt;unique structure, which has been ignored in the past, is responsible for providing Ca 2+ for&lt;br/&gt;hyperactivation. Localization of the IP3 R and/or RyR to the RNE should tell us whether this&lt;br/&gt;hypothesis is correct.&lt;br/&gt;Hypothesis 3: A Ca 2+ rise in mitochondria is involved in switching on hyperactivation. The&lt;br/&gt;picture of Ca 2+ signalling that has been emerging for other cells is that mitochondria pick up Ca 2+&lt;br/&gt;released from intracellular stores and respond by increasing ATP production. ATP levels are&lt;br/&gt;doubled in hyperactivated guinea pig sperm. Therefore, experiments are proposed to test whether&lt;br/&gt;release of Ca 2+ from intracellular stores results in increased levels of Ca 2+ , NADH, and ATP in&lt;br/&gt;flagellar mitochondria.&lt;br/&gt;Hypothesis 4: Mitochondria regulate flagellar Ca 2+ and hyperactivation. The tight wrap of&lt;br/&gt;mitochondria around the flagellar axoneme separates it from the plasma membrane; therefore,&lt;br/&gt;mitochondria are in a position to affect Ca 2+ levels at the axoneme in the site where the flagellar&lt;br/&gt;bend develops. Blockers of mitochondrial release of Ca 2+ will be applied to sperm before using&lt;br/&gt;pharmacological initiators of hyperactivation to determine whether hyperactivation can be prevented.&lt;br/&gt;The testing of these 4 hypotheses should provide a picture of how Ca 2+ turns on this&lt;br/&gt;movement pattern that is essential to fertilization.</AbstractNarration>
