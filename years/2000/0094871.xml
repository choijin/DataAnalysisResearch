<AbstractNarration>The university is operating a CSEMS scholarship program for students in aviation-related fields as well as computer science, computer engineering, and electrical engineering. The program involves aggressive recruitment, primarily at community colleges, of academically superior, low-income students; a plan to orient, motivate and ready the students for rigorous academic performance; a plan to support the students through a professor-mentor and advising program; and a plan to help them gain employment in their degree fields, or be accepted in graduate school.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The university is using its contacts with a number of aerospace and electronics firms, which afford special opportunities for its students for summer research, co-operative assignments, and new graduate hiring. In addition, the university has made a substantial financial commitment to the NSF program, agreeing to augment the NSF funds with major institutional scholarships, offering material leverage to NSF funding &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
