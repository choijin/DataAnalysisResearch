<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding to the University of California-Berkeley for a 5 year REU Site Program entitled, "Summer Undergraduate Program in Engineering Research at Berkely (SUPERB)-Network Technologies," under the direction of Dr. Jan Rabaey.  This 8-week summer program will provide 6 undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds a stimulating research experience with mentoring by faculty and senior graduate students.  Each student will be carefully matched with a faculty member, working in emerging Networking Technologies such as networking, wireless communications, microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), and integrated circuits.  The students will have access to state-of-the-art computing and networking equipment throughout the program. The students will attend weekly meetings where they will meet with faculty to learn more about the research focus of their projectsand to hear talks on how to improve communications skills and apply to graduate school. The evaluation plan for this project calls for systematic tracking of participants after they leave the program, and the assessment of both educational outcomes as well as the broader effect on the host institution.</AbstractNarration>
