<AbstractNarration>Despite the growing complexity of the storage landscape, tools to architect new storage systems are practically nonexistent.  The purpose of this CAREER grant proposal is to develop a long-range program of research and education in design and performance analysis of storage systems, with a specific emphasis on emerging probe-based storage technology.  The main question this research proposal asks is:  "How do we design probe-based storage to give optimal performance for a workload with certain characteristics?"  Answering this question requires a long-range research plan with thrusts in several areas, including creating physical models for the device, developing tools and methodologies for optimizing design based on a specific workload, and novel research in workload characterization to generalize our conclusions.  Although our initial focus is on probe-based storage, we envision creating a parameterized, plug-and-play performance environment in which many other models may be used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The education component of this proposal represents a philosophy of curriculum development to increase awareness of storage systems, and a general emphasis on fostering active learning skills.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
