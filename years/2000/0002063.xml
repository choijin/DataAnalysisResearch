<AbstractNarration>This award helps underwrite participant travel for a workshop on freedom and privacy by design. The workshop is part of an interdisciplinary conference addressing potential effects on society and individual freedom and privacy resulting from the use of computers, data banks, computer networks, and communications systems. The workshop explores the use of technology to bring about strong protections of civil liberties. The exploration of technology includes (a) implemented, fielded systems, and (b) what principles and architectures should be developed, including which open problems must be solved, to implement and field novel systems that can be inherently protective of civil liberties. The workshop will take place on the first day of the conference, and will consist of approximately 30 active participants with a range of backgrounds, and about 50 spectators, including members of the press. The larger conference, of which this workshop is a part, addresses new developments and issues in the politics and intellectual property of domain names; developments in privacy law; security vs privacy vs free speech in broadband communications; the effectiveness of governmental privacy commissioners; ECHELON; the effect of the Internet on intellectual property; free expression versus privacy; the use of humans as research subjects on the net; Internet voting; rating and filtering systems and their effects on privacy and free speech; recent developments in free speech and privacy issues in the Pacific Rim; and the effect of the Internet on campaign finance vs free expression.</AbstractNarration>
