<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;This Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE) grant supports an integrated research and education project in the area of automated design of multi-piece molds for manufacturing geometrically complex heterogeneous objects.  Its goal is to develop underlying algorithms that will enable development of computer-aided design and manufacturing (CAD/CAM) systems for automatically designing multi-piece molds. The research effort will focus on:  (1) characterization of the new design space enabled by multi-piece molds; (2) development of geometric reasoning algorithms for decomposing molds into manufacturable components; and (3) development of geometric reasoning algorithms for incorporating assembly features into mold components for facilitating mold assembly.  The education effort will focus on:  (1) introduction of rigorous algorithmic foundations into CAD/CAM courses; (2) familiarizing students with the challenges in the CAD/CAM system development; and (3) providing students an opportunity to develop prototype CAD/CAM systems for design and manufacturing of multi-piece molds.  Outreach projects will be initiated to expose high school students to the CAD/CAM field and give them an opportunity to make a more informed career choice; and, allow industry to learn about new CAD/CAM and heterogeneous object manufacturing technologies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful this project will have the following impacts.  First, it will lead to the development of new geometric reasoning algorithms in manufacturability analysis and manufacturability-driven spatial partitioning areas.  In addition to mold design, these algorithms will be useful in several other CAD/CAM applications.  Second, it will provide a commercially viable method for making geometrically complex heterogeneous objects.  The ability to manufacture geometrically complex heterogeneous objects economically will significantly expand the design space and will allow development of new products in many different areas.  Finally, integration of geometric reasoning principles into the mechanical engineering curriculum will help in creating a new generation of engineers who will have exposure to geometric algorithms in addition to traditional mechanical engineering curriculum.  This exposure is expected to help in preparing engineers for participating in the development of the next generation CAD/CAM systems.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
