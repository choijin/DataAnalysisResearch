<AbstractNarration>PI's objectives are to: (1) Investigate the kinetics of PMN-tumor cell aggregate formation as a function of shear rate, and states of PMN/tumor cell activation. These data will be analyzed using a mathematical model based on Smoluchowski's two-body collision theory that will provide numerical estimates of an important cellular property termed adhesion efficiency, which reflects the binding affinity of interacting cells. (2) Elucidate the fundamental molecular and signaling mechanisms of PMN-tumor cell adhesive interactions using function blocking monoclonal antibodies and highly specific enzymes will, (3) Track individual PMNs in shear flow and delineate the dynamics and pattern of their interactions with surface-anchored tumor cells using a perfusion chamber coupled with an epifluorescence videomicroscopy system.&lt;br/&gt;For the educational component of this proposal, the PI aims to develop an innovative university-wide curriculum in Cellular Engineering at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. This goal will be met through the development of a cohesive set of lecture courses and the establishment of a capstone laboratory course in which students will obtain valuable hands-on experience, by being exposed to a wide array of experimental tools and techniques used in bioengineering research. To promote exposure of Bioengineering to high-school students, an outreach program will be developed in parallel. The strategy involves the educational enrichment of regional high-school teachers and the development of an internet-based module using animation and audio/video clips on selected topics of Cellular Engineering in an effort to introduce this material as a section in an advanced science course.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
