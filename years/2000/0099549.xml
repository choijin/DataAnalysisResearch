<AbstractNarration>Pang, Jong-Shi&lt;br/&gt;From: Jaksa Cvitanic [cvitanic@math.usc.edu]&lt;br/&gt;Sent: Monday, July 02, 2001 4:33 AM&lt;br/&gt;To: Pang, Jong-Shi&lt;br/&gt;Subject: Re: your mail&lt;br/&gt;Dear Dr. Pang,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I enclose here the abstract for my proposal.&lt;br/&gt;Let me know , please, if it's O.K.&lt;br/&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jaksa Cvitanic&lt;br/&gt;------&lt;br/&gt; Principal Investigator:  JAKSA CVITANIC&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research is proposed on various aspects of the modern theory &lt;br/&gt;of financial markets and related mathematical  problems of &lt;br/&gt;stochastic analysis, filtering and control.  Issues that will &lt;br/&gt;be studied involve:&lt;br/&gt;(i) finding algorithms to compute the diffusion term of&lt;br/&gt;the optimal wealth/hedging process, and related questions&lt;br/&gt;about Martingale Representation Property and Malliavin&lt;br/&gt;Calculus;&lt;br/&gt;(ii) questions on maximizing  Stochastic Differential&lt;br/&gt;Utility and connections to Forward-Backward Stochastic &lt;br/&gt;Differential Equations and problems of &lt;br/&gt;incomplete/asymmetric information;&lt;br/&gt;(iii)  analytical and numerical methods for finding optimal&lt;br/&gt;portfolio/consumption investment for retirement, in general &lt;br/&gt;diffusion models;&lt;br/&gt;(iv) theory of utility maximization/risk minimization in&lt;br/&gt;general semimartingale models of markets with frictions;&lt;br/&gt;(v) filtering and calibration of stochastic volatility models;&lt;br/&gt;(vi) optimal design of executive compensation.&lt;br/&gt;It is expected that tools from stochastic analysis and martingale&lt;br/&gt;theory, convex duality theory, functional analysis, stochastic &lt;br/&gt;control, Monte Carlo/simulation methods, will prove valuable &lt;br/&gt;in the resolution of  these questions, sometimes requiring &lt;br/&gt;development of new tools, thus enhancing the understanding of &lt;br/&gt;both the theoretical and applied aspects of these fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The optimal portfolio selection and  consumption selection &lt;br/&gt;is the theory that provides answers to the question of how &lt;br/&gt;to allocate money between investing in different assets in &lt;br/&gt;financial markets, and consuming it in order to buy various goods.  &lt;br/&gt;The theory has been developed in almost full generality by now. &lt;br/&gt;However, it depends on a mathematical model of the markets, &lt;br/&gt;and our ability to estimate the model parameters.  For example, &lt;br/&gt;correct pricing of complex financial contracts, such as exotic &lt;br/&gt;options, depends on how well we can estimate the "volatility" &lt;br/&gt;(riskiness) of the stock on which the option is written.&lt;br/&gt;One of the problems we propose to study is how to do this &lt;br/&gt;estimation by using observed stock prices.  Similarly, the &lt;br/&gt;problem of actually  computing the corresponding  optimal &lt;br/&gt;trading strategies has not been resolved in general.  The &lt;br/&gt;algorithms that are commonly used today typically do not work well&lt;br/&gt;in more complex and realistic models for financial markets, that &lt;br/&gt;are becoming a standard, due to the increased sophistication of &lt;br/&gt;market modelers.  Thus, it is important to explore new analytical &lt;br/&gt;and computational methods for finding optimal trading strategies, &lt;br/&gt;some of which are suggested in this proposal.  Similar methods are &lt;br/&gt;suggested for exploring important problem of how a firm should  &lt;br/&gt;compensate its executive so that the resulting behavior of the &lt;br/&gt;executive is optimal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
