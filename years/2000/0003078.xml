<AbstractNarration>For the past two decades, the University of Michigan (UM) WISE program has developed and implemented a host of programmatic activities to increase the number of women students who successfully pursue majors, advanced degrees and careers in science, mathematics and engineering (SME). Program services range from summer workshops that have served 1,300 middle school girls to a living-learning residential program that has been home for more than 1,000 first- and second- year undergraduate women; from a summer research program aimed at encouraging women to undertake graduate studies in science and engineering to a peer mentoring network for women graduate students.  The WISE program has made a significant impact in the recruitment and retention of women in SME fields.  For example, UM engineering undergraduate enrollment of women increased from 17% in 1980 to 32% in 1999.  In 1980, only 18% of the science and mathematics degrees awarded by UM went to women.  Today, 42% of the biochemistry majors are women; 46% of the cellular and molecular biology majors; 44% of the mathematics majors; and 45% of the geology majors.</AbstractNarration>
