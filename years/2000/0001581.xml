<AbstractNarration>0001581&lt;br/&gt;Seif&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description: This award is to support a collaborative project by Dr. Mohamed A. Seif, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Northern Illinois University (NIU), Dekalb, Illinois, and Dr. Mohammad R. Shaalan and Dr. Usama Khashaba, both of the Department of Mechanical Power Engineering, Zagazig University, Zagazig, Egypt.  The project is intended to develop and demonstrate a novel automated non-destructive evaluation (NDE) technique, that of laser speckle shearing interferometry.  The technique should be capable of determining flaws and initial development of microcracking and its subsequent propagation in different materials.  The sensitivity of the method and four significant factors in final failure, namely the number and character of the flaws, the load environment, the residual stress level, and the mechanism of failure of the material, will be investigated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scope: The US PI has special expertise in implementing NDE and using laser measurements in experimental mechanics.  Dr. Shaalan and Dr. Khashaba have expertise in experimental design, reliability analysis, and data analysis.  The two sides have complementary expertise and facilities at their disposal for this research.  The project should lead to simpler, more reliable, and less expensive techniques for determining the integrity of complex structures used in applications requiring high reliability, such as aviation structures and critical components in industrial applications.  The project will involve a US graduate student at NIU, providing that person with an international research experience.  This proposal meets the INT objective of supporting collaborative research in areas of mutual interest.  This project is being supported under the US-Egypt Joint Fund Program, which provides grants to scientists and engineers in both countries to carry out these cooperative activities. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
