<AbstractNarration>A broad class of transport processes in matter at high densities and temperatures will be studied.  One of the main objectives of this research is to study elementary processes associated with the evolution of neutron stars.  The study will focus on examining how various factors affect the evolution, to facilitate comparison with the existing and future observational data.  The outcome of this study will contribute to the understanding of basic interactions among elementary constituents of matter under extreme conditions.  In addition, the properties of the nonrelativistic electron-positron plasma will be studied.  The understanding gained will help guide the experimental efforts to create the electron-positron plasma in the laboratory and interpret the recent experimental data.</AbstractNarration>
