<AbstractNarration>The ubiquity of communications technology is becoming more evident&lt;br/&gt;every day. As the number of customers grows within each market, along&lt;br/&gt;with their demand for higher and higher data rates, the need to use &lt;br/&gt;available resources such as power and bandwidth as efficiently as possible &lt;br/&gt;becomes paramount. Typically a communications system that is operating near &lt;br/&gt;theoretical limits requires a receiver whose computational complexity&lt;br/&gt;is prohibitively large. To reduce complexity, it is common to linearize&lt;br/&gt;a portion of the receiver but this can severely reduce system performance&lt;br/&gt;relative to theoretical potential. However, there is a class of nonlinear&lt;br/&gt;receivers known as decision-feedback receivers whose complexity is essentially &lt;br/&gt;no more than that of linear receivers but whose performance is often much &lt;br/&gt;closer to that of optimal receivers.  This research explores the &lt;br/&gt;decision-feedback receiver structure as a practical means of realizing &lt;br/&gt;resource-efficient communications systems.  The research is also integrated &lt;br/&gt;into educational activities at all student levels. Aspects of the research &lt;br/&gt;are purposefully  introduced to undergraduate students in the classroom,&lt;br/&gt;during summer work programs, and through senior-level thesis advising. &lt;br/&gt;This prepares them both technically and motivationally to enter industry&lt;br/&gt;or to pursue further studies in graduate school. Graduate students are&lt;br/&gt;provided an environment conducive to doing quality research in the exciting &lt;br/&gt;field of communications, whether they choose careers in industry or academia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technical aspects of the research involve three components. First, it &lt;br/&gt;is determined, at least in principle, how to combine a decision-feedback &lt;br/&gt;receiver with error-control coding for a variety of important communications &lt;br/&gt;channels. Then, within these decision-feedback frameworks analytical &lt;br/&gt;relationships between available resources and system requirements are derived, &lt;br/&gt;and  resource-efficient systems are designed. Lastly, the transition is made &lt;br/&gt;from theoretical random codes to actual encoders and decoders that are &lt;br/&gt;simulated in software.  Together these investigations provide communications &lt;br/&gt;systems that are  highly efficient in regard to their conservation of &lt;br/&gt;resources, yet with low enough complexity to be amenable to implementation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
