<AbstractNarration> Mathematical Sciences (21)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is producing a video-based, team oriented set of activities designed to provide skills for students taking their first college level mathematics course, thus enhancing their chances of succeeding in the course as well as improving their learning in the course. The basis for this project is that students must be actively involved in teaching themselves, and therefore require training to more effectively do so.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The "Excellence Through Mathematics Communication and Collaboration" project is providing such training. Students are assigned to "Focus Teams" of 4 students who are given a set of 10 projects to be completed outside of normal class time involving the soft skills of learning mathematics such as note-taking skills, homework techniques, test preparation skills, and other basic mathematical skills (i.e., organization, logic, notation, and the ability to communicate mathematics verbally.) Each project is a self-contained unit. Projects are being presented on videotape and include written instructions, team exercises, and reports to turn in. Students are held accountable for attendance and participation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Outcomes from the project include (a) a set of 10 video-based projects along with written instructions, worksheets, and web components; (b) a guidebook with detailed instructions for faculty; (c) a pilot test of the project; (d) an evaluation/assessment plan for effectiveness of the project and a report of the results; and (e) dissemination of the project to the professional community.</AbstractNarration>
