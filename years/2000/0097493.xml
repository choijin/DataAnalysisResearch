    <AbstractNarration>The Undergraduate Research Experience in Molecular Biology and Bioinformatics will allow undergraduates to participate for three, nine week summer sessions (2001-2003) in molecular biology and bioinformatics (MBB) research projects. Research projects will encompass diverse fields of biology each using Molecular Biology and Bioinformatics research tools. Seven highly qualified undergraduates having a research interest in molecular biology and bioinformatics will enter the program from state and national institutions, with particular attention focused on the recruitment of students from underrepresented groups. The main objectives of this program are to: 1) provide students with the opportunity to conduct hands-on molecular biology research, 2) train students in bioinformatic methods and demonstrate the use of bioinformatics to aid in elucidating biological problems, 3) provide students with critical information on graduate school admissions and how to succeed in a research career and 4) raise awareness of ethical issues that emerge from molecular biology research. The program seeks to mentor students in the laboratory in order to develop technical and intellectual competence, which in turn encourages independence in the research environment. This REU site will not only enrich students with undergraduate research experience, but also promote careers in academic and industry research.</AbstractNarration>
