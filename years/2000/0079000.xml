<AbstractNarration>Nowak&lt;br/&gt;0079000&lt;br/&gt;     The investigator and his colleagues develop new theories for&lt;br/&gt;the emergence of communication and cooperation among individuals.&lt;br/&gt;They focus on theories to explain the evolutionary transitions&lt;br/&gt;from simple indexical signals through to iconic and referential&lt;br/&gt;signs and finally to symbols and syntax in human language.  These&lt;br/&gt;transitions are related to increases in fitness brought about&lt;br/&gt;through natural selection acting on communication strategies.&lt;br/&gt;They approach these problems using evolutionary game theory and&lt;br/&gt;population dynamics.  The technical objective is to discover&lt;br/&gt;evolutionarily stable solutions to language games, such that when&lt;br/&gt;all individuals adopt these solutions, no mutant behavior can&lt;br/&gt;invade the population under the influence of natural selection.&lt;br/&gt;The challenge is to characterize the dynamics of the language&lt;br/&gt;game by specifying a realistic set of strategies and payoffs, and&lt;br/&gt;then to analyze the stability properties and accessibility of the&lt;br/&gt;equilibrium solutions.  The mathematical equivalence of the&lt;br/&gt;game-theoretical replicator equation to the Lotka-Volterra&lt;br/&gt;equation offers a large tool box of techniques from nonlinear&lt;br/&gt;dynamics with which to explore the games.  They also aim to relate&lt;br/&gt;these results to findings in information theory, in particular&lt;br/&gt;the formulation due to Shannon and Weaver (1949).  Theoretical&lt;br/&gt;studies of language therefore provide a set of fascinating&lt;br/&gt;conceptual and technical challenges, as the strategies described&lt;br/&gt;with the models must be rich enough to capture the symbolic and&lt;br/&gt;open-ended properties of signals.&lt;br/&gt;     While cooperation and animal communication are both areas in&lt;br/&gt;which much important theoretical work has been conducted, few&lt;br/&gt;attempts have been made to bring them together.  The study of&lt;br/&gt;language provides an important focus for such a synthesis.&lt;br/&gt;Theoretical studies of the evolution of animal communication have&lt;br/&gt;stressed extravagant and costly ornamentation, using Darwin's&lt;br/&gt;theory of sexual selection, whereas evolutionary approaches to&lt;br/&gt;language tend to be represented by studies in historical&lt;br/&gt;linguistics within human societies.  It is the objective of this&lt;br/&gt;project to occupy the center ground and provide a theoretical&lt;br/&gt;bridge between these two disciplines.  Thus the work is neither a&lt;br/&gt;study of animal signals and cooperation nor a mathematical&lt;br/&gt;investigation of human syntax and grammar, but rather an attempt&lt;br/&gt;to reconstruct the continuous series of stages through which&lt;br/&gt;evolution might have proceeded from one to the other.  The project&lt;br/&gt;does not not attempt to explain the glorious intricacies of human&lt;br/&gt;grammar studied by linguists, such as in X-bar theory.  Instead it&lt;br/&gt;focusses on simple design features of animal communication and&lt;br/&gt;human language and attempts to describe their evolution in&lt;br/&gt;mathematical terms.  These probably antedated grammar, phrase&lt;br/&gt;structure, anaphora and related linguistic constructs, and&lt;br/&gt;thereby provide some biological foundations upon which these&lt;br/&gt;later concepts might rest.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
