<AbstractNarration>Abstract # 0070356 Integrated AFM-optical microscope (BioScope) for molecular and cell biology&lt;br/&gt;PI: Y. L. Lyubchenko, Arizona State University. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AFM is a novel technique that offers unique advantages with the potential for very high resolution imaging of macromolecules, their complexes and cells in the absence of stains, shadows, and labels.  AFM can be performed in air at ambient conditions or in aqueous solutions the latter being particularly important for resolving fully hydrated structures.  Recently, instruments which integrate AFM technology with an optical light microscope has permitted cells, microorganisms macromolecular complexes to be imaged with a resolution much greater than the ~200 nm resolution of the best optical microscopes. &lt;br/&gt;A BioScope AFM, an integrated Atomic Force Microscope/Optical Microscope will be used to study the structure of living cells and macromolecular assemblies and to follow biochemical processes in living as well as fixed cells, tissues, and developing organisms. This is one of the most powerful instruments used in cellular and structural biology and material science today.  Specifically, this integrated optical/AFM microscope will be able &lt;br/&gt;to locate with the optical microscope the area of interest; &lt;br/&gt;to obtain high resolution topographic images of cells, their components and macromolecular complexes; &lt;br/&gt;to combine optical and topographic characteristics of the samples;&lt;br/&gt;to follow the dynamics of living cells and their components.&lt;br/&gt;These new capabilities will allow more detailed structural and functional studies of a wide range of biological systems including a) the molecular structure of DNA during recombination, b) the structure and spectral properties of photosynthetic complexes in bacteria, c) surface reorganization of sperm just before fertilization of amphibian and mammalian eggs, d) the surface structure of pathogenic fungi, e) the mechanisms of viral interactions with cell surfaces, and f) surface characterization of biomimetic materials used in artificial organs and tissues.  In each case, this new imaging technique is expected to provide new insights into how cells interact with both biological and nonbiological surfaces.  The BioScope will be housed in the W. M. Keck Bioimaging Laboratory at Arizona State University and will be accessible to any interested party at the University, including faculty, postdoctoral researchers as well as graduate and undergraduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
