    <AbstractNarration>0001567&lt;br/&gt;Ammar&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description: This award is to support a collaborative project by Dr. Reda Ammar, Professor and Chairman of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Connecticut, Storrs, Connecticut, and Dr. Salwa Nassar, Professor and Head of Parallel and Distributed Systems Team, the Electronics Research Institute, Cairo, Egypt. They plan to investigate and develop distributed/ parallel computing techniques for processing real-time applications with extremely high data rate such as the high-speed ultrasound testing of steel pipes. Because of extreme data rates (e.g. multi-channel data sets arrive every 200-400 microseconds), and real-time response requirements for this class of applications, the processing methodology requires innovative approaches that utilize the capabilities of distributed/parallel systems. The work has three major thrusts: Development of a multi-layers performance model for real-time applications; development of a suitable pipelined methodology which can allow different stages of real-time application to be carried out in extreme data rate situations; and generic research in the area of effective application of high performance distributed, real-time technology to extremely high throughput data processing situations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scope: The US PI and the Egyptian collaborator have extensive experience in this area of research. The US investigator will focus on hierarchical performance modeling approach while the Egyptian PI will, with support from the US PI, investigate the potential mapping of the processing into the architecture. One post-doctorate from Egypt will work on the project at the University of Connecticut. This proposal meets the INT objective of supporting collaborative research in areas of mutual scientific interest. This project is being supported under the US-Egypt Joint Fund Program, which provides grants to scientists and engineers in both countries to carry out these cooperative activities.</AbstractNarration>
