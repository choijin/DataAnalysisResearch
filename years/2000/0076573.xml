    <AbstractNarration>0076573&lt;br/&gt;Heidaran&lt;br/&gt;This award provides support for the travel and conference registration fees of students and young investigators as participants in the conference Signal Transduction by Engineered Extracellular Matrices, Tilton, New Hampshire, June 25-29, 2000. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Gordon Conference discussed the converging roles of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and soluble factors for the repair or replacement of tissue lost or damaged due to disease or injury. Emphasis was placed on discussion of the state-of-the-art, unpublished research in signal transduction, the mechanisms by which growth factors and the ECM regulate cell fate, and their application to tissue engineering. Two roundtable discussions facilitated close interaction between researchers working in the fields of cytokine signal transduction, ECM, and tissue engineering. A workshop on career and research funding opportunities in these areas also was held. The meeting provided a platform for the development of long term interdisciplinary interactions, and exposed students and young professionals to the latest ideas and opportunities at the confluence of signal transduction, molecular and cellular biology, and tissue engineering.</AbstractNarration>
