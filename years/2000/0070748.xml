<AbstractNarration>This project will investigate (1) liftings and deformations&lt;br/&gt;of representations of finitely generated groups; and (2) the structure of the&lt;br/&gt;antiderivative closure of the field of rational complex functions, and its extensions&lt;br/&gt;and their groups of differential automorphisms.&lt;br/&gt;Regarding (1), a simple complex matrix representation of a finitely&lt;br/&gt;generated group is deformable if it extends to a representation in matrices over complex formal power series.  Such an extension exists if there is a compatible family of liftings of the representation&lt;br/&gt;to the finite dimensional quotients of formal power series.  Thus the&lt;br/&gt;extension problem can be viewed as a sequence of (relative) lifting problems. &lt;br/&gt;Each such lifting problem is obstructed by an element in a certain cohomology group of a module&lt;br/&gt;constructed from the original simple representation.  The proposed research will&lt;br/&gt;investigate the lifting problem by studying these cohomological elements. &lt;br/&gt;Regarding (2), the antiderivative closure of the field of rational functions is the&lt;br/&gt;maximal extension obtained by adjoining full sets of solutions of linear homogeneous ordinary&lt;br/&gt;differential equations whose solutions can be obtained by repeated antiderivatives.&lt;br/&gt;The group of differential automorphisms of such an extension is free prounipotent.&lt;br/&gt;The research will exploit this structure to describe the antiderivative closure&lt;br/&gt;directly in terms of the functions in the coordinate ring of the free prounipotent group. &lt;br/&gt;Antiderivative closures may not be antiderivative closed, so a tower of such closures&lt;br/&gt;may result. The research will analyze the differential Galois groups of the steps in&lt;br/&gt;this tower over the base field of rational functions.   These groups have a normal series with free &lt;br/&gt;prounipotent sections.  However, they are not known to be free prounipotent themselves. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Groups are objects that mathematically encode the concept of symmetry, and&lt;br/&gt;have been a mainstay in mathematics, chemistry, and elsewhere for over a&lt;br/&gt;century.  Representations of groups are realizations of groups as&lt;br/&gt;transformations of space.  A given group usually has infinitely many&lt;br/&gt;representations.   These can be organized into a geometrical set.  &lt;br/&gt;Representations which are not just isolated points of the set are called&lt;br/&gt;deformable.  This research is aimed at understanding deformable&lt;br/&gt;representations and their applications to group representations in&lt;br/&gt;mathematics, chemistry, and elsewhere.  Integral calculus deals with&lt;br/&gt;reconstructing a function, such as one describing the position of an&lt;br/&gt;object, from the instantaneous rates of change of the function; the&lt;br/&gt;reconstructed function is called an antiderivative.  The planned research&lt;br/&gt;can be viewed as a method to solve, in principle, and all at once, all the&lt;br/&gt;repeated integral calculus problems arising from polynomial functions.&lt;br/&gt;This would have many applications in calculus.</AbstractNarration>
