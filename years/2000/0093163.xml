    <AbstractNarration>There is a tremendous market for tetherless and ubiquitous network&lt;br/&gt;access, and a great demand for nomadic computation and&lt;br/&gt;communication. A major component of such a system is a high speed&lt;br/&gt;robust wireless local area network (WLAN) that provides services for a&lt;br/&gt;limited geographical area. This limited geographical area enables a&lt;br/&gt;large density of access points as well as high power tranmissions and&lt;br/&gt;opens up the possibility of high rate robust multimedia communications&lt;br/&gt;comparable to wired systems. Even though the bandwidth is still&lt;br/&gt;scarce, the spatial dimension can now be exploited: The size of&lt;br/&gt;typical WLAN devices, such as laptops and hand-held computers, enable&lt;br/&gt;proper spacing of multiple antennas to provide diversity and coding&lt;br/&gt;gains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is aimed at a complete system design for multiple&lt;br/&gt;antenna methods in the WLAN environment including coding, modulation,&lt;br/&gt;channel estimation and power control strategies specifically tailored&lt;br/&gt;for the slow fading environment of a WLAN channel. In particular,&lt;br/&gt;high-rate multiple antenna coded modulation techniques and multiple&lt;br/&gt;transmit antenna joint source and channel coding strategies are&lt;br/&gt;developed. The issue of channel estimation along with feedback is&lt;br/&gt;investigated and power control based on limited feedback is adressed.&lt;br/&gt;A general approach to multiple transmit antenna methods is explored by&lt;br/&gt;providing a theoretical foundation for spatially separated antennas in&lt;br/&gt;WLAN environments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The education plan is closely aligned with the research work and&lt;br/&gt;emphasises the use of internet and computers in education by making&lt;br/&gt;use of Polytechnic University's newly installed WLAN system on&lt;br/&gt;campus. Curriculum development addresses specific needs of&lt;br/&gt;Polytechnic's professional masters program and is based on an&lt;br/&gt;integrated, end-to-end approach to communication systems.</AbstractNarration>
