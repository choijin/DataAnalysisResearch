<AbstractNarration>0074653  Miller  The proposed research centers on the need to better understand the impact of bioaerosols on public health.  Bioaerosols are airborne particles that are living or originated from once-living organisms.  The complexity of this problem warrants a multidisciplinary approach, combining expertise in environmental engineering and microbiology.  The project consists of two synergistic components.  In the first component, the PI will gain expertise in microbiology through a combination of course work in environmental microbiology, a lab-based certification program in Public Health Microbiology, and supporting laboratory activities.  In the second component, the PI will conduct research with the support of established experts.  The objective of the research is to collect and assay air and settled house dust samples for endotoxin and gram-negative bacteria from homes.  This research is based on the hypothesis that air samples are a better correlate with human exposure to airborne allergens compared to house dust samples.  House dust samples are easier to collect and have been used extensively in previous asthma evaluations.  Results will support epidemiological studies of the causes of increasing asthma rates in children.  Support will be used to conduct exploratory work to determine the feasibility of a research thrust in bioaerosols.  The PI has a strong background in engineering and will gain access to new skills and expertise in bioaerosols through this award, allowing her to become an independent researcher in a new area of inquiry at a relatively early stage in her career. ***</AbstractNarration>
