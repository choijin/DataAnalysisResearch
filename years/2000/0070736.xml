    <AbstractNarration>The investigator and his students study capacity theory and its applications &lt;br/&gt;to arithmetic geometry. Capacity is a measure of size for sets, which arises &lt;br/&gt;in potential theory and has applications in probability, complex analysis, &lt;br/&gt;and number theory. The chief goal of this project is to prove a very strong &lt;br/&gt;version of the Fekete-Szego theorem on algebraic curves, which asserts that &lt;br/&gt;if an adelic set on a curve has large enough capacity, then there exist &lt;br/&gt;algebraic points with all their conjugates near it, in an adelic sense. &lt;br/&gt;The new theorem will be a basic existence theorem producing algebraic points &lt;br/&gt;which are subject to real and p-adic rationality conditions, as well as &lt;br/&gt;topological constraints. To fix ideas, for sets in the complex plane, the &lt;br/&gt;capacity of a circle turns out to equal its radius, and the capacity of a &lt;br/&gt;line segment is a quarter of its length. In analysis, the primary distinction &lt;br/&gt;is between sets of capacity 0 and sets of positive capacity: sets of &lt;br/&gt;capacity 0 are 'invisible' to holomorphic functions. In number theory, &lt;br/&gt;the main distinction is between sets of capacity greater than 1, and less &lt;br/&gt;than 1. The classical theorem of Fekete and Szego says that for a set in &lt;br/&gt;the complex plane stable under complex conjugation, if the capacity of the &lt;br/&gt;set is greater than 1, then every neighborhood of the set contains infinitely &lt;br/&gt;many Galois orbits of algebraic integers. David Cantor generalized the theorem &lt;br/&gt;to adelic sets on the projective line, and subsequently the investigator &lt;br/&gt;generalized it to adelic sets on algebraic curves. As an application, &lt;br/&gt;the investigator proved an existence theorem for algebraic integer points on &lt;br/&gt;affine algebraic varieties, which has been the object of considerable work by &lt;br/&gt;Moret-Bailly and Szpiro and their students. Earlier, Raphael Robinson had &lt;br/&gt;extended the Fekete-Szego theorem in another direction, showing that if a &lt;br/&gt;set of capacity greater than 1 were contained in the real line, then every &lt;br/&gt;real neighborhood contained infinitely many Galois orbits of totally real &lt;br/&gt;algebraic integers. Recently the investigator proved an adelic version of &lt;br/&gt;Robinson's theorem, proving the existence of algebraic numbers which were &lt;br/&gt;totally real and totally p-adic at a finite number of places. The goal of &lt;br/&gt;the project is to generalize this theorem to algebraic curves. The methods &lt;br/&gt;used will involve p-adic analysis, potential theory, and approximation theory &lt;br/&gt;for algebraic functions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study of diophantine equations (looking for integer solutions to &lt;br/&gt;polynomial equations in several variables) is a very old and very difficult &lt;br/&gt;subject, going back to the Greeks. It is only within the last half-century &lt;br/&gt;that much progress has been made, using methods of modern number theory. Two &lt;br/&gt;famous results were a negative solution to "Hilbert's Tenth problem" &lt;br/&gt;(by Matiyasevich in 1970), which asks if there is an algorithm for determining &lt;br/&gt;whether or not a given equation has integer solutions; and the negative &lt;br/&gt;resolution of Fermat's Last Theorem (by Wiles in 1995), which asks if sums of &lt;br/&gt;n-th powers of integers can be n-th powers. The investigator's work pursues &lt;br/&gt;a different direction, showing that for much larger arithmetic domains than &lt;br/&gt;the integers, under appropriate conditions there do exist solutions; and &lt;br/&gt;moreover there exist algorithms for telling whether or not they exist. &lt;br/&gt;The current work will considerably reduce the size of the domains where &lt;br/&gt;solutions are known to exist.</AbstractNarration>
