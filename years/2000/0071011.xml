<AbstractNarration>In previous work, the PI introduced the study of algebraic geometric&lt;br/&gt;codes over local Artinian rings, and the first main goal of this&lt;br/&gt;project is to further the understanding of these objects.  In&lt;br/&gt;particular, the investigator studies the minimum squared Euclidean&lt;br/&gt;weight of these codes.  This quantity is closely related to an&lt;br/&gt;exponential sum, where the sum is over points on the curve (defined&lt;br/&gt;over the ring) used in the construction of the code.  Thus, the&lt;br/&gt;question of the error-correcting capability of these codes is reduced&lt;br/&gt;to a question in number theory.  Results have already been obtained by&lt;br/&gt;the investigator and a colleague in the two special cases where the&lt;br/&gt;curve involved is either the Serre-Tate canonical lift of an ordinary&lt;br/&gt;elliptic curve or a plane curve with a single point at infinity.  The&lt;br/&gt;PI is continuing this work with the goal of studying the squared&lt;br/&gt;Euclidean weight and associated exponential sum for more general&lt;br/&gt;curves.  Additionally, the PI is working towards the development of a&lt;br/&gt;decoding algorithm for these codes, with respect to the squared&lt;br/&gt;Euclidean weight.  The second main goal of the project involves the&lt;br/&gt;search for a structure theory of codes, a topic which has been around&lt;br/&gt;almost from the beginning of the study of codes.  This search was&lt;br/&gt;largely unsuccessful until the introduction of so-called critical&lt;br/&gt;indecomposable codes in a recent paper of Assmus. The PI is developing&lt;br/&gt;this theory further and demonstrating its power by revisiting the&lt;br/&gt;classification of self-dual codes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whenever data is transmitted across a channel, errors are bound to&lt;br/&gt;occur.  The goal of coding theory is to find efficient ways of adding&lt;br/&gt;redundancy so that errors can be detected, or even corrected.  Two&lt;br/&gt;basic questions must be asked about every code: "What is the&lt;br/&gt;error-correcting capability of this code?" and "If an error occurs in&lt;br/&gt;transmission while using this code, is there an efficient way of&lt;br/&gt;recovering the original codeword?"  In the case that code is defined&lt;br/&gt;over the ring of integers modulo a power of a prime, the&lt;br/&gt;error-correcting capability of the code is measured in terms of the&lt;br/&gt;code's minimum squared Euclidean weight and the investigator studies&lt;br/&gt;this property in the case of algebraic geometric codes.  The problem&lt;br/&gt;of recovering the original codeword is equivalent to finding a&lt;br/&gt;decoding algorithm for the code, which has important connections to&lt;br/&gt;cryptography also.  Finally, a structure theory for codes allows the&lt;br/&gt;study of codes from a systematic point of view.  In particular,&lt;br/&gt;self-dual codes often achieve a good balance between error-correcting&lt;br/&gt;capability and efficiency, and a structure theory allows a new attack&lt;br/&gt;for the study of these objects.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
