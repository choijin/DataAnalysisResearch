<AbstractNarration>This project is devoted to a special class of chaotic dynamical systems,&lt;br/&gt;namely hyperbolic mathematical billiards. They serve as the prototype examples&lt;br/&gt;of non-uniformly hyperbolic dynamical systems with singularities. Such systems&lt;br/&gt;play an increasingly important role in the rigorous mathematical foundation of&lt;br/&gt;statistical physics, so that the study of their chaotic (i. e. mixing)&lt;br/&gt;properties is getting more and more physical relevance. The project mainly&lt;br/&gt;focuses on a fundamental conjecture regarding this family of dynamical&lt;br/&gt;systems, namely the celebrated "Boltzmann-Sinai Ergodic Conjecture", which&lt;br/&gt;states that any finite system of (totally elastic) hard spheres moving on a&lt;br/&gt;flat torus is fully hyperbolic and ergodic, of course, on the level set of its&lt;br/&gt;trivial first integrals. The proof of this conjecture (in its full generality)&lt;br/&gt;has been so far notoriously withstanding any attack against it. The first&lt;br/&gt;major part of the present proposal directly targets this conjecture. The&lt;br/&gt;second and fourth parts are blueprints for further research in this direction&lt;br/&gt;by generalizing the original Boltzmann-Sinai Conjecture to cylindric billiards&lt;br/&gt;(mathematical billiards with cylindric scatterers) and billiards in physically&lt;br/&gt;more relevant containers, like rectangular boxes. The third part of the project&lt;br/&gt;aims at the biggest open question in the topic of Wojtkowski's one-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;falling balls: Wojtkowski's still unsolved conjecture on the full hyperbolicity&lt;br/&gt;of the falling ball system with nonincreasing masses. (And such that not all&lt;br/&gt;masses are the same, of course.) Beside these, the question of ergodicity&lt;br/&gt;(possibly, under the condition that a strictly concave potential acts) is also&lt;br/&gt;posed and targeted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The foundation of statistical physics (like heat theory, dynamical theory&lt;br/&gt;of fluids and gases) took place in the last third of the 18th century, mainly&lt;br/&gt;by the groundbreaking works of Boltzmann and Helmholz. That foundation was,&lt;br/&gt;however, based upon a strong hypothesis made by Boltzmann himself. That&lt;br/&gt;hypothesis claims that any physical system with a huge number of interacting&lt;br/&gt;particles (like molecules) has the property that for any fixed total energy&lt;br/&gt;and initial state, the system will evolve to any other state with the same&lt;br/&gt;energy. Although this conjecture, if taken literally, mathematically cannot&lt;br/&gt;happen, yet the precise mathematical formalism and its rigorous verification&lt;br/&gt;for different models of statistical physics bears a particular importance to&lt;br/&gt;the understanding the physics of the surrounding world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
