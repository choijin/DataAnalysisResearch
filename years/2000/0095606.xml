<AbstractNarration>Project Description for "The Evolution of Bargaining Conventions" by&lt;br/&gt;Herbert Dawid and W. Bentley Macleod&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;         Legal scholars and economic historians have long recognized the&lt;br/&gt;importance of social conventions and norms for the efficient and smooth&lt;br/&gt;operation of the economy. For example, if an employee feels that his or&lt;br/&gt;her employer is fair, then conflict is reduced, and the individual will&lt;br/&gt;invest more into the relationship. However, it is extremely difficult to&lt;br/&gt;precisely define the notion of a fair convention.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;         One approach is to study the evolution of coventions in an&lt;br/&gt;explicit bargaining problem where individuals have to decide how to divide&lt;br/&gt;the gains from trade. The current literature has shown that the 50/50&lt;br/&gt;split is a stable convention in a variety of situations. That rule however&lt;br/&gt;does not reward individuals who may contribute more to a relationship, a&lt;br/&gt;point that Grossman and Hart argue may explain why ownership is structured&lt;br/&gt;to make one party a residual claimant to the profits of a firm. What has&lt;br/&gt;not been studied, and is the object of the current project, is the&lt;br/&gt;evolution of bargaining conventions in the presence of relationship&lt;br/&gt;specific investments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        We show that that the addition of relation specific investments&lt;br/&gt;can result in social conventions that are very different from the 50/50&lt;br/&gt;split. Moreover, this research addresses an important open question raised&lt;br/&gt;by Henry Hansmann and Reinier Kraakman, namely why is it efficient for&lt;br/&gt;ownership to be concentrated in the hands of a single individual or group.&lt;br/&gt;We show that depending upon the information structure, both ownership and&lt;br/&gt;the bargaining conventions evolve to a "fair rule" that encourages&lt;br/&gt;efficient relationship specific investments, and low levels of conflict.&lt;br/&gt;In particular, we demonstrate that it depends crucially on&lt;br/&gt;complementarities between the specific investments of the individuals&lt;br/&gt;whether such fair and efficient conventions are developed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        This work is theoretical and uses an abstract framework that might&lt;br/&gt;not be directly applicable in its current form. However, it does study the&lt;br/&gt;conditions that give rise to norms which encourage efficient behavior in a&lt;br/&gt;decentralized, anonymous economy.  Understanding the structure of&lt;br/&gt;efficient social norms may also have implications for the efficient&lt;br/&gt;running of exchange mediated through the internet. Elucidating the type of&lt;br/&gt;information needed to ensure efficient exchange in these cases may help us&lt;br/&gt;better understand the rules that need to be used in "New Economy" to&lt;br/&gt;ensure its continued success and growth.</AbstractNarration>
