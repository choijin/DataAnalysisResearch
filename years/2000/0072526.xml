<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;Nonparametric Bayesian Modelling&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nonparametric Bayesian models are motivated by the desire to more realistically&lt;br/&gt;model data.  They provide a means of escaping the strictures of parametric &lt;br/&gt;models, while, with their Bayesian nature, they allow the incorporation of some&lt;br/&gt;information about the process under investigation.  These philosophical &lt;br/&gt;advantages translate directly into superior performance for the models, which&lt;br/&gt;have had a particularly strong showing wherever random effects are involved.&lt;br/&gt;When these models are used in conjunction with the hierarchical model, they &lt;br/&gt;constitute a powerful modelling tool.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The current state of the art in nonparametric Bayesian modelling allows one to &lt;br/&gt;propose and fit models, and a limited amount of work has been done on selection&lt;br/&gt;of a model from some small set of candidate models.  The greater field of data&lt;br/&gt;analysis in this context is almost untouched.  The reason for this is that the &lt;br/&gt;current set of models do not allow for a sophisticated data analysis:  the &lt;br/&gt;iterative process of proposing a model, assessing its fit, developing a &lt;br/&gt;modification of the model to improve its fit, and reducing the model if no &lt;br/&gt;substantial improvement in fit is found.  The main focus of this work is to &lt;br/&gt;formulate and implement sophisticated nonparametric Bayesian data analysis.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To accomplish the above goal, this research proposal identifies five areas &lt;br/&gt;where nonparametric Bayesian models currently either perform poorly or cannot&lt;br/&gt;be used in a satisfactory, general fashion.  These areas are (i) examination&lt;br/&gt;of the relationship between covariates and response (ii) assessment of the fit&lt;br/&gt;of a model (iii) combination of information from related experiments (iv)&lt;br/&gt;modelling distributions with outliers and (v) working with small to moderate&lt;br/&gt;sample sizes.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the proposed research, the author will develop models that will show strong&lt;br/&gt;performance for each of the above problems.  The first class of models, &lt;br/&gt;dependent nonparametric processes, move beyond current models which are aimed&lt;br/&gt;at providing a description of a single random distribution.  They provide a &lt;br/&gt;means of modelling a collection of random distributions which exhibit strong&lt;br/&gt;local dependence and long-range independence.  This feature of the model makes &lt;br/&gt;it ideal for (i) - (iii) above.  The second class of models, contaminated &lt;br/&gt;models, directly targets the departure from a parametric model in a clear, &lt;br/&gt;easily interpretable fashion.  This type of model is ideal for describing &lt;br/&gt;distributions that contain outliers, and its close proximity to a parametric &lt;br/&gt;form will yield small sample performance that is nearly equivalent to the &lt;br/&gt;parametric model, providing an approach to problems (iv) and (v).  Additionally,&lt;br/&gt;the two types of models may be freely combined, resulting in a single, coherent &lt;br/&gt;approach to all five problems.  The basic theoretical properties of the models&lt;br/&gt;will be investigated, the computational strategies needed to fit the models&lt;br/&gt;will be devised, and the models will be applied in a variety of settings.  &lt;br/&gt;Throughout, the emphasis of the research will be on the development of sound&lt;br/&gt;data analytic strategies so that the theoretical and practical advantages&lt;br/&gt;of nonparametric Bayesian modelling can be realized.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
