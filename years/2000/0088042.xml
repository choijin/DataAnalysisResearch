<AbstractNarration>Interdisciplinary (99)&lt;br/&gt;We are developing an undergraduate optics facility to serve as a center for optics instruction and promote an enhanced understanding of optics across several areas in the college of science and math at Cal Poly. The facility is being used in the teaching of upper division physics and chemistry courses and increasingly for student and faculty research projects. The theme of the laboratory is optical metrology. This ranges through interferometric measurement of solid body deformation, optical characterization of surfaces and laser spectroscopy and determination of atomic linewidths. Not only does this tie in with the Polytechnic nature of our university, but by thematically developing the facility we also demonstrate the unity and commonalties of optical methods. For example, the resolution of optical systems and the determination of object deformation by speckle interferometry are both essentially diffraction limited phenomena. For the laboratory we will adopt, modify, and develop new experiments. Experiments that will be adopted include plane wave interference [Catunda et. al. Am. J. Phys. 66, 548 (1998)] and photon counting [Kocyk et. al. Am J. Phys. 64, 240 (1996)] in physics and radiative properties of ruby [Shoemaker et. al. "Experiments in Physics Chemistry" 6th Ed., McGraw-Hill (1996)] in chemistry. Other experiments will be adapted and modified to suit our student body. For example, in chemistry, beginning with a known fluorescence quenching experiment of the uranyl ion by the chloride ion [Halpern "Experimental Physical Chemistry" 2nd Ed. Prentice Hall (1997)] this experiment will be expanded to include micellar systems [Almgren et. al. Langmuir 12, 3855 (1996)] which is of relevance to our biochemistry majors. Some well known experiments will be adapted and made more quantitative by the use of modern electronic cameras and computers. Thus, the Abbe-Porter experiment on spatial filtering [Hecht "Optics" 3rd Ed. Addison Wesley (1997)] will be modified so that students can acquire and measure the spatially filtered images. This optics laboratory will also permit us to develop new experiments for the physics and chemistry majors to make use of recent material and technical advances. For example, an experiment to study the modulation transfer function of a liquid crystal light valve will be developed which will allow students to become familiar with this important topic within the confines of a three-hour laboratory. Other experiments that will be developed within this facility include (in chemistry) vibrational modes of molecules which will be measured by Raman scattering and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and compared to computational models and (in physics) measurement of atomic hyperfine structure [Rao et. al. Am. J. Phys. 66, 702 (1998)] and atom trapping. Because of the rapid pace of change in optical science and technology and the growing application of optical techniques across the physical and chemical sciences it is difficult to establish and maintain an up-to-date facility containing the instruments of modern optics. However, much of this instrumentation is now used in the workplace or graduate school and it is necessary to provide training in optics to a large number of students from different disciplines. With this facility we will be able to give in-depth training to the students in 'optics' courses (e.g. laser applications), provide experiments for courses with large optics components (e.g. surface science) and give exposure to students in other areas. By centralizing the equipment and flexibly scheduling use of the laboratory we will be able to maximize its impact on the largest number of students and facilitate the interaction of faculty from different disciplines. We estimate that about 200 students/year will directly benefit from this facility. Also, because engineering students frequently take upper-division physics and chemistry classes, the facility will have an effect well beyond the College of Science and Mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
