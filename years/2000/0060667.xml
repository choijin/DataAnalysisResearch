<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovative Research Program (SBIR) Phase I involving Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) fuel cells offers a unique opportunity to create zero and ultra-low emission vehicles.  While current nickel or noble metal catalysts used in the reformer of PEM fuel cells are effective for the steam reforming, they are very sensitive to sulfur poisoning and also deactivate by coke deposition.  This research will effort will develop a new, sulfur-tolerant catalyst with low coking and low cost for gasoline steam reforming.  TDA Research, Inc. (TDA) has identified a novel sulfur-tolerant catalyst for gasoline steam reforming to generate hydrogen for PEM fuel cells.  In this program TDA will prepare and evaluate this catalyst, using an existing automated steam reforming reaction system to test our catalyst.  The Phase I work will include an engineering analysis to assess the effect of the catalyst on sulfur poisoning, coke deposition and processing costs as well as the cost of producing the catalyst.  The catalytic activity of TDA's catalyst will be measured in the presence and absence of H2S.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A successful project will result in the production of sulfur tolerant and coking resistant catalysts for the fuel processor of PEM fuel cells.  PEM fuel cells are suited for automobiles applications where quick startup is required, and are the primary candidates for use in light-duty vehicles.  They will create zero and ultra-low emission vehicles.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
