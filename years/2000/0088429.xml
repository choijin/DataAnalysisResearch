<AbstractNarration>Physics (13) A joint University of Virginia physics-engineering task force has recommended on the basis of the ABET 2000 criteria a restructuring of the two semester problem session/introductory physics labs for 450 engineering students. The results of physics education research in the 1990s indicate that there should be more reliance on computer-based tools and new methods of instruction and grading. The project is adopting the Real Time Physics curriculum as the basis for a new two hour per week workshop/laboratory in mechanics, heat and thermodynamics, and electromagnetism. In addition, the project is adapting and implementing as many exemplary commercial products as possible, but utilizing these products in innovative ways. Assessment and evaluation will be crucial in order both to improve the workshop experience for students and to educate them in the best way possible. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; There previously was no lab experience for the first semester course. The project is combining the former problem recitation session and laboratory (second semester only) into a workshop that consists of &lt;br/&gt;a) A pre-workshop activity utilizing the internet based WebAssign program to present a series of conceptual and numerical problems to prepare the students for the two hour workshop.&lt;br/&gt;b) Utilizing Real Time Physics as the laboratory experience with computer tools (probes and software) to engage students in active learning. There will be new computers for the cooperative learning groups and probes from PASCO and Vernier. &lt;br/&gt;c) A post workshop activity using peer ranking essay questions on WebAssign that test the students understanding of the concepts presented in the workshop. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
