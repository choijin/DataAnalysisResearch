    <AbstractNarration>The Southeast Center for Networking and Information Technology Education &lt;br/&gt;(the Center) is promoting the development of curricula, processes, and infrastructure to improve programs and 'create a statewide delivery system to educate and train technicians to meet workforce shortages in computer networking and information technology (IT). The Center involves a statewide partnership of educational institutions (two community colleges, three school systems and two state universities) and industry participants. The Center is jointly managed by Daytona Community College and Seminole Community College. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center is working to achieve the following objectives and outcomes:&lt;br/&gt;(a) Incorporate best-of-breed IT workforce curricula with current industry certification requirements to develop integrated networking and IT curricula that provide seamless K-1 6 articulation with multiple occupational exit points and incumbent worker education opportunities. &lt;br/&gt;(b) Develop and conduct Teach the Teacher (T3) in-service and faculty development in a technologically-integrated format to disseminate IT instructional resources and facilitate curricula adaptation and course delivery. &lt;br/&gt;(c) Leverage industry partnerships to provide ongoing support to the Center, determine training requirements, create and validate curricula, and provide student and faculty internships. &lt;br/&gt;(d) Encourage diversity in the workforce by developing marketing collateral to be used by&lt;br/&gt;educational institutions to generate IT career awareness and recruit students from under-represented populations, i.e. women, minorities, and non-traditional students.</AbstractNarration>
