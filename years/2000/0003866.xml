<AbstractNarration>This project supports an innovative form of the Athabaskan Languages Conference, an annual conference which brings together researchers, teachers and members of Athabaskan-speaking communities to stimulate each other toward continual improvement in linguistic research, Athabaskan language pedagogy, and minority and endangered language retention methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Athabaskan language family is spread over a large area of North America, with concentrations in Western Canada, Alaska, the west coast of the United States, and the Southwest. With the possible exception of Navajo, all the Athabaskan languages are both highly endangered and incompletely researched.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2001 Athabaskan Languages Conference will be hosted by the UCLA Department of Linguistics, May 18-20, 2001. Papers are solicited in all areas of Athabaskanist inquiry. Organized sessions will focus on Language and Pedagogy, Language and Theory, New Data, and Community-Academy Relations. A special workshop on the instrumental analysis of voice quality is planned for Sunday, May 20, 2001. Researchers and teachers will learn from experts in acoustic and articulatory phonetics about how to measure subtle effects in their data which may previously have gone undescribed. A formal call for papers will be issued in January, with a submission deadline of March 2, 2001.</AbstractNarration>
