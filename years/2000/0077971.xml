    <AbstractNarration>Wang&lt;br/&gt;0077971&lt;br/&gt; ATP (adenosine triphosphate) is the universal chemical&lt;br/&gt;energy molecule in all living cells. ATP driven protein motors&lt;br/&gt;play a central role in many cell functions. For example, kinesin&lt;br/&gt;drives intracellular vesicle transportation and moves chromosomes&lt;br/&gt;during mitosis; myosin drives muscle contraction, and the&lt;br/&gt;V-ATPases regulate intracellular acidity. Understanding the&lt;br/&gt;operating principles of the ATP driven motors is crucial to&lt;br/&gt;comprehending intracellular protein transport and cell motility.&lt;br/&gt;Structural studies are providing the atomic details of motor&lt;br/&gt;proteins, and are revealing more information about the&lt;br/&gt;conformational changes associated with the chemical reactions&lt;br/&gt;they catalyze. Current experimental technologies permit measuring&lt;br/&gt;forces of a single protein motor with piconewton precision and&lt;br/&gt;motions with nanometer resolution. These advances, along with&lt;br/&gt;advances in mathematical modeling and computer power, make it&lt;br/&gt;possible to explore the mechanochemical energy transduction in&lt;br/&gt;molecular motors in unprecedented detail. In this project, the&lt;br/&gt;investigator and colleagues pursue the mathematical and physical&lt;br/&gt;issues that arose in the previous studies of F1 ATPase. These&lt;br/&gt;concern the molecular details of how protein motors should be&lt;br/&gt;modeled and what mathematical formulations are adequate for&lt;br/&gt;modeling them. In particular, the study focuses on the mechanism&lt;br/&gt;of force generation at the catalytic site during the ATP&lt;br/&gt;hydrolysis cycle. Resolution of this key process will illuminate&lt;br/&gt;the operating principles of this ATP driven motor, and likely&lt;br/&gt;other protein motors as well. To accommodate more sophisticated&lt;br/&gt;modeling, the investigator develops methods for analyzing protein&lt;br/&gt;structures and solving complex model equations. The results of&lt;br/&gt;these studies set the stage for modeling the mechanochemical&lt;br/&gt;energy transduction in myosin and kinesin dimers. The approach is&lt;br/&gt;to model the continuous stochastic motion of the motor using&lt;br/&gt;stochastic differential equations and couple these to the&lt;br/&gt;chemical reactions described by discrete Markov processes. The&lt;br/&gt;model equations are constructed from basic physical principles,&lt;br/&gt;structural data, and biochemical and biophysical measurements.&lt;br/&gt;These equations are then analyzed numerically. The hope is that&lt;br/&gt;this will lead to a unified view of ATP driven motors.&lt;br/&gt; To facilitate the fast growing field of biotechnology, it is&lt;br/&gt;necessary to deduce concise mechanisms for biological systems&lt;br/&gt;from experimental results. This requires the application of&lt;br/&gt;fundamental principles from the mathematical and physical&lt;br/&gt;sciences. The purpose of this interdisciplinary project is to&lt;br/&gt;study the mechanisms by which proteins use chemical energy to&lt;br/&gt;generate mechanical forces. In turn, these forces drive a wide&lt;br/&gt;variety of cellular processes essential to life. In all living&lt;br/&gt;cells, the universal chemical energy molecule is ATP (adenosine&lt;br/&gt;triphosphate). ATP is produced using the energy extracted from&lt;br/&gt;food, and the life of every cell depends on processes that are&lt;br/&gt;powered by ATP. For example, muscle contraction is directly&lt;br/&gt;driven by the ATP protein motor myosin. Therefore, understanding&lt;br/&gt;the operating principles of the ATP protein motors is central to&lt;br/&gt;comprehending the life of cells.</AbstractNarration>
