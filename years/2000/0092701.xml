<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;The PI's objective of the proposed research activities is to examine the mechanism of gene transfer from a tissue engineering scaffold by developing a novel system designed to deliver the DNA directly to the cell microenvironment. Gene therapy approaches have expanded into applications for wound healing and tissue regeneration, but therapies are limited by the inability to efficiently delivery DNA. Tissue engineering scaffolds have demonstrated an enhanced delivery; however, an understanding of the mechanism of gene uptake would provide fundamental design parameters necessary to optimize gene transfer. His hypothesis to be tested is that delivery from the scaffold to which cells are adhered enhances uptake due to direct release into the cell microenvironment. To test this hypothesis, they propose to ionically complex non-viral DNA with a cationic peptide and to subsequently localize the DNA to the adhesion surface by tethering the peptide to a hydrogel. The development of a system with controlled, efficient gene delivery would impact the fields of wound healing, tissue engineering, and gene therapy, and would find application to basic studies of cell processes.&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the proposed educational activities is centered on the development of&lt;br/&gt;educational tools for elementary, high school, and college students, which can be widely&lt;br/&gt;distributed through an established infrastructure at Northwestern. Cellular processes and&lt;br/&gt;biological systems serve as the basis to attract student interest. At the elementary level, events are designed for a Science Olympiad in which students apply the scientific method and get hands-on experience. The events are phrased in terms of biological phenomenon; however, the concepts are centered on the physical sciences, which is an area in which students frequently struggle.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
