<AbstractNarration>This project will develop an explicit formal system for the learning of phonologies, capable of inferring&lt;br/&gt;lexical representations, deducing constituency and other nonovert structure from overt observables, and&lt;br/&gt;constructing the mapping between lexical forms and the grammar's output.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary formal problem to be attacked is the mutual entanglement of constituent structure,&lt;br/&gt;phonological mappings and phonological lexical representations. A language learner has direct access to&lt;br/&gt;none of these; they must be inferred from positive overt data. However, the three are tightly interrelated.&lt;br/&gt;The correct phonological mapping depends upon the structural analysis assigned to overt forms by the&lt;br/&gt;target grammar as well as on the lexical representations taken to underlie the overt forms. Assigning the&lt;br/&gt;correct structural analysis to an ambiguous overt form requires some grasp of what the correct phonological&lt;br/&gt;mapping is like, as does the induction of underlying forms. In the face of these entanglements, a successful&lt;br/&gt;solution to the full learning problem must work on all three simultaneously, using progress on one to&lt;br/&gt;achieve further progress on the others, ultimately arriving at the correct conclusion for each.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will build on existing work solving important subproblems within phonological learning&lt;br/&gt;under Optimality Theory (OT). In prior work, learning algorithms have been developed for OT systems in&lt;br/&gt;which there are mutual entanglements between constituent structural analysis and phonological mapping,&lt;br/&gt;but in which lexical representations need not be learned. The new research proposed here will extend and&lt;br/&gt;generalize these approaches so that they may apply to systems which require non-trivial learning of lexical&lt;br/&gt;representations. This requires the addition of significant further structure to the learning and processing&lt;br/&gt;algorithms: a lexicon must be constructed and maintained, the parsing algorithms which assign analyses to&lt;br/&gt;overt data must be expanded to make use of the lexical representations, and the learner must have&lt;br/&gt;procedures for hypothesizing and adjusting lexical representations. The basic algorithms for learning&lt;br/&gt;mappings will also be modified to ensure learning of phonotactic distributions as a preliminary to the&lt;br/&gt;analysis of lexical relations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigations will begin with metrical stress grammars, including those with rich morphophonemic&lt;br/&gt;relations dependent on underlying contrasts in stress and quantity. An important part of the project will be&lt;br/&gt;the construction, as targets for learning, of constraint systems that plausibly capture phenomena requiring&lt;br/&gt;the nontrivial interaction between lexical representations and phonological mappings. Extensive survey&lt;br/&gt;and analysis of the targeted linguistic generalizations will be required to establish the empirical basis of the&lt;br/&gt;learner's goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed learning algorithms will be tested and evaluated via both formal analysis and computer&lt;br/&gt;simulations. Given that the property of mutual entanglement of analysis and mapping is not particular to&lt;br/&gt;phonology, but is endemic to the problem of learning from observable data in all linguistic domains, the&lt;br/&gt;results of this research are expected to provide insight into how language learning must proceed in general.</AbstractNarration>
