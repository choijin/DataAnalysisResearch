<AbstractNarration>In this preliminary research project, large arrays of Micro Electromechanical Systems (MEMS) with programmable electrodes and electromagnets will be used to achieve microscale positioning of particles, whiskers, and chopped fibers in polymer matrix multi-functional materials. The  research will enhance the understanding of the electro-magneto-mechanical interactions of particles in thin layers of liquid polymer undergoing solidification and curing.  The preliminary research task is to establish whether particles at this scale can be patterned by rearrangement in response to electric and magnetic fields.  Currently there is no way to affordably position particles and whiskers in microscale patterns in composite materials. The research is thus a critical enabling technology that will provide an affordable method to pattern two or more types of particles into unit cells.  Such patterning will reduce the concentration of stress, electric field, and magnetic field, thereby leading to materials with improved threshold properties such as mechanical strength, electric breakdown field, and magnetic saturation field.  These three threshold properties will be tested in patterned microstructures, and the results will be compared with random particle arrangements. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the feasibility of this method is established, it is expected that this novel process would then provide an affordable way to make massive arrays of electrodes and electromagnets with features as small as one micrometer at low unit cost based upon photolithography methods.  The MEMS arrays are designed to be reusable, as they are not part of the finished product.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
