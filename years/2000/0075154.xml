<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT:&lt;br/&gt;   The general aim of this project is to study the structure of positive &lt;br/&gt;closed currents supported by topologically thin pseudoconcave sets, focusing &lt;br/&gt;primarilly on the relationship between properties of currents and their &lt;br/&gt;supports. Topologically thin sets in two complex dimensions are those fibered &lt;br/&gt;along  nowhere dense sets by a family of complex lines; their most important &lt;br/&gt;subclass is formed by pluripolar pseudoconvex ones. The specific questions to &lt;br/&gt;be considered group around the problems of characterization of supports of &lt;br/&gt;positive closed currents, characterization of positive closed currents in &lt;br/&gt;topological terms, uniqueness phenomena  for positive closed currents, and &lt;br/&gt;related problems of branching structure of thin pseudoconcave sets. Problems &lt;br/&gt;involving the branching structure concern analogs of the mondromy group for &lt;br/&gt;thin pseudoconcave sets and properties of the order structure on the reduced &lt;br/&gt;homology group of the complement of the set in the ambient complex projective &lt;br/&gt;space.&lt;br/&gt;   In the general context the problems addressed in this project concern the &lt;br/&gt;the structure of currents with the singular supports. Currents are &lt;br/&gt;generalizations of distributions to the geometrical setting and, as such, are&lt;br/&gt;useful to analize low regularity phenomena that are studied with increasing&lt;br/&gt;frequency in modern science. The broader aim of this project is to contribute &lt;br/&gt;to the understanding of the notion of current and to increase its applica- &lt;br/&gt;bility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
