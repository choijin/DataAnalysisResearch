    <AbstractNarration>The object of this project is to educate biotechnologists who not only understand how to perform sophisticated techniques, but who also can more quickly provide their employers with improved productivity because they understand the molecular theory behind these &lt;br/&gt;laboratory procedures. Two major concerns being addressed by the project are insufficient scientific preparedness of high school graduates entering two-year technical programs and the need for structured involvement of industrial and academic laboratories in the education of these technicians.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To address these concerns, the project is: &lt;br/&gt;a. aligning the secondary school requirements with post-secondary education biotechnology curriculum; &lt;br/&gt;b. familiarizing secondary teachers with current techniques in the field as they pertain to the high school curriculum; &lt;br/&gt;c. providing opportunities for high school classes to conduct laboratory exercises using materials and/or equipment unavailable in high school laboratories;&lt;br/&gt;d. developing summer courses for potential biotechnology students; &lt;br/&gt;e. involving academic and industrial partners in student training and curricula development; and&lt;br/&gt;f. ensuring access for groups underrepresented in this field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The methods are improving science education at the secondary level, helping to satisfy the needs of industry and academic laboratories for qualified technicians, and broadening the participation of underrepresented groups in this field including women, persons with disabilities, and students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds in rural New England.</AbstractNarration>
