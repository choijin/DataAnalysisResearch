<AbstractNarration>Abstract Thompson &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; A confocal laser scanning imaging system will be used by faculty, graduate students, undergraduates and visitors to Stanford University's Hopkins Marine Station.  The equipment includes a Zeiss Axiovert SI00 inverted microscope and a Noran Oz confocal scanning system.This equipment will: I) Enhance ongoing faculty research, 2) Promote new research activities, 3) Promote the training of graduate and post-doctoral students in modern methods of optical microscopy in a way that will enhance their research and career&lt;br/&gt;development, and 4) Strengthen ongoing efforts to permit undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;students access to the lasted research techniques.&lt;br/&gt; The confocal imaging system will be used by four principle investigators&lt;br/&gt;to address a number of cell biological questions using methods ranging from&lt;br/&gt;ion imaging, sophisticated fluorescence microscopy, high resolution&lt;br/&gt;Nomarski DIC,  to morphometry.  One group is investigating the spatial and&lt;br/&gt;temporal aspects of second messenger signaling in neurons following the&lt;br/&gt;activation of surface receptors by neurotransmitters, including the&lt;br/&gt;dynamics of Ca2+ and NO signals.  A second group is investigating the&lt;br/&gt;development and biophysical properties of motor systems in the squid using&lt;br/&gt;neuroanatomical and immunocytochemical methods.  A third study focuses on&lt;br/&gt;the specializations of fish heater organs and cardiac cells using&lt;br/&gt;immunocytochemistry and antibodies specific for different isoforms of Ca&lt;br/&gt;pumps and myosin  ATPase.  The fourth group uses fluorescence imaging&lt;br/&gt;techniques to investigate the time course and spatial pattern of NO and&lt;br/&gt;Ca2+ during fertilization of the sea urchin egg. &lt;br/&gt; The principle investigators are addressing questions at the leading edge&lt;br/&gt;of their disciplines.  This shared confocal microscopy center adds&lt;br/&gt;substantially to their ability to further their science, enhances their&lt;br/&gt;teaching efforts, and increases collaboration with Stanford colleagues and&lt;br/&gt;visitors from other institutions.  This is in keeping with the role of the&lt;br/&gt;Hopkins Marine Station as a regional center for marine biology research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
