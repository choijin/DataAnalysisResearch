<AbstractNarration>Abstract.  Problems of Complex Analysis Arising in Complex Dynamics&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research of this proposal applies the methods of complex analysis to&lt;br/&gt;several  problems of dynamical systems in the complex domain.  The dynamics&lt;br/&gt;of a polynomial map of the complex plane  C  has been studied in depth and&lt;br/&gt;has produced a theory which is both a beautiful and compelling model for&lt;br/&gt;many systems in nature.  The dynamics of polynomial mappings of&lt;br/&gt;two-dimensional complex space  C^2  should produce a theory with equal&lt;br/&gt;beauty and utility.   The work of this project includes three parts:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1.  The first objective is to study mappings which are quasi-hyperbolic, a&lt;br/&gt;condition which is more general and will be more easily verified than the&lt;br/&gt;more traditional condition of (uniform) hyperbolicity.  At the same time,&lt;br/&gt;the quasi-hyperbolic mappings have expansion/contraction properties which&lt;br/&gt;makes them&lt;br/&gt;understandable in a way similar to hyperbolic mappings.  The corresponding&lt;br/&gt;dynamical sets will be shown to have bounded geometry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2.  A second objective is to apply these complex methods to the study of&lt;br/&gt;polynomial difffeomorphisms of the real plane.  This will give a new&lt;br/&gt;approach that will give results not easily obtained with purely real methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3.  The third objective is to understand the nature of parameter space, the&lt;br/&gt;space of all mappings.  A particular focus will be on the connectedness&lt;br/&gt;locus, which is a higher-dimensional analogue of the Mandelbrot set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In each of these cases, the methodology involves the further development of&lt;br/&gt;mathematical techniques from complex analysis: analytic functions and&lt;br/&gt;varieties, harmonic measure, pluri-potential theory, and the geometric&lt;br/&gt;theory of currents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
