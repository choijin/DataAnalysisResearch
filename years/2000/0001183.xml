<AbstractNarration>0001183&lt;br/&gt;Malin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project involves a near-surface 3D geophysical investigation of the drill site area near Parkfield, CA for the San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth (SAFOD).  Major portions of the fieldwork and data analysis will include advanced training of students in the investigation methods and extensive interactions between industry, government, and the universities involved in the investigation.  The scientific purpose of the investigation will be to further characterize the near-surface fault and basin structure of the site.  Knowledge of the near-surface structure is essential for interpreting the results of the deeper drilling and more regional geophysical investigations that are currently planned.  In addition,  these data will help to establish some of the near surface complications the drilling effort may encounter.  The geophysical methods to be included in the site investigation are potential field and field gradient profiling, seismic profiling, magnetic field survey, and radar profiling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The drill site investigation will be conducted as part of an advanced, multi-university near-surface geophysics field camp and seminar.  The camp will also be used as a focus for industry-university-government cooperation and interaction on the SAFOD project.  The camp will primarily include students from Duke, Stanford and UC Berkeley, but will also be open to students from Questa College Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, and other institutions participating in the SAFOD effort.  The educational purpose of the field camp will be two fold:  1)  to demonstrate the techniques and value of 3D geophysical surveying and data; and 2) to acquaint a large group of students with the scientific objectives and research possibilities of the SAFOD program.  By sharing the data in an open and coordinated fashion between each of the participating institutions, it is hoped that several competing models of the drill site will emerge, with the ultimate test being provided by the drilling itself.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
