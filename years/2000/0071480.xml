<AbstractNarration>Proposal:  DMS-0071480&lt;br/&gt;PI: Nikolai Saveliev&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A major obstruction to using the Floer homology to study 3-dimensional &lt;br/&gt;manifolds is the lack of clear understanding of its behavior with respect to &lt;br/&gt;the standard constructions of 3-dimensional topology, such as Dehn surgery, &lt;br/&gt;connected sums etc. The known results in this direction have not made much &lt;br/&gt;of headway in Floer homology computations or applications. The main thesis of &lt;br/&gt;the investigator is that the operation with respect to which the Floer homology&lt;br/&gt;behaves most naturally is the branched covering. Therefore, the investigator &lt;br/&gt;studies gauge theory on 3-manifolds with group actions and relates &lt;br/&gt;gauge-theoretical invariants to the classical invariants of the branch set. &lt;br/&gt;As an example, his previous study of equivariant gauge theory on the links of &lt;br/&gt;quasi-homogeneous surface singularities has led to a closed form formula &lt;br/&gt;expressing their Floer homology in terms of classical invariants. The &lt;br/&gt;investigator introduces and studies an equivariant Casson invariant for an &lt;br/&gt;integral homology sphere with a cyclic group action and relates it to the &lt;br/&gt;classical Casson invariant and the knot signatures. The definition makes use &lt;br/&gt;of the equivariant gauge theory and, in particular, of the equivariant Floer &lt;br/&gt;index. The latter is closely related, in the case of anti-holomorphic &lt;br/&gt;involutions, to the topology of Stein surfaces and the non-compact Kaehler &lt;br/&gt;geometry. The investigator also continues his study of the links of complete&lt;br/&gt;intersection singularities, and the relevance of the equivariant Casson &lt;br/&gt;invariant to homology cobordisms and the triangulation conjecture for &lt;br/&gt;topological manifolds in dimensions five and higher. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research is a study of 3- and 4-dimensional manifolds by the methods of &lt;br/&gt;gauge theory, coming from theoretical physics. In the last two decades, these &lt;br/&gt;methods brought new life into the classical low dimensional topology, leading &lt;br/&gt;to many spectacular developments and to the solutions of many difficult &lt;br/&gt;problems. The area was revolutionized to the point that the state of knowledge&lt;br/&gt;of two decades ago looks now, in many aspects, like a desert of nearly &lt;br/&gt;complete ignorance. Manifolds of dimension four were the ones that benefited &lt;br/&gt;the most: gauge theory methods worked very efficiently in this setting. At &lt;br/&gt;the same time, their analogue in dimension three, which is known as the Floer &lt;br/&gt;homology, is yet to reveal its full potential. The Floer homology is in the &lt;br/&gt;focus of investigator's research efforts.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
