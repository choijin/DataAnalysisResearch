<AbstractNarration>Theoretical studies will be conducted on the fundamental physics of various low-dimensional systems.  Systems to be considered include heterogeneous magneto-conducting and magneto-superconducting systems, and ensembles of nano-scale magnetic clusters.  These systems are presently being produced in forefront physics and chemistry laboratories, but their physical properties have not been studied extensively.  One can expect new topological defects, a rich spectrum of ordered and disordered states, and new transport and dynamical phenomena.  Also, a host of applications are suggested, including very dense and reliable memory, sensors, magnetic transistors and other magneto-transport devices, as well as quantum generators.  Collaborations have been established with experimental and theoretical groups in the US and Europe.&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;Theoretical studies will be conducted on the fundamental physics of various low-dimensional systems.
