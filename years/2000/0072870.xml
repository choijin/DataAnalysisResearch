<AbstractNarration>Modern processors improve instruction level parallelism by speculation. The outcome of data and control decisions is predicted, and the operations are speculatively executed and only committed if the original predictions were correct. There are a number of other ways that processor resources could be used, such as threading or eager execution.  As the use of speculation increases, more processors will need some form of speculation control to balance the benefits of speculation against other possible activities.  This research examines a set of microarchitectural features that can benefit from speculation control, including trace formation; instruction fetch management, execution resource management and memory access prioritization.  The research also explores how out-of-order processor designs can use multi-voltage levels to reduce energy, and how the processor can provide feedback to an operating system that further controls energy use via dynamic voltage scaling.  This work is done using a microarchitectural model that supports multithreading and multiprocessor simulations. This work is part of a broader effort that includes experimentation with existing computers, design and modification of operating systems for energy efficiency and the adoption of microarchitectural models designed for comparing energy efficient processor designs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
