<AbstractNarration>DMS-0072667&lt;br/&gt;Allen I. Knutson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Allen Knutson's proposed work is about Schubert calculus &lt;br/&gt;on flag manifolds, which combinatorially is about counting &lt;br/&gt;the (obviously nonnegative) number of flags satisfying a &lt;br/&gt;list of intersection conditions with other flags, and is &lt;br/&gt;computable as a (not obviously nonnegative) integral over &lt;br/&gt;a flag manifold.  The main question in the field concerns &lt;br/&gt;finding a totally-positive combinatorial formula rather than &lt;br/&gt;the alternating sum.  His work with Dr. Terence Tao on the &lt;br/&gt;case of single subspaces, refining totally-positive formulae &lt;br/&gt;already known and solving long-standing conjectures in that &lt;br/&gt;relatively simple case, has suggested new lines of attack &lt;br/&gt;on the general problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Given four straight lines (picture them as blue) drawn in &lt;br/&gt;space, in generic directions, how many other straight lines &lt;br/&gt;(picture them as red) touch all four?  In special cases &lt;br/&gt;there are many, but generically there are exactly two&lt;br/&gt;such red lines. This is the first interesting case of a &lt;br/&gt;general problem counting the number of flat subspaces &lt;br/&gt;(in this case one-dimensional) intersecting a number of &lt;br/&gt;other subspaces (which can even be curved).  Computers &lt;br/&gt;can determine this obviously nonnegative number in any &lt;br/&gt;given case, but do so by adding many large positive and &lt;br/&gt;negative numbers together -- in particular it is difficult &lt;br/&gt;to determine easily if the number is zero.  Also many &lt;br/&gt;interesting cases in engineering are beyond the reach &lt;br/&gt;of computers.  Dr. Knutson's work concerns the search for &lt;br/&gt;a manifestly positive formula for these (no cancelation), &lt;br/&gt;which in particular would make it much more straightforward&lt;br/&gt;to determine which such problems have any solutions at all. &lt;br/&gt;Under previous NSF support he and Dr. Terence Tao already&lt;br/&gt;determined this positivity criterion in a famous subcase &lt;br/&gt;of the general problem.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
