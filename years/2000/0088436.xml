<AbstractNarration>Biological Sciences (61) Student learning can be enhanced by engaging the student and by providing an appropriate context for learning. This can be accomplished by developing investigative exercises that require student participation in experimental design and provide realistic research experience. An inquiry-based approach also moves away from the once-standard "cookbook" approach to teaching experimental protocols. If the student must plan the course of the experiment, s/he is required to think about individual steps rather than simply following directions. This project is carrying the investigative approach one step further: linking investigative activities in the laboratory sessions for two courses frequently taken by the same students, Molecular Biology and Biochemistry. These courses form the core of the Biochemistry and Molecular Biology major and minor at Wittenberg University. Co-ordination of the laboratory exercises of these two courses is centered on an investigation of the relationships among gene sequence, protein sequence, protein structure, and protein stability using Staphylococcal nuclease, a small compact, well-defined protein, as a model system. Students identify appropriate regions of Staphylococcal nuclease for mutagenesis, complete mutagenesis and sequence determination of the variants, and sub-clone the variant sequences into an expression vector in the Molecular Biology laboratory. They continue their investigation in the Biochemistry laboratory through protein purification and analysis of the purified mutant protein to determine both activity and stability. Students are given the opportunity to master experimental design, implementation, and data interpretation in a realistic research context. They have the opportunity to develop and then test their own theories of protein structure and learn techniques in the context of a research program. The project is an adaptation of Darwin 2000, using this example as a model for nuclease analysis.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
