<AbstractNarration>    The principal investigator and his colleagues use an&lt;br/&gt;experiment-based computational approach to model blood flow in&lt;br/&gt;large stenotic arteries and investigate critical flow and artery&lt;br/&gt;wall behaviors that may lead to artery compression, plaque cap&lt;br/&gt;rupture, stroke and heart attack.  Dynamic properties of the&lt;br/&gt;stenotic arteries with plaque stiffness and geometry variations&lt;br/&gt;are determined experimentally using hydrogel tubes whose&lt;br/&gt;mechanical properties are close to those of bovine carotid&lt;br/&gt;arteries.  This leads to a series of 3-D nonlinear computational&lt;br/&gt;models with fluid-wall interactions based on the experimental&lt;br/&gt;measurements.  Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian formulation is used&lt;br/&gt;to deal with free moving boundaries.  Implicit methods including&lt;br/&gt;the SIMPLER algorithm and fully coupled methods based on&lt;br/&gt;mesh-free generalized finite differences with staggered grids,&lt;br/&gt;upwind techniques, and a consistent physical interpolation&lt;br/&gt;technique are used to solve the fluid model.  A sequence of&lt;br/&gt;experiment-based thin- and thick-wall models are introduced to&lt;br/&gt;model the dynamic nonlinear properties of the stenotic tube wall&lt;br/&gt;with large strain, deformation, compression and collapse.  An&lt;br/&gt;incremental boundary iteration method and an under-relaxation&lt;br/&gt;technique are used to handle the fluid-wall interactions.&lt;br/&gt;Validated by experimental data, results obtained are&lt;br/&gt;physiologically relevant and may provide information helpful for&lt;br/&gt;early detection, diagnosis and prevention of related&lt;br/&gt;cardiovascular diseases.  The models and numerical methods&lt;br/&gt;developed are applicable to a wide range of problems with&lt;br/&gt;fluid-structure interactions and can be extended to include mass&lt;br/&gt;transfer, structures of arteries and plaques, endothelial&lt;br/&gt;responses, and arterial remodeling.&lt;br/&gt;     Stenosis, a constriction in blood vessels, is one of the&lt;br/&gt;leading causes of death in the western world.  The investigators&lt;br/&gt;and their colleagues couple experiments with computations to&lt;br/&gt;model blood flow in large stenotic arteries and investigate&lt;br/&gt;critical flow and artery wall behaviors that may lead to artery&lt;br/&gt;compression, plaque cap rupture, stroke and heart attack.  The&lt;br/&gt;problem is difficult because of the high complexity of artery&lt;br/&gt;structure and its nonlinear mechanical properties, strong blood&lt;br/&gt;and artery interactions, and critical flow conditions caused by&lt;br/&gt;severe stenosis.  Dynamic properties of the stenotic arteries are&lt;br/&gt;determined experimentally using bovine carotid arteries and&lt;br/&gt;hydrogel tubes, whose properties are close to those of bovine&lt;br/&gt;carotid arteries.  A series of 3-D nonlinear computational models&lt;br/&gt;with fluid-wall interactions, based on the experimental&lt;br/&gt;measurements, are solved by a novel numerical method to quantify&lt;br/&gt;conditions under which artery compression and plaque cap rupture&lt;br/&gt;may occur.  Validated by experimental data, these results can be&lt;br/&gt;helpful for early detection, diagnosis and prevention of related&lt;br/&gt;cardiovascular diseases.  The models and numerical methods&lt;br/&gt;developed are applicable to a wide range of problems with&lt;br/&gt;fluid-structure interactions and complex geometries.  The models&lt;br/&gt;can be extended to include mass transfer, structures of arteries&lt;br/&gt;and plaques, grafts and stents, endothelial responses and&lt;br/&gt;arterial remodeling.  As applications of biotechnology, the&lt;br/&gt;results obtained can be used to improve the design of medical&lt;br/&gt;devices such as grafts and stents.</AbstractNarration>
