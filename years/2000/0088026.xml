<AbstractNarration>A picture is worth a thousand words, and the addition of sound and motion can breathe life into a picture.&lt;br/&gt;As a result, the use of video in all kinds of multimedia applications has become an important development&lt;br/&gt;in the 1990s. In particular, Video on demand (VOD) is a core technology for many important applications&lt;br/&gt;such as digital libraries, distance learning, electronic commerce, entertainment, public information&lt;br/&gt;systems, etc.&lt;br/&gt;The simplest video delivery technique employs a dedicated stream for each service request. Obviously,&lt;br/&gt;this scheme is too expensive and has been shown to have little scalability. To vastly reduce this cost, one&lt;br/&gt;can leverage multicast technology to allow multiple clients to share a video stream. Unfortunately, today's&lt;br/&gt;multicast technology was developed in the 80's, and was not optimized for such applications. Missing a&lt;br/&gt;multicast could mean a long wait until the next multicast. This limitation has recently led to a large body&lt;br/&gt;of research looking for remedies at the application level.&lt;br/&gt;Application-level solutions, however, cannot address all the drawbacks, particularly traffic congestion&lt;br/&gt;caused by too many multicasts. In fact, this proposal is motivated by application-level work done by&lt;br/&gt;the investigator in his last NSF project (from 1998 to 2000). The achievements of that project, though&lt;br/&gt;significant, were constrained by the limitation of standard multicast. Minimizing the multicast frequency&lt;br/&gt;is crucial for any multicast-based applications, particularly those running on a public network such as the&lt;br/&gt;Internet. Attaining this goal requires a fundamental change in the multicast concept. The investigator&lt;br/&gt;proposes enabling the multicast tree to deliver the entire video to all the receivers who may subscribe to&lt;br/&gt;the multicast at different times. This new capability would significantly reduce the number of multicasts&lt;br/&gt;necessary, and therefore lower the network resource requirements. At first sight, this seems like a mission&lt;br/&gt;impossible. But on the contrary, this can be achieved by allowing the routers on the multicast tree to&lt;br/&gt;intercept and cache a video stream passing through. The data can be relayed to subsequent subscribers to&lt;br/&gt;further extend the multicast tree. In this project, the investigator proposes to develop a suite of techniques&lt;br/&gt;to make such an environment practical for future-generation large-scale multimedia applications.&lt;br/&gt;To assess the potential of the proposed idea, the investigator has designed an initial version of his&lt;br/&gt;Caching Multicast Protocol (CMP). The preliminary study indicates that this approach has the potential&lt;br/&gt;to revolutionize the way in which multimedia information is disseminated. This scheme is much more&lt;br/&gt;scalable and less expensive than application-level solutions. The new communication paradigm, however,&lt;br/&gt;demands new research at the network level. In this project, the investigator proposes to study issues such&lt;br/&gt;as cache organization, cache replacement policies, multicast routing algorithms, congestion control, client&lt;br/&gt;and server protocols, etc. In addition, he will implement a prototype, consisting of CMP-capable routers,&lt;br/&gt;CMP-compliant servers (sources) and CMP-compliant clients (destinations) to examine the practicality of&lt;br/&gt;the proposed techniques.&lt;br/&gt;The significance of this project is in advancing multicast technology to enable large-scale deployment&lt;br/&gt;of multimedia applications. Although many great advances have been made in the field of information&lt;br/&gt;technology, none have had as great and direct an impact on the daily lives of ordinary citizens as multime-dia&lt;br/&gt;information systems. As such, the benefits of this research will reach many people in society. In terms&lt;br/&gt;of education, this project will help to support three doctoral students. The investigator has a good record&lt;br/&gt;of using NSF projects to train students for teaching careers. After these students graduate, they can help&lt;br/&gt;to spread the CMP expertise developed from this project to their new institutions. Other graduate students&lt;br/&gt;taking our advanced databases course can also benefit from this work by experimenting with various new&lt;br/&gt;multicast applications on the CMP testbed. To reach out to members of communities, materials resulting&lt;br/&gt;from this research will be disseminated on the investigator's research group website.</AbstractNarration>
