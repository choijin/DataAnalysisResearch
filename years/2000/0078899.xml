    <AbstractNarration>Timothy Steimle of Arizona State University is supported by a grant from the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program with which he is using optical absorption spectroscopy to study early transition metal containing radicals and magnesium organometallic radicals. The radicals will be generated in the supersonic expansion of a laser ablated metal source and the species detected using high resolution LIF and a proposed transient frequency modulation spectrometer. These techniques will be used to obtain hyperfine structure of these species and permanent electric dipole moments. Dipole moments will be obtained for the TiCH and VCH known radicals. MgOH, MgCH3, MgCCH, TiCH and CuOH will be studied and searches will be made for hydroxide, imide and thiol radicals containing early transition metals. These data are a stringent test of theory involving electron correlation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This detailed spectroscopy study of transition metal containing compounds will provide high resolution spectra from which fundamental information on permanent electric dipoles of the compounds will be obtained. This will be used to test state of the art theories which are in the development phase for these difficult species. The data are also widely applicable to organometallic, analytical and high temperature chemistry and to stellar atmospheres and the interstellar medium.</AbstractNarration>
