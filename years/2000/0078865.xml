    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will make self-assembled, nanocomposite building blocks, composed of carbon nanotubes on a macroscopic support. Phase I demonstrated the growth of high quality, long nanotubes, adhered to a metal mesh. The support catalyzes the growth of a dispersed uniform structure of sootfree nanotubes. Additional processing is not required. Traditional manufacturing processes can convert the composite into filters, electrodes, and structures that transport mass, charge, and stress on nanometer scales. The nanotubes remain organized and connected electrically and mechanically. Intimate solid-gas and solid-liquid contact accompanied by high transport rates result. Unlike porous nanoscale media, the pore size can be independent of the nanotube diameter, allowing rapid access to their surface.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Phase II product will be microfiltration media with unprecedented filtration efficiency and low energy cost. Carbon nanotubes have enhanced single-collector efficiencies and substantially high surface to volume ratios. These advantages produce enormous, pound-for-pound value. The industrial partner has committed Phase III funding based on initial testing and market pull for low-energy, cost-effective separation technology. The industrial partner is committed to nanoscale technologies and the tremendous physical properties of the supported nanocomposites.</AbstractNarration>
