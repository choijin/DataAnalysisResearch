<AbstractNarration>The United States of America will host the 42nd International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) in the year 2001 in Washington DC.  The IMO is the premier international mathematics competition for high school students and it will bring to the USA more than 500 of the most talented high school age mathematicians from more than 80 countries.  The American mathematics community will use this opportunity to promote the importance of mathematics for all students and to celebrate the accomplishments of our best and brightest students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the competition, students work individually over a two-day period on six challenging problems, presenting their solutions as essay-style proofs akin to those produced by research mathematicians.  During the several day grading period the IMO students will be treated to American hospitality, visiting attractions in and around the Capital and experiencing American life and culture. At the closing awards ceremony, outstanding performances are honored by the awarding of gold, silver, and bronze medals to students scoring in the top half of the results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the host country, it is the responsibility of the USA, in addition to organizing the contest, to provide lodging, food, entertainment, and cultural activities for all the participants and team leaders during the&lt;br/&gt;approximately two weeks that they are in our country.  For the participants, many of whom become world leaders in math and science, the IMO provides a unique opportunity to build friendships with students from other countries, to exchange mathematical ideas, and to learn about other cultures, especially about the USA. For the American mathematics community, the IMO provides an opportunity to promote the importance of a strong mathematics education for all students---much like the Olympics are used to promote physical fitness for all---and to celebrate the outstanding achievements of our nation's young men and women in mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;Financial support from the Division of Mathematical Sciences of the National Science Foundation for competition and related administrative costs will help to underwrite the underlying theme of the importance of mathematics education for all students, thus furthering the educational goals of the NSF and IMO 2001 USA activity.</AbstractNarration>
