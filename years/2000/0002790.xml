<AbstractNarration>Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     SPATIAL MODELING, ANALYSIS AND PREDICTION OF &lt;br/&gt;      NONSTATIONARY ENVIRONMENTAL PROCESSES&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Montserrat  Fuentes, North Carolina State University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Richard  L. Smith, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spatial statistics is one of the major methodologies of environmental &lt;br/&gt;statistics; its applications include producing spatially smoothed or &lt;br/&gt;interpolated representations of air pollution fields, calculating &lt;br/&gt;regional average means or regional average trends based on data at a &lt;br/&gt;finite number of monitoring stations, and performing regression &lt;br/&gt;analyses with spatially correlated errors to assess the agreement &lt;br/&gt;between observed data and the predictions of some numerical model.  &lt;br/&gt;However, the most commonly used spatial statistics methodology, also &lt;br/&gt;known as geostatistics or kriging, is essentially based on the &lt;br/&gt;assumption of stationary and isotropic random fields. Such &lt;br/&gt;assumptions cannot be expected to hold in large heterogeneous fields. &lt;br/&gt;The research described here concentrates on nonstationary spatial &lt;br/&gt;models. Some new models are introduced, as well as new fitting &lt;br/&gt;methods based on spectral analysis. The applications include three &lt;br/&gt;real data sets: (i) monitoring data for nitrate fields compared with &lt;br/&gt;Models-3 output as part of the process for assessing compliance with &lt;br/&gt;the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990; (ii) modeling the spatial &lt;br/&gt;distribution of particulate matter fields, as one of the components &lt;br/&gt;needed for an improved risk assessment of human health effects of &lt;br/&gt;particulate matter; (iii) developing statistical models for spatial &lt;br/&gt;temperature fields and applying them to the attribution of various &lt;br/&gt;"signals" produced by climate models - in particular, this &lt;br/&gt;methodology will permit improved assessment of the extent to which &lt;br/&gt;observed global climate change may be attributed to anthropogenic &lt;br/&gt;influences.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In more detail, the new statistical methodology concentrates on two &lt;br/&gt;approaches to nonstationary models: a spatial deformation approach &lt;br/&gt;due to Guttorp and Sampson, and an approach where the field is &lt;br/&gt;represented locally as a stationary isotropic random field, but the &lt;br/&gt;parameters of the stationary random field are allowed to vary &lt;br/&gt;continuously across space. Kernel functions are used to ensure that &lt;br/&gt;the field is well-defined but also continuous. Some combination of &lt;br/&gt;the two approaches may be needed for fields with are neither &lt;br/&gt;stationary nor isotropic. New fitting algorithms are developed, using &lt;br/&gt;both space domain and spectral approaches; in cases where the data &lt;br/&gt;are distributed exactly or approximately on a lattice, it is argued &lt;br/&gt;that spectral approaches have potentially enormous computational &lt;br/&gt;benefits compared with maximum likelihood. The methods are extended &lt;br/&gt;to prediction/interpolation questions using approximate Bayesian &lt;br/&gt;approaches to account for parameter uncertainty.  We develop &lt;br/&gt;applications to obtaining the total loading of pollutant &lt;br/&gt;concentrations and fluxes over different geo-political boundaries, to &lt;br/&gt;risk assessment for particulate matter random fields, and to the &lt;br/&gt;attribution of an observed climate record to various components &lt;br/&gt;produced by numerical climatic model, the latter forming a new &lt;br/&gt;approach to the fingerprint estimation technique developed by &lt;br/&gt;climatologists.  &lt;br/&gt;This program is being jointly funded by the Division of Mathematical Sciences and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities from the Directorate of Mathematical and Physical Sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
