<AbstractNarration>Characterization remains a cornerstone for the development and understanding of new materials.  Throughout the last decades, the ability to adequately probe physical properties of materials has shifted from "in-house" laboratories towards state-of-the-art, regional research facilities (e.g. neutron, high-magnetic field, and synchrotron radiation sources). In an effort to educate and train young materials scientists in state-of-the-art, regional-facility characterization techniques, Louisiana State University's Center for Advanced Microstructures and Devices (CAMD) is hosting a summer school on "Synchrotron Radiation Applications to Materials Science" from June 5 to June 10, 2000.  &lt;br/&gt;During this one-week course, advanced graduate students will learn, through lectures, discussions, and hands-on practical experience, how and why the application of synchrotron radiation is indispensable to the characterization of a variety of materials.  CAMD/LSU faculty, as well as a number of researchers from around the country will give lectures and lead discussions (~ 25 speakers total).  The students (~35-45) will take part in approximately 35 hours of lectures/discussions on various topics of the application of synchrotron radiation to materials science research, as well as learn "hands-on" practical/technical knowledge at the CAMD facility.  Such knowledge can then be applied to further a participant's research program by integrating the unique advantages of synchrotron radiation, as exemplified by a regional laboratory like LSU/CAMD, to expand the student's knowledge and potential as a materials scientist.&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characterization remains a cornerstone for the development and understanding of new materials.
