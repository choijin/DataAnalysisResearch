<AbstractNarration>     Next generation high-speed networks are expected to support exciting new applications involv-&lt;br/&gt;ing multi-media traffic, such as video-conferencing, tele-medicine, video-on-demand, and web&lt;br/&gt;TV, in addition to countless other yet-to-be-conceived network applications. The viability and&lt;br/&gt;the continuing success of these networks will depend crucially upon their ability to offer high&lt;br/&gt;performance with regard to latency, delay variation, and bandwidths they can provide to these&lt;br/&gt;myriad of applications. Customers will demand high-quality multimedia services, and not be&lt;br/&gt;satisfied with the kind of high-latency, variable delay that is characteristic of the current Inter-&lt;br/&gt;net. The various performance requirements from the users and the sheer size of these networks&lt;br/&gt;make it imperative that we properly understand at a fundamental level how to design, engi-&lt;br/&gt;neer, and control these networks, and develop appropriate methodologies. It is also essential&lt;br/&gt;that these tools be evaluated in terms of complexity and accuracy using experimentation (i.e.,&lt;br/&gt;testbed) and simulation.&lt;br/&gt;      To address the challenges described above, we propose to develop an innovative approach&lt;br/&gt;that harnesses the power of combined measurement and analysis to create design and control&lt;br/&gt;tools for next generation networks. We plan to elaborate on the approach in the context of:&lt;br/&gt;performance evaluation (i.e., QoS estimation), and QoS-sensitivity estimation.&lt;br/&gt;     These issues form the foundation required to solve key network design and control problems.&lt;br/&gt;Building upon our approach|combining analysis with measurements|we will then focus on&lt;br/&gt;on a variety of problems that have to be addressed in order for networks to support QoS:&lt;br/&gt;  admission control,                                                                                                                                                     congestion control,&lt;br/&gt;  QoS-based routing, and&lt;br/&gt;  network design and dimensioning.&lt;br/&gt;Our proposed solutions to the above problems will be supported and refined by extensive&lt;br/&gt;empirical studies on our experimental platform. This platform is capable of supporting a&lt;br/&gt;variety of network technologies and traffic characteristics.&lt;br/&gt;     Our research team has been at the forefront of the development of important results in traffic&lt;br/&gt;analysis, network design, and control, and is committed to creating the necessary synergy for&lt;br/&gt;addressing the key problems outlined above. Our team already has a significantly productive&lt;br/&gt;track record in previous collaborative efforts.&lt;br/&gt;      We are planning to address a set of problems that are critically important for deploying&lt;br/&gt;next generation networks with the capability of offering high bandwidth and stringent QoS to&lt;br/&gt;users. Creating a future broadband network that is exible, efficient, robust, and controllable&lt;br/&gt;is essential to the viability of our economy and to the different communities within it. Hence, if&lt;br/&gt;our research is successful, it will have a significant impact on the delivery of services necessary&lt;br/&gt;to meet the diverse needs of education, business, and entertainment.</AbstractNarration>
