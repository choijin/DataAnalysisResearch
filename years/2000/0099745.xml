    <AbstractNarration>A conference on Molecular Electronics will be held at Kailua-Kona, Hawaii, December 10-15, 2000. The conference will address theoretical and experimental aspects of molecular electronics with emphasis on molecular phenomena and material science considerations. Molecular Electronics is an emerging field developing as the microelectronics field looks beyond silicon to evaluate new possibilities for future technology, and as atomic level resolution probes have become available for accessing and manipulating individual molecules and molecular assemblies. New techniques will be discussed for molecular synthesis, as well as new techniques for attaching molecules to specific surfaces/interfaces, and evaluating molecular transport properties. The conference will also concentrate on possible techniques for creating molecular circuits and methods needed to be able to interact with and to exploit the properties of single molecules.&lt;br/&gt;The program is organized around 20 invited speakers, and both contributed papers and posters are scheduled. The overall size of the meeting is expected to include 60-80 participants. Special efforts have been made to recruit a diverse group of participants, including foreign and American scientists, younger and older researchers, and industrial, national laboratory and academic researchers. Objectives are to stimulate communications among the chemistry, physics, engineering and materials science communities working in this and related fields, and to formulate and delineate critical research necessary to move molecular electronics concepts forward. &lt;br/&gt;The conference is well organized by an international committee. A list of invited speakers and conference organizers who are leaders in the field is provided. The conference is expected to provide an effective forum for discussion of critical scientific issues and directions in Molecular Electronics. Along with the opportunity to assess the field and future directions, it is expected that new ties and collaborations will be established between university, industry, and other research institution researchers.&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt; An evaluation of the progress and status of Molecular Electronics and related chemistry and materials issues, especially critical materials and device related research areas, and the relationship of molecular and materials issues to device fabrication along with current assessments of the most important developments in this field will be of great value to the understanding and development of new capabilities in computing, data processing, and communications. &lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>
