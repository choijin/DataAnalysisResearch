    <AbstractNarration>Though inherently a statistical issue, model evaluation lacks a unifying &lt;br/&gt;statistical framework; this project supplies such. The foundation of the &lt;br/&gt;framework is the use of Bayesian techniques to quantify the degree to &lt;br/&gt;which a model captures an underlying reality; develop theory and methods &lt;br/&gt;that allow dual use of data in both estimation of model inputs and &lt;br/&gt;evaluation of outputs; select evaluation functions, by which a model and &lt;br/&gt;reality are compared and through which flaws (causes of "invalidity") &lt;br/&gt;are found; and to design the collection of field and computer simulation &lt;br/&gt;data. The building of the framework relies on specific formulations of &lt;br/&gt;problems, motivated by testbed examples such as subsurface fluid flow &lt;br/&gt;models - where the computer model is deterministic but uncertainties are &lt;br/&gt;present in the model inputs and specifications - and traffic simulators &lt;br/&gt;- where the model is intrinsically stochastic, in addition to having &lt;br/&gt;uncertain inputs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Computer models are everywhere and evaluating their fidelity to reality &lt;br/&gt;is central to assessing their effectiveness in understanding real &lt;br/&gt;phenomena (such as flow of pollutants through soil and into groundwater) &lt;br/&gt;and predicting results of innovative technologies (such as new signal &lt;br/&gt;timing strategies to relieve traffic congestion in urban networks). This &lt;br/&gt;project develops a statistical structure and basis for such evaluations &lt;br/&gt;applicable across the scientific and technological landscape. In the &lt;br/&gt;process, the project creates the ingredients for a virtual laboratory &lt;br/&gt;to disseminate results, broaden involvement of other researchers (and &lt;br/&gt;users), and establish a unique educational and training environment.</AbstractNarration>
