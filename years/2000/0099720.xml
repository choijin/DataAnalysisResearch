    <AbstractNarration>0099720&lt;br/&gt;Campbell&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports acquisition of a DNA microarray reader and supporting equipment. The equipment is required for studies of the simultaneous expression of all genes found in the genomes of yeast and other organisms. Such analysis of whole genome expression is usually referred to as functional genomics; the cost of purchasing and operating the equipment needed for functional genomics is high enough that it is generally beyond the means of single undergraduate institution. The equipment purchased through this award, though located at one institution, will be available to a consortium of college faculty from across the country who desire to pursue such research, but currently lack access to the necessary equipment. Research to be enabled by the equipment includes studies of the effect of aging and of DNA-binding chemicals on gene expression in yeast. In addition, several participating faculty will collaborate on an effort to develop new algorithms for mathematical analysis of DNA microarray datasets. The users are members of a group of 23 faculty (from the US and Canada) who have formed the Genome Consortium for Active Teaching (GCAT). During the 2000-2001 academic year, GCAT will coordinate a series of functional genomics experiments using yeast DNA microarrays that can be measured using the equipment provided through this award. The research efforts are expected to have a substantial impact on undergraduate training (including that of women and underrepresented minorities) in an area of biology of major importance.</AbstractNarration>
