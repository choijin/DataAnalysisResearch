<AbstractNarration>Experiments will be conducted to test Newtons law of gravitation at&lt;br/&gt;inter-mass separations of less than one centimeter.  For separations&lt;br/&gt;between one centimeter and one tenth of a millimeter, the experiments&lt;br/&gt;will be sensitive enough to detect gravity and to test for deviations&lt;br/&gt;from Newtons inverse-square law.  For smaller separations the&lt;br/&gt;experiments could detect proposed new short-range forces stronger than&lt;br/&gt;gravity but still many orders of magnitude weaker than other known&lt;br/&gt;forces. The investigators will first complete on-going experiments with&lt;br/&gt;an existing room temperature apparatus, and then construct a new&lt;br/&gt;cryogenic instrument with greater sensitivity.  A planar tungsten&lt;br/&gt;torsional oscillator is used as the sensitive force detector.  There is&lt;br/&gt;currently intense interest among theoretical physicists in the&lt;br/&gt;possibility that there may exist new feeble forces at length scales&lt;br/&gt;below one centimeter.  String theory, which seeks to encompass all&lt;br/&gt;known physics including gravitation, generally predicts light fields&lt;br/&gt;called moduli.  When these acquire mass through certain mechanisms,&lt;br/&gt;they may mediate forces with a range of about one millimeter.&lt;br/&gt;Detecting such forces would provide dramatic evidence for string&lt;br/&gt;theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Theorists have also proposed that there may exist several new compact&lt;br/&gt;spatial dimensions beyond the usual three, and that gravity is weak&lt;br/&gt;because it is able to spread out in the extra dimensions.  When the&lt;br/&gt;number of extra dimensions is two, this view leads to large deviations&lt;br/&gt;from Newtons law of gravitation at about one millimeter.  Experimental&lt;br/&gt;evidence of the predicted deviations would be a dramatic step forward&lt;br/&gt;for our understanding of fundamental physics.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
