<AbstractNarration>0002306&lt;br/&gt;WHITE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will fund an Albert Einstein Fellow to work in the Division of Elementary, Secondary and Informal Education of the National Science Foundation for eleven months, beginning September 1, 2000.  The precise duties and responsibilities of this Fellow will be determined by NSF personnel.  However, the majority of her time will be devoted to the Presidential Awards for Excellence in Mathematics and Science Teaching program.  She will assist with the preparation and implementation of the winter conference for state coordinators, the national selection committee meeting, the Award Week ceremonies and activities, as well as involvement in the day-to-day work of the program.  Her involvement in other programs of the Division will depend upon her available time, her interests, and the needs of the Division.  The Fellow will provide three written reports to the Triangle Coalition, which will describe her responsibilities and on-going activities.  These will be used to evaluate the Fellows' accomplishments during the Fellowship period and to offer personal perspectives and recommendations on the Fellowship program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
