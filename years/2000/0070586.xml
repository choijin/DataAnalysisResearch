    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal concerns several interrelated areas of mathematics: &lt;br/&gt;self-affine tiles and reptiles, refinable functions and wavelets, spectral&lt;br/&gt;sets, and mathematical quasicrystals. Although the subjects may appear to be&lt;br/&gt;rather distant from each other, the proposal actually has a very coherent&lt;br/&gt;central theme, which is self-similarity and tiling, and using analytical&lt;br/&gt;techniques to study them. The theme occurs naturally in self-affine tiles and reptiles, and in the branch of quasicrystal questions the PI proposes here. It occurs, although&lt;br/&gt;less obviously, in refinable functions and in spectral sets. &lt;br/&gt;The refinement equation satisfied by a refinable function is a generalized self-similarity,&lt;br/&gt;and it is closely related to self-affine tiles and self-similar measures.&lt;br/&gt;Spectral sets, on the other hand, are closely tied with tiling, as it is&lt;br/&gt;conjectured that a set is a spectral set if and only if it tiles by&lt;br/&gt;translation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; A self-similar tile is one that can be disected into several pieces&lt;br/&gt;such that all pieces are identical in shape and are similar to the original&lt;br/&gt;tile. The simplest example of such a tile is the square, which can be&lt;br/&gt;disected into 4 identical squares half in dimension of the original square.&lt;br/&gt;By repeated inflation and disecting of a self-similar tile we can cover&lt;br/&gt;a larger and larger area, and this results a self-similar tiling. Self-similar&lt;br/&gt;tilings are fascinating, and many of the aperiodic tiles discovered&lt;br/&gt;in recent years, such as the Penrose aperiodic tiles, can be viewed&lt;br/&gt;as generalized self-similar tiles. Furthermore, self-similar tilings&lt;br/&gt;have been linked to quasicrystals, materials whose atomic structures&lt;br/&gt;are aperiodic rather than the usual periodic structures. It is not&lt;br/&gt;clear how these types of atomic structure are formed, but models have&lt;br/&gt;been conceived by physicists using aperiodic tiles.</AbstractNarration>
