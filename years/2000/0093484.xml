<AbstractNarration>     Emerging infrastratureless wireless networking technologies such as MANET [1], sensor networks [31],&lt;br/&gt;and bluetooth [2] will seek to support advanced applications such as smart environment, "zero conf"&lt;br/&gt;teleconferencing setups, collaborative learning, wireless access to Web services, and emergency rescure&lt;br/&gt;operations. This class of applications is mission critical, and the network has to address a number of critical&lt;br/&gt;issues in order to cope with the anticipated design requirements of such applications. In an&lt;br/&gt;infrastructureless wireless network, no underlying infrastructure, such as cellular layout and central control units e.g. base stations, is available for networking support. A large number of networking devices are allowed to communicate with one another over the shared wireless medium in an ad hoc manner. Some&lt;br/&gt;unique design challenges posed by such networks include fully distributed and localized design, sustained&lt;br/&gt;quality of service (QoS), efficient network resource utilization, unconstrained scalability and robust system&lt;br/&gt;performance. State-of-the-art solutions are inadequate to address these issues and meet the applications'&lt;br/&gt;requirements. A fundamental problem is that an infrastructureless wireless network is a large-scale&lt;br/&gt;distributed system that may consist of a very large number of wireless networking components (e.g.&lt;br/&gt;thousands, even millions in a sensor network), which have limited power and computing resources and are&lt;br/&gt;prone to channel errors and failures. Therefore, any feasible system solution must be fully distributed and&lt;br/&gt;localized, scalable, and robust. In some sense, the microscopic behavior of each individual node may not be&lt;br/&gt;very critical, but network nodes must collectively achieve the desired global macroscopic property.&lt;br/&gt;     In this project, we propose a novel self-organizing protocol and algorithm design approach for such&lt;br/&gt;networks, in order to meet the challenges posed by applications as well as the network itself. In a self-organizing design approach, local decision makers self-organize themselves and coordinate among one&lt;br/&gt;another, in order to collectively achieve the desired global property. We apply our proposed design&lt;br/&gt;methodology in two largely unaddressed problem domains: fair packet scheduling in multihop wireless&lt;br/&gt;networks, and robust report forwarding in sensor networks. Toward this end, we present four self-organizing packet-scheduling algorithms and a novel report forwarding protocol that we have developed&lt;br/&gt;recently [22, 24, 35, 36, 46, 47]. The key innovations of this work are:&lt;br/&gt;      A model-referenced self-organizing algorithm and protocol design approach.&lt;br/&gt;      A suite of self-organizing packet scheduling algorithms for infrastructureless wireless networks that&lt;br/&gt;provide QoS performance bounds in terms of fairness, throughput and delay, maximize channel spatial&lt;br/&gt;reuse, and arbitrate the conflict between achieving fairness and maximizing channel utilization.&lt;br/&gt;      A novel self-organizing data forwarding protocol that allows for unconstrained scalability, supports&lt;br/&gt;robust message delivery along the optimal forwarding band, and ensures efficient power consumption&lt;br/&gt;in the context of sensor networks.&lt;br/&gt;     The expected research results from this project include a formal investigation of self-organizing design&lt;br/&gt;approach, and a detailed design, analysis, and evaluation of the self-organizing algorithms and protocols for&lt;br/&gt;packet scheduling and report forwarding. The resulting software will be freely available to the research&lt;br/&gt;community. The education plan in this proposal includes offering a new graduate course, reinventing an&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate networking course, recruiting more students into undergraduate research programs, and&lt;br/&gt;setting up an undergraduate networking laboratory.</AbstractNarration>
