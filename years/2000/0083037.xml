<AbstractNarration>This is the first year funding of a three-year continuing award. A demanding application area of virtual or augmented environment is multi-user collaborative environment where multiple users at either a local site or remote sites communicate with each other and interact with a synthetic or virtual scene. Among the necessary sensors and devices, an effective visualization device and a real-time image acquisition system are two main challenges. The objective of this project is to develop a novel visualization device referred to as head-mounted projective display (HMPD), build a multi-user interactive workbench by integrating the developed HMPD technology with a unique real-time image acquisition system known as an omni-focus camera, and evaluate and quantify the system as an effective tool for remote collaboration. The head-mounted projective display (HMPD) proposed is coupled with a supple, non-distorting and durable projection surface as an alternative to current visualization devices. Its novel concept suggests solutions to part of the problems of state-of-art visualization devices, such as large distortion with wide field of view, occlusion contradiction between virtual and real objects, and brightness conflict with background illumination. Several properties of the proposed HMPD make it extremely suitable for multiple-user collaborative applications. Research efforts will be made to design and implement a lightweight and compact head-mounted prototype by introducing diffractive optical element (DOE) and plastic materials, and investigate approaches to optimize the illumination of the display and retro-reflective material properties for imaging purpose. At one site, a multi-user interactive bench prototype with tele-presence capability will be built by using the HMPD concept and adding an image acquisition system developed from a unique omni-focus camera system. At the other site, a mural display system will be built with conventional stereoscopic video system located near the mural display, where one or several collaborators will also gather. Tele-collaborative work will be tested between the Beckman Institute at the University of Illinois--Urbana Champaign and the School of Optics-CREOL at the University of Central Florida through the Internet II connection linking our laboratories. Finally, the PIs will quantify the depth and size representation and perception accuracy, evaluate occlusion perception aspects, and set up a comprehensive calibration procedure for the HMPD and the workbench and mural prototypes. The results are expected to impact a wide range of applications such as collaboration/tele-collaboration, tele-presence, tele-manipulation, and visualized education/tele-education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
