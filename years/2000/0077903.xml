<AbstractNarration>Legumes, such as clover, alfalfa, and soybean, are important in agriculture&lt;br/&gt;and in nature.  Soil bacteria known as rhizobia can benefit legumes when&lt;br/&gt;they infect their roots, because they can take up atmospheric nitrogen and&lt;br/&gt;supply it to the plant.  This extra nitrogen increases plant&lt;br/&gt;photosynthesis, thereby indirectly increasing the energy supply to the&lt;br/&gt;rhizobia.  Thus, symbiosis between legume and rhizobium seems beneficial to&lt;br/&gt;both.  But what if, as often happens, two or more different strains of&lt;br/&gt;rhizobia infect the same plant?  An initially rare strain that uses plant&lt;br/&gt;resources for its own reproduction, rather than for nitrogen fixation,&lt;br/&gt;could increase in numbers at the expense of both the plant and the more&lt;br/&gt;cooperative rhizobial strain.  Although most rhizobia seem to be&lt;br/&gt;predominantly beneficial, such "parasitic" strains do exist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will determine whether plant responses to rhizobia that fail&lt;br/&gt;to fix nitrogen can select for more beneficial rhizobia.  Previous research&lt;br/&gt;shows that legumes can control the oxygen supply to rhizobia inside their&lt;br/&gt;root nodules.  The PIs will determine how this oxygen supply changes with&lt;br/&gt;changes in nitrogen fixation by rhizobia, and how this legume response&lt;br/&gt;affects the survival and reproduction of the rhizobia.  Most of the&lt;br/&gt;research will be conducted under controlled laboratory conditions, but a&lt;br/&gt;field test will determine whether legumes alter the frequency of&lt;br/&gt;cooperative vs. parasitic rhizobia in soil.  In addition to possible&lt;br/&gt;practical applications in agriculture, the research will contribute to&lt;br/&gt;overall understanding of the general problem of cooperation between&lt;br/&gt;species.  Such cooperation is critical to the pollination of flowers, the&lt;br/&gt;survival and growth of coral reefs, plant growth in phosphorus-poor soils,&lt;br/&gt;and many other natural systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
