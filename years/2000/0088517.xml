<AbstractNarration>Biological Sciences (61) Chemistry (12)&lt;br/&gt;Science faculty at Bowdoin College strive to optimize undergraduate learning by incorporating modern analytical techniques into inquiry-based laboratory exercises that allow for meaningful intellectual and creative input from students, and through their oversight of undergraduate-led research projects. Currently, Bowdoin undergraduates majoring in biology, biochemistry and environmental studies receive little exposure to the essential modern techniques of chromatography and spectroscopy. Chemistry majors, although grounded in the principles of these methods, generally do not gain experience with them in the context of complex analytical problems. This project introduces undergraduates to the principles and applications of chromatography and spectroscopy via high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The project is interdisciplinary in nature and involves undergraduates and faculty from all of the above-mentioned departments. The specific goals of the project are to 1) enable Bowdoin undergraduates across departments to learn the principles, techniques and applications of chromatography and spectroscopy via the use of an HPLC with diode array detection, 2) develop course laboratories designed to convey deep understanding of these modern techniques and also to facilitate inquiry-based learning by enabling students to pursue hypotheses of their own creation in self-designed laboratory projects, 3) foster the use of chromatography and spectroscopy in undergraduate-led research, 4) create informed lesson plans centered on HPLC technology for dissemination among science faculty. Chromatography and spectroscopy are being incorporated into the laboratory portions of five core and upper-division courses, as well as into undergraduate-led research. Experiments are being adapted from the educational and research literature. For example, in the Plant Physiology course, experiments developed at the University of Colorado to expose students to photosynthesis and energy dissipation are being modified to use HPLC instead of TLC for the analysis. Overall, the project is broadening and enhancing the background of Bowdoin undergraduates and is providing those students with first-hand experience with the practice of science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
