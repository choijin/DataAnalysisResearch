    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0072492&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Jim A. Bryan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is primarily concerned with Gromov-Witten&lt;br/&gt;invariants. The investigator will study the Gromov-Witten&lt;br/&gt;invariants of a 3-fold X by determining the local contributions&lt;br/&gt;of a suitably rigid curve C in X. In particular, the investigator&lt;br/&gt;will study the integrality properties of such contributions and&lt;br/&gt;their relationship to the number of certain BPS states in&lt;br/&gt;M-theory as defined via the formula of Gopakumar and Vafa. For&lt;br/&gt;nodal curves C, the investigator will continue his work with Katz&lt;br/&gt;and Leung; for smooth higher genus curves C, the investigator&lt;br/&gt;will continue work begun with R. Pandharipande. In collaborations&lt;br/&gt;with Leung, the investigator will also seek to define a new&lt;br/&gt;invariant of symplectic 4-manifolds which would specialize to the&lt;br/&gt;modified Gromov-Witten invariants defined by Behrend and Fantechi&lt;br/&gt;for algebraic surfaces with positive geometric genus (which in&lt;br/&gt;turn generalized the modified invariants defined by the&lt;br/&gt;investigator and Leung for K3 and Abelian surfaces). Such an&lt;br/&gt;invariant would be better suited to study the enumerative&lt;br/&gt;geometry of irrational surfaces than the ordinary Gromov-Witten&lt;br/&gt;invariants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the physics of string theory, particles are replaced with&lt;br/&gt;one-dimensional objects (``strings'') and so the path that a&lt;br/&gt;particle traces out over time becomes a surface in space-time (a&lt;br/&gt;``world-sheet''). The equations of string theory then tell us&lt;br/&gt;that the surface should be a holomorphic surface (a Riemann&lt;br/&gt;surface) mapped into space-time in a holomorphic manner. This has&lt;br/&gt;led to the purely mathematical notion of Gromov-Witten&lt;br/&gt;invariants. Gromov-Witten invariants study holomorphic mappings&lt;br/&gt;of Riemann surfaces into higher dimensional geometric objects&lt;br/&gt;(for example, projective manifolds). They have become important&lt;br/&gt;invariants in geometry, topology, and algebraic geometry as well&lt;br/&gt;as being central in string theory. Bryan's project specifically&lt;br/&gt;addresses the problem of how the algebraic geometry of a&lt;br/&gt;projective manifold is encoded in the Gromov-Witten invariants&lt;br/&gt;and how they are tied to string theory. Algebraic geometry is a&lt;br/&gt;classical subject in pure mathematics that has recently found&lt;br/&gt;application in such diverse subjects as robotics and coding&lt;br/&gt;theory; string theory is the leading candidate for a "theory of&lt;br/&gt;everything", i.e. a single physical theory that describes all&lt;br/&gt;known physical phenomenon.</AbstractNarration>
