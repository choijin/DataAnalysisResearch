    <AbstractNarration>0078383&lt;br/&gt;Gopal&lt;br/&gt; This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will investigate the use of&lt;br/&gt;redox catalyst electrodes for the synthesis of hydrogen peroxide through electrochemical&lt;br/&gt;regeneration of the redox catalyst. In the Phase I research, catalysts were developed and&lt;br/&gt;their short-term stability for peroxide synthesis was successfully demonstrated. Flow cell&lt;br/&gt;operation with 10 cm2 electrode cells showed the preparation of hydrogen peroxide in&lt;br/&gt;acidic condition (1N H2SO4) at 60% current efficiency and up to 2% in peroxide&lt;br/&gt;concentration. However, Phase I work indicated poor catalytic current with oxygen for&lt;br/&gt;these redox systems, as well as an upper limit for hydrogen peroxide concentration (2%).&lt;br/&gt;Phase II research effort will be directed towards improving the catalytic effect of these&lt;br/&gt;redox catalysts through changes in preparative procedures, electrode structure, and&lt;br/&gt;fabrication technique. The electrodes will be tested and optimized for peroxide synthesis&lt;br/&gt;using oxygen/air and almost pure water (pH adjusted, if necessary) using flow cell&lt;br/&gt;experiments. The electrodes will be tested for long-tem stability (500 hours). Larger&lt;br/&gt;electrodes (100cm2 ) will be fabricated using the best composite electrode for long-term&lt;br/&gt;stability testing and process optimization. Commercialization of the process will be&lt;br/&gt;carried out with a Phase III partner upon the successful completion of Phase II work.&lt;br/&gt;Potential Commercial Application of the Research &lt;br/&gt; Hydrogen peroxide is a clean oxidant, which reacts to form water as its reaction product.&lt;br/&gt;It is therefore environmentally acceptable in many industries. The market for hydrogen&lt;br/&gt;peroxide is expected to grow by almost 10% for the next few years. New technology&lt;br/&gt;(synthesis of hydrogen peroxide from water and air) described in this Phase II proposal&lt;br/&gt;could be implemented for various applications. These areas include wastewater treatment, on-site generation (for industrial and consumer application such laundry bleach etc.), as well as commercial peroxide production.</AbstractNarration>
