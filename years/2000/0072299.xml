<AbstractNarration>DMS-0072299&lt;br/&gt;Lizhen Ji&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Symmetric and locally symmetric spaces are important &lt;br/&gt;objects in mathematics and arise from many different &lt;br/&gt;subjects such as Lie group theory, representation theory, &lt;br/&gt;number theory, differential geometry, algebraic geometry, &lt;br/&gt;and dynamics.  Many natural such spaces are noncompact. &lt;br/&gt;For example, the space of positive definite matrices of &lt;br/&gt;determinant one is a noncompact symmetric space, and the &lt;br/&gt;moduli space of all elliptic curves is a noncompact locally &lt;br/&gt;symmetric space of finite volume which is one example of &lt;br/&gt;Shimura curves and plays an important role in the recent &lt;br/&gt;solution of the last Fermat's theorem.  To understand the &lt;br/&gt;geometry and analysis of such noncompact spaces, an important &lt;br/&gt;problem is to study their compactifications.  One of the common &lt;br/&gt;themes of the four projects in this proposal is to understand &lt;br/&gt;refined structures of the compactifications and their relations &lt;br/&gt;to the spectral theory of the spaces. For example, for locally symmetric spaces, geodesics which are eventually distance &lt;br/&gt;minimizing can be used to study the compactifications and &lt;br/&gt;also to understand the generalized eigenfunctions of the &lt;br/&gt;continuous spectrum, specifically, the scattering matrices.&lt;br/&gt;Compactifications of symmetric spaces play an important role &lt;br/&gt;in understanding behaviors at infinity of the joint eigenfunctions &lt;br/&gt;of the invariant differential operators and the matrix &lt;br/&gt;coefficients of representations.  The compactifications &lt;br/&gt;of globally and locally symmetric spaces have mainly be &lt;br/&gt;studied separately before, and an important feature of &lt;br/&gt;this proposal is to study compactifications of both types &lt;br/&gt;of spaces using a similar approach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mathematicians study geometric shapes and their structures.  One&lt;br/&gt;such collection of shapes consists of objects called manifolds. &lt;br/&gt;If a drum is pictured as a particular type of manifold then the&lt;br/&gt;tones produced by the drum can be thought of as mathematical&lt;br/&gt;objects associated to the manifold.  For a particularly important&lt;br/&gt;collection of drums there are two kinds of tones: the discrete (or&lt;br/&gt;isolated) ones and the continuous families. The PI intends to &lt;br/&gt;investigate a variety of mathematical structures on these drums or manifolds.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
