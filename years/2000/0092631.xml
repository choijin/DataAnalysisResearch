<AbstractNarration>0092631&lt;br/&gt;Rapid emerging information technologies (IT), new sensors, wireless communications, and high tech controls will likely form a foundation for the next generation of  transportation systems. To jump-start the evolutionary process a technology oriented basic research program is needed. This project outlines a plan for developing such a program centered around a workshop titled "A Basic Research Program for Surface Transportation Systems." The workshop will bring together 25 to 30 leaders in technology and transportation from academia and industry to structure the research program and draft a research project solicitation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this proposed activity is to develop a 10-year basic research vision with a 25-year focus to be implemented through a partnership between the National Science Foundation and the US Department of Transportation. It will incorporate the technologies noted above that are not traditionally included in transportation research. The objective to identify "Areas of Influence" and impacts of science and technology on transportation from the perspective of those supporting disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this program is to support basic research that provides the science and technology to ensure the following:&lt;br/&gt;1. The use of IT to make our surface transportation system safer, more reliable, and more productive.&lt;br/&gt;2. The impact on our human and natural systems of the use of IT to sustain and revitalize our transportation system must be understood well enough that we can capitalize upon the opportunities it presents to improve performance, as well as to identify and mitigate any unwanted consequences.&lt;br/&gt;3. Knowledge must be made available that will support "managing" both the complexity and the vulnerability of surface transportation systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Products from the workshop will include a report documenting a proposed 10-year research vision and the rationale behind the development of such a sustained program&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
