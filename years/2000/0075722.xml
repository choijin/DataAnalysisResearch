    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to develop algorithms and tools for interior point methods. &lt;br/&gt;The investigator will continue his ongoing research into interior point methods with &lt;br/&gt;the aim of advancing several outstanding topics in semidefinite programming (SDP) and &lt;br/&gt;related problems. A better understanding of neighborhoods and paths is needed in SDP, &lt;br/&gt;and in programming over a symmetric cone in general. This is necessary in order to &lt;br/&gt;develop more efficient algorithms in terms of faster asymptotic convergence and numerical &lt;br/&gt;stability. The investigator intends to develop effective mathematical tools to deal &lt;br/&gt;with these issues. Programming over homogeneous cones and hyperbolic cones are likely &lt;br/&gt;to become the next emerging fields in interior point methods, and there is a need to &lt;br/&gt;develop efficient, long-step interior algorithms for such problems. Eventually, &lt;br/&gt;interior point methods will need to deal with even more complicated industrial &lt;br/&gt;applications which must be solved efficiently. The project will involve all of these &lt;br/&gt;areas of interior point methods; efficient algorithms will be devised in all cases, &lt;br/&gt;and the needed mathematical tools will be developed. The project also has two other &lt;br/&gt;goals. The first is an extension of duality theory beyond its traditional convexity, &lt;br/&gt;and the second one is the development of faster proximal point algorithms for convex &lt;br/&gt;programming. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interior point methods have been successful in solving many large scale industrial problems &lt;br/&gt;in industry: in civil and electrical engineering, management, communication networks, &lt;br/&gt;finance, and others. Further applicability of these methods depends on a better &lt;br/&gt;understanding of their behavior and continuous development of appropriate software. This &lt;br/&gt;project aims to search for efficient algorithms and improved mathematical tools so that large &lt;br/&gt;scale optimization problems arising from diverse industrial disciplines can be efficiently &lt;br/&gt;solved.</AbstractNarration>
