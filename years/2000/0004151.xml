    <AbstractNarration>0004151&lt;br/&gt;Under this award, the Civil Engineering Research Foundation (CERF) will work closely with the National Science Foundation (NSF) and other government agencies, academia, and industry including designated representatives from different basic construction materials groups to enhance and continue implementation of a program to identify and develop key research initiatives in high-performance construction materials and systems. The effort aims to expedite the commercialization of those initiatives that are essential for the revitalization of the nation's infrastructure and the enhancement of our global competitiveness. This commercialization effort reinforces and complements the Construction Technology Goals initiative developed under the Construction and Building (C&amp;B) Subcommittee of the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC). The emphasis will be on the dissemination of key research findings and demonstration opportunities as well as the promoting and development of promising collaborative partnerships.***</AbstractNarration>
