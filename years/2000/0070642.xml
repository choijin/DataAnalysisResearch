<AbstractNarration>Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The applicant proposes to work on several related problems in function&lt;br/&gt;theoretic operator theory and in Euclidean harmonic analysis. He plans to&lt;br/&gt;use his recent work with Arcozzi and Sawyer as a basis for the study of&lt;br/&gt;interpolating sequences in Besov spaces. He proposes to use phase space&lt;br/&gt;methods to study eigenvectors of pseudodifferential operators and as well&lt;br/&gt;as solutions to other extremal problems. He also plans to use his recent&lt;br/&gt;work with Holland on the asymptotic behavior of Bergman kernel functions&lt;br/&gt;as a starting point to investigate whether generalized Segal-Bargmann&lt;br/&gt;spaces can be used to give quantum deformations of the plane. Finally, he&lt;br/&gt;plans to investigate whether certain techniques that arose in recent work&lt;br/&gt;on higher order Hankel operators have broader application in operator&lt;br/&gt;theory. The work proposed will advance the understanding of the function&lt;br/&gt;theoretic operator theory on spaces of holomorphic functions and of&lt;br/&gt;operators arising in Euclidean harmonic analysis. It will also develop new&lt;br/&gt;viewpoints and techniques that will have general applicability in those&lt;br/&gt;areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More generally, the proposed work is at the interface of operator theory,&lt;br/&gt;function theory, and harmonic analysis.  The unifying theme of the work is&lt;br/&gt;the systematic use of phase space methods, both as a technical tool and,&lt;br/&gt;more importantly, as a unifying conceptual structure.  Those tools and&lt;br/&gt;that viewpoint have been very productive, both historically and recently,&lt;br/&gt;of important new techniques in theoretical mathematics and of major new&lt;br/&gt;applications of mathematics to science and engineering.  The recent work&lt;br/&gt;Lacey and Thiele on bilinear operators is an example of the first and the&lt;br/&gt;impact of wavelet and related methods on signal processing is a&lt;br/&gt;spectacular example of the second.  One certainly expects that further&lt;br/&gt;research in these areas will continue to produce important additional&lt;br/&gt;contributions inside and outside of mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
