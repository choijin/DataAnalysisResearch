<AbstractNarration>Under the direction of Dr. Kathleen Morrison, Mr. Enrique Rodriguez-Alegria will collect data for his doctoral dissertation. To examine the changes in pottery production and utilization in early colonial Mexico City, he will examine relevant collections there, study archival material in Spain and assist in neutron activation analysis of clay at the University of Missouri reactor facility. While the Spanish conquered the Aztec city of Mexico-Tenochtitlan in 1521 and subsequently formed the uppermost stratum in the society thus created, the situation was not straightforward. Intermarriage between conqueror and conquered was common and within the Spanish themselves significant social stratification took place. While documentary evidence provides some insight into this process, many details are unknown and through the study of ceramic material excavated from Mexico City residences significant additional insight can be attained.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Immediately after the conquest Spanish conquistadors began to import serving vessels from Europe and China. These vessels were different from Aztec pottery because they were covered with a white glaze and had specialized shapes that pleased European tastes. Indigenous Mexicans immediately began producing pottery in imitation of the form and surface finish of European imports. These imitation types, although recognizably different from the European products, apparently gained favor in the colonial market in Mexico City. Using archaeological material from 12 Spanish houses Mr. Rodriguez-Alegria will address basic questions related to who consumed different imported types and who used indigenous imitations of Spanish imports. Among the factors to be studied using archival records are the immigrant or local status of the families involved, the presence of Indians in the household as spouses or servants, the financial wealth of the families, and the role of the family in the conquest or in government. The use of imported and indigenous products should shed light on the factors which led to emerging class structure in New Spain and the role of Indians in the production and distribution of this significant artifact class.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will shed new light on the process of assimilation and acculturation and produce data of interest to many archaeologists and historians. It will also assist in training a promising young scientist.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
