<AbstractNarration>     Support for multiple quality-of-service (QOS) levels in mobile, distributed, packet radio&lt;br/&gt;networks is required for many commercial wireless applications. Mobile radio networks (or ad&lt;br/&gt;hoc networks) are required in situations where the network itself must be highly mobile and&lt;br/&gt;where access to a fixed infrastructure of base stations is not available. To meet demands of&lt;br/&gt;portability and low-power operation, it is desirable for a single ad hoc network to service the&lt;br/&gt;traffic demands of a wide range of applications, including examples such as all-informed&lt;br/&gt;multicast voice, real-time video, large file transfers, and interactive web browsing. Each class of&lt;br/&gt;traffic has specific service requirements and these QOS levels must be provided from a mobile&lt;br/&gt;and distributed network that operates with battery power only and with very limited bandwidth.&lt;br/&gt;     The Wireless Communications Program at Clemson University has recognized that&lt;br/&gt;strong interaction among different protocol layers in ad hoc radio networks is not only desirable&lt;br/&gt;but in fact essential. A single protocol layer cannot guarantee a specific quality of service for a&lt;br/&gt;traffic type, but there must be coordination among the routing, queuing, traffic scheduling,&lt;br/&gt;congestion control, channel-access, and adaptive-transmission protocols. We have already&lt;br/&gt;demonstrated that information from the physical and link layers can be effectively utilized by the&lt;br/&gt;routing protocol to dramatically improve the end-to-end network performance and reduce the&lt;br/&gt;total energy expended by the mobile radios. The proposed research and education plan is based&lt;br/&gt;on our previous results that show that strong coupling among the protocol layers is vital for&lt;br/&gt;wireless communications networks that must interconnect highly mobile users and link them&lt;br/&gt;reliably to a fixed infrastructure. This career plan is structured to extend previous results through&lt;br/&gt;collaborative research that is focused on the link and network layers, and to explore a new topic&lt;br/&gt;area by applying the advances discovered in our previous work to new research into the&lt;br/&gt;interaction between the network and transport layers.&lt;br/&gt;     The proposed career plan is centered on both undergraduate and graduate student&lt;br/&gt;participation. The topics are organized so that students with a range of experience levels can&lt;br/&gt;make significant contributions. A key priority of the research plan is to include students with a&lt;br/&gt;variety of career goals and motivate them to strive for the highest levels of scientific and&lt;br/&gt;engineering excellence throughout their careers. Ample opportunities are planned to encourage&lt;br/&gt;and develop promising undergraduate students to pursue graduate school. An important&lt;br/&gt;component of the educational plan is to incorporate research tools in the classroom. Animation&lt;br/&gt;tools that illustrate the performance of our distributed protocols have increased our&lt;br/&gt;understanding our research and they will prove to be equally valuable in the classroom and&lt;br/&gt;laboratory. Rather than simply reading about networking protocols in a textbook, students will&lt;br/&gt;implement distributed protocols within a discrete event simulation program and see the&lt;br/&gt;performance implications of the various protocols.</AbstractNarration>
