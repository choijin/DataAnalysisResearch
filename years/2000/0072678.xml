<AbstractNarration>Theorems and algorithms for Cooperative &lt;br/&gt;and Dynamic Games:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;T.E.S. Raghavan, University of Illinois at Chicago&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the main problems of the proposal in &lt;br/&gt;cooperative game theory is to find efficient &lt;br/&gt;algorithms to solve for the nucleolus of &lt;br/&gt;combinatorial TU games, based on the successful &lt;br/&gt;algorithms for assignment and interval games.  &lt;br/&gt;A second problem is to study games with stable &lt;br/&gt;cores. In particular to study core stability for &lt;br/&gt;combinatorial games such as assignment games. &lt;br/&gt;In coalitional bargaining we will look for subgame &lt;br/&gt;perfect stationary Nash equilibria of perfect &lt;br/&gt;information games which approximate in its payoff &lt;br/&gt;the nucleolus payoff.  In the area of dynamic games, &lt;br/&gt;we would like to extend the policy improvement &lt;br/&gt;algorithm for  undiscounted stochastic games &lt;br/&gt;of perfect information. We would formulate models &lt;br/&gt;of tax evasion as dynamic games and study their &lt;br/&gt;equilibria.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The  problems in cooperative games posed above &lt;br/&gt;are physically motivated by the following questions. &lt;br/&gt;Federal and state governments undertake costly construction &lt;br/&gt;facilities like bridges, freeways,  water and sewer pipes,  &lt;br/&gt;railroads and airports.  Often   the critical  decision &lt;br/&gt;facing the government is to distribute the total cost &lt;br/&gt;among the users in an equitable way.  The algorithms to &lt;br/&gt;be developed will help to arrive at such equitable costs &lt;br/&gt;after properly modeling the problems as cooperative games.  &lt;br/&gt;Tax offices are flooded with tax returns;  Indutrial &lt;br/&gt;corporations are flooded with  vouchers for payment &lt;br/&gt;approval; automobile manufacturers are supplied with large &lt;br/&gt;consignment of automobile parts for quick acceptance. &lt;br/&gt;Auditors are few in number to audit all tax returns; &lt;br/&gt;accountants are few to check all vouchers; laborataries &lt;br/&gt;and manpower are limited to test for all defective items.  &lt;br/&gt;One can classify the tax returns or vouchers or suppliers &lt;br/&gt;into various categories and make decisions on which items &lt;br/&gt;in the tax return or voucher to audit; what percent of &lt;br/&gt;defective items in a sample require acceptance or more &lt;br/&gt;testing. Depending on the outcome of auditing, or sequential &lt;br/&gt;sampling one can  make new decisions on  how frequently &lt;br/&gt;one should audit the future returns and vouchers from &lt;br/&gt;the specific class of violators.  In polluting the &lt;br/&gt;environment, the violators are often big manufacturers. &lt;br/&gt;If the pollutants are distinct, then polluters are some &lt;br/&gt;what identifiable and the cost of cleaning can be &lt;br/&gt;decentralized. If the pollutants are of a few type, then &lt;br/&gt;one knows roughly which  groups of polluters could have &lt;br/&gt;contributed to which type. The levels of violation would &lt;br/&gt;require sporadic or systematic inspection.  In a way &lt;br/&gt;the total cost has to be collected by suitable taxing &lt;br/&gt;policies that could vary depending on the levels of &lt;br/&gt;pollution. For an ordinary home owner sewer charges are &lt;br/&gt;simply tied to the water usage.  When the polluters are &lt;br/&gt;confounded one has to identify polluters by sending  &lt;br/&gt;inspectors now and then to make spot check for &lt;br/&gt;environmental violations and punish violators by &lt;br/&gt;various penalties.  In such problems the algorithms &lt;br/&gt;to be developed will show the formal ways of arriving at &lt;br/&gt;cost figures or inspection strategies that are both &lt;br/&gt;intuitively and scientifically defendable. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
