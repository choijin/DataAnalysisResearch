<AbstractNarration>This project will examine mistaken eyewitness identifications as a principal source of erroneous convictions. Although a growing body of empirical research by psychologists provides insights into the factors contributing to mistaken identifications, and with increasing frequency, psychologists are called upon to provide courtroom testimony about those factors. Such expert testimony, however, is often criticized as unreliable. This project will examine the empirical questions of reliability and generalization of findings using a meta-analysis of existing studies of face recognition, in both the eyewitness and laboratory research paradigms.  In particular, the project will examine the strength and reliability of research findings concerning a large number of factors thought to influence identification accuracy and the relationships among research methods and the magnitude of effects produced by manipulations of substantive variables. Factors to be addressed include stable (e.g., sex, race) and malleable characteristics (e.g., stress, disguise) of both participants and targets, as well as situational (e.g., exposure duration) and procedural (e.g., lineup presentation) variables. Careful attention will be given in the meta-analysis to the different types of study characteristics, independent variables, and their operationalization employed in the research.  The project, as a result, will identify research and theoretical domains where findings are on the strongest and weakest footings and, most importantly, will test a series of hypotheses about methodological and substantive factors that enhance or limit the generalizability and theoretical implications of research results.</AbstractNarration>
