<AbstractNarration>Mathematical Sciences (21) Biological Sciences (61)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This "Proof of Concept" project is developing an integrated mathematics and biology course that teaches linear algebra concepts in the context of biological case studies. This course is being team-taught to a mixture of junior biology students and sophomore mathematics students and is intended to supplement, not replace, current courses in linear algebra for the mathematics majors and current courses in ecology for the biology majors. The course is designed to strengthen the mathematical skills of biology students, expose mathematics students to mathematical models used in biology, teach students how to collaborate with people trained in different scientific disciplines, and teach students how to critically read research papers. Biology and mathematics students working together on case studies, group projects, and presentations form an extensive part of the course. The case studies, based on accessible biological research papers that incorporate mathematical models, are being written jointly by mathematics and biology faculty. Homework assignments and supplemental reading material for the course are also being created. The mathematical topics in the course include matrix algebra, bases, eigenvectors, eigenvalues, systems of linear difference and differential equations, and ill-conditioned matrices. The biological topics include population matrices, elasticity and sensitivity, nutrient flow in aquatic systems, spread of infectious diseases, and genetics. These materials are being modified for dissemination to disciplinary faculty who wish to supplement existing courses in ecology, conservation biology, or linear algebra and for institutions who wish to design a similar integrated course. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
