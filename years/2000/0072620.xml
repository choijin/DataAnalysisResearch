    <AbstractNarration>0072620&lt;br/&gt;Wang&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal outlines a research program aimed at understanding the &lt;br/&gt;behavior of systems with regard to external inputs such as disturbances &lt;br/&gt;and track signals. Specifically, two types of stability properties will be &lt;br/&gt;examined: input-to-output stability and incremental stability. Roughly &lt;br/&gt;speaking, input-to-output stability requires that the output signals &lt;br/&gt;eventually become small if the external input signals are small, and in &lt;br/&gt;particular, the output signals should converge to zero when there is no &lt;br/&gt;input acting on the system. Incremental stability properties require nearby &lt;br/&gt;trajectories with nearby inputs stay nearby, and eventually converge to &lt;br/&gt;each other. These properties are nonlinear generalizations of some &lt;br/&gt;frequently used ones in the study of linear systems. To understand the &lt;br/&gt;properties in the nonlinear case well, it is crucial to explore their &lt;br/&gt;equivalent characterizations, among which the Lyapunov-like functions &lt;br/&gt;provide the most intrinsic insight. The main objective of the project is to &lt;br/&gt;investigate the equivalent characterizations and to develop the theory of &lt;br/&gt;Lyapunov-like functions for the nonlinear stability properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the main issues in systems and control theory concerns with the &lt;br/&gt;study of system sensitivity to disturbances, and more generally, of the &lt;br/&gt;dependence of outputs on actuator and measurement errors, magnitudes of &lt;br/&gt;tracking signals, and the like. For linear systems, the frequency domain &lt;br/&gt;approach has led great success in the study of such problems. Yet for &lt;br/&gt;nonlinear systems, the situation is much more complicated. A key issue in &lt;br/&gt;the nonlinear case is to identify the most desired features and to formulate &lt;br/&gt;them into suitable mathematical notions. During the last 10 years or so, &lt;br/&gt;the notion of input-to-state stability was formulated and it quickly became &lt;br/&gt;a fundamental concept upon which much of modern nonlinear feedback &lt;br/&gt;analysis and design rest. In this project it is proposed to investigate a wide &lt;br/&gt;variety of extensions of the notion of input-to-state stability. The goal is to &lt;br/&gt;build a theoretical foundation for the study of stability-like properties for &lt;br/&gt;nonlinear systems, thereby providing a set of sound theoretical tools for &lt;br/&gt;nonlinear systems design.</AbstractNarration>
