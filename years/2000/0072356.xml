<AbstractNarration>Proposal:  DMS-0072356&lt;br/&gt;PI: Jerzy Dydak&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator plans to work on&lt;br/&gt; a general theory of dimension called&lt;br/&gt;the extension dimension. In this theory, dim(X) is not a natural number.&lt;br/&gt;Instead, dim(X) is a CW complex and dim(X) being at most K&lt;br/&gt;means that K is an absolute extensor of X. In particular,&lt;br/&gt;dim(X) being at most the n-sphere is equivalent to the covering dimension&lt;br/&gt;of X being at most n. dim(X)=K means that K&lt;br/&gt;is minimal with respect to all L such that dim(X) is at most L.&lt;br/&gt;It turns out that infinite symmetric products play a crucial role&lt;br/&gt;in the whole theory. Their properties lead to a natural algebra&lt;br/&gt;with self-duality. That self-duality is an algebraic manifestation&lt;br/&gt;of the geometric duality between compact spaces and CW complexes.&lt;br/&gt;All infinite symmetric products equivalent to compact&lt;br/&gt;or finite-dimensional CW complexes are classified.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In classical dimension theory one tries to attach&lt;br/&gt;a natural number n (or infinity) to every space.&lt;br/&gt;It turns out that the natural number n is simply a substitute&lt;br/&gt;for the n-sphere and saying that dim(X) is at most n reflects&lt;br/&gt;a certain relationship between the space X and the n-sphere.&lt;br/&gt;One can generalize the notion of dimension by considering&lt;br/&gt;the same relationship between the space X and a polyhedron K&lt;br/&gt;and that is stated as "dimension of X is at most K". For example, one can&lt;br/&gt;investigate if the dimension of X is at most the projective plane.&lt;br/&gt;It turns out that the dimension theory constructed that way&lt;br/&gt;is much closely connected to the mainstream of topology.&lt;br/&gt;In particular, one gets links to homological algebra&lt;br/&gt;and algebraic topology. One of the most interesting aspects of&lt;br/&gt;that theory is duality, a fundamental idea in the whole of&lt;br/&gt;mathematics. At the simplest level it means that not only&lt;br/&gt;are we trying to attach dimension (a polyhedron) to a space,&lt;br/&gt;but also we attach a space to a dimension.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
