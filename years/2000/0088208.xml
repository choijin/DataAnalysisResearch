<AbstractNarration>Engineering - Materials Science (57)  The Manufacturing Engineering program at Kettering University is undergoing a revamping of its curriculum to reduce the number of required core courses, while still providing students with experiential learning in materials processing and manufacturing systems. As a part of this restructuring of the curriculum, the program is introducing a new course which focuses on the selection of materials and processing routes for engineered products. Much of the content and pedagogy for the course is being adapted from successful projects at California Polytechnic University San Luis Obispo and at Virginia Tech. The course introduces these concepts in the framework of developing a manufacturing strategy for producing a real product in a team environment. This introduces students to concepts such as material selection, process selection, life- cycle engineering, economic decision making, risk and product liability assessment, engineering communication, project planning and engineering ethics. To implement this change, the faculty are incorporating the use of a graphical material property and processing selection database. The new course is being introduced over a two-year period to provide time for evaluation, assessment and re-design. Outside evaluators familiar with both the technical aspects and with pedagogical methods will assist in developing and implementing assessment tools to evaluate the specific outcomes of the course. By adapting and implementing approaches used at other institutions, this new course will serve as a catalyst for change in courses throughout the university.</AbstractNarration>
