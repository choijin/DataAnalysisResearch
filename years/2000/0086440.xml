    <AbstractNarration>WSU will implement a young women's afterschool and summer science camp program to determine what type and degree of contact is most effective in increasing their understanding of, and interest in, the areas of science, math and technology. Three types of science camps are proposed for middle school girls: eight-week afterschool camps (two days/week); week-long summer camps (six hours/day); and week-long residential summer camps. Each camp provides 30 hours of instruction. The theme of the camps in "Science at the Summit." This mountaineering theme covers many fields of science, mathematics and technology related to popular Northwest outdoor experiences. Camps are taught by a certified teacher, assisted by local outdoors experts, with support from women science professionals. A mentoring program brings together women professionals and students through regular E-mail contact over six-month period immediately following the camp experience. Girls also have program contact through CityLab's website and with CityLab's monthly newsletter. Program evaluation will determine whether or not the mode of delivery of content material, in combination with a strong mentoring program, significantly affects middle school student's interest in, and intent to pursue courses and experiences in science, math and technology.</AbstractNarration>
