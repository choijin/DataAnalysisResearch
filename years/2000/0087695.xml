<AbstractNarration>0087695&lt;br/&gt;Zafiriou&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Freshwater dissolved organic matter (DOM) strongly affects many important processes, particularly&lt;br/&gt;in organic-rich systems. Recent reports show that (1) the major term in the proton balance of the highly&lt;br/&gt;colored Satilla River is "organic alkalinity," and (2) that photoreactions in this water, catalyzed in part by&lt;br/&gt;Fe, consume O2, bleach color, and form CO, CO2 (the major product), and Fe(II). We hypothesized that&lt;br/&gt;CO2 arises by Fe-catalyzed "photodecarboxylation":&lt;br/&gt;DOM-COO-H + O2 + hv_______ Fe&lt;br/&gt;DOM-H + CO2&lt;br/&gt;a well-known reaction for simple molecules. The implied massive loss of the principal organic ionizable&lt;br/&gt;groups should profoundly influence many important properties of photo-altered DOM (hv-DOM): e.g.&lt;br/&gt;metal-binding capacity, acid-base properties, hydrophobic binding, adsorption/coagulation,&lt;br/&gt;bioavailability, optical properties, and perhaps behavior in water purification (e.g. chlorination).&lt;br/&gt;However, an initial study determining and modeling Satilla water's whole pH titration curves before vs.&lt;br/&gt;after photolysis (solar simulator) falsified the hypothesis above: for every CO2 formed only ~ 0.1 acidic&lt;br/&gt;group was lost; pH decreased (stronger acids formed than were consumed). Furthermore, Fe was involved&lt;br/&gt;in the changes observed.&lt;br/&gt;Objectives: Hence we are proposing (1) better characterizing the relationships among CO2 evolution,&lt;br/&gt;proton binding sites (concentrations and affinities), and other variables: [Fe], pH, [O2], light dose, and&lt;br/&gt;wavelength; (2) assessing the generality and environmental variability of these effects by studying other&lt;br/&gt;riverwaters, sampled in different seasons; (3) examining the effect of these changes on an important&lt;br/&gt;physico-chemical property of hv-DOM: its copper binding strength and capacity, and (4) formulating a&lt;br/&gt;better heuristic scheme than the hypothesis above to rationalize the results chemically. Clearly to some&lt;br/&gt;extent photo-generated CO2 does not originate simply from -COO&lt;br/&gt;-&lt;br/&gt;groups. Acidic groups, if lost, seem to&lt;br/&gt;be replaced by similar but not identical new acids from DOM photo-oxidation.&lt;br/&gt;Work Plan and Methods: This is a collaborative effort among a postdoctoral associate and two PIs with&lt;br/&gt;experience in organic/inorganic alkalinity-pH-CO2 properties, and DOM photochemistry. We are using&lt;br/&gt;optimizations of methods demonstrated to apply to this problem, and well-known Cu-binding study&lt;br/&gt;methods. The Altamaha, a more typical second river chosen for study, is also DOM-rich. Its DOM is&lt;br/&gt;thought to be derived from both allochthonous and autochthonous sources, in contrast to the Satilla's&lt;br/&gt;mainly allochthonous, highly colored DOM. Suwannee River water and well-known isolates of its humic&lt;br/&gt;and fulvic acids (SRFA, SRHA) are also being studied, since in organic-rich colored waters these&lt;br/&gt;fractions comprise a major portion of the DOM, organic alkalinity, and light-absorbing material.&lt;br/&gt;Education: This project contributes to training in environmental science by involving an independent-working&lt;br/&gt;postdoctoral associate and graduate students at UGA and WHOI.&lt;br/&gt;Societal Impacts: This study increases our understanding of processes potentially affecting water&lt;br/&gt;transparency, potability and treatment (e.g. chlorination), aquatic biota, and also the binding, transport,&lt;br/&gt;and transformations of agrichemicals and pollutants (especially Cu).</AbstractNarration>
