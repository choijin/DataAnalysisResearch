<AbstractNarration>Schlick&lt;br/&gt;0071877&lt;br/&gt;     The investigator and her colleagues organize a&lt;br/&gt;multidisciplinary workshop on methods for macromolecular&lt;br/&gt;modeling.  The aim is to bring together both developers of&lt;br/&gt;computational tools for biomolecular simulations and those&lt;br/&gt;biological and chemical scientists who use computer modeling to&lt;br/&gt;study macromolecular problems.  The workshop highlights recent&lt;br/&gt;advances in simulation techniques, most notably in the areas of&lt;br/&gt;conformational sampling, fast electrostatics, molecular dynamics&lt;br/&gt;integration, and quantum-mechanical calculations, that are having&lt;br/&gt;significant impact on structural biology.  It surveys developments&lt;br/&gt;in algorithmic approaches, hierarchical spatial representations,&lt;br/&gt;and improved computing platforms that continue to enhance the&lt;br/&gt;reliability of macromolecular simulations and increase their&lt;br/&gt;applicability and relevance to biomolecular research.  The topics&lt;br/&gt;highlighted are: (1) new methods for long-term molecular dynamics&lt;br/&gt;simulations; (2) conformational sampling: equilibrium and&lt;br/&gt;nonequilibrium processes; (3) multiscale modeling; (4)&lt;br/&gt;quantum/classical mechanics; (5) fast electrostatics; and (6)&lt;br/&gt;applications to enzyme catalysis, DNA modeling, and DNA/protein&lt;br/&gt;systems.  The workshop is held at the Courant Institute of&lt;br/&gt;Mathematical Sciences at New York University on October 12-14 and&lt;br/&gt;co-sponsored by SIAM (Society for Industrial and Applied&lt;br/&gt;Mathematics), as part of SIAM's new Activity Group in the Life&lt;br/&gt;Sciences, as well as by National Science Foundation programs in&lt;br/&gt;Applied Mathematics, Computational Mathematics, Theoretical and&lt;br/&gt;Computational Chemistry, and Molecular Biophysics.&lt;br/&gt;     Computational methods are increasingly being recognized as&lt;br/&gt;valuable tools for the study of biomolecular structure and&lt;br/&gt;function.  The interdisciplinary nature of biomolecular&lt;br/&gt;computational approaches is largely driven by the many important&lt;br/&gt;practical applications in the field, such as drug design,&lt;br/&gt;biomedical engineering, and food chemistry.  The workshop program&lt;br/&gt;provides a timely and unique opportunity for close interaction&lt;br/&gt;and scientific exchange among biomolecular researchers, computer&lt;br/&gt;scientists, and applied mathematicians.  In the era of integrative&lt;br/&gt;science, such synergy kindles new ideas and helps educate young&lt;br/&gt;scientists for cross-disciplinary research at the interface of&lt;br/&gt;computational science and biology.  The meeting brings researchers&lt;br/&gt;abreast of current developments in algorithms and computational&lt;br/&gt;methods.  It also highlights critical problems in structural&lt;br/&gt;biology and new application areas, and it fosters&lt;br/&gt;interdisciplinary collaborations.  The results of the workshop are&lt;br/&gt;disseminated through the collected scientific articles by the&lt;br/&gt;invited speakers, which will be published in Springer Verlag's&lt;br/&gt;Lecture Notes series in Computational Science and Engineering&lt;br/&gt;(LNCSE).  These tangible records, in addition to a carefully&lt;br/&gt;designed program, are expected to serve the community by&lt;br/&gt;educating junior scientists at disciplinary interfaces,&lt;br/&gt;stimulating new ideas in computational techniques for&lt;br/&gt;macromolecular modeling, and identifying key areas for future&lt;br/&gt;research.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
