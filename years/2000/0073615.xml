<AbstractNarration>CMS0073615&lt;br/&gt;PI: David Feary&lt;br/&gt;Institution: National Academy of Sciences&lt;br/&gt;"U.S. National Committee for Rock Mechanics"&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The U.S. National Committee for Rock Mechanics (USNC/RM) is the focal point for rock mechanics and other geotechnical activities within the National Research Council (NRC).  The USNC/RM provides (1) scientific and technical input to programs within the federal agencies and (2) U.S. participation and adherence to the International Society for Rock Mechanics (ISRM).  The USNC/RM operates under the auspices of the NRC's Board on Earth Sciences and Resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research and engineering developments in rock mechanics are driven by concerns for the natural and built environment (including radioactive and hazardous waste isolation and remediation and mitigation), mitigation of natural hazards such as earthquakes and landslides, environmentally sound recovery of natural resources, and interest in defense structures in rock.  The technological, economic, social, and political impact of these issues engage the attention of many government agencies, business corporations, and public interest groups and posits the need for the USNC/RM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The expertise, judgement, and strategic perspective of the USNC/RM serves to define and help initiate sponsored studies and other activities with respect to major areas of national interest or concern in which rock mechanics problems represent critical or limiting factors. In this regard, the committee offers a forum for meetings with federal agency liaison representative and other interested organizations to exchange ideas and information on important topics that may merit inquiry through the National Research Council.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The USNC/RM is the official representative of the United States on the International Society for Rock Mechanics.  This role of the committee is particularly important in today's global technical and economic environment for close scientific and technical interaction with the international rock mechanics community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
