<AbstractNarration>The research goals of this CAREER project are to identify novel routes of catabolic carbon flow and to isolate and characterize regulated genes following a switch from a photoautotrophic to a photo-or dark heterotrophic growth in a blue-green (cyanobacteria) alga, Synechocystis sp.  Target genes that are under control of a cyclic-AMP receptor protein will also be identified in this facultative heterotrophic cyanobacteria. Both biochemical and genetic methods of analysis will be used to gain a deeper understanding of the metabolic potential of Synechocystis. Understanding the basic physiology of cyanobacteria and the genetic regulation of physiological changes in response to environmental stimuli could lead to formation of new beneficial plant interactions or biodegradation of xenobiotic compounds from surface waters.  The project's teaching goals are intertwined with the research component.  Enhanced scientific thinking and research experience will be provided at the pre-college level through the use of Synechocystis as a classroom model.  High school teachers will be teamed up with graduate students for summer laboratory research, resulting in the development of physiological and genetic experiments appropriate for high school students.  Laboratory equipment will be assembled by the high school teacher/graduate student teams, enabling area students to perform hands-on experimental research in the classrooms of these trained teachers. Partnerships with local schools will provide original biological research experience to students and promote an interest and passion for science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The undergraduate educational focus is to involve students in original research experiences.  Research utilizing mutagenesis, molecular genetics and computer assisted sequence analysis will be incorporated into the appropriate microbiology laboratories and into a new upper division microbial genetics laboratory course. The focus on graduate student education will provide the skills required for research on genetic, biochemical and physiological aspects of biology and will provide opportunities to share these skills.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
