<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT:&lt;br/&gt;    The classical Phragmen-Lindelof theorem extends the maximum principle&lt;br/&gt;to unbounded analytic functions by showing that an analytic function that&lt;br/&gt;satisfies an asymptotic exponential bound in the upper half plane and a&lt;br/&gt;uniform bound on the real axis in fact satisfies a uniform exponential&lt;br/&gt;bound in the upper half plane. Research of the past three decades has&lt;br/&gt;shown that the validity of estimates of a similar character for analytic&lt;br/&gt;functions on algebraic varieties in n-dimensional complex Euclidean space&lt;br/&gt;are in fact equivalent to certain properties of linear constant&lt;br/&gt;coefficient partial differential operators.  Some such properties of the&lt;br/&gt;operators are surjectivity on the space of real analytic functions or&lt;br/&gt;Gevrey classes, the existence of lacuna in fundamental solutions, the&lt;br/&gt;existence of linear solution operators, and continuation properties of&lt;br/&gt;solutions of the homogeneous equation(s).  While there are different sets&lt;br/&gt;of these estimates associated to the different properties of the operator,&lt;br/&gt;they all are similar in spirit.  The aim of this work is to develop&lt;br/&gt;methods that give a geometric characterization of the algebraic varieties&lt;br/&gt;for which a given Phragmen-Lindelof condition is satisfied.  If&lt;br/&gt;successful, the work should also give insight into questions about the&lt;br/&gt;partial differential equations such as the existence of fundamental&lt;br/&gt;solutions with cone-shaped lacuna. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work is focused on developing tools in complex analysis that&lt;br/&gt;can be used to answer basic questions about linear partial differential&lt;br/&gt;equations.  In the 1950's, Laurent Schwartz formulated such fundamental&lt;br/&gt;problems for general linear partial differential equations.  Are they&lt;br/&gt;always solvable?  If so, can the solution be chosen as smooth as the data&lt;br/&gt;in the problem?  Do fundamental solutions exist?  Can the equations be&lt;br/&gt;solved with a "formula", so that the answer depends linearly on the data&lt;br/&gt;of the problem?  Most of these questions were answered in the 1950's by&lt;br/&gt;Ehrenpreis and Malgrange.  However, the question of whether the solution&lt;br/&gt;could be chosen to be real analytic when the data is real analytic was&lt;br/&gt;open until the late 1960's when the first counter examples were given.  In&lt;br/&gt;1973, Hormander gave a characterization of the equations with this&lt;br/&gt;property in terms of the validity of certain inequalities for analytic&lt;br/&gt;functions on the zero set of the polynomial giving the differential&lt;br/&gt;equation.  In 1990, Taylor, Meise, and Vogt answered the question about&lt;br/&gt;the existence of "formulas" for the solution and showed they were also&lt;br/&gt;characterized in terms of some similar inequalities.  The aim of this&lt;br/&gt;project is to develop tools that allow one to decide whether or not the&lt;br/&gt;required estimates are valid for a given partial differential equation. We&lt;br/&gt;believe that it is possible to develop an algorithm that will make the&lt;br/&gt;verification, and further, will explain the geometry of the zero set of&lt;br/&gt;the associated polynomial that is necessary for the inequalities to be&lt;br/&gt;satisfied. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
