<AbstractNarration>0072588&lt;br/&gt;Matalon&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the proposed work is to derive and analyze mathematical &lt;br/&gt;models that describe the dynamics of flames. The models will be derived &lt;br/&gt;systematically from the conservation laws of mass, momentum and energy &lt;br/&gt;by means of asymptotic methods and analyzed using analytical and &lt;br/&gt;numerical methods. It is proposed to identify mathematical models that &lt;br/&gt;contain enough details of the real combustion systems and analyze these &lt;br/&gt;models in order to gain basic understanding on how the physical and &lt;br/&gt;chemical processes interact in the simpler circumstances. Comparison &lt;br/&gt;with the experimental record will be performed in order to test the models &lt;br/&gt;and their predictions. The mathematical problems involve nonlinear &lt;br/&gt;evolution equations and nonlinear aspects of flame instabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the proposed work is to gain fundamental understanding &lt;br/&gt;in the complex processes occurring in combustion problems, problems that &lt;br/&gt;are encountered in various engineering applications. Improving our &lt;br/&gt;fundamental understanding of combustion phenomena could suggest new &lt;br/&gt;directions for applied research and lead to a better design of combustion &lt;br/&gt;systems. The problems that will be investigated are related to phenomena &lt;br/&gt;that have been observed in the laboratory but are not yet completely &lt;br/&gt;understood. The proposed work will address three classes of problems: &lt;br/&gt;The first class is concerned with the evolution of premixed flames in open &lt;br/&gt;space and in confined environments, where the coupled effects between &lt;br/&gt;the flame and the hydrodynamic field is of primary interest. Studies of &lt;br/&gt;premixed flames have significant technological importance and are &lt;br/&gt;directly applicable to internal combustion engines processes. The second &lt;br/&gt;class of problems is concerned with instabilities in non-premixed &lt;br/&gt;combustion, or diffusion flames, for which theoretical studies are only &lt;br/&gt;now emerging. Non-premixed conditions are favored in furnaces for safety &lt;br/&gt;reasons and in diesel engines here the liquid fuel evaporates in the &lt;br/&gt;combustion chamber providing the necessary fuel vapor that burns with &lt;br/&gt;air. The third class of problems is concerned with flame spread over &lt;br/&gt;flammable liquids, where the combined behaviors in the liquid and gas &lt;br/&gt;phases determine the flame dynamics. Flame spread over an accidental &lt;br/&gt;spillage of a flammable liquid, or a "running liquid fire" encountered in &lt;br/&gt;petrochemical industries, can become a fire hazard.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
