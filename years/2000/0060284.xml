<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project proposes to develop a new class of UV-transmitting, electrically conductive coatings by using filtered cathodic arc plasma deposition (FCAPD).&lt;br/&gt;Cathodic arc plasmas are characterized by relatively high ion energy (20-150 eV) that lead to denser films.&lt;br/&gt;Macroparticles which typically contaminate such plasmas can be filtered using curved magnetic filters that&lt;br/&gt;have been developed by Berkeley's Plasma Application Group.  Filtered cathodic arc coatings are not only&lt;br/&gt;dense but may be grown in a vacuum or reactive environments.  The window of partial pressure for&lt;br/&gt;stochiometric compound films is wider than for evaporation or sputtering methods. Moreover, sputtered&lt;br/&gt;coatings (and more so beam-evaporated films) are characterized by porosity, which increases the thickness&lt;br/&gt;for the required electrical conductivity, with reduced optical transmission. The primary objective of Phase I&lt;br/&gt;is to demonstrate that a thin coating can be produced which is highly conductive and transmits between 80-&lt;br/&gt;90% of the incident UV radiation.  Once the feasibility of using FCAPD for producing high density coatings&lt;br/&gt;that show high electrical conductivity and high light transparency have been answered, Phase II will&lt;br/&gt;optimize the process for larger areas. Engineering development, marketing and sales of coating units is the&lt;br/&gt;province of Phase III.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Commercial applications for FCAPD films include: electrochromic automotive and aircraft windows; heat&lt;br/&gt;mirrors; optoelectronic devices such as UV triggered diamond high voltage switches; solar cell surfaces for&lt;br/&gt;space applications Cathodic arc deposition of TiN coatings is a well established technology which supports&lt;br/&gt;tens of millions of dollars of business annually worldwide in coating equipment sales and hundreds of&lt;br/&gt;millions of dollars annually for the coatings generated by that equipment.</AbstractNarration>
