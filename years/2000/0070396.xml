<AbstractNarration>0070396&lt;br/&gt;Russel Meints&lt;br/&gt;A Multi-User Server for Bioinformatics Data Storage, Distribution and Analysis&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, Oregon State University (OSU) will obtain a multi-user computer server to support bioinformatics data storage, distribution, and analysis for the Biological Computing Consortium (BCC) network. This Consortium is comprised of seven research units: The Center for Gene Research &amp; Biotechnology (CGRB), and the Departments of Botany and Plant Pathology, Entomology, Food Science and Technology, Horticulture, Microbiology and Zoology. The Consortium network also supports academic programs closely associated with the research groups.  Seven individual laboratory members come from departments that are not part of the Consortium. Over 800 individual accounts are supported from the Consortium network which is currently based on two servers: a Sun E4000 (installed 1998) for genetic, genomic, phylogenetic, and GIS data analysis and a Sun 670MP (age: 7 years) that is used to provide e-mail, web services, and administrative support for the Consortium members.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will be used to replace the Sun 670MP, which has reached obsolescence. The&lt;br/&gt;exponential growth of data from genetic research supports the need for the much larger capacity server than the one currently in use. This second server will allow implementation of a database driven archival, retrieval and data analysis system. This will support storage and retrieval of large amounts of data for multiple simultaneous users and allow this information to be distributed using web-based technology to researchers anywhere on campus. The new server will provide important back-up for the Sun E4000 to ensure that the research can continue even if one of the servers is out of service. The CGRB currently generates more than 1000 Megabytes (1 Gbyte) of research data per week. The amount of data that is generated is expected to triple in the near future with the increase in genomics research and the addition of new technologies such as DNA micro-array chip readers, capillary sequencing systems, and digital fluorescence microscopy systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research projects of the five major user groups are as follows: analyzing evolutionary patterns in continuous characters; phylogenetic, biogeographic and revisionary studies of insects and construction of web-based specimen and insect collection databases; studies of auxin and cytokinin interactions in tomato and identifying the diageotropica (dgt) mutant of tomato; researching population genetics of ectomycorrhizal fungi; and studying poplars as a model system for tree genetic engineering, which focuses on how to control flowering in order to develop a reliable system to contain transgenic material. There are more than 100 principal investigators associated with the Consortium who will benefit from this new server.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
