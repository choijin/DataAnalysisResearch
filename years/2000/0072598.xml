<AbstractNarration>VARIATIONAL ANALYSIS AND DYNAMIC OPTIMIZATION&lt;br/&gt;DMS 0072598&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of this proposal is to make an essential &lt;br/&gt;contribution to the mathematical progress of &lt;br/&gt;three classes of such problems by actually &lt;br/&gt;producing different optimality criteria and &lt;br/&gt;furnishing stability analysis results.  The three &lt;br/&gt;classes are under three main headings: the &lt;br/&gt;generalized problem of Bolza, the continuous-time &lt;br/&gt;optimal control, and the discrete-time optimal &lt;br/&gt;control.  The first class, the generalized problem of&lt;br/&gt;Bolza, falls in the heart of nonsmooth analysis where &lt;br/&gt;the regularity of the integrand is lacking but &lt;br/&gt;compensated for by the relative regularity of its&lt;br/&gt;Hamiltonian.  Despite the fact that under certain &lt;br/&gt;hypotheses the second class can be viewed as a &lt;br/&gt;subclass of the first, it is quite beneficial to&lt;br/&gt;study this class directly on its own to obtain results &lt;br/&gt;that take into account the special and rich structure &lt;br/&gt;of the problem.  This direction of research produces &lt;br/&gt;for the optimal control problems, results that are, in&lt;br/&gt;general, distinct from those obtained by applying the &lt;br/&gt;results of the generalized problem of Bolza.  Furthermore, &lt;br/&gt;these two sets of results hold for the optimal control &lt;br/&gt;setting under  different sets of hypotheses.  The third &lt;br/&gt;class of problems is important for numerically solving the&lt;br/&gt;continuous-time optimal control problem via discretization.&lt;br/&gt;For the three classes, second-order necessary and &lt;br/&gt;sufficient conditions would be derived in terms of a &lt;br/&gt;quadratical functional, conjugate point theory, and  &lt;br/&gt;a Riccati equation.  Furthermore, results on the stability &lt;br/&gt;and sensitivity of solutions to perturbations would be &lt;br/&gt;investigated.  The Hamilton-Jacobi theory would be &lt;br/&gt;employed, as well as the latest techniques from &lt;br/&gt;variational and nonsmooth analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Optimization problems with dynamical structure have become &lt;br/&gt;prominent in a variety of disciplines as mathematical &lt;br/&gt;models of systems with time evolution. In particular, &lt;br/&gt;optimal control theory is a subject that was developed in &lt;br/&gt;the 1950's mainly to deal with applications arising from &lt;br/&gt;several disciplines. This includes engineering, operations&lt;br/&gt;management and economics. Most problem formulation were &lt;br/&gt;initially derived from engineering considerations which &lt;br/&gt;lead to the presence of control and state constraints. This &lt;br/&gt;is the case  with the "soft moon landing problem" and &lt;br/&gt;the "rocket car problem". Most recently, the formulation &lt;br/&gt;of the optimal control problem has been adapted to include &lt;br/&gt;considerations from other areas like management and &lt;br/&gt;economics. This accounts for the increased interest in &lt;br/&gt;optimal control problems with constraints containing both &lt;br/&gt;the state and the control variable. Therefore, providing &lt;br/&gt;new tools and better techniques to tackle these problems &lt;br/&gt;and to help in computing their solutions would have an &lt;br/&gt;important impact on the applications emanating from &lt;br/&gt;those disciplines. This is exactly the goal of the present &lt;br/&gt;proposal. In fact, the intent is to derive optimality &lt;br/&gt;criteria for control problems with different types of &lt;br/&gt;constraints. Furthermore, the stability of these criteria &lt;br/&gt;under small perturbations is analysed. This latter is &lt;br/&gt;crucial for applications, due to the error in measurements.                          &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
