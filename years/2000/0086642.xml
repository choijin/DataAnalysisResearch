<AbstractNarration>     This document describes a proposed software system, called INBOUNDS (Integrated&lt;br/&gt;Network-Based Ohio University Network Detective Service), that will address the&lt;br/&gt;difficult research problem of security in the dynamic real-time Internet environment&lt;br/&gt;populated by both legitimate users and hostile intruders.&lt;br/&gt;    Internet security is becoming more critical by the day. Successful attacks on banks,&lt;br/&gt;schools, government agencies, and corporations that do business online are becoming&lt;br/&gt;more and more common, and the frequency of these attacks and the amount of damage&lt;br/&gt;done is rising rapidly. Commercially available firewalls and intrusion detection systems&lt;br/&gt;are currently the only weapons with which to defend against the threat, but they are&lt;br/&gt;obviously not capable of keeping up with the ever-changing attack strategies of hackers.&lt;br/&gt;     Thus, we propose INBOUNDS a real-time network based intrusion detection and&lt;br/&gt;response system under development at Ohio University's Laboratory for Real-Time,&lt;br/&gt;Secure Systems and Applications. INBOUNDS detects and responds to suspicious&lt;br/&gt;behavior by using TCPTrace (a network traffic analysis tool) and DeSiDeRaTa (dynamic,&lt;br/&gt;real-time resource management middleware). INBOUNDS is intended to function in a&lt;br/&gt;heterogeneous environment with fault tolerance, very low overhead, and a high degree of&lt;br/&gt;scalability. A prototype of INBOUNDS is currently being used for around-the-clock&lt;br/&gt;intrusion detection and response at Ohio University and we propose to add functionality&lt;br/&gt;that will enable INBOUNDS to deal with the following important types of attacks:&lt;br/&gt;    Large-scale, distributed denial-of-service attacks&lt;br/&gt;    Abnormal network protocol behavior including SYN and RESET attacks&lt;br/&gt;    Suspicious keywords in interactive sessions/email&lt;br/&gt;    Suspicious patterns of data, such as the fan-out patterns commonly seen with&lt;br/&gt;    email viruses&lt;br/&gt;    Communication over unusual network ports, which are common when attackers&lt;br/&gt;    target seldom used and insecure servers&lt;br/&gt;    Connections from unknown/unusual hosts&lt;br/&gt;    Abnormal data patterns for a particular time of day&lt;br/&gt;    Unusual data patterns on known ports, such as would be seen when at attacker&lt;br/&gt;    installs programs using the fingerd port as in the Morris Worm</AbstractNarration>
