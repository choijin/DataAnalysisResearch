<AbstractNarration>This proposal concerns research and education on adaptive regression&lt;br/&gt;when the random errors are dependent. Many procedures have been &lt;br/&gt;(and will be) proposed for nonparametric regression based on&lt;br/&gt;different assumptions. In applications, a difficulty a user often&lt;br/&gt;faces is the choice of the best method for the data at&lt;br/&gt;hand. This is specially the case for high-dimensional function&lt;br/&gt;estimation, where to overcome the curse of dimensionality, various &lt;br/&gt;parsimonious models such as projection pursuit, CART, neural nets, &lt;br/&gt;additive models, MARS, etc. are proposed according to different &lt;br/&gt;characterizations of the target function. A main interest in this &lt;br/&gt;research is to construct adaptive estimators by combining a&lt;br/&gt;collection of candidate procedures. The goal for the combined&lt;br/&gt;procedure is to perform automatically as well as (or nearly as well&lt;br/&gt;as) the best original procedure without knowing which one it is.  &lt;br/&gt;The random errors will be assumed to be generally dependent,&lt;br/&gt;including both short- and long-range cases. The effects of&lt;br/&gt;dependence on adaptation capability will be studied. It is&lt;br/&gt;anticipated that theoretically proven and computationally feasible &lt;br/&gt;algorithms will be proposed to combine regression procedures&lt;br/&gt;targeted at various characteristics of the regression function and &lt;br/&gt;different dependence structures for the random errors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Function estimation is an important statistical tool that tries to&lt;br/&gt;understand accurately the functional relationships between variables based on &lt;br/&gt;data and it has applications in many disciplines for successfully  &lt;br/&gt;addressing scientific questions. In reality, observations are always&lt;br/&gt;subject to random noise (error) from different sources. When the&lt;br/&gt;random errors are dependent on each other, the dependence may&lt;br/&gt;disguise the functional relationship of interest. Long-range&lt;br/&gt;dependence refers to a situation where the errors are still highly&lt;br/&gt;correlated even when they occur at times or locations that are far&lt;br/&gt;away from each other. It is known that such a long-range dependence makes&lt;br/&gt;the estimation of the target function much harder. In applications,&lt;br/&gt;the degree of dependence between the errors is usually unknown,&lt;br/&gt;which makes the function estimation problem even harder. In this&lt;br/&gt;proposal, we intend to develop methods that adaptively handle&lt;br/&gt;different degrees of dependence among the errors so that the&lt;br/&gt;function of interest can be estimated optimally without knowing the&lt;br/&gt;dependence structure of the errors. The research results and related&lt;br/&gt;work by others on long-range dependent data will be brought to&lt;br/&gt;students at various levels in several statistics&lt;br/&gt;courses. Collaborations will be conducted with several professors at&lt;br/&gt;Iowa State University and their students in atmospheric science, &lt;br/&gt;electrical engineering, agronomy and possibly other fields to&lt;br/&gt;appropriately address long-range dependence phenomena, which have&lt;br/&gt;been encountered often and known to cause problems in data analysis &lt;br/&gt;with the existing statistical methods. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
