<AbstractNarration>Mathematical Sciences (21)  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This "Mathematics Across the Curriculum" (MAC) project is integrating mathematics into curricula that are not typically associated with mathematics. The key problem that this project addresses is students' lack of opportunity to deepen and reinforce the mathematics that they have learned in their mathematics classes as well as understand its greater importance and application in their lives. The project is assisting faculty across the disciplines to create, evaluate, and modify projects that incorporate mathematics. The project is adapting and implementing the results and practices of previously funded NSF projects at Dartmouth College and Alverno College. Principal investigators from these projects are serving as consultants and evaluators for the MAC project. Participants include faculty from Washington State community colleges, The Evergreen State College, Western Washington University, and the local school district. Additional support is being provided by the State Board for Community and Technical Colleges; the Puget Sound Center for Teaching, Learning and Technology; the Washington Center for the Improvement of Undergraduate Education; and the GTE Service Corporation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is allowing faculty of various disciplines to create activities, projects, and/or courses that explicitly incorporate mathematical dimensions of their disciplines. Statewide and national dissemination of best practices are a planned key outcome.</AbstractNarration>
