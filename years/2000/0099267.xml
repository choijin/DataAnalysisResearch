<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;The biennial meeting of the International Ethological Congress is open to all who are interested in ethology, animal behavior and related disciplines. The IEC is the only international gathering for those studying all aspects of animal behavior. The coverage of the field at IEC conferences is always broad, with papers ranging from neurobiology and neurochemistry to applied animal ethology and behavioral evolution. The IEC emphasizes integration of the field of animal behavior across all animal groups and all levels of analysis rather than promoting one particular point of view or methodology. It seeks to integrate pure and applied ethology, field and laboratory orientations, theoretical and empirical approaches and to bring together those working in other subdisciplines, such as ornithology, herpetology, mammalogy, entomology, primatology, physical anthropology. The conference also makes an effort to bring in ideas from related fields that can broaden and strengthen the study of behavior.  &lt;br/&gt; It is particularly important that young scientists be exposed to this perspective and to the intellectual stimulation that this conference provides. They need to establish professional contacts with leaders in their field from around the world. As interactions in many fields increase, this opportunity for international dialogue between young scientists of different countries should also not be overlooked. Because these young scientists are often financially limited, NSF support that would partially defray the costs of this conference will greatly enhance their participation in the conference and allow them to reap the professional and intellectual rewards of that experience.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
