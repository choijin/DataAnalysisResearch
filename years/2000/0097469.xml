    <AbstractNarration>The REU site focuses on mathematics and statistics applied to industrial problems. The problems come from local business and industry, partners of WPI's Center for Industrial Mathematics and Statistics. The students work closely with a company representative who introduces them to the problem and guides their work to a solution the company can really use. The faculty advisor helps them maintain a focus on the mathematical issue at the core of the problem. The whole experience is designed to provide the students with a glimpse of the ways that advanced mathematics is used to solve real-world problems.&lt;br/&gt;The selection of students is based on academic qualifications, career objectives and past work experience. Working in teams of 2 to 4, students meet daily with the faculty advisor and provide oral and written progress reports for the other teams and the company representative. In this way, the projects help develop some skills in communication and teamwork that are crucial for success in a nonacademic work environment.&lt;br/&gt;In addition presentations by mathematicians who work in industry and site-visits to companies contribute to providing the students with a complete image of industrial mathematics.</AbstractNarration>
