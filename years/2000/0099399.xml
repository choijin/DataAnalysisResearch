<AbstractNarration>We want to investigate several projects in Dynamical Systems &lt;br/&gt;and in Partial Differential equations. We will also &lt;br/&gt;consider multi-particle systems that share properties with both/&lt;br/&gt;One unifying thread is that we would like to understand the relation &lt;br/&gt;between variational approaches and more geometric ones. &lt;br/&gt;In particular, we would like to produce proofs of diffusion &lt;br/&gt;that use geometric and variational methods and to &lt;br/&gt;extend  results in  dynamics obtained by variational methods to partial &lt;br/&gt;differential equations. An important tool for &lt;br/&gt;geometric methods is the theory of normally hyperbolic &lt;br/&gt;manifolds and we would like to extend it to Partial differential&lt;br/&gt;equations and infinite particle systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes, small  short range causes may have large long term &lt;br/&gt;effects. For example, small periodic  forces may build up large changes in energy. &lt;br/&gt;Some small changes in  the local properties of &lt;br/&gt;a material may lead to the emergence of patterns that cover large distances. &lt;br/&gt;In other situations, however, local effects just average out.&lt;br/&gt;We would like to device a broad based array of methods (including &lt;br/&gt;numerical studies and geometric techniques)&lt;br/&gt;that can be used to decide whether build up or &lt;br/&gt;averaging occurs. We would also like to pay special attention to&lt;br/&gt;some concrete models appearing in technological applications.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
