    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will design, fabricate and test a&lt;br/&gt;prototype gas-cluster ion-beam (GCIB) sputtering tool for depth profiles with&lt;br/&gt;monolayer-specific surface analysis of thin films. Applications will be to multilayer&lt;br/&gt;thin films of key importance in the microelectronics industries including semiconductors,&lt;br/&gt;metals in magnetic sensors, and dielectrics in photonic and micro-optical devices. The&lt;br/&gt;sputtering tool is expected to meet aggressive performance specifications including depth&lt;br/&gt;resolution of less than 1 nm in conjunction with mass spectrometry. This GCIB tool will&lt;br/&gt;be designed particularly for in-situ sputtering with surface-analytical instruments&lt;br/&gt;including the secondary-ion mass spectrometer (SIMS), the Auger electron spectrometer&lt;br/&gt;(AES) and the x-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS). The overriding motivation is the&lt;br/&gt;critical need in microelectronics for techniques to obtain accurate sputter depth&lt;br/&gt;measurements. The Phase-I effort demonstrated those GCIB methods with argon clusters&lt;br/&gt;sputter with near-atomic smoothness, high depth resolution and high secondary-ion yields.&lt;br/&gt;Minor instrumental design issues limited the cluster beam exposure uniformity and this&lt;br/&gt;artificially limited the average depth resolution measured. Straightforward engineering&lt;br/&gt;solutions are well known and are expected to yield improvements in Phase II that will&lt;br/&gt;provide depth resolution of well below 1 nm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed technology will enable analysis of next-generation microelectronics devices&lt;br/&gt;having much thinner films. Epion is the first and only to manufacture GCIB systems. The&lt;br/&gt;tool to be prototyped will enable and have a wide applicability to many areas of the&lt;br/&gt;electronic materials processing and manufacturing industry.</AbstractNarration>
