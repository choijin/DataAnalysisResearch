    <AbstractNarration>0070321&lt;br/&gt;James D. Forney&lt;br/&gt;Purdue Research Foundation&lt;br/&gt;Quantitative Data Analysis and Graphics Facility: Storm 860 and Alpha Imagers &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will fund the development of an interdepartmental facility for documentation and quantification of biochemical and molecular biological data. This facility will provide equipment and software to digitize data derived from most gel electrophoresis experiments and allows analysis of the resulting data. The procedures and techniques that can be analyzed will include: DNA and RNA sequencing and structure analysis, PCR-based assays including quantitative PCR and RFLP analysis, quantitative northern and Western blotting, Southern hybridizations, non-radioactive detection for research and teaching laboratories, colony counting and kinetic analyses of enzymatic reactions. The goal is to maximize use by making the facility as flexible and as accessible as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Equipment to be purchased includes two imagers capable of quantifying data imaged using autoradiography, fluorescent stains or labels, visible stains or labels, or simply using white lighting. These two components are the Storm 860 Imager (Molecular Dynamics) and the AlphaImager (AlphaInnotech). Sufficient computational equipment will be purchased to perform image and data analysis. The facility will be installed on the first floor of the centrally located Biochemistry building, which will provide easy access to researchers in several departments. The facility will be used for undergraduate and graduate level training in quantifying and analyzing data collected from biological assays.</AbstractNarration>
