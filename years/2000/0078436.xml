<AbstractNarration>This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program supports research on the development of polyoxoanion-based dioxygenase catalysts by Professor Richard Finke of the Department of Chemistry at the Colorado State University. A specific focus is the development of  new, more robust and longer lifetime dioxygenase catalysts using oxidation-resistant polyoxyanions. The approach involves the performance of kinetic and mechanistic studies of the polyoxoanion-to -dioxygenase catalyst evolution process, isolation and performance of compositional and structural characterization on the true active catalyst, and then the use of the isolated catalyst to extend its applicability to additional classes of reactions for which efficient catalysts do not presently exist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this research is to develop new catalysts which can directly utilize dioxygen to oxidize a wide variety of aromatics, olefins and alkanes of commercial importance. These catalysts will have  a significant economic and environmental impact due to their ability to replace current co-oxidation processes and to their potential applications in the degredation of aromatic pollutants. The students involved in this project will receive broad training in analytical, inorganic and materials chemistry and leave them well-prepared for academic or industrial careers.</AbstractNarration>
