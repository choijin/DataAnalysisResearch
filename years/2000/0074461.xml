<AbstractNarration>This research will investigate the cultural adaptation of recently immigrated Latino workers to small, rural Southern communities in Arkansas as an example of a new immigration pattern to the U.S.  Rapid increases (estimated at 10-20%) of Latinos into small, primarily Caucasian communities in Arkansas to work in non-migratory, year-round, poultry-processing plants has an immediate and long-term impact on various infrastructures and systems.  A feasibility study in Arkansas will explore the social, cultural, and health care issues relevant to these rural communities experiencing rapid Latino immigration.  A part of this ethnographic research project will investigate immigration patterns regarding gender and age, responsiveness of local educational and governmental systems, and problems of health care access and utilization of available services.  This part will include review of public documents, participant observation and key informant interviews. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike the sociocultural issues of Latinos and Hispanics in major metropolitan cities, and populations of migrant farm laborers in Florida, California, and some border areas, the Latinos in Arkansas are often entering relatively poor counties with few bilingual services, and are relocating to work in small, year-round manufacturing plants.  These Latino immigrant populations are creating an entirely new sociocultural infrastructure in these small towns.  Ethnographic analysis of this immigration process is essential for better understanding of the challenges and successes inherent in the process over time and to aid the planning for the provision of adequate services in the future.  This study will assist in defining the Latino population demographics and characteristics, mapping the community and organizational contacts and participants needed for appropriate communication with the Latino population, and providing qualitative and quantitative research questions and hypotheses, as well as pilot data, for future research.  This ethnographic research will provide better information for addressing the health, education, and general welfare status of similar rural populations experiencing rapid immigration by Latino workers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This POWRE award will provide Erwin with additional training and support to enhance her research methods expertise and skills, in order to complete this research in a new culture group.  Specifically, the award will allow Erwin to obtain additional Spanish language training necessary to work within the Latino population and will provide time for training to enhance her analysis and software utilization skills.  This award will thus enhance Dr. Erwin's ability to serve as a leader, researcher, and educator in the anthropology and health of rural and minority populations. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
