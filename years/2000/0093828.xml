    <AbstractNarration>A major objective of the Gordon Conference in Chemical Oceanography is to bring together every two years leading members of the scientific community, along with post doctoral fellows and graduate students, to discuss new and exciting research in an informal setting. In 2001, the Gordon Conference in Chemical Oceanography will discuss research activities in three main areas: (1) The Climate Connection to Chemical and Atmospheric Chemistry Present and Past; (2) Chemical Processes in Marine Sediments; and (3) Analytical Developments and their Applications. The Gordon Conference has become recognized as an important venue to exchange ideas in the interdisciplinary field of marine chemistry and forge new scientific alliances. For this reason the National Science Foundation, along with the Office of Naval Research and the Gordon Research Conference, will co-sponsor the participation of 20 graduate students and 33 session chairs and speakers in the 2001 Gordon Conference in Chemical Oceanography.</AbstractNarration>
