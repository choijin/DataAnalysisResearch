<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;The Salish Kootenai College Rural Systemic Initiative (SKC RSI-Phase II) will result in a&lt;br/&gt;transformation of the educational experience for both teachers and students. Professional&lt;br/&gt;development for teachers, adoption of effective assessment strategies, and promotion of &lt;br/&gt;community involvement in the educational process will enhance the quality and quantity of the&lt;br/&gt;learning experience for students in science, mathematics, and technology within and beyond the&lt;br/&gt;school walls.  The classroom teacher is the key to the effectiveness of the delivery of curricular&lt;br/&gt;changes to the individual student. In the SKC RSI project, the primary goal is to have every&lt;br/&gt;teacher achieve the status of "master teacher" and to have every student achieve the status &lt;br/&gt;of "master learner."  It is important to understand that the journey of the educational experience &lt;br/&gt;Is a balanced effort between teachers and students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall goal of this proposal is to implement a comprehensive, sustainable, adaptable&lt;br/&gt;system-wide reform of science, mathematics and technology instruction and learning on the&lt;br/&gt;Flathead Indian Reservation in Montana. This will lead to increased achievement for all students&lt;br/&gt;and specifically emphasizes greater achievements for two groups of under-served populations in&lt;br/&gt;this rural setting: Native American students and girls.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SKC is the resource identifier for science, mathematics, and technology areas and has&lt;br/&gt;already developed coursework in biology, chemistry, physics, and earth sciences. SKC will, in&lt;br/&gt;effect, become a "mini clearinghouse" for science, mathematics, and technology (SMT) areas&lt;br/&gt;using American Indian-specific teaching and learning materials in professional development&lt;br/&gt;in SMT areas for teachers and students. SKC is currently preparing assessment strategies&lt;br/&gt;and activities that will be shared with other TCRSI projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other major goals are the improvement of science, mathematics, and technology education&lt;br/&gt;on the Flathead Indian Reservation including access to high quality, standards-based &lt;br/&gt;instruction for all students, innovative use of educational technologies for interactive delivery&lt;br/&gt;and the training of the teaching workforce to meet the demands of a new instructional&lt;br/&gt;paradigm. Rigorous, standards-based instruction for all students will be implemented on the&lt;br/&gt;Flathead Indian Reservation and the curriculum, professional development, and assessment&lt;br/&gt;systems to support that instruction. The development of the policy changes and resource&lt;br/&gt;allocations to support these efforts are the long-term goal of the SKC RSI Program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
