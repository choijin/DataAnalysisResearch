<AbstractNarration>This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) provides funding for the development of a taxonomy of contingency logistics systems, formulate a general model of such systems, develop  approaches for characterizing  contingency logistics system decision support systems and exploration of empirical data to suggest how such decisions are structured in practice.  The contingencies faced by such systems may be due to (1) a change in the system performance objective, (2) changes in available system resources or (3) changes in system demands.   System objectives may change from efficiency as a goal, to timely delivery.   System resources may change due to catastrophic events; technology changes etc.,  and system demands may change due to the product life cycle evolving from ramp up stage to operational stage to the ramp down stage.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The requirements for a contingency logistics system to have an effective list of alternate control parameters are as follows. (1) selection apriori of a finite number of possible styles of operation, (2) repeated investments to preserve the viability of these possible styles of operation, and (3) adjustment of the mode of operation in response to changes in the environment.   The investment in maintenance of possible alternatives thus takes away from the available resources when contingent actions are not required, but provides effectiveness when contingencies do in fact surface.  Results of this research will offer an environment to examine  alternate ways to organize prototype systems;  use of control rules and switching schemes between rules in the presence of contingencies; and their impact on system response as well as other performance objectives.  These results will prove useful in the organization and planning for contingency rich logistics environments.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
