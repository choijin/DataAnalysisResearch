<AbstractNarration>This project concerns the connection between fundamental &lt;br/&gt;problems in number theory, zeros of arithmetic L-functions,&lt;br/&gt;and random matrix theory.  Recent developments have placed &lt;br/&gt;the confluence of these fields at the center of a great &lt;br/&gt;deal of important work that combines activity and interest &lt;br/&gt;from researchers previously working in completely &lt;br/&gt;different areas. The study of zeros of arithmetic &lt;br/&gt;Dirichlet series, or L-functions, occupies a central &lt;br/&gt;position in number theory and includes within its realm &lt;br/&gt;both the Riemann Hypothesis and the Birch and &lt;br/&gt;Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture. The theory of eigenvalues of &lt;br/&gt;random matrices is a subject begun nearly 50 years ago by &lt;br/&gt;physicists interested in the statistics of energy &lt;br/&gt;levels of excited particles. The connection between these &lt;br/&gt;two fields was revealed for the first time in 1974 in the &lt;br/&gt;paper ``The pair correlation of the zeros of the &lt;br/&gt;zeta-function'' by H. L. Montgomery. This project will &lt;br/&gt;involve both number theorists and mathematical &lt;br/&gt;physicists to develop a comprehensive new model &lt;br/&gt;for families of L-functions in &lt;br/&gt;order to gain insights into a number of fundamental open &lt;br/&gt;problems about L-functions. For example, by combining &lt;br/&gt;random matrix theory and number theory appropriately, &lt;br/&gt;the principal investigator and his colleagues intend to &lt;br/&gt;(i) find all of the terms in asymptotic formulae for &lt;br/&gt;moments of families of L-functions, (ii) determine &lt;br/&gt;precisely how large the extreme-most values of &lt;br/&gt;L-functions can be, and (iii) analyze the vanishing &lt;br/&gt;at the central critical point for &lt;br/&gt;families of L-functions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1859 Bernhard Riemann made a conjecture about an important&lt;br/&gt;function known as the zeta-function.   &lt;br/&gt;Riemann's hypothesis is still unproven and is widely &lt;br/&gt;regarded as the most important unsolved problem in&lt;br/&gt;mathematics. It has long been known that the solution of&lt;br/&gt;this problem would have significant applications to &lt;br/&gt;cryptography, coding theory, and the study of &lt;br/&gt;prime numbers. Recently, it has also been realized that &lt;br/&gt;the zeta-function and the closely related L-functions &lt;br/&gt;provide models for the behavior of fundamental particles in &lt;br/&gt;physics.  The project `L-functions: symmetry and zeros' &lt;br/&gt;will bring mathematicians and physicists together to &lt;br/&gt;explore this amazing connection more deeply through the &lt;br/&gt;use of a statistical tool called `random matrix theory.' &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
