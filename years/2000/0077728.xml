<AbstractNarration>Cox&lt;br/&gt;0077728&lt;br/&gt;     Information processing along and between nerve cells is&lt;br/&gt;achieved via electrodiffusion along branches and across cell&lt;br/&gt;membranes.  The relatively poor axial conductance of the branches&lt;br/&gt;is offset by the myriad of ion channels that perforate the cell&lt;br/&gt;membrane.  A nerve cell's salient physical, as opposed to&lt;br/&gt;geometrical, properties are then its axial conductance, its&lt;br/&gt;membrane's capacitance and permeability to one or more ionic&lt;br/&gt;species and the kinetics (rules that govern its open/closed&lt;br/&gt;state) of the underlying channels.  The predictive utility of a&lt;br/&gt;mathematical model of course hinges on the accuracy to which&lt;br/&gt;these physical properties are known.  Unfortunately, the&lt;br/&gt;experimental determination of each of these quantities is a&lt;br/&gt;formidable task that, in light of recent data suggesting that the&lt;br/&gt;permeabilities vary with position in the dendritic tree, requires&lt;br/&gt;great investment for all but the simplest geometries.  The&lt;br/&gt;investigator and his colleagues therefore determine the extent to&lt;br/&gt;which the neuron's physical properties may be inferred from more&lt;br/&gt;readily available indirect measurements.  These indirect&lt;br/&gt;measurements are recordings of somatic and distal membrane&lt;br/&gt;potential following a known current stimulus to the soma.&lt;br/&gt;Assuming current seals at the distal ends, these two potential&lt;br/&gt;recordings result in lateral overdetermination of the underlying&lt;br/&gt;degenerate-parabolic system of Hodgkin-Huxley equations.  The&lt;br/&gt;investigator and his colleagues deduce from this overdetermined&lt;br/&gt;system a number of well posed problems, and associated algorithms&lt;br/&gt;(based on moment, fixed-point and output least squares methods),&lt;br/&gt;for the recovery of one or more of the neuron's physical&lt;br/&gt;properties.  They test these algorithms on data recorded from&lt;br/&gt;pyramidal neurons drawn from the rat's hippocampus.&lt;br/&gt;     In order to repair or reproduce the brain one must have a&lt;br/&gt;parts list and a blueprint specifying how the parts are to be&lt;br/&gt;connected.  At the coarsest level there are but two types of&lt;br/&gt;parts, nerves (neurons) and nerve glue (glial cells).  Though the&lt;br/&gt;human brain has more of each than the Milky Way has stars, it is&lt;br/&gt;not their sheer number but rather a subtle combination of&lt;br/&gt;interconnectedness and variation in electrical properties that&lt;br/&gt;render the brain so powerful.  The term `variation' is meant to&lt;br/&gt;express the realization that a neuron is not simply a switch&lt;br/&gt;within a certain brain center or a wire connecting two such&lt;br/&gt;centers, but rather is a tree of wires with electrical properties&lt;br/&gt;varying along each of its branches.  It is this local variation in&lt;br/&gt;a neuron's ability to conduct the brain's principal ions that is&lt;br/&gt;thought to be responsible for an individual neuron's ability to&lt;br/&gt;perform tasks reminiscent of rudimentary computers.  Given however&lt;br/&gt;the minute size and variegated nature of a single neuron, the&lt;br/&gt;direct experimental determination of its electrical properties&lt;br/&gt;has yet to be achieved.  The investigator and his colleagues&lt;br/&gt;therefore pursue the mathematically challenging task of&lt;br/&gt;determining these properties from more readily available, though&lt;br/&gt;indirect, experimental measurements.  This process is akin to&lt;br/&gt;determining the size and location of a leak in a transatlantic&lt;br/&gt;telephone cable by comparing what the American said to what the&lt;br/&gt;Englishman heard.  The success of their endeavor, coupled with the&lt;br/&gt;increasingly fine resolution of images of neuronal&lt;br/&gt;interconnections, will permit the investigator and his colleagues&lt;br/&gt;to produce models of sufficient veracity to be of use by the&lt;br/&gt;medical community from construction of prosthetic neuronal&lt;br/&gt;circuits to the design and testing of drugs and better&lt;br/&gt;treatments.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
