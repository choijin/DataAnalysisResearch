<AbstractNarration>DMS-0072312&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The term conformal dynamics has recently gained some currency and is&lt;br/&gt;meant to cover real and complex dynamics. This merging of sub-areas&lt;br/&gt;makes sense because their methods are showing more overlap than ever.  &lt;br/&gt;The project suggests a variety of goals. The first is the study of&lt;br/&gt;boundaries of connectedness loci for families of polynomials. This&lt;br/&gt;generalizes the study of the boundary of the Mandelbrot set. Problems&lt;br/&gt;include the metric structure of the boundary, including the boundary&lt;br/&gt;behavior of the Riemann map of the complement and the distribution of&lt;br/&gt;the harmonic measure. This part of the problem continues the on-going&lt;br/&gt;work by J. Graczyk and the proposer. The second goal is the study of&lt;br/&gt;boundaries of Siegel disks. The main problem in this area is deciding&lt;br/&gt;whether such boundaries are Jordan curves. The proposed approach is&lt;br/&gt;based on gaining information on the Riemann map of the Siegel disk by&lt;br/&gt;means of a cohomological equation. The third problem is in real&lt;br/&gt;dynamics and concerns the existence of wild attractors with additional&lt;br/&gt;properties. The forth goal is to estimate the measure and Hausdorff&lt;br/&gt;dimension of sets invariant under certain iterated function systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To understand the meaning of this research in the broad perspective of&lt;br/&gt;science, one has first to realize the role played by one-dimensional,&lt;br/&gt;or conformal, dynamics. Systems which appear as models in natural&lt;br/&gt;sciences, such as physics, astronomy, meteorology, economics or&lt;br/&gt;ecology, involve multiple parameters.  However, &lt;br/&gt;frequently one dominant parameter emerges&lt;br/&gt;which controls long time-behavior of the system. In such a way the&lt;br/&gt;logistic family appears in the study of many complicated systems. The&lt;br/&gt;logistic maps are quadratic polynomials. It is useful to study them on&lt;br/&gt;the complex plane, and thus complex quadratic polynomials enter the&lt;br/&gt;picture. This is the first object of our study. &lt;br/&gt;In other situations the system begins to show quasi-periodic&lt;br/&gt;or ``rotational'' behavior. This is situation is modeled by Siegel&lt;br/&gt;disks which are another subject of our proposed study. Wild&lt;br/&gt;attractors, which are our third subject, refer to a very unusual&lt;br/&gt;chaotic regime for a system in which two completely different limiting&lt;br/&gt;modes of long-term behavior co-exist side by side.   The attractor&lt;br/&gt;for an iterated function system which we will also investigate appears&lt;br/&gt;as a projection of a certain fractal set. This kind of problem appears&lt;br/&gt;in applications where one often has a multi-dimensional fractal set&lt;br/&gt;which can be studied by projections onto lower-dimensional spaces.   &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
