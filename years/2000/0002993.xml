<AbstractNarration>0002993&lt;br/&gt;Torgersen&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Educational research supports the critical importance of creating a realistic context in the classroom that is engaging to students.  Theories of situated learning, instructional approaches such as anchored instruction, and successful high school, UG geoscience efforts, all recommend that students be engaged in a "macro-context" that situates learning in the authentic practices of scientists, politicians, and/or citizens.  This increases the probability that students will detect the usefulness of geoscience knowledge as a tool for solving problems in their own real world; that is, they will detect the information's raison d'etre and be able to transfer learning from the classroom to their own lives.  In order to 1) provide opportunities to learn, 2) provide the tools to extrapolate from personal experience (the best learning tool) 3) appreciate the scientific/economic couplings and feedback loops that affect their daily lives and 4) appreciate the temporal response of coupled systems, and 5) mindfully engage both undergraduate and high school students in construction of understanding concerning coupled dynamic environments across multiple scales (lab water, pond water, and the waters of Long Island Sound), the PIs will acquire and install an Instrumented Environmental Laboratory (InEnLab) at the University of Connecticut.  Commercially available environmental probes will be installed in campus ponds that clearly demonstrate (on a daily timescale) the coupled interactions of chem./bio/phys within these small, commonplace ponds.  The data streams (T, cond., O2, pH, etc., every 15 minutes) from these in situ probes will be directly connected to the Internet and available in real time through (e.g., www.myPond.uconn.edu) modeled after an existing www.mySound.uconn.edu .  An anchored problem involving water issues in and around the University community will serve as a context for students to develop, identify and quantify the dynamics of this coupled system.  This web-accessible data stream (with scientist diary comments) will then serve as a context for UG and HS classroom problems/examples, demonstrations of coupled system dynamics and independent inquiry as well as create unique opportunities for undergraduate honors theses.  Such experiences will afford students an opportunity to inter-relate these experiences with observations they make during controlled laboratory experiments that quantify discrete processes and lead to an appreciation of the magnitude and temporal response of environmental systems over larger time scales and larger space scales.  Transfer of knowledge will be stimulated by comparison of the processes and time scales in Mirror Pond to Bridgeport Harbor and Long Island Sound using streamed data from www.mySound.uconn.edu.  Project management will take a management-by-objectives approach.  Formative evaluation dependent measures will include completion of objectives and timelines, online website statistics, instructor variables (implementation fidelity) and student variables (knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors including interest, self-efficacy, and geoscience content achievement).  Formative evaluation methods will include teacher and student surveys, artifacts of student problem solving on the scenario, course grades, teacher interviews and student interviews.  The formative evaluation will be conducted by project team members and the summative by an external evaluator.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
