    <AbstractNarration>A Supersecondary Structure Unit (SSU) is defined as three or more secondary structures in a given fold that pack against one another. When such SSUs occur in different folds, they are referred to as "legos". Numerous anecdotal examples of legos, such as 4-a-helix-bundle and 3-b-corner, have been identified, but there has been no systematic attempt to explore the entire structural database for a full list of recurrent structural patterns from which know protein folds might be constructed. This project will develop the necessary methods to carry out such a search and to fully characterize the resulting lego set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Such an effort will provide an entirely new view for protein folds. Specifically, the project will seek to answer the following questions: &lt;br/&gt;1. How large is the lego set? &lt;br/&gt;2. To what extent can the lego set cover known folds? &lt;br/&gt;3. What are the rules governing lego-lego interactions? &lt;br/&gt;4. Can one construct novel protein folds by following the rules? &lt;br/&gt;5. How conserved are sequences representing the same lego?&lt;br/&gt;6. Do legos correlate to functional sites?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will be an important complement to current approaches in functional&lt;br/&gt;genomics. Most current approaches infer protein function by sequence and structural similarities to existing folds. The results obtained from this project will provide a basis to relate different folds and to extend functional inference beyond the boundary of known folds. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will lead to the development of an array of lego-based algorithms for&lt;br/&gt;predicting protein structure and function. The legos and their various properties will constitute a publicly available database. Via the World Wide Web, researchers will be able to perform two types of searches. A protein structure can be submitted to discover the legos it encompasses. The user can also search a protein sequence against all lego profiles; the matched legos may provide&lt;br/&gt;information otherwise unavailable for novel sequences.</AbstractNarration>
