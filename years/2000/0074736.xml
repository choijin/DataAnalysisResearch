<AbstractNarration>.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will address the question: What would a shift from reductionist approaches to approaches based on systems theory imply for economic theories and methods as applied to environmental/ecological problems?  This question will be addressed by: (1) comparing and contrasting the roots of systems theory and methods with those of neoclassical economic theory and methods, specifically as applied to environmental problems; (2) researching applications of systems theory in other disciplines to identify methods and approaches that might inform economic approaches to environmental policy and ecosystem management; (3) developing conceptual models that integrate systems concepts and theory into economic approaches to environmental problems; and (4) exploring the implications and requirements of a shift in economic theories and methods of approaching ecosystem management towards systems theory based approaches. The broad goal of this research is to contribute to the development of "transdisciplinary" approaches to ecosystem management and environmental policy decisions, by exploring how the discipline of economics might evolve, and ways to link economics and other disciplines. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Environmental and ecological problems are systemic in nature, dependent on complex interactions between systems and parts of systems, particularly the interactions between the economic and social systems and the natural system. Traditional disciplinary approaches are effective and appropriate for analyzing parts of these systems. However, individual disciplinary approaches do not address the essential relationships that make a system unique, and thus cannot adequately address environmental issues in a way that will foster long run sustainability. Systems theory, which is designed to address the multiple aspects of a system, as well as the relationships that define it, may provide a framework for more effective transdisciplinary approaches.  The results of this research will contribute to improving the ability of economic approaches to address the relationships that are crucial to defining systems, and to improving the ability of economic approaches to better consider the different aspects of people's environmental values. This research will also contribute to newly dominant ecosystem approaches to environmental management, by exploring ways that researchers might help decision makers more effectively carry out these programs, and making economics more relevant to the policy process. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The POWRE grant will allow the PI to advance her research program by providing the opportunity to learn more about approaches from other disciplines, and explore whether and how they can inform and be combined with economic approaches. It will enable her to do the scholarly research necessary to take her work to the next level of application by allowing her to conduct exploratory, fundamental research that will lead to implementation in future projects. It will advance her career by allowing her to contribute to broadening the scope of economics, position herself to take advantage of increasing opportunities for interdisciplinary and ecosystems-focused research; and participate in and contribute significantly to research initiatives that are currently being developed at the University of Rhode Island.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
