<AbstractNarration>0071939&lt;br/&gt;Milewski&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will consist of the study of three problems in fluid mechanics &lt;br/&gt;and nonlinear waves. The first project involves understanding certain &lt;br/&gt;aspects of dispersive wave turbulence, that is, the statistical description of &lt;br/&gt;a large number of interacting dispersive waves, such as those on the ocean &lt;br/&gt;surface. First, a reduced model will be used which contains the &lt;br/&gt;fundamental nonlinear processes and can yield the scaling for the energy &lt;br/&gt;transfer mechanisms. Second, spectra of two-- and three--dimensional &lt;br/&gt;ocean waves with a reduced equation valid for finite depth and deep water &lt;br/&gt;will be computed and compared with results from the reduced model. The &lt;br/&gt;second project involves the study of three-dimensional solitary waves in &lt;br/&gt;regimes where surface tension is an important part of the dynamics. These &lt;br/&gt;are waves that can be generated, for example, by flow of a thin fluid layer &lt;br/&gt;over a small obstacle. Here, it is proposed to use solutions that have &lt;br/&gt;already been computed to find additional solutions in regimes of physical &lt;br/&gt;interest, such as increasing depth. The third project is to study the &lt;br/&gt;dynamics of reaction-diffusion equations in the presence of spatial &lt;br/&gt;inhomogeneities, as for example, in models of certain chemical reactions &lt;br/&gt;where the reactant concentration is not uniform in space. In the spatially &lt;br/&gt;homogeneous case, one obtains various coherent patterns in the reaction. &lt;br/&gt;How these patterns and their boundaries are modified by the &lt;br/&gt;inhomogeneities will be studied.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this research is to understand several aspects of wave &lt;br/&gt;dynamics in fluids using a combination of theory and advanced &lt;br/&gt;computation. There are three distinct phenomena that will be studied. &lt;br/&gt;First, the evolution of wave turbulence will be studied: the physical &lt;br/&gt;situation in which many waves of different wavelengths and traveling in &lt;br/&gt;different directions are superposed. The simplest example is the apparent &lt;br/&gt;random mix of waves on the surface of the ocean. The goal is to predict &lt;br/&gt;the relative energy in the different waves and the mechanisms by which &lt;br/&gt;waves of different sizes exchange energy. These are important predictions &lt;br/&gt;whose applications range from understanding satellite remote sensing data &lt;br/&gt;to climate dynamics. Second, a class of water waves called lump solitons &lt;br/&gt;will be studied: localized coherent waves that travel in a particular &lt;br/&gt;direction. The goal is to obtain the range of physical situations in which &lt;br/&gt;these waves can exist. This work has implications in a variety of thin film &lt;br/&gt;and coating applications. Lastly, the dynamics of the components of &lt;br/&gt;biological and chemical reacting systems where the concentration of the &lt;br/&gt;reactants vary in space will be studied. The particular case where a &lt;br/&gt;catalyst for the reaction is not distributed uniformly and therefore the &lt;br/&gt;reaction proceeds differently in different places will be studied. The goal &lt;br/&gt;is to understand how the reaction varies from place to place and what &lt;br/&gt;happens at the boundaries where the reactions change character.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
