<AbstractNarration>This dissertation research will investigate how articulatory properties of segments differ and how they are similar with respect to spatio-temporal characteristics, as prosodic conditions change. Recent phonetic studies point to three kinds of prosodically determined locations where segments potentially receive prominence. One is in pitch-accented syllables which encode the interplay of lexical stress and sentential stress, another is in domain-initial positions, and the third is in domain-final positions. One of the specific goals of this study is to understand the nature of such prosodically conditioned articulatory prominence by addressing the following questions: (a) to what extent the articulatory nature of prominence arising with stress differs from that associated with domain-edge effects, and (b) how the stress and edge effects interact with each other. Another major goal of this dissertation is to understand prosodically conditioned articulatory prominence in view of coarticulatory resistance by examining (a) how coarticulation patterns vary depending on prominence-related prosodic conditions, and (b) how the hypothesized coarticulatory variations are related to the prosodically variable strengths of articulation. Finally, this study will attempt to model coarticulatory patterns, developing the idea that the spatio-temporal target of a segment may vary depending on prosodic conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Articulatory data will be obtained using the Carstens Electromagnetic Midsagital Articulograph (EMA) in the UCLA Phonetics Lab. A comprehensive corpus will be used in which all the prosodic conditions of interest can be examined at the same time. This will provide a body of coherent articulatory data that will allow the researcher to examine the characteristics of articulation that arise with different prosodic conditions, and to evaluate previously hypothesized accounts of articulatory prominence.</AbstractNarration>
