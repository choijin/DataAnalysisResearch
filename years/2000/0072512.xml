    <AbstractNarration>DMS-0072512&lt;br/&gt;Dusa McDuff&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;McDuff will continue studying the structure of symplectic &lt;br/&gt;manifolds and of the group G(M) of diffeomorphisms that &lt;br/&gt;preserve the symplectic structure on a given manifold M. &lt;br/&gt;Working together with Francois Lalonde, she recently &lt;br/&gt;discovered that these diffeomorphisms do not twist the &lt;br/&gt;manifold topologically very much. Indeed, using ideas &lt;br/&gt;from quantum homology, they have shown that the homotopy &lt;br/&gt;groups of the Hamiltonian subgroup H of G(M) act trivially &lt;br/&gt;on the rational homology of the underlying manifold M. The&lt;br/&gt;conjecture is that any fiber bundle with structural group&lt;br/&gt;H is a product as far as its rational cohomology is concerned. &lt;br/&gt;She also plans to study other topological implications of the&lt;br/&gt;existence of quantum homology, in particular its consequences &lt;br/&gt;for the Flux conjecture. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A symplectic structure is a very basic structure on space &lt;br/&gt;that underlies the equations of classical physics. They &lt;br/&gt;have become very prominent recently because of their &lt;br/&gt;appearance in modern theories of duality, especially in &lt;br/&gt;the "mirror symmetry" phenomena of high energy physics. Mathematically, they are very interesting and help in &lt;br/&gt;understanding 4 dimensional spaces (curved space-times). &lt;br/&gt;Recently McDuff has focussed her attention on studying &lt;br/&gt;the different ways that the points of a space can&lt;br/&gt;move while still preserving this structure. Working with &lt;br/&gt;a collaborator, she has found that some ideas coming from &lt;br/&gt;string theory (known in the field as "quantum homology") &lt;br/&gt;show that spaces with symplectic structures are much more &lt;br/&gt;rigid than ones without, and cannot be moved and twisted up&lt;br/&gt;very much. She intends to pursue this line of questioning &lt;br/&gt;during the period of the grant. Many very interesting &lt;br/&gt;symplectic rigidity phenomena have been discovered, but &lt;br/&gt;there are still plenty of open questions.</AbstractNarration>
