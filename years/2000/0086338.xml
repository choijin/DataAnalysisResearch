<AbstractNarration>This project investigates the potential to promote understanding and interest in science among middle school girls on an informal science learning web site called Whyville.  Whyville provides an environment for students to explore scientific phenomenon, together with other students, and participate in both scientific and design activities.  Preliminary studies of the current Whyville users show that over 60% of the users are girls, most from grades 4-8.  Because Whyville is successful in attracting girls to a science oriented site, it is poised to be a potentially powerful tool for motivating and educating girls in science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project would use several methodologies to investigate Whyville characteristics, participants, and effects.  A survey of the current Whyville users (N=600) will gather data on science interest, demographics, and background.  Focus groups with current users (N=20) will be conducted on-line, within Whyville, to gather information on site use.  A group of first time users (N=60) will be recruited from local schools and given a science interest and background survey, as well as a pre-assessment before entering Whyville.  Then, using a tracking program, a subset of the current users (N=60) and all first time users will have their movements on the site monitored for three months in order to determine the activities of greatest interest and appeal.  A subgroup (N=20) of new and current users will "visit" Whyville in a lab setting where their use of the site will be tracked in depth.  They will also participate in a "think aloud" session with an interviewer while using Whyville and will explain their perceptions and understanding of the science content.  The new users will also be asked to complete an interim assessment at the end of their "think aloud" session.  Finally, any subsequent voluntary use of Whyville by these new users will be tracked for three months and they will be asked to complete a post-assessment to provide a third comparison point for the impact of Whyville exposure on science concept knowledge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research proposed should provide a number of benefits.  Its examination of Whyville characteristics, participants, and effects may provide a model for researchers, evaluators and site developers in future work.  The findings should suggest guidelines for improving the effectiveness of educational websites in attracting your girls' interest in science and technology, and they may have important implications for improving school-based learning as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
