<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator proposes several projects concerning &lt;br/&gt;multi-dimensional stability of flows in compressible, viscous, &lt;br/&gt;and reacting media.  These include both shear flows of classical &lt;br/&gt;hydrodynamic stability and compressive flows of shock wave and &lt;br/&gt;combustion theory,  the former exhibiting local symmetry parallel &lt;br/&gt;to and the latter normal to the flow.  The unifying mathematical &lt;br/&gt;theme in these problems is the appearance of multiple length scales &lt;br/&gt;corresponding to small-scale transport and large-scale convective &lt;br/&gt;effects,  with associated ``stiffness'' in the linearized perturbation &lt;br/&gt;problem.  This leads to interesting, nonstandard issues in spectral &lt;br/&gt;and semigroup theory.  At the same time, the inclusion of small-scale &lt;br/&gt;transport effects is highly desirable from the point of view of physical &lt;br/&gt;applications, which often occur at scales where these effects might be &lt;br/&gt;expected to be significant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The stability of regular flow patterns is an old and central topic in fluid, &lt;br/&gt;gas, and plasma dynamics, deciding which (stable) patterns will typically&lt;br/&gt;be observed, and which (unstable) are only mathematical and not physically&lt;br/&gt;observable solutions.  The transition from stability to instability&lt;br/&gt;is of particular importance, since it usually signals the arisal of&lt;br/&gt;alternative, more complicated flow patterns close to the original&lt;br/&gt;(now unstable) one- this is a way to understand complicated flows&lt;br/&gt;by the study of simpler and better-understood ones.  Despite a large&lt;br/&gt;and well-known body of theory on this subject, dating back to the late &lt;br/&gt;1800's, there are still many aspects that are poorly understood, particularly&lt;br/&gt;for compressive, viscous, or reacting flows.  Here, we propose to study&lt;br/&gt;several of these issues arising in compressible gas and plasma dynamics,&lt;br/&gt;and in combustion, applications in which such usually-neglected effects&lt;br/&gt;are of considerable practical importance.  Our goal is, by including&lt;br/&gt;these mathematically problematic terms, to move existing theory from&lt;br/&gt;the qualitative to the quantitative regime, obtaining new information&lt;br/&gt;of use to practitioners at the same time that we advance the mathematical&lt;br/&gt;theory.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
