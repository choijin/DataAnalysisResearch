<AbstractNarration>The Conference Board of the Mathematical Sciences (CBMS) promotes, administers, and provides support services for the conference series known as the NSF/CBMS Regional Research Conferences in Mathematics.  These conferences have been an ongoing cooperative project administered by CBMS and supported by NSF continuously since 1969. Proposals for grants for individual conferences are made by prospective host institutions directly to NSF and those conferences chosen for funding are selected by a national review panel appointed by NSF and CBMS. Each conference features a distinguished lecturer who delivers ten lectures over a five day period on a topic of important current research in one sharply focused area of the mathematical sciences. The organizer of each conference invites other established researchers in the field and interested newcomers, including graduate students and post doctoral fellows, to participate in the conference. The lecturer prepares a substantial expository monograph based upon his or her lectures, which is then published by one of the following professional societies: the American Mathematical Society, the Society for&lt;br/&gt;Industrial and Applied Mathematics, or jointly, the American Statistical Association and the Institute of Mathematical Statistics.</AbstractNarration>
