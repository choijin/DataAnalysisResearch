    <AbstractNarration>This project examines whether prosecution of misdemeanor domestic violence, accompanied by counseling and advocacy services for its victims, has a greater deterrent effect on recidivism than prosecution alone. Several hypotheses will be tested, the most critical of which is whether there is a subsequent decrease in intimate violence and an increase in self esteem, empowerment, and quality of life when victims receive counseling and advocacy services from Kings County (New York) District Attorney's Office social workers following a domestic violence incident and throughout the criminal case. More specifically, the project will compare victims residing in one geographic area, who receive a "Prosecutor Plus Counseling and Advocacy" condition, with closely matched victims in a second area who receive a "Prosecutor Only" condition. The subjects will be evaluated immediately following the perpetrator's arrest and at 3-month intervals throughout the duration of the criminal case and following its resolution for a total of 12 months. The study provides a unique opportunity to conduct a field experiment in Brooklyn's predominantly African-American and Caribbean community to evaluate the effectiveness of counseling and advocacy services in reducing domestic violence recidivism.</AbstractNarration>
