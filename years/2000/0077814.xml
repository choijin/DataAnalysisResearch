<AbstractNarration>This award is in partial support of a Gordon Conference on Research at high Pressures.  This conference is vital and important as high pressure research has changed dramatically over the years with the development of new techniques for generating pressure and studying samples at pressures which now extend into the multi-megabar range for static pressures, and substantially higher for shock pressure.  The conference serves as an important international forum for topics at the forefront of both static and dynamic pressures, in small volume diamond anvil cells and large volume presses, in the diverse fields of physics, chemistry, geosciences, and emerging topics in biology.  The upcoming meeting will feature invited talks in the most exciting subjects of recent interent, including efforts to understand and metallize hydrogen, the composition of the earth's core, novel materials, magnetism and superconductivity, shock on polyatomics, alkali metals, and new methods and techniques.  Opening and closing sessions will discuss the challenges of the future and celebrate the successes of the past.  This vibrant and successful conference will have representation from all fields and sectors, including new faces, graduate students, post docs, junior faculty and a strong representation from large active groups.</AbstractNarration>
