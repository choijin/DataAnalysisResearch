<AbstractNarration>Geology (42) &lt;br/&gt;The Geoscience/Geography Department at New Jersey City University, an urban, culturally diverse, Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI), is modernizing its field data acquisition and interpretation capability and utilizing this to improve the quality of science education in undergraduate courses and research projects. Students are now able to use modern technology when they acquire map data and interpret field data. The implementation of this capability is promoting higher levels of experiential learning and fostering the development of creativity, resourcefulness, and critical thinking, all traits that are indispensable for survival and success in the modern workplace. While the quality and relevance of SMET education is improved for all students taking geoscience courses, future science teachers and science majors in particular are benefiting from derivative curricular modernization. Students are developing hands-on expertise with equipment and technology that they will be expected to use professionally. The equipment acquired in this project includes six new computers equipped with GIS software (for GIS lab expansion from 6 to 12 seats); three pieces of digital spatial positioning equipment (2 GPS receivers and one total station); and one digital ground penetrating radar system that is being leveraged to gain access to a full range of geophysical instruments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This new equipment has provided the basis for adapting successful exercises and projects that have been developed elsewhere for student use. Exercises and projects from Houston Community College (GPS and GIS), Western Michigan University (field geophysics), and the New Jersey Geological Survey are being adapted to suit our learning needs (in coursework and in undergraduate research) and physical limitations (geography, geology, and hydrogeology). Field and lab exercises utilizing GPS and GIS are incorporated into a number of courses, including GIS (2 courses), Structural Geology, Stratigraphy, Field Methods, and Geophysics. Field geophysics exercises are being incorporated into the NJCU curriculum as part of an expanded Geophysics two-course sequence, inserted into our Hydrogeology two-course sequence, and utilized in Field Methods. These exercises and projects also serve as catalysts for new single- and multi-discipline undergraduate research projects that are developed in geography, geology, hydrogeology, geophysics, biology, chemistry, and physics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
