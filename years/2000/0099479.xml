<AbstractNarration>This project, at an RUI institution, provides undergraduate students with research experience through an active program in laser spectroscopy.  Students are actively involved in the study of optical properties of rare earth ions doped in crystalline host materials, and novel organic dyes in solid plastic materials.  Measurements include time-resolved spectroscopic techniques to study energy transfer characteristics and mechanisms.  Processes such as energy transfer between sensitizers and activators, fluorescence quenching, Stoke's shifts, and the effect of host materials on such processes are studied.  The research aims to help students understand and solidify their thinking about energy levels, selection rules, radiative and nonradiative processes.  Students actively participate in weekly group discussions interacting with fellow students and the PI.&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;The project is primarily oriented toward providing research education experience for undergraduates in materials physics studies including advanced characterization tools and analysis methods to address basic research issues in a topical area with technological relevance. The research will contribute basic materials science knowledge to important aspects of processing and fabricating photonic devices such as lasers and sensors. An important feature of the program is the way in which research and education are integrated through the training of students in basic research in a technologically significant area.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
