    <AbstractNarration>0091690&lt;br/&gt;Bronzino&lt;br/&gt;The Biomedical Engineering Alliance for Connecticut (BEACON) is presenting a Symposium on Avances in Biodynamics and Ergonomics, October 27, 2000. The several objectives of the meeting are to: 1) present insights into new research in Ergonomics and Biodynamics highlighting the important emerging roles for biomedical engineers, ergonomists, and health care workers 2) present examples of successful academic/industrial collaborations in the areas of Ergonomics and Biodynamics, 3) provide information about funding opportunities, including those for academic-industrial collaborations in these areas, and 4) provide an opportunity for students from engineering, ergonomics, and the health sciences to learn about Ergonomics and Biodynamics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is anticipated that the convening of academic and industrial professionals from the various disciplines involved in Ergonomics and Biodynamics (e.g. engineering, ergonomics, medical science and health care) will facilitate interdisciplinary networking and collaborations that can enhance innovation in these areas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results of the meeting will be disseminated on the BEACON WEB site (http://www.beaconalliance.org/) and in a printed publication for which funds are being provided by the National Science Foundation.</AbstractNarration>
