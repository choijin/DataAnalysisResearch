    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to investigate the physical and mechanical properties of Polymer Silicate Layered Nanocomposites (PSLN) as applied to dental materials. A specific material system is chosen that optimizes key properties including compressive, flexural and tensile strength, hardness and reduction of polymerization shrinkage while maintaining the critical working and handling characteristics of the material. The quantum effects realized through the novel mechanistic dispersion of the nano-sized and geometrically ideal filler will lead to dramatic property enhancement of the composite affecting the durability and longevity of the dental restoration. Feasibility of this application of PSLN technology will be investigated through a series of experiments with subsequent&lt;br/&gt;characterization by x-ray diffraction and TEM analysis. Due to a high failure rate attributed to lack of strength, marginal leakage and technique sensitivity, methacrylate based dental composites have not been universally accepted as a replacement for amalgams. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Preliminary findings and data from other industrial applications support the idea that PSLN technology provides superior property enhancement enabling remarkable potential for further acceptance of dental composites. This research project addresses the development of an enhanced dental composite specifically for use as core build-up material and provides future avenues for improvements to all dental composites, including anterior, posterior and flowable composites.</AbstractNarration>
