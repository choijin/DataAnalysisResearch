<AbstractNarration>This project concerns research in set theory and descriptive set&lt;br/&gt;theory, particularly involving the influences of the axiom of&lt;br/&gt;determinacy.  The axiom of determinacy is the statement that&lt;br/&gt;every two-player integer game is determined, that is, one of the&lt;br/&gt;players has a winning strategy.  Although this axiom contradicts&lt;br/&gt;the axiom of choice, an accepted part of mathematics, it was&lt;br/&gt;proposed in the 1960s to be a reasonable assumption for the&lt;br/&gt;smallest inner model of set theory containing the real numbers.&lt;br/&gt;This model contains the sets of reals occurring in ordinary&lt;br/&gt;mathematical practice (e.g., the projective sets and beyond).&lt;br/&gt;The study of this model, in turn, gives direct information about&lt;br/&gt;the mathematical universe.  The notion of a scale is a central&lt;br/&gt;structural concept in descriptive set theory, and the axiom of&lt;br/&gt;determinacy was used to develop the scale theory of the&lt;br/&gt;projective sets, which was later extended throughout the entire&lt;br/&gt;model.  The scale theory by itself, however, is not sufficient to&lt;br/&gt;answer many questions.  A more detailed inductive analysis was&lt;br/&gt;begun in the mid 1980s which was successful at the lower levels&lt;br/&gt;of the model, including the projective sets.  This theory does&lt;br/&gt;not currently extend through the entire model, and finding such&lt;br/&gt;an extension remains a central goal.  Recently, several new lines&lt;br/&gt;of investigation have opened up, relating in some way to the&lt;br/&gt;theory of this model.  One such direction concerns investigating&lt;br/&gt;the connections between the existing theory of this model and the&lt;br/&gt;theory of ultrafilters (Shelah's p.c.f. theory).  Preliminary&lt;br/&gt;results, which use centrally Woodin's theory of the nonstationary&lt;br/&gt;ideal, suggest strong collapsing principles apply as one moves&lt;br/&gt;from the inner model to the real universe.  Exactly what is&lt;br/&gt;forced to collapse, and what principles govern this phenomenon,&lt;br/&gt;is a topic of investigation.  Finding and establishing principles&lt;br/&gt;independent of the complete inductive analysis might also provide&lt;br/&gt;a framework for propagating a basic "skeleton" of the analysis&lt;br/&gt;through the entire model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project attempts to advance the understanding of the&lt;br/&gt;mathematical universe of sets.  All of mathematics takes place&lt;br/&gt;within this universe, and progress here is important not only&lt;br/&gt;foundationally, but because of the direct influence on the&lt;br/&gt;various branches of mathematics.  It has been known for some time&lt;br/&gt;that strong assumptions are needed to answer many basic&lt;br/&gt;mathematical questions.  Identifying these assumptions and&lt;br/&gt;exploring their consequences is a major theme in set theory.  The&lt;br/&gt;axiom of determinacy is an important example of such an axiom.&lt;br/&gt;This was formulated in the 1960s but the full extent of its&lt;br/&gt;consequences is not known.  Recent evidence suggests that it may&lt;br/&gt;shed light on some basic mathematical questions, such as the&lt;br/&gt;continuum hypothesis (the question of how many real numbers there&lt;br/&gt;are).&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
