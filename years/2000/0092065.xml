<AbstractNarration>Title --- CAREER:  A Statistical Approach to Estimating 3D Manifolds From Range &lt;br/&gt;Data&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI --- Ross T. Whitaker&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Institution --- University of Utah&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses the question of how to automatically generate 3D &lt;br/&gt;computer models of objects and scenes using data from a range finding &lt;br/&gt;device, such as a laser range scanner, sonar, ultrasound, or radar.  Such &lt;br/&gt;3D computer models are important in a wide range of applications including &lt;br/&gt;defense surveillance, forensics, teaching, and medicine.  Range measuring &lt;br/&gt;devices typically sweep a beam of energy to gather many millions of 3D &lt;br/&gt;measurements from surfaces of objects but they have some limitations.  &lt;br/&gt;First, because not all object are visible from a single point of view, a &lt;br/&gt;single sweep is incomplete.  Second, each individual range measurement is &lt;br/&gt;not necessarily accurate because the measurement process is inherently &lt;br/&gt;noisy.  The strategy is to systematically fuse together many measurements &lt;br/&gt;from different points of view in order to create accurate, complete 3D &lt;br/&gt;models.  This project examines some of the fundamental mathematical &lt;br/&gt;questions pertaining to this process and then studies how to implement and &lt;br/&gt;demonstrate this theory on real data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Range-finding devices measure distances to objects by reflecting energy off &lt;br/&gt;of the interfaces between different types of materials, but they provide a &lt;br/&gt;noisy, mathematically complex, and highly nonlinear transformation from a &lt;br/&gt;collection of surfaces to a set 2D depth maps.  This project will develop &lt;br/&gt;statistical methods for estimating manifolds from this kind of data, &lt;br/&gt;thereby generalizing the current state of the art in estimation theory, &lt;br/&gt;which is primarily concerned with estimating functions or fields.  Thus, &lt;br/&gt;the goal is to provide a general, complete, and practical foundation for 3D &lt;br/&gt;surface reconstruction.  The strategy is to find the surface that maximizes &lt;br/&gt;the posterior probability conditional on a collection of range measurements &lt;br/&gt;taken from different points of view.  The reconstruction framework is &lt;br/&gt;Bayesian; it includes a sensor model as well as prior knowledge about the &lt;br/&gt;characteristics of the object or scenes being modeled.  This work will &lt;br/&gt;address a number of important issues pertaining to this statistical &lt;br/&gt;methodology for building 3D models, including better sensor models, &lt;br/&gt;high-order priors, fast and robust algorithms, and broader applications.  &lt;br/&gt;These developments will comprise a fundamental scientific result: the &lt;br/&gt;generalization of the basic principles of estimation theory to the &lt;br/&gt;challenging and timely problem of 3D surface reconstruction.</AbstractNarration>
