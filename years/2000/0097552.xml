<AbstractNarration>Systematics and evolution are central concepts in biological&lt;br/&gt;disciplines.  Knowledge of the manner in which species are related to each&lt;br/&gt;other and the mechanisms by which they become distributed across the globe&lt;br/&gt;provide a framework (in evolutionary trees for example) for organizing and&lt;br/&gt;communicating ideas and advances, for example in terms of biodiversity or&lt;br/&gt;comparative genomics. Our program provides students with a coherent,&lt;br/&gt;hands-on introduction to research in systematics and comparative&lt;br/&gt;evolutionary biology, and serves a critical role in attracting, inspiring&lt;br/&gt;and educating undergraduate students in the fundamental importance of these&lt;br/&gt;biological disciplines.  Students enrolled in the AMNH REU program have at&lt;br/&gt;their disposal world-class collections of fishes, dinosaurs, reptiles,&lt;br/&gt;amphibians, mammals and invertebrates, as well as cutting edge research&lt;br/&gt;facilities in the Molecular Genomics laboratories, and the museum's&lt;br/&gt;research library.  Project titles, while all concerned with the basic role&lt;br/&gt;of evolution and systematics, span a range of topics as broad as those&lt;br/&gt;being investigated by the museum's curators, including the use of genetic,&lt;br/&gt;histological, anatomical and paleontological data types. The American&lt;br/&gt;Museum of Natural History is an inspirational place for young scientists to&lt;br/&gt;work, and an REU program is a wonderful way for us to bring a critical mass&lt;br/&gt;of bright young scholars into our departments and expose them to the&lt;br/&gt;challenge and excitement of an original research program.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
