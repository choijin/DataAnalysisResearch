<AbstractNarration>DMS-0072483&lt;br/&gt;Chikako Mese&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator proposes to study geometric &lt;br/&gt;variational problems, with particular emphasis on harmonic maps &lt;br/&gt;in spaces with singularities.  Motivated by questions in &lt;br/&gt;geometry and algebra, the study of harmonic maps to singular &lt;br/&gt;targets, particularly metric spaces of curvature bounded &lt;br/&gt;from above, has attracted the attention of many mathematicians.  &lt;br/&gt;In particular, many remarkable results have been obtained by Gromov-Schoen, Korevaar-Schoen, and Jost. The PI proposes to &lt;br/&gt;develop the minimal surface theory as a continuation of the &lt;br/&gt;study of the harmonic map theory.  The PI has shown that minimal&lt;br/&gt;surfaces in metric spaces of curvature bounded from above &lt;br/&gt;generalize several important properties of the classical minimal surfaces.  We are interested in the development of a higher&lt;br/&gt;dimensional analogue of the theory advanced thus far.  The PI &lt;br/&gt;will also investigate harmonic maps between surfaces when the&lt;br/&gt;target is given a metric of curvature bounded from above. &lt;br/&gt;We are particularly interested in understanding the behavior of harmonic maps when the target metric has singularities associated &lt;br/&gt;with curvature concentrations.  Furthermore, we hope to gain an understanding of the behavior of harmonic maps when we vary the &lt;br/&gt;target metrics in a certain class.  This in turn will be used&lt;br/&gt;to study Teichmuller spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mathematical study of harmonic maps is natural and &lt;br/&gt;physically significant.  This is because physics dictates &lt;br/&gt;that most natural actions occur in a way to minimize certain quantities.  For instance, it is well known that the path&lt;br/&gt;of light in space is affected by gravity, and this path can &lt;br/&gt;be realized by a curve which minimizes arclength with respect &lt;br/&gt;to a certain metric.  A thin film (such as a soap film formed on &lt;br/&gt;a closed wire frame) will come to a configuration which &lt;br/&gt;minimizes the surface area.  Both these configurations can also&lt;br/&gt;be represented by energy minimizing maps.  As critical points &lt;br/&gt;of the energy functional, harmonic maps are mathematical models &lt;br/&gt;of natural phenomena and provide an interesting mathematical study.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
