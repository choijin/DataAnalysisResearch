<AbstractNarration>Biological Sciences (61)  The goal of this project is to increase student comprehension of and enthusiasm for genetics by developing a "Workshop Genetics" course to replace the traditional lecture/lab format currently in use. Genetics is a highly quantitative subject that is frequently a stumbling block for biology majors. Studies show that students enroll in genetics with misconceptions regarding everything from the cell cycle and mitosis to evolution. Furthermore, students have a particularly hard time relating many genetics concepts to their everyday lives. Nonetheless, most initiatives to improve science education have focused on introductory and general education courses. In order to rectify these problems, the "Workshop Biology" project, which was developed for a large general education class at the University of Oregon, is being adapted for implementation in the smaller, mid level genetics class. "Workshop Genetics" consists of four basic types of activities: Class Assemblies, Concept Activities, Investigative Laboratories, and Issues Activities. Additionally, a series of computer-based multimedia genetics problem sets are being developed through collaboration with John Pollack at Cornell University. All of these activities are being implemented with the help of undergraduates pursuing secondary education certification in biology. The success of the project goals will be assessed through collaboration with Dr. Patricia Nelson, Head of the Susquehanna University Education Department. Ultimately, this course will serve as a model for other upper level workshop science courses, will be disseminated via a "Workshop Genetics Homepage", and will be presented at ABLE and Strategies for Success Conferences.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
