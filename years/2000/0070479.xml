<AbstractNarration>The investigator will study the cohomology theory and K-theory of partial&lt;br/&gt;flag varieties and quiver varieties.  In particular he will look for&lt;br/&gt;K-theory parallels of known results in cohomology.  A first target is the&lt;br/&gt;cohomology and Grothendieck rings of a partial flag variety.  Since any&lt;br/&gt;partial flag variety has a cell decomposition into Schubert cells, its&lt;br/&gt;cohomology ring has a basis consisting of the cohomology classes of&lt;br/&gt;Schubert varieties.  Likewise the Grothendieck ring of algebraic vector&lt;br/&gt;bundles has a basis of structure sheaves of Schubert varieties.  The&lt;br/&gt;investigator will study the structure constants for these rings with&lt;br/&gt;respect to their bases indexed by Schubert varieties.  The main goal is to&lt;br/&gt;find explicit formula for these constants, but also positivity questions&lt;br/&gt;are of interest.  In cohomology the structure constants are known to be&lt;br/&gt;positive for geometric reasons, but no combinatorial proof of this fact is&lt;br/&gt;known.  In K-theory the investigator has conjectured that the structure&lt;br/&gt;constants have alternating signs, i.e. they are non-negative in even&lt;br/&gt;degrees and non-positive in odd degrees.  Finding a proof of this would be&lt;br/&gt;very interesting.  An additional goal is to find efficient computer&lt;br/&gt;algorithms for calculating these structure constants.  The investigator&lt;br/&gt;will also try to find a formula for the K-theory class of the structure&lt;br/&gt;sheaf of a general quiver variety.  Such a formula will generalize a&lt;br/&gt;formula for the cohomology class of a quiver variety, which the&lt;br/&gt;investigator has proved earlier with Fulton.  The investigator hopes that&lt;br/&gt;proving such a formula will be of help for constructing an explicit&lt;br/&gt;resolution of the structure sheaf of a quiver variety.  This would&lt;br/&gt;generalize classical constructions such as the Koszul complex, which is of&lt;br/&gt;fundamental importance in homological algebra.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development of cohomology theory was motivated in part by the problem&lt;br/&gt;of classifying topological spaces.  This is important for addressing&lt;br/&gt;questions such as "what is the shape of our universe?".  Cohomology theory&lt;br/&gt;is also an important tool for solving problems in enumerative geometry, in&lt;br/&gt;which one seeks to determine and count all the solutions to a geometric&lt;br/&gt;problem.  For example, if the geometric problem is to find lines which&lt;br/&gt;intersect or are tangent to a given collection of fixed geometric figures,&lt;br/&gt;then the number of such lines is desired.  A very powerful technique for&lt;br/&gt;solving this type of problems is to construct a space consisting of all&lt;br/&gt;objects which could potentially be a solution.  Counting the number of&lt;br/&gt;solutions to a problem is often equivalent to performing a calculation in&lt;br/&gt;the cohomology ring of this space of potential solutions.  The objects to&lt;br/&gt;be counted can in many situations be identified with flags of subspaces in&lt;br/&gt;a given vector space.  Flag varieties, whose points correspond to such&lt;br/&gt;flags of subspaces, are therefore typical candidates to act as the space of&lt;br/&gt;potential solutions.  This makes it important to be able to do efficient&lt;br/&gt;computations within the cohomology ring of a flag variety, and gives the&lt;br/&gt;reason why the structure constants for this ring has been wanted by&lt;br/&gt;geometers and combinatorialists for decades.  The K-theory or Grothendieck&lt;br/&gt;ring of a variety can be seen as a generalization of the cohomology ring.&lt;br/&gt;A good understanding of K-theory will therefore give a more complete&lt;br/&gt;picture of cohomology theory.  At the same time K-theory is important for&lt;br/&gt;the study of vector bundles on a variety and for homological algebra.  This&lt;br/&gt;makes it very natural to try to generalize the known results about&lt;br/&gt;cohomology theory to K-theory.</AbstractNarration>
