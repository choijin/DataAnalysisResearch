    <AbstractNarration>This project investigates the role of patient information concerning multiple&lt;br/&gt;aspects of quality in the health sector of Tanzania, and how this information&lt;br/&gt;changes and is updated when quality changes. &lt;br/&gt;In Tanzania, as in most African countries, patients, even the poor, have a&lt;br/&gt;number of choices when they seek care. Although it may involve significant&lt;br/&gt;additional expense, patients frequently bypass one facility to seek care at a&lt;br/&gt;more distant facility. Differences in quality can explain this phenomenon.&lt;br/&gt;However, it is widely held that patients cannot directly evaluate many aspects&lt;br/&gt;of quality in health care. Patients know that one facility is cleaner or has a&lt;br/&gt;more polite staff, but they do not know the quality of their consultation or&lt;br/&gt;prescription. They seek the services of a professional because they do not know&lt;br/&gt;what professionals know, and this leaves them unable to fully evaluate the&lt;br/&gt;services they receive.&lt;br/&gt;This project collects a unique data set in which patient choices are matched&lt;br/&gt;with objective measures of a variety of aspects of quality as evaluated by&lt;br/&gt;other physicians. Though patients cannot directly evaluate all aspects of&lt;br/&gt;quality, another doctor can. The data depicts patients' willingness to incur&lt;br/&gt;additional travel cost for different objective aspects of quality. &lt;br/&gt;Preliminary analysis of an earlier round of data collection has shown that&lt;br/&gt;patients know about unobservable aspects of quality. The additional round of&lt;br/&gt;data quantitatively characterizes the method by which patients learn about&lt;br/&gt;something that they cannot directly observe. The data depicts quality that&lt;br/&gt;varies between facilities, between the various organizations that provide&lt;br/&gt;health services in Tanzania, within these organizations and over time. Using&lt;br/&gt;this data, the project reveals whether patients assign reputations to&lt;br/&gt;organizations, management practices within organizations, individual&lt;br/&gt;facilities, or even individual doctors. It addition, it depicts the speed with&lt;br/&gt;which patients update their information about quality.&lt;br/&gt; The manner and speed with which patients learn and update information&lt;br/&gt;about quality has important implications for the future of decentralization,&lt;br/&gt;privatization and regulation of health services in Tanzania and Africa in&lt;br/&gt;general.</AbstractNarration>
