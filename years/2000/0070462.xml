<AbstractNarration>A B S T R A C T&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;of the NSF proposal  DMS-0070462&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;" Reflection Principle in Higher Dimensions:  Geometric,&lt;br/&gt;Analytic and Algebraic  Approaches"&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Principal  Investigator   -   Sergey  Pinchuk&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal is focused on the following problems of analytic continuation:&lt;br/&gt;(i) Continuation of proper holomorphic mappings between domains with&lt;br/&gt;     real analytic boundaries;&lt;br/&gt;(ii) Analyticity of continuous CR mappings between real analytic manifolds;&lt;br/&gt;(iii) Propagation of holomorphic and CR mappings along manifolds.&lt;br/&gt;The existence of biholomorphic and/or proper holomorphic mappings between&lt;br/&gt;certain domains ( or CR mappings between manifolds) imposes&lt;br/&gt;significant restrictions on these domains ( manifolds ) as well as on the&lt;br/&gt;mappings. These restrictions give rise to various, sometimes unexpected,&lt;br/&gt;phenomena of analytic continuation in several complex variables. The goal of&lt;br/&gt;the proposed research is to solve some concrete old problems and to provide&lt;br/&gt;a further progress in the study of  analytic continuation and  related&lt;br/&gt;areas.  The main method of investigation is the reflection principle, which&lt;br/&gt;will be combined with other methods from analysis, geometry, algebra and&lt;br/&gt;differential equations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Complex analysis has been used as a powerful tool in mathematics and its&lt;br/&gt;applications for a long time and has a tendency to a larger role in certain&lt;br/&gt;areas. For example, the famous "edge of the wedge" theorem, which is now one&lt;br/&gt;of the main ingredients of the reflection principle, was discovered by  a&lt;br/&gt;physicist  N. Bogolyubov with respect to his research in quantum field&lt;br/&gt;theory. Another important object in theoretical physics - the Heisenberg&lt;br/&gt;group -&lt;br/&gt;is closely connected with the group of holomorphic automorphisms of the&lt;br/&gt;unit ball in the 2-dimensional complex space.&lt;br/&gt;I believe that this research program will be useful not only for complex&lt;br/&gt;analysis but also for the strengthening its ties with other areas of&lt;br/&gt;mathematics and sciences by means of potential applications. It will also&lt;br/&gt;influence mathematical education at Indiana University via involvement of&lt;br/&gt;graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
