<AbstractNarration>Chemistry (12)   The proposed project has three goals: (1) to increase the retention rate for students in basic organic chemistry courses, (2) to enhance the ability of students in these courses to use scientific reasoning, and (3) to drive innovation in the teaching of organic chemistry. These are accomplished by creating interactive learning software delivered to students over the web by a versatile platform called OWL developed at the institution and now used in general chemistry. The software consists of guided discovery modules and intelligent tutors. Using guided discovery modules, students run virtual experiments, interpret data, and then form, test, and revise hypotheses. The students' scientific reasoning ability is enhanced while gaining an appreciation for the experimental basis for the organic chemistry they are learning. Using intelligent tutors, students explore topics like SN1, SN2, E1, &amp; E2 reactivity and synthesis. Students receive immediate feedback, tuned to each individual's level of mastery. Combined with regular electronic homework, also delivered by OWL, students are prompted to keep current in their courses by participating actively in their own learning. Student participation in all components of this system, called "Organic OWL," is encouraged by allotment of credit for passed homework and completed modules and tutors. The learning power of the software will be enhanced significantly by a provision for students to draw and to submit their own structures using the ChemDraw and ChemFinder programs, in cooperation with CambridgeSoft Inc., Cambridge, MA. The materials are text-independent, and the OWL delivery platform are to be available commercially within one year of the start of the project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
