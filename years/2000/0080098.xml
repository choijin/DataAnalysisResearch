    <AbstractNarration>Antigen receptor diversity, the basis of adaptive immunity, is in part generated by a mechanism of somatic recombination that brings together the different gene segments that are expressed in lymphocytes. In tetrapods gene segments are rearranged from an array of tandemly duplicated genes to form the antigen-binding portion of the Ig heavy (H) and light (L) chains. There is one H chain locus and one to three L chain loci, but only one H and L chain combination is used to form the receptor that is expressed on the B lymphocyte cell surface. A completed and functional rearrangement is required for expression, but the mechanisms that restrict expression to one allele are not well defined.&lt;br/&gt;In higher vertebrates rearrangement thus creates a diverse antibody repertoire and plays an intrinsic part of the regulation of Ig gene expression. However, this role is one that evolved since its incipience in the ancestral jawed vertebrate. In representatives of the earliest vertebrates, the sharks and skates, there are hundreds of H and L chain loci ("clusters"), each consisting of a few gene segments. Each cluster potentially can function independently. Moreover in many clusters the gene segments are already recombined in the germline and do not need to undergo rearrangement to be utilized in lymphocytes.&lt;br/&gt; The proposed research will exploit these exceptional features in shark Ig gene organization to ask the questions: (i) When multiple Ig loci are available, is clonal receptor expression still achieved? (ii) Are the germline-rearranged genes preferentially expressed in differentiating cells because the recombination step is not needed? (iii) What elements control Ig expression when rearrangement is not required? (iv) Do the germline-rearranged genes compensate by diversifying by other mechanisms? To address these questions we will &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;--determine how many kinds of H and L chains are expressed per lymphocyte. In particular, the ontogenetic expression of shark germline-joined and non-joined genes will be compared.&lt;br/&gt;--examine somatic hypermutation in shark L chain genes. Results from prior&lt;br/&gt;support have shown that one germline-joined L chain type exhibits an&lt;br/&gt;unusual pattern of somatic changes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;--investigate the mechanism that rearranges the Ig genes in germ cells. Preliminary results suggest that these events are the result of on-going recombinase-like activity. Experiments are proposed to assay for recombinase activity in shark gonads.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; It is hoped that the research will shed some light on the regulation of Ig gene expression and the rearrangement process, giving insight as to how the adaptive immune systems of higher vertebrates evolved specific, clonal recognition of pathogenic non-self.</AbstractNarration>
