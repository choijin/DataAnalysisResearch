<AbstractNarration>0078912&lt;br/&gt;Bargmann&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Developmental biology demands the integration of cell biology,&lt;br/&gt;genetics, molecular biology, and biochemistry.  The exciting progress of&lt;br/&gt;the past decade has depended upon bringing together people who work with a&lt;br/&gt;variety of organisms, including yeast, worms, flies, and vertebrates to&lt;br/&gt;learn about the molecules and principles held in common among these&lt;br/&gt;seemingly diverse organisms.  Despite all the excitement in the field,&lt;br/&gt;there are relatively few meetings organized to emphasize the increasingly&lt;br/&gt;obvious relationships among developmental events previously viewed as&lt;br/&gt;distinct.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our specific objectives are to assemble a group of scientists with broad &lt;br/&gt;expertise in modern molecular analysis of development, have a series &lt;br/&gt;of talks on up to date research, and have about 120 other attendees present&lt;br/&gt;posters describing their research.  The meeting will be held on the campus&lt;br/&gt;of the University of California, Santa Cruz on July 21st to July 26th,&lt;br/&gt;2000.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two major goals of the meeting.  The first is to teach&lt;br/&gt;each other.  The planned program will be a superb course in advanced&lt;br/&gt;developmental biology, and help those working with each particular organism&lt;br/&gt;to keep abreast of exciting new developments in the study of other&lt;br/&gt;organisms.  This will important not just for established investigators, but&lt;br/&gt;also for the many students and postdoctoral fellows who will attend the&lt;br/&gt;meeting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
