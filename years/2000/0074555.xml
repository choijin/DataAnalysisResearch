<AbstractNarration>AST-0074555&lt;br/&gt;Buratti&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this POWRE grant is to give the Principal Investigator  (P.I.) an opportunity to experience an academic career in teaching and research.   This award will fund a teaching and research sabbatical at Pomona College. As a leading liberal arts college with strong science departments, Pomona College is the ideal location for teaching courses that speak to a wide audience of students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific goals are to: 1. Teach several courses.  The courses will include one in introductory astronomy that incorporates activities developed in the P.I.'s teacher training workshop, and an undergraduate seminar in which the tentative subject is a sharp scrutiny of various areas of pseudoscience. 2. Provide advice to Pomona College in the establishment of a new major in Earth, Planetary and Space Sciences. 3. Work with students at Pomona College on research projects (the tentative topics are observations of seasonal volatile transport on Pluto and physical characterization of Near Earth Objects). The relationships built with students will be reinforced by collaborating with faculty at the Claremont Colleges in establishing a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program. 4. Integrate student teachers from the Claremont Colleges into the "Teachers Touch the Sky" program. The experience in the academic environment gained through this POWRE award will enable the P.I. to make a career change. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is funded by the Division of Astronomical Sciences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
