<AbstractNarration>This project will study the use and implementation of an environmental management system standard developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). Public concern for the environment has spread across the globe, with national policy responses resulting in an increasingly complex web of diverse and often contradictory non-tariff barriers to trade. The growing number of incompatible environmental import restrictions has resulted in decreased efficiency and profit for corporations that export to multiple developed countries. In response, ISO 14000, is an attempt on the part of the International Standards Organization, to create common environmental management systems that will assist firms in their efforts to meet these increasingly stringent environmental laws, while simplifying the process of product export through the evolution of uniform requirements. This study, in particular, will explore several questions: 1) will ISO 14000 produce deglobalization and continued wealth inequalities in less developed regions, 2) will the ISO 14000 regime be biased in the interest of the wealthier countries and leave less developed countries will fewer benefits from participation, and 3) will implementation be shaped by firms and governments efforts to achieve their goals.  In sum, the project will investigate the impact that public policies have on firm's decisions to opt-in to the ISO 14000 regime, while shedding light on the impact that ISO 14000 will have on international trade and the environment. Data will be gathered from a large-scale mail survey of ISO 14001 certified firms in developing countries, along with personal interviews with industry and government officials.  This project will provide an understanding of the varying public policy responses to the globalization of environmental management, while also providing policy makers with information about the costs and benefits of various policy options juncture.</AbstractNarration>
