    <AbstractNarration>A Gordon Research Conference will be held July 9-14, 2000 on defects and defect-related phenomena in homogeneous and structured semiconductors, associated with growth and processing of electronic materials. Topics which are controversial and/or forward-looking will be emphasized. The program is organized around invited speakers, discussion leaders, a chair, vice-chair, and program committee; both contributed papers and posters are scheduled. Objectives are to stimulate communications among the broad community of researchers who address defects from a variety of disciplinary backgrounds--chemistry, physics, engineering and materials science, and to formulate and delineate critical research necessary to further basic understanding and move concepts closer to technological success. The conference is expected to provide an effective forum for discussion of critical scientific issues in the area of defects in semiconductors. Along with the opportunity to assess the field and future directions, it is expected that new ties will be established between universities, research institutions, and industry. &lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt; An evaluation of the progress and status of defects and defect-related phenomena in semiconductors associated with growth and processing of electronic materials and device related structures along with current assessments of the most important developments in this field will be of great value to the understanding and enhanced utilization of materials in computing, data processing, and communications. &lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>
