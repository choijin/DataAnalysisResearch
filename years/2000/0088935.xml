<AbstractNarration>Professor Koch   is investigating  critical  behavior  in  Hamiltonian&lt;br/&gt;systems and models from statistical  mechanics.  Such behavior appears&lt;br/&gt;to be  attributed not  to  individual  systems,  but to  manifolds  of&lt;br/&gt;systems.  In  the renormalization group   approach to these phenomena,&lt;br/&gt;one attempts to identify these manifolds as the invariant manifolds of&lt;br/&gt;a transformation acting  on the space of  systems  considered.  Such a&lt;br/&gt;"renormalization group   transformation", acting on  Hamiltonians, was&lt;br/&gt;introduced in a previous project.  It is expected to have a nontrivial&lt;br/&gt;fixed point,  whose stable manifold describes  the critical breakup of&lt;br/&gt;certain invariant   tori.  One  of  the  main goals  is  to  prove the&lt;br/&gt;existence of such a fixed point.  The proposed method involves the use&lt;br/&gt;of a computer, to carry out the large number of estimates that will be&lt;br/&gt;needed.  Another goal is to use the known or anticipated properties of&lt;br/&gt;the  fixed  point in order to   describe  critical invariant  tori and&lt;br/&gt;nearby periodic orbits.  Extensions  of renormalization group  methods&lt;br/&gt;to  other  (problems in) Hamiltonian systems   will be investigated as&lt;br/&gt;well.   Some interesting formal connections  with quantum field theory&lt;br/&gt;and statistical mechanics  also suggest new   ways of approaching  old&lt;br/&gt;problems in these areas.  One  of the long term  goals in this area is&lt;br/&gt;to gain a better understanding of the critical  behavior of Ising type&lt;br/&gt;models.  The approach here is to  find and study suitable improvements&lt;br/&gt;of the corresponding hierarchical  model.  Other interesting questions&lt;br/&gt;concern  the hierarchical model  itself, and two  fixed point problems&lt;br/&gt;relevant to disordered media. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Much  of this   project  is related  to  the question  of stability in&lt;br/&gt;classical   Hamiltonian systems.    Examples are  coupled oscillators,&lt;br/&gt;certain  plasma beams, and models   from celestial mechanics.  In  the&lt;br/&gt;case  of two degrees  of freedom, quasiperiodic  orbits that trace out&lt;br/&gt;smooth invariant tori divide phase space into regions from which other&lt;br/&gt;trajectories cannot   escape, thus  adding  to   the stability  of the&lt;br/&gt;system.  The breakup of such tori, as system parameter are varied, can&lt;br/&gt;cause the  dynamics to become locally  unstable or chaotic.  Numerical&lt;br/&gt;studies  reveal that this   happens  in a highly  universal  way, with&lt;br/&gt;certain measurable quantities taking exactly the same values, within a&lt;br/&gt;large class of systems.  The standard explanation of these findings is&lt;br/&gt;based  on  the assumption that  there  exists a nontrivial Hamiltonian&lt;br/&gt;system  that is  invariant  under a  suitable  "renormalization  group&lt;br/&gt;transformation".  The goal  here is to  prove that this assumption  is&lt;br/&gt;correct.  Part of the proof will  be carried out by  a computer.  This&lt;br/&gt;work  should  yield valuable  insight into   the  mechanism behind the&lt;br/&gt;observed phenomena, and at the same time, advance the state of the art&lt;br/&gt;in computer-assisted proofs -- a  technique that will undoubtedly play&lt;br/&gt;an  important role in  the  future of mathematical research.   Similar&lt;br/&gt;universality  phenomena  are  associated   with  phase transitions  in&lt;br/&gt;condensed matter  physics,  and  models from  several  other  areas in&lt;br/&gt;mathematics and physics.  A more  general form  of universality -- the&lt;br/&gt;fact  that macroscopic   descriptions are possible   without the exact&lt;br/&gt;knowledge  of  microscopic details   -- is in   fact  at the  heart of&lt;br/&gt;physics and other sciences.  The projects under investigation are part&lt;br/&gt;of a long  term effort to understand such  phenomena, and  to describe&lt;br/&gt;them mathematically.  A correct  mathematical  description can also be&lt;br/&gt;expected  to lead to significant improvements in numerical algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
