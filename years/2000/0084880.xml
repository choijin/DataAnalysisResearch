<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to develop a new approach for robust design called  "smart assembly."  A smart assembly has features, not otherwise required by the function of the design, which allow the design to absorb or cancel out the effects of variation.  The research will investigate both passive and active smart assemblies.  A passive assembly requires external adjustment and cannot absorb variation after being set. An active assembly can automatically adapt itself to variation which changes over time.  The  research will elucidate and place within a framework principles of smart assembly design so that a methodology for such design can be developed.  Computer-based analytical tools for tolerance propagation will be modified to facilitate the modeling and design of smart assemblies.  This will require that the capability of absorbing variation be included in the modeling strategy.  Another task will be to investigate the possibility of indirect absorption--of locating the feature to absorb variation away from the point at which it occurs. This may be beneficial for cost or manufacturing reasons. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the research will provide designers with additional means for controlling variation in mechanical assemblies.  Although numerous methods have been proposed for developing robust designs, none have focused on the development of features which can absorb variation, even though such approaches have been used in industry.  The research will provide the design engineer with a methodology and analytical tool to control variation when it is not possible in any other way.  The proper control of variation in assemblies has a direct link to product quality and is crucial in the development of competitive worldwide products. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
