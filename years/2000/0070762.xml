    <AbstractNarration>The investigator and his collaborators study several problems in the&lt;br/&gt;representation theory of reductive groups and its applications to number&lt;br/&gt;theory. The first problem is to prove the Kirillov conjecture which states&lt;br/&gt;that every irreducible unitary representation of Gl(n,R) or GL(n,C)&lt;br/&gt;remains irreducible when restricted to a certain subgroup. The second&lt;br/&gt;problem is to find a formula relating fourier coefficients of half&lt;br/&gt;integral weight modular forms with special values of L-functions of&lt;br/&gt;integral weight modular forms. This formula generalizes a classical&lt;br/&gt;formula of Kohnen and Zagier and is different from a formula given&lt;br/&gt;by Waldspurger. Other problems which are considered are the study of&lt;br/&gt;Bessel distributions and Bessel functions for quasi-split groups and the&lt;br/&gt;study of Fourier Jacobi models for representations of symplectic and&lt;br/&gt;unitary groups. The line of attack on these problems is to study certain&lt;br/&gt;invariant distributions and the spherical functions associated to them via&lt;br/&gt;regularity theorems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unitary representations of semisimple Lie groups were studied by the famous &lt;br/&gt;physicists Wigner and Dirac among others in an attempt to understand and&lt;br/&gt;develop the theory of quantum mechanics. Later, mathematicians such as Gelfand&lt;br/&gt;and Harish Chandra developed and rigorized this beautiful theory. Many&lt;br/&gt;applications were found to physics, geometry, number theory and other&lt;br/&gt;fields. The purpose of the current proposal is to advance the understanding &lt;br/&gt;of representation theory and to continue to explore the connections&lt;br/&gt;between representation theory and number theory.</AbstractNarration>
