<AbstractNarration>Environmental scientists who develop policies for the effective management of human activity are&lt;br/&gt;often thwarted by a lack of accurate information about the state of the environment. In some&lt;br/&gt;cases, the correct policy is not clear because the relationship between human activity and the&lt;br/&gt;environment is not well understood. Additional environmental data could improve such under-standing&lt;br/&gt;and provide the means to develop effective policies. In other cases effective policies&lt;br/&gt;have been proposed but additional data is required to justify the political and economic costs of&lt;br/&gt;implementation. However, more data by itself is not the solution. The human resources neces-sary&lt;br/&gt;to parse and analyze the data are scarcer than available data. What is necessary is intelli-gence&lt;br/&gt;to actively sample in such a way as to maximize the useful content in the data.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed inter-disciplinary program will investigate means of extended-term environmental&lt;br/&gt;monitoring. Specifically, this project seeks to endow a solar-powered airship with the intelligence&lt;br/&gt;to conduct extended-duration, autonomous environmental sampling. We will explore issues of&lt;br/&gt;configuration and design, path planning and control in the presence of weather patterns, and&lt;br/&gt;algorithms necessary for intelligent environmental monitoring. The intended result is an instru-mented&lt;br/&gt;platform for efficiently gathering accurately tagged environmental data that can stay aloft&lt;br/&gt;indefinitely.&lt;br/&gt;Airships are well suited for environmental monitoring tasks, however their potential in this capac-ity&lt;br/&gt;remains unfulfilled. As aerial monitoring platforms, they exhibit numerous advantages over&lt;br/&gt;fixed wing aircraft and helicopters. They are safer, more stable, and less expensive. They con-sume&lt;br/&gt;less power and are capable of extended operation. Given the intelligence to operate auton-omously&lt;br/&gt;and the proper sensing hardware, an airship provides a sensing platform that would be&lt;br/&gt;an asset to a diverse range of environmental scientists who seek to understand, remediate, and&lt;br/&gt;manage the environment. Potential applications of this technology include forest and crop man-agement,&lt;br/&gt;wetland surveys, land use assessment, monitoring of hazardous waste sites, and ero-sion&lt;br/&gt;quantification.&lt;br/&gt;Through a cost-sharing provision with Carnegie Mellon University, we will demonstrate our&lt;br/&gt;results on a prototype, instrumented airship to generate a characterization of air pollution. Work-ing&lt;br/&gt;together with a recently funded EPA Supersite in Pittsburgh, this project will employ an airship&lt;br/&gt;to generate 3-D profiles of air pollution and ambient particulate matter. The resulting data set will&lt;br/&gt;provide new insights into the vertical distribution and transport mechanisms of air pollution.&lt;br/&gt;New technologies cannot turn back the ecological clock but they can help environmental scien-tists&lt;br/&gt;push back the frontiers of knowledge and help ordinary citizens grasp the urgency of pre-serving&lt;br/&gt;our natural world. It is now possible to use previously classified images from spy&lt;br/&gt;satellites that show the extent of environmental degradation at a macro scale. This proposal will&lt;br/&gt;create a means of gathering dense environmental data at a much finer resolution, in a more effi-cient&lt;br/&gt;manner.</AbstractNarration>
