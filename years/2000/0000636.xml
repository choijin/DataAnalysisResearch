<AbstractNarration>0000636&lt;br/&gt;MCCREEDY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Parent Partners in School Science (PPSS) is a partnership project between The Franklin Institute and the Philadelphia School District.  This is a three and one-half year program which will provide a pivotal role for the informal science learning center to be a facilitator in parental support of K-4 school instruction in science.  The PPSS program will involve teachers, families and children in grades K-2 the first year, grades 1-3 the next, and finally grades 2-4 in the third year.  The incorporation of the national science standards and working with Home and School Associations (HSA) in the area schools, the program will impact over 3600 children, 5400 parents and 45 educators participating over the life of the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are several goals and elements in the program.  This will certainly demonstrate how an informal science center supports learning and it is also hoped to become a model for effective parent-teacher and parent-child collaboration to support learning.  There will be Exploration Cards developed, which are at-home schince challenges for families, Discovery Days that are museum-based days of science inquiry using the yearly theme, Parent/Teacher Workshops at the museum, and finally a Science Celebration which is a showcase of participants' year-long achievements via an exhibit to be displayed at The Franklin Institute for a month, then traveling the exhibit to participating schools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project's structure, disseminination acitivites and products are designed for national application and as a model for use in both formal and informal education communities.  It is hoped the program will offer new opportunities for science center methology and pratice to provide direct support for the school agenda in science.</AbstractNarration>
