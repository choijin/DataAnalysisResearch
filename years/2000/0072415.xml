<AbstractNarration>0072415&lt;br/&gt;Ramakrishna&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project aims to develop i) numerically inexpensive methods for state &lt;br/&gt;preparation in quantum control; and ii) control laws for nonlinear systems &lt;br/&gt;in the presence of singularities, and techniques for singular exterior &lt;br/&gt;differential systems. Several extant and future technologies call for the &lt;br/&gt;control of quantum systems - semiconductor heterostructures, &lt;br/&gt;spectroscopy, atomic lasers, quantum information processing, control of &lt;br/&gt;molecular dynamics, to name a few. Many of these problems can, after &lt;br/&gt;judicious modeling and optimization, be recast as the problem of &lt;br/&gt;preparing desired unitary generators, via an external control acting on a &lt;br/&gt;quantum system. This leads quickly to the problem of path planning for &lt;br/&gt;systems with drift on Lie groups, via controls that are constrained. Path &lt;br/&gt;planning for systems with drift, with few and constrained inputs, has not &lt;br/&gt;hitherto been studied. The only other alternatives for the control of &lt;br/&gt;quantum systems are computationally expensive optimization, and &lt;br/&gt;tracking which relies heavily on intuition. In this project the role of &lt;br/&gt;intuition and optimization will be limited to reformulating a given physical &lt;br/&gt;objective as state preparation for a quantum system. The latter problem &lt;br/&gt;will be attacked by developing structured factorization of unitary matrices, &lt;br/&gt;the structure being determined by the constraints. The resulting control &lt;br/&gt;design will be compared with other techniques such as inversion and &lt;br/&gt;optimal control.  Applications to lasing without inversion, molecular &lt;br/&gt;control, quantum computing and information will be then carried out. &lt;br/&gt;Related issues, such as tractable descriptions of reachable sets of quantum &lt;br/&gt;systems, will also be studied. The second part of the project stems from &lt;br/&gt;the fact that the extant non-linear control schemes are rarely directly &lt;br/&gt;applicable in singular situations such as a varying rank decoupling matrix &lt;br/&gt;and a change in relative degree. Tools from singularity theory, the theory &lt;br/&gt;of foliations, nonsmooth analysis and Lie groups will be developed to &lt;br/&gt;address this problem. A key feature will be the use of differential forms &lt;br/&gt;instead of vector fields for studying such issues. This should also have &lt;br/&gt;payoffs for singular exterior differential systems. Applications to &lt;br/&gt;techniques such as the method of intermediate integrals for partial &lt;br/&gt;differential equations and equations that change type will be studied from &lt;br/&gt;this vantage point. It is worth remarking that both components of the &lt;br/&gt;project call for similar mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Successful completion of this project should yield benefits for several &lt;br/&gt;current and future technologies. For instance, the fabrication of a quantum &lt;br/&gt;computer calls for solutions to precisely the type of problems being &lt;br/&gt;studied in the project. Similarly, obtaining a snapshot of chemical &lt;br/&gt;reactions at the molecular level also requires the control of quantum &lt;br/&gt;processes. Active control of quantum phenomena would also lead to the &lt;br/&gt;control of chemical reactions via tuned lasers. This should enhance &lt;br/&gt;product specificity in chemical reactions, thereby minimizing the presence &lt;br/&gt;of products that are not desired. The control of quantum phenomena is still &lt;br/&gt;in its infancy. The project aims to move it along further by linking it &lt;br/&gt;concretely to traditional control theory. Conversely, the results of the &lt;br/&gt;project should shed light on the control of macroworld systems. This will &lt;br/&gt;also have benefits for traditional technologies such as robotics, consumer &lt;br/&gt;electronics and electrical networks, since the underlying mathematics is &lt;br/&gt;quite similar. From a didactic point of view, the project's contribution will &lt;br/&gt;be to show to undergraduates and graduate students alike that advanced &lt;br/&gt;mathematics is not an arid field, but is in fact a lively process with &lt;br/&gt;palpable connections to real life situations. This should enhance the &lt;br/&gt;likelihood of students, especially from under represented groups, to pursue &lt;br/&gt;higher education in mathematics, science and technology.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
