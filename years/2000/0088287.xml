<AbstractNarration>Interdisciplinary (99) Sweet Briar College (SBC) is implementing a new curriculum leading to the B.S. in Environmental Science (ES). SBC is located on 3,300 acres of diversely used land giving us the potential to develop an extraordinary environmental program. The SBC ES major has depth and breadth in both the life sciences and the physical sciences, requiring intermediate-level courses in biology, chemistry, and mathematics and upper-level courses in environmental science plus at least one other science. Students choose to focus in one of four concentrations. This new curriculum is being adapted from efforts at the Richard Stockton College of New Jersey, Middlebury College, Brown University, and Rollins College, and has features adapted from strong environmental programs at other institutions as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four integrated courses are being implemented. These include three new environmental science courses (Advanced Laboratory in Environmental Science, Senior Research in Environmental Science, and Environmental Risk Assessment) and one existing biology course (General Ecology). ES majors are required to take General Ecology and the Advanced Laboratory in Environmental Science, typically in successive years. Risk Assessment and Senior Research in Environmental Science are usually taken during the senior year. This progression gives us an excellent opportunity to coordinate our courses and build on concepts and acquired skills from course to course. Modifications to the General Ecology laboratory: 1) focus on three field systems, each of which illustrates important ecological principles and environmental concepts; 2) introduce long-term field research; and 3) introduce GIS/GPS and weather monitoring technologies. The Advanced Environmental Science Laboratory is an intensive 6-hours-per-week laboratory experience intended to further expose ES majors to hypothesis formulation and testing, data analysis, team-oriented problem solving, and oral and written presentation of results. Students use the sites studied previously during General Ecology along with the terrestrial and aquatic resources of the SBC campus as well as the surrounding central Virginia area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After completing these courses, ES students are prepared to conduct research as part of Senior Research in Environmental Science, a semester-long independent project culminating in the preparation of a paper, a presentation at a college research symposium and, if appropriate, a presentation at a local or regional scientific meeting. Projects are chosen that explore environmental problems using the knowledge and skills acquired from previous coursework. The Environmental Risk Assessment course is a highly-recommended senior elective that shares a philosophy, a focus on technology, and a case history approach with General Ecology and the Advanced Environmental Science Laboratory. Environmental Risk Assessment extensively utilizes the concepts and practical skills emphasized during these two earlier courses and is intended to introduce the student to the practice of risk assessment. The incorporation of advanced technology into this course as a result of this project significantly changes how our undergraduates learn the science and art of assessing risk. This is imperative as environmental risk assessment is increasingly being used in the private and public sectors for decision making and resource allocation. Evaluation of both the courses and the overall curriculum is being conducted.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
