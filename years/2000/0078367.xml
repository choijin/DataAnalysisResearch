    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project plans to develop a new fiber based chemical sensor technology that can be used to make rapid trace chemical analysis of gaseous and liquid environments without the need for time consuming sample extraction and preparation. This new miniature sensing technology will combine aspects of fiber optics, enhanced absorption analysis techniques, and ultimately wireless internet communications. This technology will provide commercial and government users a chemical monitoring system which can be inexpensively networked over wide areas. Such a network of sensors can be monitored in real time from any secured computer via the Internet, providing real time information relating to chemical processing and transport, as well as for the monitoring of leaks and hazardous accidents. Such a system could be used as a warning network for large plant facilities and neighborhoods. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This technology is being developed for commercial application in several areas in collaboration with an established fiber sensor supplier for trace detection of chemicals around storage facilities and industrial facilities.</AbstractNarration>
