<AbstractNarration>Proposal:  DMS-0072062&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;Professor Bromberg plans to study spaces of hyperbolic metrics on a fixed&lt;br/&gt;3-manifold. Two types of questions will be investigated. The first of&lt;br/&gt;these is a study of hyperbolic cone-manifolds. Finite volume&lt;br/&gt;cone-manifolds arise naturally as a link between cusped hyperbolic&lt;br/&gt;3-manifolds and closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds. Bromberg's goal is to&lt;br/&gt;parameterize spaces of infinite volume hyperbolic cone-manifolds and use&lt;br/&gt;this parameterization to understand non-singular hyperbolic structures.&lt;br/&gt;The second question involves the topology of deformation spaces of&lt;br/&gt;complete, infinite volume metrics on open 3-manifolds. Anderson and Canary&lt;br/&gt;have shown that the space of such metrics on a manifold of fixed homotopy&lt;br/&gt;type has a very complicated topology akin to that of the Mandelbrot set&lt;br/&gt;studied in complex dynamics. In joint work with J. Holt, Bromberg has&lt;br/&gt;shown that this complicated behavior persists even if the deformation&lt;br/&gt;space is restricted to metrics on a 3-manifold of fixed homeomorphism type&lt;br/&gt;generalizing work of McMullen. Complex projective structures naturally&lt;br/&gt;appear in both of these topics. Bromberg also plans to study projective&lt;br/&gt;structures with a given discrete holonomy representation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project lies in the field of low dimensional topology and geometry.&lt;br/&gt;The main objects studied are three-manifolds which are spaces with one&lt;br/&gt;more dimension than a surface (a 2-manifold). Three-manifolds,&lt;br/&gt;such as the space that we live in, are some of the most basic&lt;br/&gt;objects in mathematics yet there are many simple questions about them that&lt;br/&gt;we cannot answer. A metric is a way of measuring distance on a 3-manifold&lt;br/&gt;and a hyperbolic metric is one of a special class of metrics such that at&lt;br/&gt;every point and in every direction the geometry locally looks the same.&lt;br/&gt;The work of W. Thurston has shown that "most" 3-manifolds carry a&lt;br/&gt;hyperbolic metric and earlier work of Ahlfors, Bers and others has shown&lt;br/&gt;that an open 3-manifold that has an infinite volume hyperbolic metric will&lt;br/&gt;in fact have many hyperbolic metrics. There is a vast program to&lt;br/&gt;understand all such metrics of which this project is a piece.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
