<AbstractNarration>Schreiber&lt;br/&gt;0077986&lt;br/&gt;     The investigator develops mathematical methods for&lt;br/&gt;difference and differential equation models to better predict&lt;br/&gt;under what conditions biological invasions succeed and the&lt;br/&gt;implications of successful invasions on the structure of&lt;br/&gt;ecological communities.  An emphasis is placed on methods that are&lt;br/&gt;robust to structural perturbations of the population equations&lt;br/&gt;and that apply to systems with nonlinear dynamics (e.g.,&lt;br/&gt;periodicity, quasiperiodicity, and chaos).  The methods involve&lt;br/&gt;the use and development of techniques from smooth ergodic theory.&lt;br/&gt;Application of these methods to models of host-parasitoid&lt;br/&gt;interactions and tritrophic food webs is pursued.  Two aspects of&lt;br/&gt;host-parasitoid interactions are examined.  First, because&lt;br/&gt;parasitoids experience egg limitation when released in systems&lt;br/&gt;with highly variable host densities (the typical situation when&lt;br/&gt;an exotic insect has reached pest status), a model of&lt;br/&gt;host-parasitoid interactions that incorporates this&lt;br/&gt;egg-limitation is considered.  As successful biological control&lt;br/&gt;only occurs after a parasitoid population has established itself,&lt;br/&gt;the proposed analysis of the model intends to determine how&lt;br/&gt;variability in the dynamics of the host population influences the&lt;br/&gt;invasion rate of the parasitoid population.  Second, previous work&lt;br/&gt;on the coevolution of patch selection strategies in&lt;br/&gt;host-parasitoid systems is extended to include two important&lt;br/&gt;biological factors, the sex-allocation strategies of parasitoids&lt;br/&gt;and plant dynamics.  The key issue is whether the manipulation of&lt;br/&gt;crop heterogeneity can lead to the coevolution of behavioral&lt;br/&gt;traits that simultaneously stabilize the system and increase crop&lt;br/&gt;yields.  Third, to better understand how ecological communities&lt;br/&gt;assemble due to invasions, this proposal undertakes the study of&lt;br/&gt;tritrophic systems with more than one species at each trophic&lt;br/&gt;level.  In these systems, three ecological forces (apparent&lt;br/&gt;competition, resource competition and intraguild predation) play&lt;br/&gt;an important role and can lead to successional intransitivites&lt;br/&gt;(e.g., a sequence of invasions that takes community A to&lt;br/&gt;community B, B to C and C back to A).  Emphasis is placed on the&lt;br/&gt;influence of habitat productivity and the timing of invasions on&lt;br/&gt;the community assembly process.  In addition, the project includes&lt;br/&gt;a program designed to stimulate undergraduate research.&lt;br/&gt;     Invading non-native species in the United States cause&lt;br/&gt;estimated economic losses of 138 billion dollars annually in&lt;br/&gt;agriculture, forestry and several other segments of the U.S.&lt;br/&gt;economy.  Exotic insect species alone are estimated to cause 13&lt;br/&gt;billion dollars in crop losses annually and approximately 42% of&lt;br/&gt;the species on the threatened or endangered species lists are at&lt;br/&gt;risk primarily because of nonnative species.  As biological&lt;br/&gt;invasions often involve nonlinear interactions between several&lt;br/&gt;species, mathematical models, as simple caricatures, allow one to&lt;br/&gt;inexpensively answer questions such as: What characteristics make&lt;br/&gt;a species a successful invader?  Which ecological communities are&lt;br/&gt;most susceptible to large long-term changes following an&lt;br/&gt;invasion?  How can crop heterogeneity be manipulated to minimize&lt;br/&gt;the economic impact of non-native pests?  The project proposes to&lt;br/&gt;develop analytical methods, and to apply these methods to models&lt;br/&gt;that address these and other questions of current interest to&lt;br/&gt;community ecology, restoration ecology, biological control, and&lt;br/&gt;evolutionary biology.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
