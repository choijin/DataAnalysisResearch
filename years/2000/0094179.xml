<AbstractNarration>Cortez&lt;br/&gt;0094179&lt;br/&gt;     The investigator develops, analyzes, and applies&lt;br/&gt;computational techniques for the motion of elastic filaments&lt;br/&gt;embedded in an incompressible fluid.  This general situation&lt;br/&gt;arises in many physical contexts, including the motion of&lt;br/&gt;microorganisms, swimming of aquatic animals, fluid flow around&lt;br/&gt;elastic bodies, bubble motion and more.  The project encompasses&lt;br/&gt;the development of numerical methods for flows corresponding to a&lt;br/&gt;wide range of length scales.  The methods are based on the use of&lt;br/&gt;a force field along filaments made of localized but smooth terms&lt;br/&gt;rather than delta distributions.  Regular expressions for the&lt;br/&gt;fluid and filament velocities induced by the forces are then&lt;br/&gt;derived as the basis for the methods.  Important properties of&lt;br/&gt;this approach are that it eliminates the singularities that would&lt;br/&gt;normally be present if the forces are assumed to be delta&lt;br/&gt;distributions, the volume of fluid within elastic boundaries is&lt;br/&gt;conserved extremely well, and high accuracy can be achieved.  The&lt;br/&gt;work is aimed at extending well-known numerical techniques to&lt;br/&gt;three-dimensional flows driven by forces along filaments and to&lt;br/&gt;the full range of length scales.  Analysis of the methods is&lt;br/&gt;carried out to establish and improve their stability, convergence&lt;br/&gt;and accuracy properties.  The applications that are pursued&lt;br/&gt;include a wide variety of flagellar motions, the motion of&lt;br/&gt;flexible membranes around obstacles, and others.&lt;br/&gt;     The motion of microorganisms in a liquid and the flow of&lt;br/&gt;blood in capillaries are two examples of phenomena that can be&lt;br/&gt;studied with computational methods.  Computer techniques that can&lt;br/&gt;accurately simulate motions of this type are very valuable&lt;br/&gt;because they can be used to determine how arteries become&lt;br/&gt;obstructed or how flagellated organisms perform specific&lt;br/&gt;functions in the human body and the effects of defects in this&lt;br/&gt;mechanism.  From a mathematical point of view, these computer&lt;br/&gt;simulations are not ready for scientists to use; there is a need&lt;br/&gt;to improve the accuracy with which the underlying equations are&lt;br/&gt;being solved and increase the reliability of the methods.  This&lt;br/&gt;project is aimed at developing computational methods for fluid&lt;br/&gt;flows interacting with elastic structures.  The goal is to develop&lt;br/&gt;high-accuracy methods, improve on their mathematical properties,&lt;br/&gt;and apply them to problems from biological sciences.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
