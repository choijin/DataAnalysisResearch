<AbstractNarration>A ten-year program to use the world's most powerful radio telescope to provide&lt;br/&gt;Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-cm (FIRST) is nearing its goal of mapping the&lt;br/&gt;entire northern sky outside the Milky Way with a resolution and sensitivity that exceed previous surveys by a factor of fifty or more. Over three-quarters of&lt;br/&gt;a million radio emitters have been detected to date, ranging from nearby active&lt;br/&gt;stars to the most distant quasars known. The images and source catalogs are all&lt;br/&gt;available on the World-Wide Web, and have been used to date by more than&lt;br/&gt;three hundred astronomers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The FIRST team is pursuing a number of major projects with this massive new&lt;br/&gt;database. Matching the radio catalog to the near-infrared sources cataloged&lt;br/&gt;by the 2MASS survey, they have discovered a number of highly obscured quasars --&lt;br/&gt;objects emitting a thousand times the energy of the whole Milky Way from a tiny&lt;br/&gt;region in a distant galaxy core that is so dust-ridden that no visible&lt;br/&gt;light escapes.  Another major project is using the entire set of radio images to attempt to&lt;br/&gt;determine the distribution of the mysterious dark matter in the Universe.&lt;br/&gt;Recognizing Einstein's dictum that mass bends light, they look for the slight&lt;br/&gt;distortions in the shapes of distant radio galaxies caused by the passage of&lt;br/&gt;their radio waves through the mass distribution of the intervening space.&lt;br/&gt;While optical astronomers have been conducting such "weak lensing" experiments&lt;br/&gt;on patches of sky the size of the full moon and smaller, this research will study the&lt;br/&gt;clumpiness of the dark matter on scales ten to one hundred times larger,&lt;br/&gt;thus making a direct connection between the galaxy distribution in the local &lt;br/&gt;Universe and the fluctuations seen in the cosmic background radiation which&lt;br/&gt;tells us the distribution of matter at the earliest times.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
