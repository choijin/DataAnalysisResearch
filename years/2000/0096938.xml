<AbstractNarration>0096938&lt;br/&gt;Forrest&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description:  This award is for support of a joint research project by Dr. M. Gregory Forest, Professor, Department of Mathematics, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina and Dr. Otis C. Wright, Mathematics and Computer Science Department at the United Arab Emirates University, Al-Ain, United Arab Emirates (UAE). The research addresses the nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) equation with nonlinearity, which is the governing equation of envelope pulse propagation in any weakly dispersive and nonlinear system.  The purpose of the collaboration is to build on results already obtained for the defocusing NLS equation and the coupled NLS system of equations, and the application of these results to optical pulse transmission.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scope:  This award will allow a US scientist to collaborate with a scientist working in the UAE.  Dr. Wright is a US scientist working abroad.  He is a recent Ph.D. graduate who is engaged in educating young college students in a foreign country where it is likely that little research in his field is being carried out.  It is important for him to maintain his collaboration with scientists in the United States at this stage in areas where there is mutual benefit.  This proposal meets the INT objective of supporting US-foreign scientific collaboration in areas of mutual benefit.  The Division of International Programs and the Division of Mathematics provide funding for this project.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
