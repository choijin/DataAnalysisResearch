    <AbstractNarration>0072404&lt;br/&gt;Margaziotis&lt;br/&gt; In the proposed work we will study the fundamental&lt;br/&gt;structure of the nucleus of the atom and the nature of the&lt;br/&gt;constituent parts of the nucleus, the neutrons and protons. Measurements&lt;br/&gt;will be made using the very precise, intense, and energetic electron&lt;br/&gt;beam produced by the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility.&lt;br/&gt;Most of the experiments will study atoms whose nucleus has no more&lt;br/&gt;than two protons and two neutrons. When electrons are used to probe&lt;br/&gt;such relatively simple systems one can compare the results to very&lt;br/&gt;accurate theoretical predictions. Experiments will be performed on helium&lt;br/&gt;nuclei to investigate the structure of these systems under extreme conditions&lt;br/&gt;including those in which the protons and neutrons are very close to each other.&lt;br/&gt;Other experiments will bombard the hydrogen nucleus, which consists of a&lt;br/&gt;single proton, to study particular features of the proton structure. One&lt;br/&gt;experiment will study the structure of a the complex lead nucleus.&lt;br/&gt; In support of these measurements we will continue our work in developing and building the target devices used to contain the materials that are being bombarded by the electron beam. This work involves building structures that can&lt;br/&gt;contain high pressure gases at temperatures a few degrees above absolute zero.&lt;br/&gt;We will also build a cooled lead target that will allow us to use the high&lt;br/&gt;power electron beam without melting the lead. In all these efforts we will&lt;br/&gt;continue to place particular emphasis on working with students, particularly&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate students and selected high school students and teachers. This&lt;br/&gt;effort is being coordinated with an outreach program that we are leading directed&lt;br/&gt;towards high schools in the local area that have large populations of minority students.</AbstractNarration>
