<AbstractNarration>The Computer Science, Engineering and Mathematics Scholarships (CSEMS) afford the College the opportunity to encourage academically talented students who are economically disadvantaged to pursue degrees in engineering technology. The CSEMS also can provide more insight into the College's retention issue through the program's use of various assessment tools such as student satisfaction surveys and student-based logs. Finally, the CSEMS are increasing student employment in technology-based jobs. Incoming freshmen pursuing an associate's in applied science degree in aeronautical technology and an associate's in applied science degree in computerized design and animated graphics, and College students who have already completed 64 credits toward a bachelor's of science, are eligible to compete for the scholarships. Admission into the program is based on the following criteria: grade point average, class standing, recommendations, Scholastic Aptitude Test scores and an interview. The College provides support for the CSEMS recipients in their pursuit of a degree in engineering technology. There are programs such as faculty mentoring and a technology seminar series devised to assist the recipients to achieve academic success. In addition, the College sponsors many activities such as faculty/recipient socials, which reinforce the objectives the College hopes to accomplish through CSEMS. Finally, the College is providing the recipients many opportunities to interact with industry representatives, both on and off campus, through internships, job fairs and industry- recipient luncheons.</AbstractNarration>
