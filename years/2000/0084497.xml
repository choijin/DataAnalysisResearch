<AbstractNarration>This award will provide funds for the support of a workshop to discuss the integration of advanced techniques into antarctic weather forecasting.   The workshop will be held at the Byrd Polar Research Center of Ohio State University, in May 2000.&lt;br/&gt; The objective of the workshop is to bring together the atmospheric community with interests in antarctic weather forecasting and synoptic meteorology.  This group, which will include operational forecasters, numerical modelers, atmospheric scientists, and others, will be expected to review the current state of knowledge in antarctic weather forecasting, as well as define and recommend goals and research needs for the U.S. Antarctic Program over the next decade.&lt;br/&gt; Recent advances in polar numerical weather prediction, resulting from ongoing efforts at improving the capabilities of numerical weather prediction models for use in polar regions, and real-time simulations of the antarctic atmosphere using the Pennsylvania State University/National Center for Atmospheric Research fifth generation mesoscale model have placed the field of antarctic weather prediction at the brink of a period of rapid improvement.  This potential can only be realized through a directed effort by all parties involved, and a stronger link between the research and operational meteorology communities.&lt;br/&gt; A formal workshop on this specific aspect of antarctic meteorology has not been convened before. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
