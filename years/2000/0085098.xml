<AbstractNarration>Fresno Urban Systemic Program&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fresno Unified School District (FUSD) proposes to significantly advance the science, mathematics, and technology education (SMT) of all K-12 students through the Fresno Urban Systemic Program (FUSP).  To accomplish the USP goals, the FUSD will provide all of its students with the fundamentals of mathematics and science so that their understanding, ability, and academic achievement will enable them to perform at or above their peers from around the world.  The FUSD goals are: (1) to improve science and mathematics achievement; (2) to increase the competency of SMT teachers and administrators; and (3) to strengthen the District's capacity to sustain SMT reform. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The proposed plan is based on prior accomplishments primarily achieved via the Urban Systemic Initiatives Program and the Local Systemic Change Project funded by the National Science Foundation.  The District intends to move aggressively to scale up activities to ensure that the SMT standards were transformed into classroom practice as prescribed by the state.  A differentiated approach to professional development will be implemented via embedded day, after school, and summer activities.  The District will work with two of its eight feeder patterns during Year 1 to test pilot the proposed design model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The District has taken on the challenge and commitment to use resources from multiple entities to upgrade facilities and provide state-of-the art improvements in support of a more rigorous course of study for SMT.  Existing partnerships with local institutions of higher education, educational consultants, cultural organizations, community groups, and parents will serve to maximize the USP efforts. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
