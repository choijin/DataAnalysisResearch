<AbstractNarration>The Montana EPSCoR Infrastructure project targets three research areas to enhance Montana's research infrastructure:  (1) Integrative Analysis of Complex Biological Systems, which will integrate the traditional players in environmental sciences with expertise in the physical and social sciences at the University of Montana and Montana State University; (2) Nanotechnology, which will combine and leverage existing Montana State University's expertise in optical technology, electrical engineering, physics, chemistry and life sciences on issues of nanotechnology; and (3) Biological Structure and Function, which will integrate biological researchers from several University of Montana departments, centers and institutes to provide a forum for collaboration and reserach emphasis.  The goal is to increase the competitiveness of these institutions in obtaining multi-investigator research awards from a variety of sources.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Infrastructure enhancements in these areas will build on the strengths of the institutions.  In addition, Montana will expand the quality and number of graduate students in each of the target areas, increase the direct involvement of undergraduates in research, and establish new initiatives in education and outreach that will have significant regional and national impact.</AbstractNarration>
