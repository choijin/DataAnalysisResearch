    <AbstractNarration>Prop # 0096937&lt;br/&gt;PI Braxton L. Tesh&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will supply shipboard scientific support equipment for the research vessel Savannah operated by Skidaway Institute of Oceanography (SkIO), University of Georgia and dedicated to use in support of marine research. The Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment Program provides funds for ship equipment deemed essential to the proper and safe conduct of ocean science research. The Program provides support for such items as deck equipment including winch systems for the deployment and retrieval of scientific instruments, navigational equipment such as radars, gyroscopes and earth satellite receivers to pin point the location of research sites, communication equipment including radio transceivers and satellite transceivers for voice and scientific data communications and other equipment such as motorized workboats for transporting scientists to and from data retrieval sites. The Project Director, Braxton Tesh is fully qualified to direct this project having had considerable experience in overseeing the acquisition and installation of shipboard equipment. This project will allow the institution to acquire a gyro compass and auto pilot, radar, GMDSS VHF Radio, escape breathing apparatus, GPS, digital fathometer, EPIRB, and immersion suits through a group purchase made by LDEO (no monetary award for SkIO).&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>
