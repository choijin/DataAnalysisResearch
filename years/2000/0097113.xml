    <AbstractNarration>We will continue our Summer Research Experience Program for Undergraduate at SUNY College at Potsdam, joint with Clarkson University. We will be involving nine undergraduates in doing research in the areas of Group theory, Graph Theory, and Topology. Experience has shown that close cooperation with undergraduate &lt;br/&gt;students and including them as participants in faculty research stimulates their interest in mathematics and helps them to learn a considerable amount of advanced material.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At least six of the nine students will be chosen from institutions other than those participating. Women and minorities will be strongly encouraged to apply. Potsdam College will provide free dormitory rooms, office space, and study lounges for the students. SUNY Potsdam and Clarkson will provide library access and computer support. The institutions involved will pay the salaries of the student leaders. Student leaders will assist in running the program and will also provide role models for students. In this way they help both the students and advisors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this program will be to build the participants' confidence in their ability to do research independently and to stimulate their interest in pursuing mathematics. To expand the students' horizons, there will be one talk each week by a guest expert.</AbstractNarration>
