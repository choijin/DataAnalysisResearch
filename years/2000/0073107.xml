<AbstractNarration>0073107&lt;br/&gt;Power&lt;br/&gt;Understanding the impacts of large disturbances on natural communities is a major goal for community ecologists and is important for successful tropical forest conservation. Hurricanes can have profound effects on the structuring of tropical forests. Although there are studies investigating the response of plant communities to hurricanes, few studies have investigated the response of faunal communities. This proposed research will investigate the effects of a hurricane on an ecologically important animal group, the ants. Ants are the most abundant animals in many tropical systems and they have many effects on ecosystem functioning. Despite their importance, little is known about their response to hurricanes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will consist of field monitoring and a field experiment in a series of sub-tropical forest habitats. The habitats fall on a continuum of agricultural disturbance and recovery. The plots range from pastures abandoned in 1993 to mature forest with no record of disturbance. Two primary goals are to document the community response to the hurricane and agricultural disturbances and to investigate a mechanism by which the hurricane may act on the ant community. Research results will increase our understanding of faunal community response to compounded large disturbances and their potential for long term recovery.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
