    <AbstractNarration>This award provides funding to bring fifteen Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) students each year to the annual ASLO winter meeting and AGU Ocean Sciences meetings. The REU students must have completed a research project during the previous year and be ready to present the results of their work either as a poster or as a talk. One student will be selected from each of the REU sites supported by OCE. Each student will receive air and shuttle bus fare, registration, room, per diem meal expenses, a ticket to the Award Luncheon or similar official event, and a one-year membership in both ASLO and AGU. Students will be prepared well for meeting navigation, paired with a mentor, and then left largely on their own during the day. Optional daily meetings at the end of the sessions will provide for feedback and interaction. A special poster session will be organized for the REU and other students. Mentors will be selected from senior scientists who work in the area of the student's interest. The majority of the presentations will be by current seniors who will be at a critical career juncture during the meeting.</AbstractNarration>
