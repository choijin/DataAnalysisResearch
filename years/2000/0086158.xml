<AbstractNarration>Cankdeska Cikana Community College was part of cohort 3 of the Tribal College&lt;br/&gt;Rural Systemic Initiative (TCRSI). Programs in this cohort received planning support in&lt;br/&gt;the first year, with the subsequent two years used to implement systemic reform. As a&lt;br/&gt;result of this initial funding, 100% of the teachers at the target schools were trained and&lt;br/&gt;began to implement standards based curriculum in their classrooms. Strategies for Phase&lt;br/&gt;II were selected based on extensive research on high poverty schools that scored highly&lt;br/&gt;on standardized achievement measures. Effective reform efforts have been shown to&lt;br/&gt;provide professional development programs of high quality, be well coordinated with&lt;br/&gt;desired instructional outcomes results oriented, and have consistent policies throughout&lt;br/&gt;the system. Successful schools carefully assessed student performance in comparison&lt;br/&gt;with standards and created additional time for academic instruction. Based on this&lt;br/&gt;research, the C4 Initiative will expand on the following three fronts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Standards Based Curriculum training offered twice&lt;br/&gt;per year will acquaint new hires and provide current developments for experienced&lt;br/&gt;teachers. Additional training sessions will focus on standards based assessment, including&lt;br/&gt;objective, standard alternative assessments to standardized tests. C4 will coordinate a&lt;br/&gt;Summer Science Institute during which teachers pilot lesson plans using independent and&lt;br/&gt;guided research in mathematics and science, and alternative assessment. With the&lt;br/&gt;coordination of C4 this curriculum will be piloted, evaluated and revised by the teachers&lt;br/&gt;involved in implementing it. This teacher-as-researcher model is anticipated to&lt;br/&gt;contribute to the scientific training of the workforce, and increase school commitment to&lt;br/&gt;the curriculum. An innovation in this area is the inclusion of a second strand of training&lt;br/&gt;for paraprofessionals, with a separate Summer Institute for teacher aides.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CONSISTENT POLICIES &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The existing RSI Council of reservation programs aimed at&lt;br/&gt;improving SMET at the k through 14 level will be expanded to include Title I and RSI&lt;br/&gt;programs on other reservation. This committee will meet monthly to coordinate activities&lt;br/&gt;that will leverage resources, maximize teacher participation and have the optimal impact&lt;br/&gt;on student achievement. The Project Director will be appointed a member of the&lt;br/&gt;curriculum committee at each of the target schools. These committees are charged with&lt;br/&gt;adoption, implementation and publication of policies supporting standards based&lt;br/&gt;curriculum and other aspects of systemic reform. Extensive use of telecommunications&lt;br/&gt;will facilitate coordination with off-reservation programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;COORDINATED RESOURCES&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Examples of resource coordination outcomes are dual&lt;br/&gt;high school-college credit course to increase advanced opportunities in mathematics and&lt;br/&gt;science, and training at the state Indian Education Association conference supported&lt;br/&gt;jointly by all North Dakota reservation RSI projects. RSI staff and Council will&lt;br/&gt;coordinate the development of after-hours instruction in mathematics and science, funded&lt;br/&gt;by resources from private and federal grant funded programs already on the reservation.&lt;br/&gt;Training for these programs and policy development will be provided with RSI funds and&lt;br/&gt;by the RSI Council respectively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cankdeska Cikana can draw upon three years of successful collaboration with the school&lt;br/&gt;districts and an experienced RSI Project Director who is an enrolled tribal member and&lt;br/&gt;also a former middle school mathematics and science teacher. As such, the project begins&lt;br/&gt;with a high level of credibility with the target school administrators and teachers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
