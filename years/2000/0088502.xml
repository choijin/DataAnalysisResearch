<AbstractNarration>Chemistry (12) &lt;br/&gt;A GC-MS is being incorporated throughout the chemistry curriculum. By adapting published experiments from the research or chemical education literature to the unique challenges and opportunities of our institution, we are developing novel pedagogical materials in both our majors courses as well as our non-majors courses. The GC-MS is having a major impact on our analytical/instrumental chemistry courses and on an environmental chemistry course for non-science majors. Additional classes that are using the instrument include organic chemistry, natural products chemistry, synthesis techniques and introduction to chemical research. A major theme of this curriculum change is project-based investigations of complex samples that directly engage the students in scientific thinking. Use of the GC-MS allows us to continue a recent change in direction of our analytical program towards the analysis of complex, "real world" samples. Experiments in the non-majors course are designed with a focus on local environmental concerns such as how the air quality is affected by a local coal-powered steam train. Such hands-on experience is critical in effectively engaging minority groups and prospective K-12 teachers. An additional outcome of this project is that all biology and chemistry students are being exposed to modern analytical instrumentation that enhances their interest in molecular structural and dynamic studies. Research students have access to state-of-the-art instrumental methods, which is strengthening their preparation for graduate studies and industrial laboratory positions and inevitably improving the publication rate of undergraduate majors at our institution. The impact of this instrument improvement project will be felt by more than 800 students over the next five years, including approximately 150 Native American and Hispanic students in our program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
