<AbstractNarration>0070212&lt;br/&gt;Rolf&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Texas A&amp;M University (TAMU) will operate the R/V Gyre during 2000 as a general oceanographic research vessel in support of NSF-supported research projects.  The Gyre is a 182 ft. vessel, constructed in 1973 and modified in 1980 and 1984, and owned and operated by TAMU.  The vessel is scheduled for a total of 175 operational days during 2000, of which 10 days are in support of NSF-supported investigators.  The remaining cruises will support State, Navy, Minerals Management Service, and other Federal and private projects.  The projects scheduled on the Gyre include several oceanographic disciplines and will fully utilize the capabilities of the vessel.  The Gyre will begin the year in the shipyard for annual ABS inspection and certification.  All operations will take place regionally in the Gulf of Mexico.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Gyre is part of a fleet of ships used by the National Science Foundation in support of marine science research.  Most oceanographic projects require highly specialized equipment to be permanently installed on the vessel, thus the necessity for specialized ships.  These vessels do not operate in the same mode as general cargo/fishing vessels.  As a result, NSF supports the operation of a variety of ships specifically dedicated to oceanographic research that are operated by universities and institutions around the country.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
