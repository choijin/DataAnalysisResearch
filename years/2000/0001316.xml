<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;                         Levin #0001316&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Why do two persons, faced with exactly the same decision, decide differently? Tile&lt;br/&gt; existence of individual differences in judgment and decision making has been widely&lt;br/&gt; noted but riot many previous studies have focused on identifying the antecedent&lt;br/&gt; conditions. Tin this proposal we focus on stable person characteristics that relate to the&lt;br/&gt; manner in which information is processed in arriving at a judgment or decision. The&lt;br/&gt; proposed experiments will provide links between individual difference indices and&lt;br/&gt; measures of the process by which a decision maker reaches his or her final choice.&lt;br/&gt; Individual difference measures to be used in the proposed research include personality&lt;br/&gt; factors such as extraversion and neuroticiscn which have been shown in previous research&lt;br/&gt; to account for significant variance in various tasks in memory and cognition, measures of&lt;br/&gt; affective state, and most notably, a measure of cognitive style widely and successfully&lt;br/&gt; used in the areas of persuasion and attitude change but only recently used in the area of&lt;br/&gt; judgment. and decision making. Such measures should provide us with new insights into&lt;br/&gt; why, in the same situation, one person will decide one way and another person will&lt;br/&gt; decide the other way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
