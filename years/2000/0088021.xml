<AbstractNarration>Biological Sciences (61)&lt;br/&gt;Four comprehensive, guided inquiry, investigative laboratory modules are being developed to address fundamental concepts in undergraduate biology instruction utilizing WOWBugs, Melittobia digitata, a harmless parasitic wasp. WOWBugs exhibit unique characteristics including elaborate courtship rituals, reproducible competitive behaviors, short generation times, easily measured heritable traits, and readily distinguishable morphological forms that are dependant upon on developmental conditions. These features make WOWBugs an effective organism for use in illustrating concepts fundamental to animal behavior, ecology, genetics, and developmental biology. Inquiry-based laboratory modules as well as instructional materials are being developed in each of these concept areas. The instructional materials under development include a book, a CD, a broadcast-quality videotape with accompanying teacher's guide, and a dedicated WOWBug newsletter and web support site. All materials are pilot tested at four diverse institutions including the University of Georgia, Hollins College, Morehouse College, and at local community colleges. The instructional materials will be disseminated at national meetings, in dedicated workshops, and through commercial distributors. In support of the curriculum development work, this project has a significant research component through which better and simpler growth medium is being developed to support classroom propagation of WOWBugs. The curricular materials in conjunction with a simple growth and propagation system ensure easy implementation into the undergraduate curriculum and provide students an opportunity to visualize a number of key biological phenomenon and to participate in a variety of innovative, inquiry-based investigations traditionally unavailable in the undergraduate laboratory.</AbstractNarration>
