<AbstractNarration>The Plant Biology Graduate Program at the University of Massachusetts will recruit ten qualified undergraduates to participate in a summer research program.  The objectives are to i) interest talented undergraduates in plant biology research and teaching, ii) increase the diversity of researchers and teachers in plant biology and iii) strengthen the regional infrastructure for plant science and education in New England.  Qualified undergraduates who have finished their junior year will be recruited nationally.  Emphasis will be placed upon recruiting students from small New England/New York Area colleges that have limited research opportunities for undergraduates, and recruiting minority students that are underrepresented in the life sciences.  The emphasis of this program is to provide undergraduates with an opportunity to immerse themselves in the day to day activities of a research laboratory.  The program will be eight weeks in duration and will emphasize independent research under the supervision of a plant biology faculty mentor.  Additionally, weekly activities are planned to foster a sense of community among the REU participants and to proivide useful experience in a variety of important skills used in a scientific research or teaching career.These include a field trip to a local habitat, workshops to develop presentation skills, a career option workshop featuring former REU participants and a poster session at the end of the program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
