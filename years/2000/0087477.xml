    <AbstractNarration>Cline &amp; Storm&lt;br/&gt;EAR-0087477&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Gordon Research Conference is one of the premier conferences that addresses the geochemistry of metallic ore deposits. The meeting serves as an international forum for researchers with differing levels of experience from academia, government, and industry to discuss issues concerning the chemistry of metal transportation and deposition in the natural environment. The theme that we have selected for the next conference is "The formation, modification and preservation of ore deposits." We have selected this theme to focus on process, rather than metal or ore-deposit type, and to highlight the linkages among the numerous factors involved in ore formation, deposit environment, and the resultant economic processing of ore. We have endeavored to make this meeting interdisciplinary by inviting speakers who are experts in a variety of fields including low-temperature geochemistry, biogeochemistry, climate change, tectonics, structure, geochronology, and numerical modeling. Each of these disciplines can bring insight and information to the understanding of how metals are transported and accumulated in and at Earth's crust. Funding of this proposal will provide partial support for junior level scientists including students, post-doctorate fellows, and assistant professors to attend the meeting, and will provide them with a unique opportunity to meet and interact with recognized experts in a friendly and informal environment. The attendance of junior-level scientists at this meeting is important because they bring new and innovative ideas to the science, and because they are responsible for future research in this field. Attendance at the conference will provide them with the opportunity to learn from and interact with more senior scientists, and to begin collaborative projects with other researchers. These experiences will undoubtedly have a positive impact on their future productivity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Convenors: Jean Cline, Jeff Hedenquist, and John Thompson&lt;br/&gt;August 19-24, 2001, Proctor Academy, New Hampshire</AbstractNarration>
