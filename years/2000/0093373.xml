<AbstractNarration>Computational geometry arose out of the need for many&lt;br/&gt;science and engineering applications of geometric computing.&lt;br/&gt;Over the last two decades, the field has emerged as a rich,&lt;br/&gt;mature, and mathematically rigorous discipline. However,&lt;br/&gt;despite its impressive achievements well-received in the&lt;br/&gt;theoretical computer science community, computational&lt;br/&gt;geometry has had limited impact in the practical areas of&lt;br/&gt;geometric computing. As advocated by the recent&lt;br/&gt;Computational Geometry Task Force Report, it is important to&lt;br/&gt;reorient the field towards providing more practical&lt;br/&gt;solutions to the specific needs of the applications that use&lt;br/&gt;geometric computing, and towards focusing on new&lt;br/&gt;"bottleneck" problems of identifiably important practical&lt;br/&gt;areas. In this proposed career plan, we intend to develop&lt;br/&gt;our research career toward this goal, by working on the full&lt;br/&gt;computational pipelines of some important real-world&lt;br/&gt;applications of geo-metric computing, including air traffic&lt;br/&gt;management (conflict prediction), graphics and scientific&lt;br/&gt;visualization (I/O-efficient isosurface extraction, I/O-&lt;br/&gt;efficient direct volume rendering, external-memory view-&lt;br/&gt;dependent surface simplification), and manufacturing&lt;br/&gt;(maximum scatter traveling salesperson problem (TSP)). An&lt;br/&gt;important aspect of the work is to examine the full&lt;br/&gt;computational pipelines of the practical applications to&lt;br/&gt;identify and formulate critical tasks into new algorithmic&lt;br/&gt;questions, extend computational geometry methodologies to&lt;br/&gt;devise novel solutions, and finally implement and integrate&lt;br/&gt;the developed algorithms into the pipelines to evaluate&lt;br/&gt;their practical ef-fectiveness in the original real-life&lt;br/&gt;applications. Key components of the plan are the expected&lt;br/&gt;rich interactions between theory and practice, and the aim&lt;br/&gt;of designing simple, easy-to-implement geometric algorithms&lt;br/&gt;that are efficient both practically and theoretically. In&lt;br/&gt;the long term, we expect to be able to have real impact on&lt;br/&gt;these important practical areas of geometric computing, and&lt;br/&gt;at the same time enrich the knowledge body of the field of&lt;br/&gt;computational geometry. The proposed educational plan&lt;br/&gt;includes introduction of new courses, involvement of both&lt;br/&gt;graduate and undergraduate students in the proposed research&lt;br/&gt;projects, participation in an outreach program, and further&lt;br/&gt;development of a research laboratory.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
