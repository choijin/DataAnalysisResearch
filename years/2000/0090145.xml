<AbstractNarration>  The PI is exploring applications of decision theory to large, complex systems, both from the theoretical and practical point of view.  From the theoretical end, he plans to use his previously-introduced concept of plausibility measures as a tool for exploring qualitative decision making.  Plausibility measures generalize probability measures, and provide an elegant framework for understanding what properties of an uncertainty measure are necessary to use that uncertainty measure for various purposes (e.g., as a model of belief revision or to apply the techniques of Bayesian networks).  The PI hopes plausibility measures will enable him to "fine-tune" approaches to decision making in applications where one does not have complete probability distributions and only rough utilities.  As far as practical applications go, the PI plans to extend his initial work on applying decision theory to query optimization in databases.  When a user poses a query, there are in general many different plans that can be used to compute the answer.  While all the plans will compute the answer correctly, they may differ wildly in running time.  What will be the best plan will in general depend on the values of certain random variables (how much memory the system has available when the query is run and the selectivity of various predicates).  Current query optimization algorithms just use a particular value (e.g., the expected value) for these variables.   The PI has previously shown how to modify these algorithms to allow for there being a probability distribution associated with each of these variables in order to compute the plan with the least expected running time.   In theory, this approach should substantially outperform the competition, but it remains to be determined experimentally whether the theoretical results hold up in  practice.</AbstractNarration>
