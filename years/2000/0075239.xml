<AbstractNarration>     The investigator develops efficient and reliable iterative&lt;br/&gt;methods for reconstructing an image from recorded, noisy data.&lt;br/&gt;To obtain better resolved images, he develops methods that can&lt;br/&gt;effectively handle complicated operators (e.g., spatially variant&lt;br/&gt;kernels) and methods that enforce a nonnegativity constraint.&lt;br/&gt;     The emergence of increasingly sophisticated imaging devices&lt;br/&gt;has produced a new generation of very difficult computational&lt;br/&gt;problems in which an image is to be reconstructed from recorded&lt;br/&gt;data.  Such problems arise, for example, in breast cancer&lt;br/&gt;detection, where there is a tradeoff between the needs to obtain&lt;br/&gt;high resolution images and to limit the radiation dose to the&lt;br/&gt;patient.  New devices have also been recently proposed for&lt;br/&gt;3-dimensional imaging, where high dimensionality and resolution&lt;br/&gt;requirements result in nontrivial computational complexity.  Yet&lt;br/&gt;another example occurs in new ground-based telescopes, which use&lt;br/&gt;adaptive optics techniques.  To extract detailed information and&lt;br/&gt;take advantage of the increase in resolution that can be obtained&lt;br/&gt;from new imaging devices, it is important to develop methods that&lt;br/&gt;take into account spatial changes of properties in the imaging&lt;br/&gt;mechanisms, which are not amenable to standard fast Fourier&lt;br/&gt;transform based methods.  New fully 3-dimensional medical imaging&lt;br/&gt;devices require a new generation of computational methods to&lt;br/&gt;efficiently reconstruct images from recorded data, and in order&lt;br/&gt;for these new computational methods to find their way to clinical&lt;br/&gt;use, it is important to provide software packages that allow for&lt;br/&gt;easy implementation and experimentation.  Methods that enforce&lt;br/&gt;nonnegativity in the computed solution, and that can efficiently&lt;br/&gt;handle spatially variant kernels, are developed.  Many of the&lt;br/&gt;computational tools developed in this project should be&lt;br/&gt;applicable to a wide class of iterative image reconstruction&lt;br/&gt;methods, including linear, nonlinear and statistical based&lt;br/&gt;methods.</AbstractNarration>
