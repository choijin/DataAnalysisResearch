<AbstractNarration>Humans have greatly benefited from the production and use of chlorine and  bromine-containing organic compounds.  However, chemical pollution has raised alarms over the potential harm that man-made chlorinated compounds can do to the health of humans, animals and entire ecosystems.  Until recently it has been thought that most if not all of the organochlorides in the environment are present due to human activity.  It is now known that thousands of organochlorides are produced naturally and that many are generated biologically.  Thus, there may be a natural cycling of chlorine in the environment similar to the way that other common elements such as carbon, sulfur, etc. are cycled.  Microorganisms play a very large role in the cycling of chemical elements.  Basidiomycete fungi (mushrooms) are known to produce organochloride compounds and some anaerobic bacteria are known to remove chlorine from some man-made compounds.  This project is aimed at determining how anaerobic bacteria degrade fungal organochlorides and participate in a natural chlorine cycle.  Knowing how these fungal metabolites are degraded will advance our understanding of chlorine and carbon cycling.  Establishing that a link exists between fungi and anaerobic bacteria will confirm that chlorine is cycled between these disparate groups of microorganisms and will provide insight into the fate of man-made and natural organochlorides once they are released into the environment.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
