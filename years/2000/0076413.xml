<AbstractNarration>0076413 &lt;br/&gt;Carpick  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will enable the acquisition of a variable temperature ultrahigh vacuum atomic force microscope (UHV AFM) devoted to the study of mechanics and tribology at the nanometer scale. The long-term research goal is to develop an atomic-scale understanding of the mechanics (including elasticity, plasticity, rupture, and fracture) and tribology (friction, adhesion, wear, lubrication) of novel materials relevant to micro- and nano-technology. Specific interdisciplinary research problems that will be addressed include fundamental studies of the tribology of micromachine surfaces, the dependence of friction upon perovskite thin film surface terminations, and mechanical properties of nanocomposites. This instrumentation will enable new opportunities to integrate research, education, and training by exposing students to cutting-edge AFM techniques applied to the study of novel materials. Further education opportunities include student laboratory tours and development and dissemination of new classroom and web-based material. &lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although friction is one of the most commonly-experienced physical phenomena in nature, it not yet understood in a truly fundamental way. This award will enable the acquisition of an atomic force microscope (AFM) which will be used to study the fundamentals of friction and related phenomena (deformation, lubrication, and wear) for novel materials. The AFM measures forces and deformations at the nano- or atomic level. The instrument will operate in a pristine vacuum environment at different temperatures to allow precise control of the materials being studied. Specific materials to be studied include surfaces of silicon micromachines, ceramic thin films, and new strong composites made from nano-scale components. The instrument will be integrated with several educational efforts. Instrument tours for undergraduate and high-school students will be provided, and a web-site showcasing the instrument and the current research projects will be created. The training that student researchers obtain on this advanced instrument can be readily applied to other academic and industrial research problems.&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
