<AbstractNarration>DMS-0072154&lt;br/&gt;John W. Lott&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Riemannian geometry is the study of curved spaces. &lt;br/&gt;Examples of such spaces are curves and surfaces in &lt;br/&gt;three-dimensional flat space. Riemann showed how to&lt;br/&gt;make precise the notion of curvature for a space of &lt;br/&gt;arbitrary dimension.  Spectral analysis can be roughly &lt;br/&gt;characterized as the study of how a space vibrates.  &lt;br/&gt;More precisely, to a curved space is associated a certain &lt;br/&gt;partial differential operator, the Laplacian.  Spectral &lt;br/&gt;analysis is the study of how the eigenvalues of the &lt;br/&gt;Laplacian depend on the underlying geometry of the space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In previous work, the principal investigator obtained &lt;br/&gt;relationships between the spectrum of the differential &lt;br/&gt;form Laplacian and the geometry of the underlying space, &lt;br/&gt;the latter being constrained by upper bounds on its diameter&lt;br/&gt;and upper and lower bounds on its curvature. In particular, &lt;br/&gt;he characterized when there are uniform upper bounds on the &lt;br/&gt;j-th eigenvalue of the p-form Laplacian, and when there are &lt;br/&gt;small positive eigenvalues of the p-form Laplacian.  He &lt;br/&gt;proposes to extend this work in several directions.  One &lt;br/&gt;direction is to just assume that there is a lower bound &lt;br/&gt;on the curvature of the space.  New issues arise in this &lt;br/&gt;case, as under the assumed geometric constraints, the space &lt;br/&gt;can ``collapse'' to a highly singular space of lower &lt;br/&gt;dimension.  The principal investigator's previous work, &lt;br/&gt;in the case of upper and lower curvature bounds, also dealt &lt;br/&gt;with the singular spaces that arise in a collapsing limit.  &lt;br/&gt;However, with just a lower curvature bound, the singular&lt;br/&gt;spaces that arise are of a different nature. He also proposes &lt;br/&gt;to extend the previous work in the direction of analyzing &lt;br/&gt;the spectrum of the Dirac operator, under the geometric &lt;br/&gt;assumptions of an upper bound on the diameter of the space&lt;br/&gt;and upper and lower bounds on its curvature.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
