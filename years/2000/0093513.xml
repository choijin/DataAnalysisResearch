<AbstractNarration>BES-0093513&lt;br/&gt;Costello&lt;br/&gt;As we begin the 21st century, we do so with the realization that the traditional engineering&lt;br/&gt;of previous decades is changing at a rapid pace. To keep in line with the advances in technology,&lt;br/&gt;we are constantly adapting, improvising, and developing new strategies that enable us to&lt;br/&gt;approach engineering research and education as an integrated system in touch with the&lt;br/&gt;technological advances around us. The goal of this CAREER proposal is to use the&lt;br/&gt;interdisciplinary background of the PI to address the multi-faceted needs of today's engineer by&lt;br/&gt;engaging them in research and education at the interface of engineering and science.&lt;br/&gt;Work in the PI's lab is focused on the application of molecular and microbiological&lt;br/&gt;techniques to the study of natural and engineered systems. The PIs  model system is the methane oxidizing bacteria, or methanotrophs. Methanotrophs are ubiquitous throughout terrestrial and aquatic environments and are important in the global carbon cycle, climate change, and the remediation of hazardous wastes. Because of this, they provide an interesting framework within which to ask questions that integrate science and engineering in both research and education. &lt;br/&gt;In this proposal, the PI has developed a long-term educational plan that coordinates directly with her interests in the research of methane oxidizing bacteria. The PI will redesign a suite of core classes in the Civil and Environmental Engineering department that will focus on educating engineering students in the concepts of modern biology by integrating biology into the curricula in the context of engineering topics. In addition, she will foster collaborative, multi-disciplinary educational and research interactions with engineering and science departments at Syracuse University. The effectiveness of these undertakings will be measured using a number of&lt;br/&gt;assessment tools and an independent advisory board established by the PI.&lt;br/&gt;In addition to educational initiatives, this project will enable students to carry out&lt;br/&gt;interdisciplinary research characterizing population shifts in methane-oxidizing bacteria in&lt;br/&gt;response to soil acidification. A combination of molecular biology and environmental&lt;br/&gt;engineering tools will be used to test the hypothesis that natural acidic deposition (acid rain)&lt;br/&gt;exerts selective pressure on methanotrophic diversity and is a significant factor in controlling&lt;br/&gt;changes in the methane oxidation characteristics of natural populations of these bacteria.&lt;br/&gt;Specific questions to be answered include 1) What are the dominant methanotrophs present in&lt;br/&gt;soils of the Adirondack mountains and 2) How do natural methanotroph populations respond to&lt;br/&gt;acidification of their environment? Answering these questions will expose students to various&lt;br/&gt;theories, techniques, and experiences that span both engineering and science disciplines. ***&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
