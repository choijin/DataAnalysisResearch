<AbstractNarration>With National Science Foundation support Dr. Lloyd Ream and his collaborators will develop a technique to extract and identify DNA preserved on prehistoric stone tools which were used to butcher animals. In preliminary work, Dr. Ream has demonstrated that microcracks produced during stone tool manufacture trap blood proteins and DNA more than 140 microns beneath the tool surface. These residues are not removed by surface washing and thus have the possibility of preservation for significant periods of time. Sonication can release 60 to 80% of the trapped DNA and make it available for identification. The team will build on this preliminary research and: 1. Combine into a streamlined procedure established methods for recovery and analysis of ancient proteins and DNA from stone tools; 2. Test the reproducibility and sensitivity of these methods by comparing the results of simultaneous protein and DNA analyses: 3. Correlate preservation of DNA and protein in bone, and use these data to infer probably condition of residues on stone tools from the same stratum; 4. Determine whether protein and DNA from modern sources contaminate associated sediments, unmodified stone and stone tools; and 6. Correlate archaeological context, deposition rate, and specimen age with preservation of protein and DNA. If successful, the project will help to define parameters, including specimen handling procedures and requisite control samples important for study of protein and DNA residues on stone tools from any archaeological site or museum collection. To accomplish this goal the team will analyze both lithics and faunal remains from the Bugas-Holding and Hell Gap archaeological sites. Together they cover a period from ca. 1,200 to 10,000 years ago and vary not only in age but also in depositional conditions. The sites are well excavated and provide an excellent context within which to develop these techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In many archaeological sites, stone tools constitute the primary class of material recovered and researchers therefore expend considerable effort in extracting the maximum amount of information from them. It is often extremely difficult or impossible based on tool form to determine use and Dr. Ream's technique, if successful will allow one to learn whether a specific implement was used to hunt or butcher game. It also has the potential to identify the species of animal and this is important because faunal remains are poorly preserved and often completely destroyed in many sites. If successfully developed these techniques will provide archaeologists with a powerful new tool which can be used in many time periods and many regions of the world.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
