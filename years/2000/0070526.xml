    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main theme of the project is to develop the theory of fourth order&lt;br/&gt;equations arising from conformal geometric considerations. The first&lt;br/&gt;part of the project seeks to apply the fourth order equation as &lt;br/&gt;regularizing equations of the more natural but more difficult fully&lt;br/&gt;nonlinear partial differential equations in conformal geometry.&lt;br/&gt;The first consequence will be natural conformal criteria for the&lt;br/&gt;existence of a conformal metric of positive Ricci curvature. The second&lt;br/&gt;part of the project seeks to widen the set of conformal classes to which&lt;br/&gt;our theory of fourth order equations may be applied. A concrete problem&lt;br/&gt;would be to find saddle point solutions of the fourth order equations&lt;br/&gt;on a large class of four dimensional conformal structures of negative&lt;br/&gt;scalar curvature. The third part of the proposed project is to develop&lt;br/&gt;the theory of biharmonic maps in four dimension. It is proposed to&lt;br/&gt;develop a classification of biharmonic maps of special conformal&lt;br/&gt;structures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The several parts of this proposal share a common novel feature to&lt;br/&gt;consider a fourth order nonlinear differential equation that relates&lt;br/&gt;fourth order term of a scalar quantity to the scalar quantity itself.&lt;br/&gt;The equation came from geometric considerations for a four dimensional&lt;br/&gt;space that are natural from topological perspective. The project&lt;br/&gt;will have an impact on the development of higher order differential&lt;br/&gt;equations in several ways. First it will introduce new techniques&lt;br/&gt;to study the solutions of such equations. Secondly, it will yield new&lt;br/&gt;methods to solve the more traditional second order equations of geometric&lt;br/&gt;interest. Thirdly, the results have aleady yield application to the&lt;br/&gt;geometry of four dimensional space.</AbstractNarration>
