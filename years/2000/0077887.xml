<AbstractNarration>Plants recognize and respond to pathogen attack with specific defense&lt;br/&gt;mechanisms. The rapid production of Reactive Oxygen Intermediates (ROI),&lt;br/&gt;from molecular oxygen, in plants has been correlated with resistance&lt;br/&gt;responses against pathogens. These oxygen derivatives can be toxic to&lt;br/&gt;invading microbes and can serve as signals to the plant cells being&lt;br/&gt;invaded. ROI accumulation is frequently correlated with the Hypersensitive&lt;br/&gt;Response (HR), a kind of programmed cell death (PCD) which probably also&lt;br/&gt;requires nitric oxide (NO) formation. In addition, ROI play a role in&lt;br/&gt;morphogenetic phenomena like cell elongation, strengthening of the cell&lt;br/&gt;wall, lignification and response to other stresses such as wounding attack&lt;br/&gt;by insects, saline and cold stress. Examples of developmentally regulated&lt;br/&gt;cell death include the formation of specialized structures like xylem,&lt;br/&gt;organ sculpting (formation of certain leaf lobes, floral organ abortion),&lt;br/&gt;the degeneration of organs once they have accomplished their function (the&lt;br/&gt;embryo suspensor, or the aleurone and the endosperm after the seed&lt;br/&gt;germination) and senescence. In flowers, the interior cell layer of the&lt;br/&gt;anther locule (the tapetum) undergoes PCD during pollen development. The&lt;br/&gt;role of ROI in these processes is largely unexplored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several biochemical mechanisms have been proposed to explain ROI generation&lt;br/&gt;by plants. However, various lines of evidence implicate an NADPH oxidase,&lt;br/&gt;analogous to that which generates the respiratory burst in mammalian&lt;br/&gt;phagocytes, as the source of the ROI detected in plants, at least upon&lt;br/&gt;infection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This investigator has found transposon insertions in the coding region of 8 Arabidopsis Atrboh&lt;br/&gt;homologs of the mammalian gp91phox, the key membrane bound NADPH-binding&lt;br/&gt;flavocytochrome b558 so far identified. These mutant lines are an&lt;br/&gt;incomparable tool to dissect the role of specific gp91phox homologues, not&lt;br/&gt;only in plant defense but also in relation to developmental processes, PCD&lt;br/&gt;and other responses to the environment. Preliminary data demonstrate&lt;br/&gt;that there is redundancy in this gene family, and that ROI generated via&lt;br/&gt;the gp91-phox protein play a role in at least one critical developmental&lt;br/&gt;process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The identification of the Atrboh genes enables the PI to look for more&lt;br/&gt;components in early steps of the signal transduction pathway to defense,&lt;br/&gt;and to study the mechanism that activates the plant NADPH oxidase.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
