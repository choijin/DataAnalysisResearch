<AbstractNarration>As network performance has increased, the high-performance computing community has begun to&lt;br/&gt;turn to distributed systems to meet their performance needs. Research that combines the concurrency&lt;br/&gt;management techniques from parallel computing with scalable and adaptive distributed systems design has resulted in a new software architecture known as the "Computational Grid". Its main tenet is that user programs should be able to draw computational "power" from a distributed resource pool the way&lt;br/&gt;electrical appliances draw electricity from a power utility: ubiquitously, seamlessly and reliably. This&lt;br/&gt;project will investigate a novel approach to building software systems that implement the" Computational&lt;br/&gt;Grid"  model of computing and how to foster new curricular directions based on this investigation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As vehicles for this proposed work, two research thrusts will be combined in the form of EveryWare and G-commerce to define a new programming methodology for the Grid. EveryWare is a software toolkit for building robust, high-performance distributed applications that can use existing Computational Grid&lt;br/&gt;middleware as building blocks. An EveryWare program is structured as a set of application customizable&lt;br/&gt;services that use the EveryWare toolkit as an adaptive server framewirk while leveraging the functionality&lt;br/&gt;provided by existing Grid systems. G-commerce is a computational economic system that allows applications to purchase resources from computational suppliers. A key feature of G-commerce is that it is a macro-economic system which provably achieves economic equilibrium and market stability. By combining these two we will define a new and powerful approach to programming Grid applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To do so we will:&lt;br/&gt;.extend and implement the EveryWare software toolkit,&lt;br/&gt;.study and develop economic formulations that will form the basis of G-commerce&lt;br/&gt;based resource allocation strategies,&lt;br/&gt;.develop a computational exchange for implementing resource economies an&lt;br/&gt;infrastructure for empirical G-commerce resource scheduling studies and,&lt;br/&gt;.verify our results using non-trivial Grid applications in "live" Grid settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research approach of this project is both analytical and experimental.&lt;br/&gt;It will approach  the problem of ensuring resource allocation stability and&lt;br/&gt;equilibrium theoretically and using simulation. Then implement promising&lt;br/&gt;economic formulations using the computational exchange, and test their&lt;br/&gt;validity with EveryWare implimentations of Grid applications. At the same&lt;br/&gt;time, EveryWare will be enhanced so that it enables the aplication programmers&lt;br/&gt;and schedulers to consider computational price when making resource allocation&lt;br/&gt;decisions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EveryWare and G-commerce will also serve as the basis for new directions in&lt;br/&gt;curriculum development. A course sequence will be designed that combines&lt;br/&gt;distributed computing techniques, statistical analysis of load conditions, and&lt;br/&gt;economic modeling methods from the literature with practical implementation&lt;br/&gt;using Computational Grids. The resulting multi-disciplinary course will allow&lt;br/&gt;students to compare and combine different strategies easily for the purpose of&lt;br/&gt;making quantitative evaluations, which will be a primary focus of each sequence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Practica will also be organized in which students from different Universities&lt;br/&gt;will be invited to participate. Each practicum will focus on the implementation&lt;br/&gt;of a chosen application using different Computational Grid infrastructures.&lt;br/&gt;Students will compare different techniques and use the EveryWare toolkit and&lt;br/&gt;G-commerce to combine those that are the most effective.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
