<AbstractNarration>Proposal: DMS-0083097&lt;br/&gt;PI: Walter D. Neumann&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite the venerable history of the algebraic geometry, many difficult&lt;br/&gt;problems remain even in low dimensions. Methods of low dimensional&lt;br/&gt;topology have proved very helpful here, and part of this project concerns&lt;br/&gt;a continuation of the investigator's successful application of such&lt;br/&gt;methods to the study of singularities of complex surfaces and the topology&lt;br/&gt;of plane affine curves. One issue to be addressed is explicit analytic&lt;br/&gt;description of singularities with given topology. The general question is&lt;br/&gt;notoriously difficult, but the investigator and J. Wahl have recently made&lt;br/&gt;a series of conjectures on realising rationally Gorenstein singularities&lt;br/&gt;with rational homology sphere links as explicit quotients of complete&lt;br/&gt;intersections and are making significant progress towards their&lt;br/&gt;resolution. 3-manifold topology is also being applied to the study of the&lt;br/&gt;global topology and analytic classification issues for two-variable&lt;br/&gt;polynomials. These issues are of intrinsic interest as well as having&lt;br/&gt;potential to contribute to the resolution of the famous Jacobian&lt;br/&gt;Conjecture.  In a rather different direction, the investigator will study&lt;br/&gt;invariants of 3-dimensional manifolds that relate to number theory and&lt;br/&gt;algebra, namely the so-called character and eigenvalue varieties and the&lt;br/&gt;Bloch invariant.  Connections are emerging between these invariants that&lt;br/&gt;will inform both topology and algebra/number theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Algebraic Geometry, which is essentially the study of the zero sets of&lt;br/&gt;families of polynomials, has always been an important area of&lt;br/&gt;fundamental research, and is also important in such diverse&lt;br/&gt;applications as control theory and communications. The project will&lt;br/&gt;apply topological methods to algebraic geometry, to obtain results on&lt;br/&gt;how to realise and classify families of polynomials that lead to&lt;br/&gt;particular topologies.  The methods of 3-dimensional topology are of&lt;br/&gt;particular importance to this project, and there is also feedback from&lt;br/&gt;algebra and number-theory to topology, as well as some interaction&lt;br/&gt;with theoretical physics and cosmology. The project also studies&lt;br/&gt;new insights that these connections bring to all these fields.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
