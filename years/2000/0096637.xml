<AbstractNarration>This K-8 Local Systemic Change mathematics project funds professional growth activities for teachers and administrators in Harvey Public Schools District 152.  A component of this three-year project is to enhance the district's infrastructure to support on-going improvements in mathematics teaching and learning.  Implementation of two reform mathematics curricula -- "Math Trailblazers in Grades K-5" and "Connected Mathematics in Grades 6-8" -- provide the tools for developing strong professional communities of teachers, administrators and parents committed to improving mathematics instruction in the district.  The results of the project will add to an emerging body of knowledge about standards-based curricula implementation in poor, urban communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is a partnership among the Institute for Mathematics and Science Education of the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), the Harvey Public Schools, and the North Central Mathematics and Science Consortium at the U.S. Department of Education's North Central Regional Educational Laboratory (NCREL).  UIC's Teaching Integrated Mathematics and Science (TIMS) Project will direct the K-5 component of the project, which involves 102 K-5 teachers.  The North Central Mathematics and Science Consortium will fund and direct the component for 17 middle-grades teachers.</AbstractNarration>
