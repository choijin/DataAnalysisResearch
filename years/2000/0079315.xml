    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project focuses on mass production of&lt;br/&gt;triploid marine shrimp. Marine shrimp culture experienced exponential growth between 1980&lt;br/&gt;and 1990, increasing from 5% to 28% of total world production. Since then, farmed shrimp&lt;br/&gt;production has stagnated due to disease and water quality problems. Disease problems are&lt;br/&gt;largely due to dependence on wild caught shrimp broodstock and post larvae, which carry&lt;br/&gt;many untreatable viral diseases. A solution to this problem is closed-cycle culture, which&lt;br/&gt;also permits genetic selection for improved production performance. To protect a breeder's&lt;br/&gt;investment in specific pathogen free (SPF)stock, specific pathogen resistant (SPR) stock,&lt;br/&gt;and genetic selection, it is highly desirable to sell only sterile post larvae. Triploidy is a&lt;br/&gt;possible solution since triploids of other species are typically sterile and may exhibit&lt;br/&gt;superior culture performance. In addition triploidy may allow for the culture of exotic&lt;br/&gt;species in environmentally sensitive areas where exclusion of exotics is desirable. &lt;br/&gt;Phase II will focus on development of tetraploid breeding stocks that will be crossed with&lt;br/&gt;normal diploid stocks to produce triploid progeny.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The successful outcome of our R&amp;D effort will result in significant changes in marine&lt;br/&gt;shrimp culture. It will prevent competitors from propagation of shrimp stocks that have&lt;br/&gt;been genetically selected for aquaculture performance. It will help stimulate large-scale&lt;br/&gt;investment in SPF, SPR, genetic selection and closed-cycle shrimp culture. It will help&lt;br/&gt;create opportunities to expand use of exotic shrimp species into environmentally sensitive&lt;br/&gt;culture areas. Our company intends to be at the forefront of these opportunities.</AbstractNarration>
