<AbstractNarration>The proposal studies optimal structured materials. These problems  &lt;br/&gt;require non-standard methods of calculus of variations that are  &lt;br/&gt;developed.  The first project deals with materials or structures  &lt;br/&gt;with inner instabilities. Under ballistic impact, these materials  &lt;br/&gt;dissipate and radiate the energy in an abnormal high rate; the  &lt;br/&gt;effect can be used in various protective devices.&lt;br/&gt;The second project aims to find the optimal structures for  &lt;br/&gt;multi-component composites. This problem is not solved even &lt;br/&gt;for the simplest cases;  the optimal structures  are significantly &lt;br/&gt;different from optimal  two-material structures.&lt;br/&gt;The third project deals with specific problem of ``inverse  &lt;br/&gt;optimization". It aims on understanding of optimality of natural  &lt;br/&gt;structures, as trunks of trees or human bones. Here we want to  &lt;br/&gt;determine the goal functional of the structural optimization from  &lt;br/&gt;the known structure and external conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The three chapters of the proposal treat novel problem in theoretical &lt;br/&gt;material science that require development of new mathematical methods. &lt;br/&gt;All problems originate in science and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;The first projects is concerned with new structures with a very high ability to &lt;br/&gt;resist shocks. Such materials can be used in various protective devices or  &lt;br/&gt;containers.  The second project addresses optimal structures of   &lt;br/&gt;composites that are made of three or more components. The study of such &lt;br/&gt;structures is demanded by many engineering applications because the  &lt;br/&gt;majority of natural or artificial composites are made of more than  &lt;br/&gt;two materials. The last project aims to develop mathematical  &lt;br/&gt;methods for evaluating the optimality of biological structures.  &lt;br/&gt;The goal here is to understand in what sense biology is optimizing its &lt;br/&gt;structures and to use biological "solutions" to evolutionary challenge &lt;br/&gt;in engineering applications.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
