<AbstractNarration>Wireless communication systems must inevitably deal with the &lt;br/&gt;severe effects of fading, the phenomenon whereby received signals fluctuate &lt;br/&gt;over very wide ranges as the propagation environment changes in time.  &lt;br/&gt;Various forms of diversity are commonly employed to combat the effects &lt;br/&gt;of fading.  In various scenarios, it is possible to achieve diversity by &lt;br/&gt;transmitting a signal that is redundant in time or frequency, by using &lt;br/&gt;multiple transmit antennas and/or multiple receive antennas.  While techniques&lt;br/&gt;for achieving time diversity, frequency diversity, and space diversity &lt;br/&gt;through multiple receive antennas are well known, developing techniques&lt;br/&gt;for achieving diversity through the use of multiple transmit antennas is&lt;br/&gt;a relatively new area which is currently of great practical and theoretical &lt;br/&gt;interest.  This research involves the design of improved modulation and coding&lt;br/&gt;techniques for the so-called space-time systems, i.e., those with multiple &lt;br/&gt;transmit antennas.  One main goal of this project is to maximize improvement &lt;br/&gt;in what is in some sense the worst case scenario where the number of receive &lt;br/&gt;antennas is either one or a very small number and also where the channel is&lt;br/&gt;fading in a very slow (i.e., quasi-static) manner.  In this environment, &lt;br/&gt;transmitter diversity and possibly frequency selectivity may be the only &lt;br/&gt;sources of potential diversity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research studies the potential of improving on existing techniques&lt;br/&gt;by overcoming two flaws that plague many existing or proposed space-time &lt;br/&gt;systems: 1) Space time codes have difficulty providing both diversity and &lt;br/&gt;significant coding gain,  Many space-time codes must use up all their redundancy &lt;br/&gt;to provide diversity and actually provide little or no coding gain.  By &lt;br/&gt;splitting the jobs of providing diversity and coding gain between either two &lt;br/&gt;separate codes or between the coding and modulation formats, this research &lt;br/&gt;produces a more effective space-time communication system.  2) Space time codes &lt;br/&gt;which promise significant coding gain often do not produce it in a quasi-static &lt;br/&gt;fading channel (QSFC).  The currently accepted design rules for space-time &lt;br/&gt;codes are in fact shaky when applied to a QSFC.  By forming a more solid &lt;br/&gt;foundation for designing codes for QSFCs, this research produces better design &lt;br/&gt;criteria and ultimately better space-time coding techniques.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
