<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses certain fundamental aspects of the electroweak&lt;br/&gt;and strong interactions that are reflected in meson and nucleon&lt;br/&gt;properties and interactions at low/intermediate energies.  The&lt;br/&gt;research is motivated by the fact that the present comprehensive&lt;br/&gt;theory--the Standard Model (SM)--is known to be incomplete;&lt;br/&gt;furthermore, the SM becomes unworkable for strong interactions at low&lt;br/&gt;energies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rare beta decay of the pi-meson (pion), occurring once in about&lt;br/&gt;100 million ordinary pion decays, provides a theoretically clean&lt;br/&gt;window to certain allowed extensions of the SM.  The PIBETA&lt;br/&gt;experiment, mounted at the Paul Scherrer Institute, Switzerland, by an&lt;br/&gt;international collaboration of seven institutions led by the&lt;br/&gt;University of Virginia (UVa) group, aims to improve the present 4%&lt;br/&gt;accuracy of the pion beta decay rate by about a factor of ten in a&lt;br/&gt;staged approach, in order to match the theoretical uncertainty and&lt;br/&gt;provide new constraints on physics beyond the SM.  Measurements that&lt;br/&gt;began in 1999 will continue through 2001.  PIBETA is the main effort&lt;br/&gt;of the present research project.  Additional commitments of effort&lt;br/&gt;include work on studies of nucleon and meson structure at Stanford&lt;br/&gt;(SLAC) and Jefferson Lab (CLAS collaboration).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the past three years this program has resulted in two doctoral&lt;br/&gt;degrees at UVa plus three more at collaborating universities stemming&lt;br/&gt;from the PIBETA project alone.  Four more UVa Ph.D. degrees are&lt;br/&gt;expected in the next three to four years.  Each year typically one to&lt;br/&gt;two undergraduate students are engaged in research on this project,&lt;br/&gt;thus gaining practical laboratory experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
