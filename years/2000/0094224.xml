    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal: 0094224 Date: March 18, 2002&lt;br/&gt;PI: Michael C. Fitzgerald Institution: Duke University &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This PECASE award to Professor Michael Fitzgerald of Duke University is supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division. The primary research objective is to develop a mass spectrometry based method to examine protein stability and folding. The experimental technique of hydrogen-deuterium exchange combined with matrix assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry has several advantages over existing techniques for studying protein folding. The long-range goals of this research are to develop a method to study complex binding interactions between multiple proteins and DNA. The educational component of this program is both innovative and well developed. Dr. Fitzgerald presents a program focused on a summer workshop for high school science teachers. He collaborated with the school district science specialist in the development of the plan, which has also received the support of eight regional principals. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will impact the fields of mass spectrometry and biochemistry. Compared to established methods, this method is not limited by sample purity and will have greater sensitivity. It is designed to be automated and fast. Future applications of this line of research could impact the study of both disease state and normal human health.</AbstractNarration>
