<AbstractNarration>This project will explore the following chemical strategies for the general synthesis, organization and integration of  nanoscale building blocks: (1)  the development of gas-phase and solution-phase chemistry for the synthesis of nanowires, nanorods and molecular wires with well-defined sizes and aspect ratios; (2) the development of suitable chemical functionalization chemistry for the self-assembly and integration of these 1D building blocks; (3) the investigation of the thermal and chemical stability of these 1D nanostructures. The three types of 1D nanoscale building blocks (nanowire, nanorod and molecular wire) in this project share common structural feature---one-dimensionality, but differ in their length scale, aspect ratio, and rigidity, conseuently also differ in their assembly behaviors and physical properties. The interdisciplinary nature of the research will benefit the postdoctoral researchers, graduate students and undergraduate students involved in the project. Associated educational activities will include exploring new means of introducing materials chemistry research into the curriculum for both undergraduate and graduate courses. &lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;One-dimensional (1D) nanostructures are of  both fundamental and technological interest.&lt;br/&gt;They not only exhibit interesting electronic and optical properties intrinsically associated with their low dimensionality and the quantum confinement effect, but they also are potentially the critical components in the nanoscale device applications. This project will train students in the important field of nanoscience and foster their scientific development in a cross-disciplinary environment. This area is viewed by industry as high priority, and students trained in this area of nanoscience and technology compete very well in the job market and make significant contributions to an area of high national interest. This project is funded by the Solid State Chemistry Program of the Division of Materials Research and the Advanced Materials and Processing Program of the Chemistry Division.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
