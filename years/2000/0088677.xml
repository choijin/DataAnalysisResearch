<AbstractNarration>Biological Sciences (61) This comprehensive project is integrating new microscopic and imaging technology into the undergraduate biology curriculum. In addition to the incorporation of phase contrast microscopy into our first year curriculum, we are incorporating experiments using techniques such as single excitation wavelength epifluorescence, dual wavelength fluorescent ratio imaging, and other types of microscopy in studying the ecology, physiology, and cellular processes of cells. We are developing new experiments for our Introductory Biology lab series as well as in Bacteriology and Cell Physiology and other upper-level labs in the department. We believe that improving our courses focusing on cells will make a needed connection for the students in understanding how the molecules relate back to the cells and eventually to the organism. A major component in current understandings of cells and how they function is the use of epifluorescence microscopy and imaging analysis. This equipment is being used in a variety of courses starting with the introductory labs where we have many prospective biology majors, nursing majors, physical education majors as well as students involved in both the environmental science and molecular biology/ biochemistry collateral majors. We are also using the microscopes in the Microbiology, Bacteriology, and Cell Physiology. The equipment will also be used in an Environmental Microbiology course being developed for Biology majors and the Environmental Science collateral and in a new course for non-majors called Life at the Extremes. The effort is motivated by recommendations of the American Society of Microbiology from which suggested approaches are adapted, as well as techniques culled from the scientific literature.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
