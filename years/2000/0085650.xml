<AbstractNarration>The United States' global positioning system (GPS), NAVSTAR, consists of a&lt;br/&gt;constellation of 24 satellites orbiting in high altitude. GPS receivers&lt;br/&gt;that can be placed in any type of vehicle, including automobiles, trucks,&lt;br/&gt;buses, airplanes, trains and ships, calculate their position on the earth&lt;br/&gt;based on their distance from four or more of these satellites. This ability&lt;br/&gt;to determine the location of vehicles in time has many useful applications&lt;br/&gt;in transportation including tracking vehicles on networks for navigation or&lt;br/&gt;travel surveys, as well as collecting and storing data about the networks&lt;br/&gt;of roads, waterways or even pipelines for facility inventories. Although&lt;br/&gt;development of a technique such as that proposed here to map GPS point data&lt;br/&gt;to linear network configurations has many applications, it is routing&lt;br/&gt;behavior and route choice as an improvement to traffic assignment models in&lt;br/&gt;urban planning that are specifically of interest to this researcher.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to develop a mathematical model to&lt;br/&gt;determine routes on networks from GPS point data in order to automate the&lt;br/&gt;route data collection process such that the recording of routes can become&lt;br/&gt;routine and widespread.  The data points collected by GPS receivers for the&lt;br/&gt;route of a vehicle travelling in a transportation system are recorded as&lt;br/&gt;single points in space.  Network segments such as roads, even though they&lt;br/&gt;have two dimensions including width, are represented as one dimensional&lt;br/&gt;lines in a GIS or other network database.  Even if there were not errors in&lt;br/&gt;both the GPS points and the network data it would be necessary for the GPS&lt;br/&gt;points to be translated to links in order to consider the route behavior or&lt;br/&gt;optimize it in the network system. Currently, errors that can not be&lt;br/&gt;completely eliminated in both the GPS collected points as well as the base&lt;br/&gt;linear networks make the process of matching the GPS data onto the network&lt;br/&gt;complicated.  In many cases, humans are needed to directly transform the&lt;br/&gt;GPS point data into a representation consisting of network line segments&lt;br/&gt;for analysis.  This is not practical on a large scale for full&lt;br/&gt;transportation networks where a large number of vehicles are being tracked.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project GPS point data for automobiles traveling on an urban road&lt;br/&gt;network will be collected (urban roads will be used because their close&lt;br/&gt;spacing as well as the interference from buildings challenges the&lt;br/&gt;methodology). Data will be collected during various weather conditions as&lt;br/&gt;well as at different times of the day when satellite configuration varies&lt;br/&gt;and affects measurement quality.   The known actual routes will be manually&lt;br/&gt;entered into the road network database and a mathematical model will be&lt;br/&gt;developed to transform the GPS points into complete routes in link by link&lt;br/&gt;network (line) nomenclature.  The model will make use of a minimum path&lt;br/&gt;algorithm and link impedances defined based on GPS point density, velocity&lt;br/&gt;and bearings. Goodness of fit measures that determine the extent of match&lt;br/&gt;between the actual and modeled routes will be used to evaluate alternative&lt;br/&gt;model specifications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is made under the Exploratory Research on Engineering the&lt;br/&gt;Transport Industries (ETI) program solicitation.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
