<AbstractNarration>Under the direction of Dr. Anthony Marks, Mr. John Williams will collect data for his doctoral dissertation. The goal of his work is to understand the lithic variability which exists in a prehistoric industry termed "Levantine Aurignacian." Archaeologists who work in the Near East have noted similarities among archaeological assemblages excavated in Israel and Jordan and which date between 32,000 and 17,000 years before the present. Some researchers point to specific tools fashioned from stone which are present in all assemblages and therefore have applied a single designation "Levantine Aurignacian" to all of these. However over the past two decades this industry has provided a source for lively debate because significant differences also have been noted and some scientists believe that this categorization serves more to obscure difference than emphasize meaningful similarity. Mr. Williams correctly notes that no single analytic system has been consistently applied to all such assemblages and with NSF support he will do so. He will visit museums in the United States, England and Israel which house carefully excavated material and obtain consistent comparable data. He will examine both tool types and the technology by which they were produced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Archaeologists have focused on the Aurignacian industry because it's European version marks the appearance of anatomically modern humans and a large suite of associated behavioral traits in this region. The origins and extent of the European Aurignacian is unclear as, likewise, is its relationship to its Levantine counterpart. Both areal variants share a set of distinctive lithic forms. For this reason the poorly described Levantine version is of great archaeological interest and Mr. Williams is taking a significant first step to better characterize this industry. Because it extends over a wide range of environments - from deserts to well watered regions - it may also be possible to correlate lithic and environmental variables and gain insight into patterns of prehistoric human adaptation. This research will provide data of interest to many archaeologists. It will also assist in training a promising young scientist.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
