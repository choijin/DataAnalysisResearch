<AbstractNarration>This award supports the travel, housing and registration costs of 15 students who would not otherwise be able to attend the 4th International Conference on Multiagent Systems (ICMAS-2000) in Boston, Massachusetts, July 7-12. This conference is the premier conference on agent technology and will have associated with it many tutorials, workshops and other events given by leading researchers in this field. One valuable part of student training is participation in the excitement of an international conference where major researchers present their work and engage one another in dialogue. The goal of this proposal is to enable students who are deserving but may not have the financial resources available to attend. A committee of senior ICMAS organizers has been formed to select students based on the following criteria: 1) those presenting papers; 2) those presenting posters; 3) those presenting in workshops or other associated conference forums; and 4) those whose research could benefit from attendance.</AbstractNarration>
