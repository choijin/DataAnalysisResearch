<AbstractNarration>Proposal: 0073085&lt;br/&gt;Title: Efficient Multicast Communication in Switch-Based Networks for Quality of Service&lt;br/&gt;PI: Yuanyuan Yang&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Multicast involves transmitting information from a source to multiple destinations, and is a requirement in high-performance networks. It is projected that multicast will be increasingly used to support various interactive applications such as video-on-demand, teleconferencing, web servers and E-commerce on the Internet. Many of these applications require not only multicast capability but also predictable performance, such as guaranteed multicast latency and bandwidth, called quality-of-service (QoS). The objective of this research is to design a QoS capable multicast architecture based on multicast networks with built-in QoS functions to support multicast communication. Specially, the research focuses on:&lt;br/&gt;(1) design of basic building-block multicast networks with better QoS functions and lower network cost;&lt;br/&gt;(2) establishing analytical models on performance metrics of statistical QoS-capable multicast architectures;&lt;br/&gt;(3) study of efficient schemes to schedule multicast for different QoS requirements;&lt;br/&gt;(4) building simulation tools for validating theoretical results, and making them available to research community and system designers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research combines algorithmic, probabilistic, combinatorial, and simulation techniques to conduct comprehensive studies. The proposed research has a significant impact on scalable and high-performance parallel/distributed computing as efficient support for multicast communication can significantly reduce the communication latency and simplify the design and implementation of numerous parallel/distributed applications.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
