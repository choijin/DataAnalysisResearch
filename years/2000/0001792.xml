<AbstractNarration>This is funding to subsidize travel and housing expenses of students attending the 6th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Design, to be held June 26-29, 2000, at WPI.  Design is an important research topic in engineering and architecture.  It is the key to economic competitiveness and the fundamental precursor to manufacturing.  However, our understanding of design as a process and our ability to model it are still very limited.  This conference series aims to provide an international forum for the presentation and discussion of state-of-the-art, cutting edge research and developments in artificial intelligence in design.  Held every two years, this conference is the premier one in the field, attracting about 150 participants from over 10 different countries.  The current funding will provide up to 50% travel support for student attendees, and will afford them an important opportunity to present their research, to hear about the latest results and research thrusts, and to interact with peers in the international, interdisciplinary AI-in-Design community.</AbstractNarration>
