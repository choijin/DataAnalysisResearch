<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal contains several open problems in Geometrical Functional Analysis. &lt;br/&gt;Furthermore it is intended to applyconcepts of Functional Analysis to solve&lt;br/&gt;questions in Financial Mathematics, in particularin the theory of option  &lt;br/&gt;pricing. A long standing open question in Operator Theory asks whether or&lt;br/&gt;not there exist Banach spaces on which every operator has an invariant subspace.   &lt;br/&gt;In order to solve this problem the author intends to use and to extend methods &lt;br/&gt;which led to the construction of spaces on which every operator is a singular &lt;br/&gt;perturbation of a multiple of the identity.  In recent years the notion of &lt;br/&gt;asymptotic properties of Banach spaces  and their connection to isomorphic &lt;br/&gt;properties gained increasing attention.  Such properties are  for example the &lt;br/&gt;recently introduced notion of uniform asymptotic convexity and &lt;br/&gt;uniform asymptotic smoothness. The author of this proposal intends&lt;br/&gt;to find sufficient and necessary isomorphic properties admitting&lt;br/&gt;uniform asymptotic convex and smooth renormings. In a joint work with R. Gardner &lt;br/&gt;and  A. Koldobsky the author applied concepts of Harmonic Analysis to find &lt;br/&gt;connections between certain extremal properties of convex bodies and higher &lt;br/&gt;derivatives of their section functions.  The author intends to explore this path &lt;br/&gt;further to get more inside on other extremal problems.  A central question in &lt;br/&gt;Finance is to find fair prices of options contingent to an underlying security. &lt;br/&gt;Many results in this area  rely on tools developed in Stochastic Calculus as &lt;br/&gt;well as Functional Analysis. The author intends to investigate the problem of &lt;br/&gt;robustness of option pricing, i.e. the continuous dependence of the option&lt;br/&gt;price on the underlying stock model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Banach spaces and their geometry are studied since they provide the natural &lt;br/&gt;framework for studying dynamical systems, differential equations, and,&lt;br/&gt;as discovered recently,  the pricing of financial assets. The proposed projects  &lt;br/&gt;deal with problems on the geometry of Banach spaces, operators between them, and &lt;br/&gt;applications to the mathematical understanding of finance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
