    <AbstractNarration>Results of more than sixty years of scientific investigation at the Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory have established the LTER site as a national and international center for forest ecosystem and hydrologic research. When combined with other research activities, more than 150 investigators are currently conducting studies at Coweeta. This tremendous site use by visiting investigators has greatly out-paced logistical support and there is a need to improve all aspects of Coweeta facilities. A comprehensive multi-phase facilities plan has been developed to meet current and future research, education, and training needs. The 2185-ha laboratory, located in the southern Appalachian Mountains of North Carolina, is USDA Forest Service property where cooperative research is jointly administrated by the Southern Research Station (SRS) and the University of Georgia (UGA). Within the past five years, the research program has substantially broadened to include regional analyses of causes and consequences of land-use change in the southern Appalachians as part of the LTER program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support implementation of Phase II of the Facilities Development Plan for Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory. Specifically, the sample cold room and drying oven space will be replaced and expanded. Current refrigerators and small drying ovens are outdated, malfunctioning, much smaller than what is needed, and expensive to operate and maintain. Completion of the development plans will provide the logistical support needed to sustain and build the science program of Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory.</AbstractNarration>
