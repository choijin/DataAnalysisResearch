    <AbstractNarration>Price&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Association of American State Geologists will continue a program to provide undergraduate students in geoscience with field-oriented research experiences. The objectives of the program are to train students in scientific field techniques (particularly geologic mapping) and to excite and encourage students to pursue careers in geoscience. This program will enable these students to work side by side with experienced geologic mappers, field geologists, and geophysicists in the field. The mentors serve as not only teachers and mentors but also as scientific collaborators. State geological surveys in all 50 states and Puerto Rico are eligible to hire students through this program. Most student projects run during summer months, but some include field activities during other parts of the year. The success of the program is assessed by interviewing students and their mentors and by tracking the students' careers. These compiled data are reported to the general geoscience community. Individual state surveys will select students from geoscience departments and summer field-camp programs nationwide and from the summer field-training program administered by the National Association of Geoscience Teachers. It is expected that most of the state field projects will be linked to funded research through the National Cooperative Geologic Mapping Program (in cooperation with the U.S. Geological Survey) or other federal, state, local government or private sector programs.</AbstractNarration>
