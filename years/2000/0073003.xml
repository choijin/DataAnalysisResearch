    <AbstractNarration>0073003&lt;br/&gt;Comfort&lt;br/&gt;The fundamental particles and interactions in nature are currently &lt;br/&gt;described by the Standard Model, with the sector of strong &lt;br/&gt;interactions described by QCD. The open and difficult challenge &lt;br/&gt;is to understand in detail how these theories describe the &lt;br/&gt;properties of matter. The empirical knowledge of the subnucleonic &lt;br/&gt;(quark and gluon) degrees of freedom in the structure of baryons and &lt;br/&gt;mesons and their interactions is essential for understanding the &lt;br/&gt;nature and dynamics of the fundamental nuclear interactions. &lt;br/&gt;A program in medium-energy nuclear physics is being planned &lt;br/&gt;that will bring new and important information for these issues. &lt;br/&gt;The properties of baryons can be explored by bringing pion &lt;br/&gt;and kaon beams onto proton targets. Critical tests of the &lt;br/&gt;Standard Model can also be made by studying specific decays &lt;br/&gt;of kaons. Because the experimental work will be carried out &lt;br/&gt;at large accelerator facilities in the U.S. and Europe, the &lt;br/&gt;planning activities will include travel to these facilities or &lt;br/&gt;other institutions for detailed discussions with collaborators, &lt;br/&gt;as well as computer simulations and calculations for the &lt;br/&gt;experiments that are anticipated.</AbstractNarration>
