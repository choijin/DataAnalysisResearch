<AbstractNarration>The Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports Professor Piotr Kaszynski, of the Department of Chemistry at Vanderbilt University, for his work on the synthesis of liquid crystalline radicals and the study of their molecular and bulk properties. Following the design and theoretical analysis of new heterocycles containing the thioaminyl fragment as a source of unpaired spin, Professor Kaszynski will carry out the synthesis of model compounds and develop general synthetic approaches to these materials. Calamitic and discotic mesogens based on these systems will then be prepared, leading to the synthesis of polymeric liquid crystalline radicals. The properties of mesogens will be explored both in the pure state and in binary mixtures by a variety of techniques, including thermal and optical characterization, phase miscibility studies, magnetic measurements, and photovoltaic measurements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Magnetic materials are at the heart of numerous technologies. Although such materials have historically been comprised of inorganic compounds, carbon-based (organic) magnetic materials have also been discovered and offer a variety of unique advantages. With the support of the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program, Professor Piotr Kaszynski, of the Department of Chemistry at Vanderbilt University, is carrying out the design and synthesis of a new class of organic magnetic materials. Through incorporation of these materials into polymeric and liquid crystalline compositions, Professor Kaszynski addresses fundamental questions regarding the nature of organic magnets and explores their potential for the preparation of new materials displaying important technological properties.</AbstractNarration>
