<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;This IMR award is for acquisition of an instrument that manipulates surface chemistry for new approaches to the growth of ultra-thin (~ one to tens of monolayers) layers. The instrument will be an UHV system equipped with dosers, supersonic nozzles, in situ probes, and a variable temperature substrate holder. The scope of the research includes both potential transition layers between substrate and epitaxial films, and ultra-thin layers between two epitaxial films. The instrument provides an important new capabilities for the Columbia University and will allow the Principal Investigator to conduct research on his DMR program DMR-99-03704, "Manipulation of Surface Reactions For Growth of Ultra-thin Films (1-20 ML)."  The research program attempts to apply recent advances in our understanding of detailed and fundamental semiconductor surface chemistry to the development of new approaches to the actual growth of ultrathin semiconductor and transition layers.  The materials chemistry studied will have implications both for conventional, molecular-based growth, and for fundamentally new approaches to growth.  The instrument will incorporate ultrahigh vacuum probes, both conventional and nonstandard, to interrogate the detailed surface chemistry, including, for example, the composition, bonding, and ordering of surface ligands and the reaction pathways of precursor molecules and surface species.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an instrument acquisition award to Columbia University. The new instrument will be used to perform in situ surface materials chemistry studies for ultrahigh vacuum growth of ultra-thin semiconductor layers.  The apparatus has two central goals: 1) collaborative research on new means for chemically forming ultra-thin interfacial layers and 2) graduate education on analytic tools for surface and materials study and for hands-on undergraduate training in experimental techniques.  Note that the proposed instrument is composed of both purchased and fabricated components and is thus a combination of the "acquisition" and "development" uses of the IMR Program.  The proposal provides an orderly plan for bringing this instrument on line and a tested plan for maintenance of this instrument. The instrument request includes 35% matching funds provided by Columbia University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
