    <AbstractNarration>Research is carried out at medium energy electron accelerators, in particular the MIT/Bates Linear Accelerator Center. The goal is to use the precision and versatility of the electron probe to study the structure of matter. The energy of the accelerator is such that we can 'see' matter at distances where phenomena are governed by the strong nuclear force. Experiments are carefully designed to gain insight into the structure and dynamics of nuclear matter. This is a contemporary field of research that uses recent technological advances in the production of electron beams and nuclear targets coupled with specially designed detection systems. At the Bates Center we conduct experiments with multiple magnetic spectrometers capable of making high precision measurements to advance the science. We are also leading the construction of a new detector, the Bates Large Acceptance Spectrometer Toroid (BLAST). which is expected to start data taking in 2002. Up to date information in the development of these projects can be found at &lt;http://mitbates.mit.edu&gt;. Our research program under this grant provides an excellent environment for the educational development of students and postdoctoral personnel.</AbstractNarration>
