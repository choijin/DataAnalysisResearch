<AbstractNarration>We propose to continue the University of Washington Physics Research Experiences for Undergraduates Program for an additional three years.  The program brings approximately 14 undergraduates to campus each summer to work with local faculty, postdocs, and students on forefront research projects.  The program is administered by a director and codirector who run two weekly meetings with the students, arrange and oversee the research assignments, and set up machine shop and other special instruction, as needed.  At the end of their 10 week visits, the students present seminars on their research activities and write papers summarizing their accomplishments.  The program is highly competitive, with about 20 applications per opening.  The program is administered jointly by the Institute for Nuclear Theory and the Department of Physics.  The students are housed together in a campus dorm.  Efforts are made to attract students from small colleges and women and minority students.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
