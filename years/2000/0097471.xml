<AbstractNarration>The Interdisciplinary Neuroscience Program at the University of Kentucky was&lt;br/&gt;established to provide a summer (10 week) research opportunity for highly&lt;br/&gt;qualified undergraduates from non-tier 1 institutions interested in&lt;br/&gt;attending graduate school.  The program seeks to; 1) provide an interactive&lt;br/&gt;environment where undergraduates are exposed to the many facets of a&lt;br/&gt;graduate career (teaching, learning, research), 2) inform interested&lt;br/&gt;undergraduates of the many possible careers available to them in the&lt;br/&gt;neurosciences, and 3) immerse students in a research project of their own&lt;br/&gt;choosing.  Faculty from a wide cross-section of the neurosciences, including&lt;br/&gt;molecular, behavioral and physiological, will offer their expertise to&lt;br/&gt;mentor students in their laboratories and participate in an intensive&lt;br/&gt;neuroscience short course.  Students will have many opportunities to&lt;br/&gt;interact both socially and professionally by attending a neuroscience&lt;br/&gt;symposia as well as numerous social events scheduled to enhance&lt;br/&gt;collegiality.  By the end of the summer, students who are generally&lt;br/&gt;otherwise unable to experience hands-on neuroscience research, will have&lt;br/&gt;completed their own project, presented it to a professional audience, taken&lt;br/&gt;an intensive neuroscience short course, gained a deeper understanding of the&lt;br/&gt;day-to-day work environment of the neuroscientist, been exposed to the&lt;br/&gt;multitude of career options open to a graduate, and in general become a more&lt;br/&gt;committed future graduate student.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
