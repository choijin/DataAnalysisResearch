    <AbstractNarration>The School District of Superior, Wisconsin will identify and appoint school and community mathematics and science professionals to an Advisory Planing Council to plan Superior Scientists, a comprehensive program targeted at girls in upper elementary, middle and high school, their parents, teachers, and guidance counselors. Over the course of a year the council will plan activities to increase the number of girls enrolling in high school math, science, and technology courses, and therefore, increase the number of women eligible to work in science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components identified as critical to the success of the project include (1) working with girls at elementary, middle, and high school; (2) developing community resources for internships; (3) developing a professional women's network for mentoring; (4) improving curriculum to raise the mathematics and science achievement of all students; and (5) introducing teaching methods that incorporate experiences that interest girls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An effective Advisory Planning Board and an application to the National Science Foundation's Program for Gender Equity for a Large Collaborative Project are primary outcomes set for this planning grant.</AbstractNarration>
