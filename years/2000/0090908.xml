<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;Filamentous fungi grow as a cellular syncytium where individual cells are&lt;br/&gt;interconnected by perforate crosswalls. Cell lysis in these systems triggers a rapid&lt;br/&gt;mechanism of septal pore sealing that is mediated by a dense-core vesicle known as the&lt;br/&gt;Woronin body. The Woronin body has been observed in over 50 species but its origin in&lt;br/&gt;the peroxisome and function associated with the cellular response to cell lysis have only&lt;br/&gt;recently been defined at the molecular level (Jedd and Chua, 2000). In the model system&lt;br/&gt;Neurospora crassa, the Woronin-body core is comprised of Hex1, a protein that is both&lt;br/&gt;necessary and sufficient for Woronin-body core formation. Deletion of the HEX1 gene&lt;br/&gt;eliminates the Woronin body from the cytoplasm and produces hyphae that bleed&lt;br/&gt;cytoplasm following cell lysis. Thus, Hex1 defines a novel peroxisomal vesicle that&lt;br/&gt;functions in the cellular response to cell lysis.&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this research is to understand basic mechanisms of Woronin body&lt;br/&gt;biogenesis and function. As part of this effort, the following specific aims will be&lt;br/&gt;addressed. i) Woronin-body associated proteins will be identified. The Woronin body&lt;br/&gt;will be biochemically purified and associated proteins identified by amino acid&lt;br/&gt;sequencing. Corresponding genes will then be cloned and analyzed to assess their role in&lt;br/&gt;the biogenesis and function of the Woronin body using genetic, biochemical and cell&lt;br/&gt;biological techniques. ii) The conservation of Woronin body structure and function will&lt;br/&gt;be determined by analyzing HEX1 and recently identified HEX1 alternative-splicing&lt;br/&gt;variants in several model ascomycetes using genetic and cell biological techniques. iii) A&lt;br/&gt;mechanism of Woronin body formation will be determined by analyzing the phenotype of&lt;br/&gt;Woronin-body-associated protein deletion strains and by reconstituting Woronin body&lt;br/&gt;formation in yeast cells using heterologous expression of Hex1 and protein interactants. In&lt;br/&gt;addition, the crystal structure of Hex1 will be determined and used to identify amino acid&lt;br/&gt;residues that mediate Hex1 self-assembly. Mutations in these residues will then be used to&lt;br/&gt;determine how Hex1 self-assembly influences Woronin body biogenesis. iv) The&lt;br/&gt;importance of the Woronin body for the pathogenicity of disease-causing fungi will be&lt;br/&gt;determined by deleting HEX1 from the genome of the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe&lt;br/&gt;grisea. The deletion strain will then be examined with respect to infection-related&lt;br/&gt;morphogenesis and host colonization.&lt;br/&gt;Results from this study will enhance our understanding of basic mechanisms&lt;br/&gt;governing vesicle formation and define a previously unrecognized pathway for protein&lt;br/&gt;sorting in the peroxisome. In addition, the possibility that the Woronin body functions as&lt;br/&gt;a pathogenicity factor in disease-causing fungi may define new strategies for combating&lt;br/&gt;fungal pathogens in both plants and humans.</AbstractNarration>
