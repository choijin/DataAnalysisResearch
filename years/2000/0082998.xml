<AbstractNarration>      The researchers propose an integrated approach to energy efficient collaborative communication in ad-hoc wireless networks. The interdisciplinary approach will address simultaneously all key levels of system design: data link layer power management, network layer energy, location, and quality of service-based routing, and application layer interfaces.&lt;br/&gt;     The objective is to reduce communication power consumption while simultaneously increasing the communication quality between the collaborators. The model problem assumes that people are interacting via ad-hoc networking integrated into pocket computers for some common task. For the communication to be successfull, all participants must be reachable via the network and have sufficient energy to perform any necessary computation. At the heart of the problem is the distributed scheduling of communication between entities to reduce communication and computation energy. Participants must have an estimate of the remaining energy available by other participants as well as models of the communication topology. Decisions must be made whether to route traffic through adjacent nodes (reducing direct power expenditure while possibly increasing latency or global energy consumption) or increasing transmitter power (potentially reaching a broader set of participants). This objective will be reached by developing design methodologies in the following research areas:&lt;br/&gt;     Link-layer controllers that adaptively learn low-power strategies for error correction &lt;br/&gt;codes, transmission power levels, and radio activity times for reduced overall power consumption, within the constraints of delay and error bounds.&lt;br/&gt;     Network-layer controllers that use inter-node attenuation, available node energy, and current traffic flows to optimize routing so as to maximize the availability of all nodes.&lt;br/&gt;     Network interfaces that allow the programmer to describe delivery constraints on messages such that communication schedules can reduce energy in a changing routing topology.&lt;br/&gt;     System level power modeling that allows the application layer to trade additional processor power to reduce networking power.&lt;br/&gt;     The project is targeted to the emerging spectrum of highly capable pocket or wearable computers and the ad-hoc networks formed by those computers. The researchers will both deploy an experimental infrastructure and use in-depth simulation models to evaluate our system. The prototype system will use a combination of laptop computers using 802.11 wireless networking and the advanced "Itsy" palm-top computer with lower bandwidth (and significantly lower power) interfaces. The simulation models will use realistic whole-system power models for advanced pocket computers coupled with a standard network simulator that we have enhanced with more realistic RF propagation models.&lt;br/&gt;     This project is significant because it address a communication model that will be common with future generation computation and communication devices. It is realistic because it will use an experimental network. It is general because we will be able to use the simulation framework to model future compute and communication networks. Finally, it is achievable because it leverages the on-going work in optimizing channel assignment in wireless networks and energy efficient computing.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
