<AbstractNarration>0083328&lt;br/&gt;Roesner&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is well known that urbanization results in severe degradation of urban streams, particularly headwater streams.  Various scientific and engineering groups are studying the problem, but there remains to be an organized project with sufficient funding to combine the talents of scientists from various disciplines (such as biology geomorphology, and sociology), with engineering specialists in ecologic hydraulics and urban drainage to develop an approach to urban stormwater management that will result in ecologically sustainable streams and lakes in the urban environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Incubation Activity proposes to combine the talents of scientists and engineers at Colorado State University, in partnership with two rapidly growing cities in the front range of the Colorado Rocky Mountains, to lay the groundwork for a larger project, which is to develop and test a "Sustainable Urban Stream and Reservoir Model" that can be used to design urban drainage systems that will result in ecologically sustainable urban water resources for cities in the arid west.  The algorithm should be transferable to eastern climates, which have more precipitation, and more evenly distributed seasonal precipitation.  As currently envisioned, the model to be developed will combine 1) An urban runoff model; 2) An urban stream geomorphologic model; and 3) A water quality/ecologic model for streams and lakes into a single model or linked models that can be used by scientists, engineers and planners to assess the ecologic impact of proposed urban development, and/or aid in the design of urban stormwater drainage facilities to prevent ecologic degradation.  In the arid west, we believe that we can actually ecologically enhance existing natural streams because of the increase in stream baseflow that generally accompanies urbanization of a watershed.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
