    <AbstractNarration>Abstract :&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ANALYTICAL FOUNDATIONS OF THE GEOMETRIC FUNCTION THEORY;&lt;br/&gt;VARIATIONAL INTEGRALS AND NONLINEAR ELASTICITY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tadeusz Iwaniec&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the major recent advances in the higher dimensional geometric&lt;br/&gt;function theory is based on finding new differential equations analogous&lt;br/&gt;to the Cauchy-Riemann system in the complex plane. Hodge theory of&lt;br/&gt;differential forms has come to play a central role in this rather modern&lt;br/&gt;approach. The Jacobian determinants and the wedge products of the exact&lt;br/&gt;differential forms are subjected to a great deal of investigation, as they&lt;br/&gt;provide the means of achieving continuity, compactness, or normal family&lt;br/&gt;type results. It is important to realize that the higher integrability&lt;br/&gt;properties of the Jacobians can only be observed for mapping in the&lt;br/&gt;Orlicz-Sobolev classes. More recent developments have emphasized the&lt;br/&gt;connection between quasiconformal mappings and the theory of nonlinear&lt;br/&gt;elasticity already formulated by S.S. Antman and J. Ball in 1976-77. This&lt;br/&gt;connection is an important aspect of the proposal. And that is why we&lt;br/&gt;depart from the usual quasiconformal theory quite far towards mappings&lt;br/&gt;(deformations of elastic bodies) with unbounded distortion. However, some&lt;br/&gt;control, such as BMO-bounds, of the distortion tensor will be necessary to&lt;br/&gt;achieve concreate results. The governing equations for mappings of finite&lt;br/&gt;distortion are non-linear first order systems of PDEs. There are also&lt;br/&gt;related second order systems which arrise naturally as the Euler- Lagrange&lt;br/&gt;equations of the associated variational integrals (stored energy of the&lt;br/&gt;deformation). An analogy between the analytic aspects of the holomorphic&lt;br/&gt;functions and mappings of finite distortion is particularly pronounced in&lt;br/&gt;even dimensions. A fruitful idea when studying these mappings is to view&lt;br/&gt;them as conformal with respect to certain measurable metric or conformal&lt;br/&gt;structures. Many of these notions extend to Riemannian manifolds, and&lt;br/&gt;accordingly, while we do not develop this aspect in full all the machinery&lt;br/&gt;we set up is ready and willing for these generalizations.&lt;br/&gt; The reader interested in developments along these lines and a&lt;br/&gt;comprehensive account of the geometric function theory is warmly referred&lt;br/&gt;to the forthcoming monograph of G. Martin and PI.</AbstractNarration>
