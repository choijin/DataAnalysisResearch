    <AbstractNarration>This is a grant to support a workshop on Algorithmic Issues in Modeling Motion to be held at Duke during August 2000.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Representations of motion are central to all computational disciplines dealing with modeling the physical world. This grant will support a direction-setting workshop on algorithmic issues in modeling motion. About 20 research leaders from a variety of fields, such as computational geometry, computer graphics, robotics, spatial databases, molecular dynamics, and computer vision will participate. Currently, each of these fields has its own methods for handling moving objects. By bringing together these experts in different areas, unified approaches and new techniques for representing, processing, reasoning, analyzing, searching, and visualizing moving objects will be developed. The workshop will produce a final report.</AbstractNarration>
