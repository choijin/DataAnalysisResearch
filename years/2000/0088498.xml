<AbstractNarration>Ten Brummelaar&lt;br/&gt;0088498&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The AEOS system with its operational adaptive optics system will observe a large (186) sample of spectral type O and B stars in the I spectral band to detect and characterize multiple stars.  The high spatial resolution obtainable with the adaptive optics will enable the measurement of magnitude differences as high as 8 in order to investigate the mass ratio between the stars within a binary star pair.  With a B0 spectral type primary, the detection of an early M star companion is predicted.  Orbit determination using double-lined spectroscopic binary information from other telescopes and the estimate of the spectral types from the photometric measurements made with AEOS will enable an estimate of mass.  These studies are important to our understanding of the formation of planetary systems, and recycling and processing of gas and dust within galaxies.&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>
