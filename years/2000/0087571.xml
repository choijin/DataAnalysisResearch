<AbstractNarration>"Family Science:  Expanding Community Support for Inquiry-based Science" is the University of Washington's innovative five-year plan for reaching youth and families in the Seattle school district.  This program represents an enhancement of the NSF-funded Family Science program targeting grades K-5 and expansion of this successful program to include middle and high school students.  The proposed activities, Science Explorations, Inquiry Science Conferences and Community Celebrations, are designed to help parents understand inquiry-based science instruction while heightening students' confidence in their ability to understand science processes.  The hands-on activities also support and complement Seattle's Local Systemic Change project by enlisting teachers, parents and community members to champion science education outside of the formal school setting.  The implementation strategy includes workshops to train Family Science Lead Teachers and Parent/Community Leaders to coordinate Family Science programs.   Subsequent partnerships between teachers and community organizations are designed to establish regional clusters of community networks to support programmatic activities during and beyond the funding period.  It is estimated that Family Science will result in the presentation of nearly 300 school and community-based events impacting 10,000 individuals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
