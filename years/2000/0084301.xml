<AbstractNarration>This project will focus on how interface dynamics is different on the liquid/liquid interface, namely on the oil/water interface (O/W), contrasted to the gas/liquid interface, with amphiphilic polymers that have strong propensity to reside at O/W interface.  Secondly, expanding on the exploration of interface dynamics to solid surfaces, this research will study in detail surface-group migration in hydrocarbon polymers following plasma treatment.  This arises from studies of plasma-induced etching reactions on hydrocarbon polymers; the issue is closely associated to an important application problem of why the surface printability of hydrocarbon polymer films diminishes with time upon glow-discharge treatment.  Thirdly, porous polymeric beads will be fabricated that have very large specific surface areas and are made to function as biomembrane mimetic surfaces.  This is connected to an exploratory effort to design biosurfaces that can act as enzymatic catalysts.&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;The significance of the first part of this project is to develop ways to synthesize better surfactants that should work as better oil-spill containment materials.  The second part addresses the ways to improve on the printing and painting on plastic sheets and films.  The third part deals with new and inexpensive ways of screening potential drugs by use of biological catalysts mad viable on plastic beads and nanoparticles.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
