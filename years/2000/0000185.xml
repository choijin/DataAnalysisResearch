<AbstractNarration>This award, provided by the Office of Polar Programs, allows a US investigator to join an Italian Antarctic Program geological field team in northern Victoria Land, Antarctica, in order to study volcanic and intrusive magmatic rocks that are believed to be important to detailed understanding of the initial phase of breakup of the Gondwanaland supercontinent. Mesozoic break-up of Gondwanaland was marked by a major magmatic event during which voluminous basaltic magmas were both erupted at the surface and emplaced as intrusive sills and dikes at depth within the Permian and Triassic sedimentary sequence of the Transantarctic Mountains. The volcanic rocks were erupted at the surface mainly as quiescent flood basalt lava flows but also explosively, as a result of subsurface magma/water interaction. In contrast to southern Africa, the basaltic magmatism in Antarctica was preceded by an episode of explosive silica-rich eruptions. These silicic rocks are recorded throughout the Transantarctic Mountains. The silicic eruptions were associated with crustal extension and the formation of a rift zone, which then controlled the transport and dispersal of the basaltic magmas associated with supercontinent break-up. The rift zone is documented in the Beardmore Glacier region, but in Victoria Land the current evidence is equivocal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In north Victoria Land no complete stratigraphic section is known that encompasses the Triassic strata and overlying volcanic units. There are isolated occurrences of sedimentary rocks with silicic volcanic debris but their stratigraphic relations are unclear; silicic debris is also incorporated in the basaltic pyroclastic rocks but its source is unknown. The accumulation of basaltic extrusive rocks in a rift has been inferred but without evidence for contemporaneous faulting. In the adjacent Deep Freeze Range, which is postulated to be part of the Jurassic rift shoulder, there is a continuous section from the basement rocks to the flood basalts, thus spanning the interval in which silicic magmatism should be recorded. Rocks reported in this interval include sedimentary strata variously regarded as Triassic or Middle Jurassic, basaltic pyroclastic rocks, and Middle Jurassic quartzose sandstones and basaltic lavas. The Deep Freeze Range offers an opportunity to resolve questions about silicic volcanism and tectonic setting during Jurassic evolution of north Victoria Land and to test the hypothesis that Early Jurassic rifting and associated silicic volcanism preceded basaltic magmatism and controlled the transport and emplacement of Gondwanaland break-up magmas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this study are expected to have implications for understanding the tectonic setting of the silicic and basaltic magmatism that marks the initial stages of break-up in Antarctica. The paleovolcanologic and tectonic setting of north Victoria Land will be developed. In addition, results are anticipated to address the point source and long-distance transport model versus the local derivation model for Ferrar magmas. Understanding of Gondwanaland break-up processes will be advanced by results of this study.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
