<AbstractNarration>0075070 &lt;br/&gt;Todorovska&lt;br/&gt;Since first introduced in mid 1980s wavelet analysis has been widely applied in many fields of science and engineering.  The wavelet transform is particularly suitable for analysis of transient signals and time varying systems, because it is localized both in time and frequency.  Its widespread use is also due to the existence of orthogonal and bi-orthogonal bases, the efficiency in representation of transient signals (data compression), and the availability of fast and accurate computational algorithms for signal/image transformation and reconstruction.  In spite of its obvious suitability to earthquake related problems (transient by nature), the wavelet analysis has been applied very little in Earthquake Engineering and Engineering Seismology.  The objective of this project is to explore various applications of wavelets to these two fields.  The focus of the study will be on identification of nonlinear soil-structure systems from strong and weak motion records in structures in presence of noise, and on representation and analysis of strong ground motion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research enhancement grant, made under the Professional Opportunities for Women in Research and Education (POWRE) program, will provide an opportunity for the Principal Investigator to initiate independent research on the application of wavelets (and modern signal processing and estimation theory, in general) to her professional field, and will create opportunities for future funding from regular NSF and other sources. This is expected to increase her chances for getting a regular tenure track faculty appointment. The Principal Investigator is a mid career researcher, with interdisciplinary education (in Physics, Civil Engineering, Applied Mathematics and Electrical Engineering), career based in Earthquake Engineering and Engineering Seismology, and with a non-tenure track faculty appointment at the University of Southern California.  This grant will also provide an opportunity for her continuing presence and visibility at her home institution, where she has been the only female faculty in the Civil Engineering Department. This project will involve cooperation across two engineering disciplines (the Principal Investigator will cooperate on this project with faculty from the Electrical Engineering Department of her home institution), and participation of one graduate student (with Civil Engineering background).  Finally, this project will lead to the introduction of new methodologies for understanding and modeling earthquake strong ground motion and response of structures, and consequently will contribute to the national effort for Earthquake Risk Reduction.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
