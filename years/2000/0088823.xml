<AbstractNarration>Biological Sciences (61); Engineering (59)&lt;br/&gt;Academic and commercial research teams are rapidly approaching a new generation of devices that will interact with, incorporate, and/or emulate living nervous systems. Neural prostheses to restore sight, hearing, or mobility will offer a wider range of function; robotic devices will become more effective with neuromorphic control systems. Neural Engineering is the intellectual force behind these developments, supported by recent advances in cellular neurobiology, microfabrication and neural modeling. Student training in this evolving area must emphasize the cellular and molecular interfaces between biological and artificial systems. With a growing industrial investment in Neural Engineering technologies, and the increasing number of Neural Engineering research centers and graduate programs emerging across the country, it is both appropriate and advantageous to now train undergraduate students in this area. Training in Neural Engineering at the undergraduate level has been slow to develop, impeded by the compartmentalization of the requisite skills in traditionally separate curricula (Neuroscience and Engineering). The UIC Departments of Bioengineering and Biological Sciences have addressed this problem in a two-year cross-college effort to establish one of the first undergraduate Neural Engineering programs in the country. In consultation with advisory committees, we have organized a Neural Engineering curriculum which culminates in a new capstone course [BioE/BioS 475]. This course was taught by the PI/CoPI as a pilot in Spring 2000 with a minimal laboratory component. We are now adapting engineered neural systems and measurement techniques from contemporary research efforts for use in this undergraduate learning environment. This will provide hands-on experience and technical training exemplary of current trends in Neural Engineering. Specifically, we are developing two new learning modules exemplary of current issues in neural engineering. The course objective is to emphasize application-driven design of neural systems. Concordantly, the themes for each module are being adapted from faculty research involving: a) Neurons cultured on a microelectrode array, demonstrating fabrication and principles of biosensors and implantable neuroprosthetics, and b) Neural circuits patterned on an inorganic substrate, illustrating progress toward neuromorphic devices for biocomputation and complex hybrid prostheses. An important goal is to enable students to make cellular-level measurements from these engineered neural systems. We expect that 1/3 of bioengineering students and an equal number of biology students will follow the Neural Engineering course track, with approximately 40 students taking the capstone course during the initial grant period. Evaluation of pedagogy and attainment of course goals are being undertaken by the UIC Survey Research Laboratory. All of the training innovations initiated by this grant will become a permanent part of our curriculum, will be disseminated to other universities, and will be used to enhance training of secondary level science teachers through collaboration with the UIC Institute for Math and Science Education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
