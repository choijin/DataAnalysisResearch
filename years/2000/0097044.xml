<AbstractNarration>0097044&lt;br/&gt;Douglas &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description:  This award supports US-India Cooperative Research: Geometric Invariants for Quotient Modules.  US PI Ronald Douglas, Texas A&amp;M University and Gadadhar Misra, Indian Statistical Institute, Bangalore will study geometric invariants of Hilbert modules over function algebras.  The project will lead to a better understanding of multivariate operator theory and the cross-fertilization of operator theory with Hermitian algebraic geometry.  It is a fundamental problem that has as its objective the classifying of quotient Hilbert modules via geometric invariants.  Progress toward the goal of finding complete unitary invariants and deepening the connection between multivariable operator theory and complex geometry would be a significant advance. &lt;br/&gt;Scope: Douglas and Misra are distinguished mathematicians with established research  records.  Douglas is a world leader in the interaction between operator theory and several fields of mathematics; Misra is a Fellow of the Indian Academy of Sciences.  They have worked successfully in the past and have sustained much of their research through electronic contact.  They are now at a stage where direct contact is needed to proceed with their groundbreaking work.  Both investigators lead groups that will be strengthened through this collaboration, which also includes support for an exchange of young scientists.  This award is jointly supported by the Division of International Programs and the Division of Mathematical Sciences.     &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
