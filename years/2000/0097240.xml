<AbstractNarration>This research involves the mitigation of  multipath interferences&lt;br/&gt;in a frequency-selective fading channel. As broadband digital wireless&lt;br/&gt;communications is more demanded than ever, such as wireless image/video&lt;br/&gt;web browsing and wireless data transmission, the technical challenges&lt;br/&gt;are exponentially increasing. One of such challenges is that, when the&lt;br/&gt;bandwidth of a channel becomes wider, there are more severe multipaths&lt;br/&gt;in a wireless system. This implies that the multipath interference&lt;br/&gt;mitigation becomes more important than ever.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Modulated coding (MC), a convolutional coding defined on the complex&lt;br/&gt;field, has been recently proposed by the PI to optimally mitigate&lt;br/&gt;intersymbol interferences (ISI) when the ISI channel is known at both&lt;br/&gt;the transmitter and the receiver. The advantage of MC is that, since&lt;br/&gt;the arithmetic operations of both MC and ISI are over the complex field,&lt;br/&gt;they can be naturally combined together, which provides the convenience&lt;br/&gt;of the optimal MC study for a given ISI channel. Since the encoding&lt;br/&gt;simplicity of the MC, it is also convenient for further adding a&lt;br/&gt;conventional error correction coding (ECC) before the MC. It has been&lt;br/&gt;shown that the combined MC and turbo coding of an ISI channel may&lt;br/&gt;outperform the AWGN channel capacity at low SNR. As an example, for the&lt;br/&gt;two tap ISI channel [0.7071,0.7071], the bit error rate is 0.00001 at the&lt;br/&gt;code rate 1/4 and the SNR E_b/N_0=-1.15 dB, which is above the AWGN&lt;br/&gt;channel capacity. The disadvantage of the previous MC study is that the&lt;br/&gt;transmitter needs to know the ISI channel, which although may be possible&lt;br/&gt;for some applications, such as storage channels and  wireline channels,&lt;br/&gt;may not be practical for some other applications, such as wireless&lt;br/&gt;channels. The aim of this proposal is to optimally design and update MC&lt;br/&gt;without the full knowledge of the ISI/multipath channel at the&lt;br/&gt;transmitter with applications, in particular, in wireless communication&lt;br/&gt;systems. Due to the simple structure of MC, the MC update at the&lt;br/&gt;transmitter is possible, which is unlike the existing coding schemes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
