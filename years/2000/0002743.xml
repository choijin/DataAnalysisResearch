<AbstractNarration>0002743 &lt;br/&gt;Grove &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant provides two-years partial salary support for the research scientist responsible for the MIT Electron Microprobe Facility.  This is a Phase II technician support grant under the Instrumentation and Facilities (IF) Program and follows three years of Phase I support (EAR-9711826). During the first three years of support from NSF-EAR Instrumentation and Facilities we achieved significant progress in upgrading the facility, developing outreach and training programs for our users and securing the financial stability of the facility.  The instrumentation is now near state-of-the-art largely due to the efforts of Dr. Nilanjan Chatterjee, our technical research specialist.  Stimulated by the support of the NSF technician program, we have effectively made Dr. Chatterjee's position a permanent one.  Should it be necessary, we have identified the funding necessary to support Dr. Chatterjee for a two-year period beyond funding made through this grant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical support for this lab facilitates research in a broad array of geoscientific investigations including: studies of hydrous phases in quenched high-pressure experimental run products to better understand the processes of melt generation with  subduction zones; geochronologic investigations of orogenic processes; trace element investigations of hot spot volcanics aimed at understanding the physical and chemical evolution of the Earth's mantle and core; and studies of the micro-mechanical properties of rocks which control the movement of fluids deep within the earth.  In addition, the MIT microprobe facility supports a large number of student users enrolled in the MIT-WHOI joint Ph.D. program as well as students and faculty from the Departments of Materials Sciences, Chemical Engineering, Chemistry and Archaeology.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
