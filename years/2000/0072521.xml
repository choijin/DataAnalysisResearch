<AbstractNarration>Balmforth&lt;br/&gt;0072521&lt;br/&gt;     Lava domes are a common geological formation, and their&lt;br/&gt;geometry sets them apart as one of the more simple types of lava&lt;br/&gt;flow.  Moreover, domes often have a relatively low aspect ratio&lt;br/&gt;and evolve slowly.  These observations can be used as ingredients&lt;br/&gt;in building simple mathematical models of expanding and cooling&lt;br/&gt;fluid domes; this proposal surrounds the development of such&lt;br/&gt;models.  In particular, lava is considered as a solidifying,&lt;br/&gt;non-Newtonian fluid with strongly temperature-dependent material&lt;br/&gt;qualities and an intrinsic yield stress.  The wide array of&lt;br/&gt;physical ingredients to the problem make the mathematical&lt;br/&gt;modelling especially challenging.  The project exploits the simple&lt;br/&gt;geometry, slow evolution and low aspect ratio of the dome to&lt;br/&gt;asymptotically reduce the governing equations to a simpler form.&lt;br/&gt;The reduction furnishes "shallow-lava equations," in much the&lt;br/&gt;same way that the "shallow-ice equations" are derived and&lt;br/&gt;extensively used to model ice sheets and glaciers.  Differences&lt;br/&gt;arise because of the viscoplastic nature of silicic lava, and&lt;br/&gt;because solidification creates a solid crust overlying the dome&lt;br/&gt;that can contribute significantly to the balance of forces,&lt;br/&gt;especially at the disk's edge.  The mathematical approach are&lt;br/&gt;complemented with an experimental one in which laboratory fluids&lt;br/&gt;are used as analogue models of the lava.  Both approaches are used&lt;br/&gt;to explore the structure and evolution of the dome, partly with&lt;br/&gt;the aim of learning more about how lava behaves as a fluid.  For&lt;br/&gt;example, some domes lose axisymmetry in what might be an&lt;br/&gt;intrinsic morphological instability; this pattern formation&lt;br/&gt;process is explored in that light.&lt;br/&gt;     Lava domes occur in many geological settings both on Earth&lt;br/&gt;and on many other planets and moons of the solar system.  These&lt;br/&gt;structures form when crystal-rich silicic magma is pushed up&lt;br/&gt;through vents onto roughly horizontal surfaces, and often occur&lt;br/&gt;inside the craters created by volcanic eruptions.  The shape of a&lt;br/&gt;lava dome is especially simple in comparison to most other lava&lt;br/&gt;flows.  Hence, a first step in understanding lava flows in general&lt;br/&gt;is to explore those domes.  Moreover, despite their slow growth,&lt;br/&gt;domes are natural hazards because they can be the setting of&lt;br/&gt;violent and dangerous events: domes can rupture and release&lt;br/&gt;confined gas in a pyroclastic outflow (an extremely hot and&lt;br/&gt;fast-moving current of air and ash), or collapse at their&lt;br/&gt;peripheries to create landslides and debris flows.  The proposal&lt;br/&gt;outlines a mathematical and experimental approach to the&lt;br/&gt;modelling of lava domes.  The purpose is to build models of the&lt;br/&gt;dome's structure and evolution, and compare these models with the&lt;br/&gt;real geological structures.  By modelling the domes in this way,&lt;br/&gt;more will be learned about how lava flows, and ultimately this&lt;br/&gt;may provide insight into the hazards associated with them.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
