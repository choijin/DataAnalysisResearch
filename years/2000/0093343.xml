<AbstractNarration>The long-term goal of my integrated research and educational&lt;br/&gt;plan is to develop interactive virtual environment sys-tems&lt;br/&gt;supporting realistic aural/visual simulation of large 3D&lt;br/&gt;models containing multiple interacting users.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research Plan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main objective of the proposed research project is to&lt;br/&gt;develop efficient algorithms for simulating the propagation&lt;br/&gt;of light and sound waves through a virtual environment by&lt;br/&gt;scattering at surfaces of a 3D model. This research problem&lt;br/&gt;is central to providing a realistic experience in an&lt;br/&gt;immersive virtual environment, as its solution enables&lt;br/&gt;global illumination and sound spatialization. It is also&lt;br/&gt;significant for several other applications, including motion&lt;br/&gt;planning, inverse modeling, scene capture, heat transfer,&lt;br/&gt;radio power prediction, fire propagation, and traffic&lt;br/&gt;analysis, which are all important in fields beyond immersive&lt;br/&gt;virtual environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For simulations of both lighting and acoustics, the&lt;br/&gt;fundamental problem is to compute a solution to an integral&lt;br/&gt;equation expressing the wave field at every point in terms&lt;br/&gt;of the wave field on surrounding surfaces. The main&lt;br/&gt;difficulty is that the wave field has discontinuities due to&lt;br/&gt;occlusions, caustics, and specular highlights, which induce&lt;br/&gt;large variations over small portions of the integration&lt;br/&gt;domain (i.e. surfaces or directions). Previous integration&lt;br/&gt;methods based on radiosity and Monte Carlo path tracing are&lt;br/&gt;generally not practical for typical virtual environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I plan to investigate a hybrid beam tracing and path tracing&lt;br/&gt;approach. The general strategy is to trace beams that&lt;br/&gt;partition the space of rays into topologically distinct&lt;br/&gt;bundles corresponding to different sequences of scattering&lt;br/&gt;events at surfaces of the 3D scene (reverberation&lt;br/&gt;sequences), and then use them to guide sampling in an&lt;br/&gt;interactive path tracing algorithm. The motivation for this&lt;br/&gt;approach is that attributes of a relatively small number of&lt;br/&gt;beams traced during the first phase can provide useful&lt;br/&gt;information about the wave field that can be used to guide&lt;br/&gt;and accelerate evaluation of samples during the second&lt;br/&gt;phase. This approach enables efficient methods for: 1)&lt;br/&gt;enumeration of reverberation sequences, 2) decomposition of&lt;br/&gt;integration domain, 3) conservative approximation, 4)&lt;br/&gt;spatial coherence in ray intersections, 5) sampling of&lt;br/&gt;reverberation sequences, 6) progressive refinement, and 7)&lt;br/&gt;off-line precomputation. The challenge is to develop methods&lt;br/&gt;that trace beams through 3D models quickly and reap the&lt;br/&gt;benefits of the traced beams in useful applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My research plan is to investigate hybrid beam tracing and&lt;br/&gt;path tracing approaches to solve classical problems for&lt;br/&gt;virtual environments. The new research contributions will be&lt;br/&gt;made at four levels: theory, algorithms, applications, and&lt;br/&gt;experiments. First, I plan to investigate new theory for&lt;br/&gt;modeling wave propagation as a discrete set of reverber-&lt;br/&gt;ation paths incorporating multiple scattering effects&lt;br/&gt;including diffractions. Second, I plan to develop new&lt;br/&gt;algorithms that efficiently find significant reverberation&lt;br/&gt;paths with general types of scattering in general 3D models.&lt;br/&gt;Third, I plan to investigate new applications where the&lt;br/&gt;proposed approach for computing reverberation paths can be&lt;br/&gt;used to solve classical problems. Finally, I plan to perform&lt;br/&gt;experiments to evaluate the results of computed simulations&lt;br/&gt;both quantitatively and qualitatively in comparison to&lt;br/&gt;measured wave fields. The overall outcome of this research&lt;br/&gt;will be a computational framework and a suite of methods for&lt;br/&gt;computing general reverberation paths in general 3D models&lt;br/&gt;and evaluating them in interactive applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Throughout this project, I plan to investigate the synergies&lt;br/&gt;between sound and light and to apply the lessons learned&lt;br/&gt;from one wave phenomenon to the other. Based on historical&lt;br/&gt;precedent, I believe that it will be possible to develop&lt;br/&gt;better simulations of virtual environments by studying both&lt;br/&gt;sound and light together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Educational Plan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of my educational plan are to teach students&lt;br/&gt;and to develop new methods for education. In particular, one&lt;br/&gt;special goal of mine is to enable the use of interactive&lt;br/&gt;virtual environment systems in the educational process. I&lt;br/&gt;plan to investigate this novel media for education by&lt;br/&gt;designing new interdisciplinary courses that will allow&lt;br/&gt;students and teachers from widely varying backgrounds to&lt;br/&gt;learn about and experiment with virtual environment systems.&lt;br/&gt;I also plan to develop new educational materials (textbook,&lt;br/&gt;course notes, software tools, and 3D models), to mentor&lt;br/&gt;students (graduate, undergraduate, and K-12), and to develop&lt;br/&gt;outreach programs for disadvantaged people (mentoring under-&lt;br/&gt;privileged students and deploying handicap-assisting&lt;br/&gt;applications).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By both developing interactive virtual environment systems&lt;br/&gt;for research, and investigating their use for teaching, my&lt;br/&gt;research and educational activities are uniquely integrated.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
