<AbstractNarration>Abstract for NSF proposal&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Low Dimensional Manifolds and Computation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project concerns problems in low-dimensional topology and geometry, &lt;br/&gt;with an emphasis on computational aspects. Manifolds in two and three &lt;br/&gt;dimensions provide the geometric models for many physical phenomena. &lt;br/&gt;Computational issues are playing an increasing role in mathematical &lt;br/&gt;investigations in these areas. Research in low-dimensional manifolds &lt;br/&gt;in turn is making contributions to computational geometry and topology. It also&lt;br/&gt;impacts computational complexity theory, which studies questions &lt;br/&gt;such as how long it takes a computer to solve a problem. Techniques of &lt;br/&gt;computational topology have already led to  improvements in algorithms&lt;br/&gt;in computer graphics,  visualization, medical and molecular modeling &lt;br/&gt;and image recognition.  Several problems on the theme of computational &lt;br/&gt;topology will be investigated in this project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The computational complexity of many important problems in topology &lt;br/&gt;and geometry is unknown, even when explicit algorithms exist. &lt;br/&gt;Recent results have revealed intriguing connections between complexity theory, &lt;br/&gt;minimal surface theory, normal surface theory and isoperimetric &lt;br/&gt;problems. The project will pursue research  in this direction, &lt;br/&gt;examining the complexity of Knot Recognition,  Knot Genus, Homology Genus&lt;br/&gt;and related topological problems. The project also includes plans to &lt;br/&gt;investigate the generalized theory of normal surfaces. Normal surfaces&lt;br/&gt;are particularly  simple surfaces relative to a fixed triangulation of&lt;br/&gt;a 3-manifold. They are the analogs of minimal surfaces in the PL Category. &lt;br/&gt;The collection of such surfaces is discrete and well suited &lt;br/&gt;to computation, leading to applications in classification, complexity, &lt;br/&gt;enumeration and algorithmic recognition. Index-one, or almost normal &lt;br/&gt;surfaces, were applied with spectacular success in recent work &lt;br/&gt;on manifold recognition. A third focus of the project &lt;br/&gt;concerns multi-region isoperimetric problems, which ask what &lt;br/&gt;are the shortest boundaries enclosing multiple regions of a &lt;br/&gt;given size. The goal is to give a mathematical proof that &lt;br/&gt;the configurations assumed by soap bubbles are optimal. &lt;br/&gt;Questions such as finding the shortest curve enclosing three given areas &lt;br/&gt;in the plane remain open. Also missing is an understanding of general &lt;br/&gt;properties of stable soap-bubble-like configurations, such &lt;br/&gt;as whether the minimizing configurations always have connected &lt;br/&gt;regions.  Finally, the project examines questions of curve &lt;br/&gt;and surface evolution, using ideas based on normal surfaces. &lt;br/&gt;Such evolution methods have the potential &lt;br/&gt;for practical applications in many areas, similar to the many &lt;br/&gt;applications of mean curvature evolution. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
