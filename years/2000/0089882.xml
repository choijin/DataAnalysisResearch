<AbstractNarration>0089882&lt;br/&gt;Haas&lt;br/&gt;This is a CAREER award that supports research on strongly correlated electron systems and quantum magnetism with a computational thrust.  The following problems will be attacked: (1) excitation spectra of complex spin liquids, such as the spin-orbital chain and multi-leg Heisenberg ladder, (2) the effect of doping two-dimensional and quasi-one-dimensional quantum spin liquids with static vacancies and mobile holes, and (3) spatial patterns of bound states in anisotropic superconductors.  Dynamical DMRG, stochastic series expansion quantum Monte Carlo, and exact diagonalization methods will be used to carry out most of the work.  The education component involves an outreach and support program for Los Angeles high school science teachers which includes: (1) a monthly colloquium, (2) training seminars and labs in the summer, and (3) regular faculty visits to the schools.  The objective is to improve the quality of high school education in the inner cities.&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;This is a CAREER award that supports theoretical and computational research in low-dimensional materials with exotic magnetic properties. These materials are related to the high temperature superconductors and are important in the understanding of quantum magnets and materials with competing ordered ground. The award supports an ambitious educational activity that leverages existing infrastructure with the aim of improving the quality of high school education in the inner cities.  The program aims to provide a "home base" for high school science teachers and to help improve the science qualifications of teachers, the connections between high schools and institutions for higher-education, and working conditions. &lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
