<AbstractNarration>The cell was discovered in the C17th by the Dutch scientist van Leeuwenhoek&lt;br/&gt;when he invented the microscope. The use of lenses and microscopes to make&lt;br/&gt;scientific observations has had a profound effect on man's history and his&lt;br/&gt;understanding. The discoveries of Galileo, Newton and Einstein are the best&lt;br/&gt;examples of this. The 1990s were declared the decade of the brain and by&lt;br/&gt;coincidence, in 1990 a new microscope was invented which allowed scientists&lt;br/&gt;to see far deeper and more clearly into (brain) tissue than ever before.&lt;br/&gt;This grant is concerned with the development of new chemical compounds that&lt;br/&gt;will exploit the unique advantages of this microscope for the very first&lt;br/&gt;time. Specifically, we will use organic chemistry to make the&lt;br/&gt;neurotransmitters that are biologically inert until they are activated by&lt;br/&gt;light. These molecules can be used to release the neurotransmitter deep&lt;br/&gt;inside cells and so stimulate a single synapse in the brain in a&lt;br/&gt;reproducible and precisely controlled way. The synapse is the basic unit of&lt;br/&gt;all the electrical circuits in the brain. The ability to use these chemicals&lt;br/&gt;to stimulate single synapses in living brains (from mammals such as rats or&lt;br/&gt;mice) will allow us to start to develop realistic theories of the basic&lt;br/&gt;molecular and cellular mechanisms which underlie neuronal network formation,&lt;br/&gt;learning and memory.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
