<AbstractNarration>Engineering - Electrical (55)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The prototype product of this project is a pilot course that integrates lighting design software simulations with qualitative photometric measurement experiments. The course includes a self-consistent data base of computer simulation software, photometric measurement &amp; data evaluation capability, and associated instruction. The course material is formatted so that other educational institutions can remotely access, via the Internet, the physical execution of the experiments and interact in real time as an integral extension of the Cal Poly Pomona laboratories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pedagogical benefit is two fold. First, any educational institution at any location is potentially capable, through conventional internet access, to offer lighting courses that include the latest comprehensive laboratory capabilities without having to invest in creating their own facilities. Second, there is an expanding trend in education to emphasize computer simulations with diminished attention on physical experience and qualitative verification of actual applications. However, in fields of engineering and science one must ultimately know how to physically construct, test, and use a real product. This course provides an example of the use of computer software while demonstrating its appropriate integration with physical reality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The effectiveness of the approach and format developed for offering this course is assessed by a formal proofing and upgrading process conducted by participating faculty both at Cal Poly Pomona and pier faculty at other schools. Cal Poly Pomona has an established working relationship with several other schools that have varying types of lighting education programs. A designated committee of faculty from these schools are identified to participate in the program. As material is developed it will be distributed to them for critique and recommendations, as well as soliciting their contributions to the material development. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
