<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will generate an Internet based system that will connect large groups of users with similar agricultural commodity interest.  ISCA Tech will start with a system that will allow growers to easily collect and manage pest-monitoring data for rapid and precise decision-making.  ISCA Tech proposes to integrate into this single user-friendly system many nascent and some established techniques that facilitate monitoring and rapid data management.  Handheld-collected data will be incorporated into an Internet hosted database where the tools of data management and query reside.  Internet access will connect users into area-wide monitoring programs that are independent of location.  It will also greatly increase the speed of data processing and report generation, and democratize the access of data management tools, such as GIS, to a broad base of users.  This system will allow growers to be self-sufficient in their data analyses, and to procure extension and scientific advice in the e-community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this system will catalyze the generation and spread of knowledge about pests dynamics, cultural practices and management through the different layers of agricultural systems.  The proposed integrated system will create the basis for a full development of agricultural practices, such as precision farming and integrated pest management.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
