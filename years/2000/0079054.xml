<AbstractNarration> This project involves a theoretical and empirical study of the role played by international law in the management and resolution of international security disputes.  Hypotheses are developed to answer two central questions.  First, what impact do principles of international law have on the diplomatic and military policies of states that are involved in territorial disputes with other states?  Second, how do principles of international law influence the positions taken by third parties toward territorial disputes and whether they intervene to support one of the disputants?  A systematic test of theoretical propositions is conducted using statistical analyses of an original dataset of the population of territorial disputes from 1900 to 2000.  The results of this project should make important theoretical contributions to understanding the domestic and international conditions that help to determine whether states and international institutions are influenced strongly by principles of international law.  Empirically, the systematic and wide-ranging tests should provide a strong basis for drawing generalizable conclusions about the causal effects of international law in international security affairs and, in particular, whether international law plays a central role in the conflict-resolution policies of democratic states.</AbstractNarration>
