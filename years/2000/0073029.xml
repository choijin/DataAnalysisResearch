    <AbstractNarration>DMS-0073029&lt;br/&gt;William Kazez&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kazez proposes to study genuine laminations of 3-manifolds. &lt;br/&gt;He and his collaborator, D. Gabai, are interested in understanding &lt;br/&gt;the geometry of the universal cover of a manifold containing a &lt;br/&gt;genuine lamination, and in particular how it is related to the &lt;br/&gt;geometry of the leaves of the lamination. He also proposes to &lt;br/&gt;study representations of order trees. Kazez along with &lt;br/&gt;K. Honda and G. Matic seek to understand the construction of &lt;br/&gt;tight contact structures from the point of view of a sutured &lt;br/&gt;manifold decomposition. For fibred knots with pseudo-Anosov &lt;br/&gt;monodromy, the sutured manifold decompositions are quite simple, &lt;br/&gt;and they propose to study the classification problem in this &lt;br/&gt;setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kazez, along with his collaborators, proposes to study the &lt;br/&gt;interaction and relationships between foliations and contact structures. Both structures are a study of a family of two &lt;br/&gt;planes in a 3-dimensional space, but these families appear &lt;br/&gt;to be extremely different. One is everywhere integrable, &lt;br/&gt;that is tangent to an embedded surface, the other is nowhere integrable. In spite of this, as the ambient space is split &lt;br/&gt;along surfaces, deep relationships start to become apparent. &lt;br/&gt;It is these relationships that we intend to develop and exploit.</AbstractNarration>
