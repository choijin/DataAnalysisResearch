<AbstractNarration>This research addresses several problems in three areas of computational &lt;br/&gt;complexity.   The overall objective in each case is to understand the limits &lt;br/&gt;of the capabilities of computers and the algorithms that run on them.  &lt;br/&gt;The first area of research concerns tradeoffs between the processing time and &lt;br/&gt;storage requirements of computations: &lt;br/&gt;When can one solve problems using algorithms that are both fast and &lt;br/&gt;use small amounts of storage and when is one limited to trading off these&lt;br/&gt;two resources, reducing storage requirements only at the cost of &lt;br/&gt;additional running time?&lt;br/&gt;The second area of research concerns the increased efficiencies in data &lt;br/&gt;structures that are possible by taking advantage of the wide range of &lt;br/&gt;instructions in modern processors that operate on entire computer words at &lt;br/&gt;once.&lt;br/&gt;The third area of research involves the analysis of algorithms to solve &lt;br/&gt;NP-hard search problems.&lt;br/&gt;When many such algorithms search but do not find a solution to a problem,&lt;br/&gt;they implicitly provide proofs that no such solution exists.&lt;br/&gt;In this portion of the research, the investigators analyze the form of these &lt;br/&gt;implicit proofs to show the limits of the efficiencies of these search &lt;br/&gt;algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More specifically, the research in time-space tradeoffs builds on the &lt;br/&gt;investigators' previous work on time-space tradeoff lower bounds and is aimed &lt;br/&gt;at extending these results to other natural problems such as graph &lt;br/&gt;connectivity and improving the complexity limits shown by current lower bound &lt;br/&gt;techniques.&lt;br/&gt;The research in data structures works in the model of random-access machines &lt;br/&gt;with arbitrary unit-cost operations on word-size quantities.&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this data structure research is to understand the limits of the&lt;br/&gt;algorithmic improvements possible in this model, particularly for &lt;br/&gt;nearest-neighbor queries, priority queues, sorting, and garbage collection.&lt;br/&gt;The research on the complexity of NP-search algorithms focuses on&lt;br/&gt;the proof complexity of co-NP properties of random structures.&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to show that for randomly-chosen inputs, natural proof systems &lt;br/&gt;such as resolution almost always require exponential-size proofs of membership &lt;br/&gt;in the co-NP sets corresponding to the duals of natural NP problems.&lt;br/&gt;A consequence of this would be proofs that large classes of algorithms for &lt;br/&gt;solving the NP problems require exponential time on large numbers of inputs.</AbstractNarration>
