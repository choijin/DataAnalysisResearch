<AbstractNarration>Abstract for Milikh, ATM-0003188&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award addresses the quantitative physics of electron energization in the auroral E region which is known to be highly turbulent during times of vigorous auroral activity with values of  the electron temperature reaching high values of 3000 K or greater.  This electron heating is thought to be generated by waves (Farley-Buneman) or by the two-stream instability.  The region where this electron heating occurs is located between 100 and 120 km where the electrons are magnetized (i.e., gyrates around the magnetic field line) and the ions are constrained by collisions to move in the direction of the neutral wind.  The rate of electron heating would be calculated as a part of the development of a kinetic model for the electron energization in the auroral E-region caused by a large amplitude turbulent electric field.  A numerical model represented by a Fokker-Planck code for the electron distribution function would be modified to include the relevant physical processes that become active by the presence of these turbulent electric fields.  The successful execution of this award would provide an understanding and predictive capability for the operation of navigation, communication, and surveillance systems.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
