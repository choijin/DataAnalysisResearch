<AbstractNarration>0076091&lt;br/&gt;Wu, Ling-Gang&lt;br/&gt;Abstract for "Regulation of the kinetics of vesicle endocytosis in a central synapse"&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Neurons talk to each other via synapses, where the nerve impulse triggers fusion of synaptic vesicles to the presynaptic plasma membrane and release their transmitter content, which in turn acts on the postsynaptic target.  To maintain synaptic transmission, fused vesicles must be retrieved from the plasma membrane (endocytosis) for re-use. The rate of endocytosis is critical because it determines whether the synapse can continuously release transmitters.  Endocytosis can be either slow or fast. The mechanisms that regulate the rate of endocytosis remain unclear. The investigators hypothesize that the rate of endocytosis is regulated by both the intensity of nerve stimulation and the intracellular calcium level. This hypothesis will be tested at a calyceal synapse, located in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) in the rat auditory brain stem. At this synapse, the investigators have recently made it possible to measure endocytosis with a time-resolved capacitance measurement technique. This is the first time such a technique has been applied to the fast synapse in the mammalian central nervous system. With this technique, the investigators will determine whether the intensity of nerve stimulation regulates endocytosis by comparing the rate of endocytosis following various nerve stimuli that differ in the number and frequency of nerve impulses. The investigators will also determine whether the intracellular calcium level regulates endocytosis by comparing the rate of endocytosis at various intracellular calcium levels. The proposed work will reveal the mechanisms that regulate the rate of endocytosis at mammalian central nervous system, and improve our understanding on how synapses maintain their activity.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
