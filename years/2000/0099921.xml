<AbstractNarration>This project will study several questions in partial differential&lt;br/&gt;equations which lead to interesting questions in harmonic&lt;br/&gt;analysis. The first set of questions are related to the inverse&lt;br/&gt;conductivity problem as studied by Sylvester and Uhlmann. My main&lt;br/&gt;interest is considering the a priori regularity assumption which seem&lt;br/&gt;to be necessary to study this problem.  I propose a technique to&lt;br/&gt;establish a uniqueness theorem in dimensions 3 and larger for&lt;br/&gt;coefficients which only have one derivative. In addition, I will&lt;br/&gt;consider the two-dimensional problem, where such a theorem is&lt;br/&gt;known. In two dimensions, I propose to extend the result from&lt;br/&gt;equations to systems. The second set of questions are related to the&lt;br/&gt;mixed problem for Laplace's equation. The goal here is to obtain&lt;br/&gt;optimal regularity results for solutions to these problems. Examples&lt;br/&gt;indicate that the positive result depend strongly on the geometry of&lt;br/&gt;the domain and the sets where Dirichlet and Neumann data are&lt;br/&gt;posed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The inverse conductivity problem is a mathematical formulation of the&lt;br/&gt;problem of determining the interior physical properties of an object&lt;br/&gt;by making electrical measurements at the boundary. This and related&lt;br/&gt;problems are of practical importance in medical imaging and in the&lt;br/&gt;nondestructive evaluation of materials. The theoretical investigations&lt;br/&gt;proposed in this project may shed some light on how to improve&lt;br/&gt;practical implementation of these problems.  The mixed problem for&lt;br/&gt;Laplace's equation models the problem of determining the temperature&lt;br/&gt;in the interior of a solid where part of the boundary is insulated.&lt;br/&gt;My research is focused on understanding how the geometry of the&lt;br/&gt;region of the region affects our ability to solve this problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
