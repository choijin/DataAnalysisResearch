<AbstractNarration>The proposal requests funds to help support the 2000 FASEB Summer Research Conference on "Retinal Neurobiology and Visual Processing". This meeting will be the fifth biannual conference in this series devoted specifically to the retina. The presentations will cover many facets of retinal biology: development and the underlying molecular mechanisms; cellular functions that support neural signaling; neural circuits by which the retina processes visual input; the code by which the retinal output is conveyed to the brain; and the resulting abilities and limitations of visual behavior.&lt;br/&gt; The five-day conference will attract approximately 180 participants from around the world. Thirty-three internationally recognized experts have agreed to present their work in formal talks, which are organized in nine thematic sessions. In assembling this program, the organizers have sought to span the range of research in retinal neurobiology, taking into account recent exciting advances in specific areas. Furthermore, emphasis has been placed on the contributions of younger scientists in an early career stage. In addition, there will be two informal workshops on topics selected before the meeting by the participants. Finally, all participants are invited to present posters during two poster sessions.&lt;br/&gt; The conference format is designed to foster direct scientific exchange among participants. There is ample time for discussion at the end of each presentation, during workshops and poster sessions; there is further free time for informal exchange at meals, which are communal, and in the afternoons. To encourage presenters to discuss their latest efforts and ongoing projects, proceedings are not published, but Abstracts of the talks and posters are collected in a small booklet and will be made available to all attendees and to others in the field who might request it. Because this conference attracts most of the field's investigators, it has been highly successful in disseminating results, and has significantly affected the course of retinal research.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
