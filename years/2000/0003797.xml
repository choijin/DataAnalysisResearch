<AbstractNarration>0003797&lt;br/&gt;Kinnally&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This three-year award for U.S.-France cooperative research in cellular biology involves Kathleen W. Kinnally and her research group at New York University and Stephan Thierry Manon of the Universite de Bordeaux II in Bordeaux, France.  The collaboration is aimed at defining the role of  bcl-2 proteins in protein translocation across mitochondrial membranes. The bcl-2 family of proteins found in yeast regulate the release of mitochondrial proteins that cause cell death.  Experiments are planned to determine the fundamental mechanism by which the bcl-2 family regulates this release  and how the proteins are transported across membrane barriers. The US investigator brings to this collaboration expertise in electrophysiology techniques applied to native and reconstituted mitochondria membranes.  This is complemented by French expertise in performing protein import experiments and in generating yeast and yeast mitochondrial mutants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award represents the US side of a joint proposal to the NSF and the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS).  NSF will cover travel funds and living expenses for the US investigator.  The CNRS will support the visits of the French researcher to the United States. The collaboration will advance fundamental understanding into the mechanism by which proteins are translocated across membranes.  These processes are important in many cellular functions including signaling, secretion, biogenesis of cell structures, compartmentation, and the mechanisms controlling tissue stability (homeostasis)  and  organogenesis. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
