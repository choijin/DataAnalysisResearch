<AbstractNarration>    Tin-Lead (Sn-Pb) solders are widely used as soldering&lt;br/&gt;materials in semiconductor devices.  The as-solidified structure&lt;br/&gt;can naturally change over time; however, the evolution can also&lt;br/&gt;be driven by thermal or mechanical loads.  Changes in&lt;br/&gt;microstructure, in particular, locally coarsened regions, have&lt;br/&gt;been observed as precursors to the formation of cracks, and&lt;br/&gt;ultimately of failure.  Time-dependent, microstructural changes,&lt;br/&gt;coupled to mechanical straining and damage evolution, must be&lt;br/&gt;considered for realistic mathematical models and numerical&lt;br/&gt;simulations.  The investigator and her colleague study, through&lt;br/&gt;mathematical modeling and numerical simulation, the fundamentals&lt;br/&gt;of microstructure evolution and its influence on material failure&lt;br/&gt;in Sn-Pb solder joints.  In the process, they develop the&lt;br/&gt;mathematical model and numerical capability more generally to&lt;br/&gt;treat the many coupled processes that influence the overall&lt;br/&gt;strength and integrity of a binary alloy.&lt;br/&gt;     Microelectronic components are generally attached to printed&lt;br/&gt;circuit boards using solder.  The solder joint can serve as the&lt;br/&gt;mechanical as well as the electrical connection.  It has been&lt;br/&gt;estimated that on the order of 10,000,000,000,000 solder joints&lt;br/&gt;are produced each year.  Damage to solder joints is a primary&lt;br/&gt;failure mechanism in electronic components.  Even on the shelf,&lt;br/&gt;daily or yearly temperature cycles, physical handling, occasional&lt;br/&gt;bumps, chemical reactions or radiation can cause damage.  Under&lt;br/&gt;operating conditions, thermal fluctuations or mechanical&lt;br/&gt;vibration can be even more severe.  For expensive devices, in&lt;br/&gt;critical applications, improved joint integrity can have&lt;br/&gt;enormously beneficial consequences, both economically and in&lt;br/&gt;terms of reliability of components.  The modeling undertaken here&lt;br/&gt;can play a crucial role in providing guidance for maintenance of&lt;br/&gt;critical components because it is practically impossible to&lt;br/&gt;examine microscopically individual, in-service joints for&lt;br/&gt;potential failure.  The theoretical framework developed here will&lt;br/&gt;also be readily applicable to analyzing self-assembling behavior&lt;br/&gt;and degradation in some nano-scale materials and devices.</AbstractNarration>
