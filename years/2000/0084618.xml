<AbstractNarration>AST-0084618&lt;br/&gt;Preston&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An astronomical sciences educational outreach workshop will be held in Cape Town, South Africa on February 2-6, 2001.  The workshop is expected to be small (about 15 to 20 attendees total). The purposes of the workshop are: 1.) to provide the attendees, especially those from the Southern African Astronomical Observatory (SAAO), with an opportunity to learn from, and collaborate with, colleagues in the field of astronomy education outreach from leading international astronomical centers; and 2.) to discuss the goals, mission, and priorities for an international astronomy educational/outreach collaboration. The attendees will be made up of educational/outreach staffs from observatories worldwide that are planning activities and programs for formal and informal public education that relate to their state-of-the-art telescope projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The workshop will include representatives from the Gemini International telescopes project, Keck Telescope in Hawaii, the Japanese Subaru Telescope, the Gran Canarias Telescopio in Spain, the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope in Chile, the Arecibo Radio Telescope in Puerto Rico, the Hobby-Eberly Telescope in Texas, the Southern African Large Telescope, and the Very Large Array Radio Telescope in New Mexico.  The expected outcome from the meeting is to establish a framework to inspire future international collaborations and coordinated programs.  During the course of the workshop, attendees will have the opportunity to brainstorm and share ideas and philosophies.  Poster papers will be presented and a compendium, following the workshop, will be published to provide information to help others who work, or wish to work, or wish to work, in similar areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is funded by the Division of Astronomical Sciences and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate, the Education and Human Resources Directorate, and the Division of International Programs.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
