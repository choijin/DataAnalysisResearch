    <AbstractNarration>Although birds are among the best-studied vertebrate group, extraordinarily little is known about their sense of smell. In fact, chemical signals are known to modulate important aspects of behavior in every vertebrate group (reptiles, amphibians, fish, mammals) except birds. The proposed research will examine the role of chemical communication in an Alaskan seabird group, known as the auklets. Within this group, one species, the Crested Auklet, has an unusual "tangerine-like" odor on its feathers that appears to be tightly linked with mating behavior. The study has three objectives: to examine in detail the nasal anatomy of auklet species, to study the biochemistry of Crested Auklet feathers, and to determine any behavioral response of Crested Auklets to their feather odor. The aim of this research is to integrate anatomy, chemistry, and behavior in a model bird group, as a means of understanding the role of chemical communication in birds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The use of chemical communication has the potential to alter fundamental assumptions about bird behavior, as scientists have typically only considered signals that involve vision or hearing. Since nasal microstructure and odor chemistry are completely unstudied in birds, the results of this research are also applicable to studies of sensory perception, adaptation, and biochemistry. Such data will increase our knowledge of birds and will enable comparisons with other animal groups, such as mammals. Finally, responses to odors appear to be involved in several important bird behaviors, such as courtship, chick rearing, and predator detection, which can influence reproductive success or mortality. Thus, information relating to odor response in birds is applicable to species conservation, management and situations involving animal husbandry. This POWRE award will permit the PI to develop expertise in several techniques that will support this integrated multidisciplinary study.</AbstractNarration>
