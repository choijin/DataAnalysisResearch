<AbstractNarration>Biological Sciences (61) &lt;br/&gt;The Biology Department of Baker University is conducting a significant improvement of our physiology laboratory experience, and the enhancement of research opportunities for undergraduates. The current physiology program has not kept pace with technology and provides only limited opportunities for gaining hands-on experience using modern physiological techniques. The laboratory approach has been traditional in that 'cookbook' experiments are conducted with little room for student-designed investigations. We are correcting this problem by revising the program to offer an effective laboratory component that emphasizes modern physiological approaches to solving biological problems. The effort is an adaptation of an project at Bates College. The objectives of this project are 1) to promote independent learning by applying computer technology to the study of physiology, 2) to teach students scientific inquiry methods, and 3) to engage students in undergraduate research projects. These objectives are being accomplished by conducting fewer traditional experiments and having students design and carry out their own investigations, then present their results in the form of a scientific paper. We are using the BIOPAC physiology teaching system interfaced with computers to facilitate data collection and analysis in real time, and provide access to interactive, multimedia presentations of physiological processes. The new equipment is also being used for independent research projects in the cardiovascular physiology of the chick embryo in shell-less culture. Our aims are to 1) improve conceptual understanding of physiology, 2) stimulate student experimentation, critical thinking and problem solving, 3) improve understanding of scientific methodology, and 4) increase student participation in research and presentations at national meetings. The use of new technology in our curriculum reform is impacting the education of approximately 40 students per year in Comparative Physiology and Human Anatomy and Physiology classes.</AbstractNarration>
