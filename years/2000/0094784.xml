<AbstractNarration>This project is increasing the enrollment, retention and graduation rates in associate degree programs in computer science, engineering technology, and mathematics (CSEM) for low- income, academically talented students, particularly those from underrepresented populations. The project consists of three major components: (a) recruitment of students into CSEM programs, in partnership with school districts and community agencies, with an emphasis on populations that are typically underrepresented in CSEM fields; (b) academic support, through existing programs and targeted initiatives, to assist CSEM students in persevering and succeeding in their chosen academic programs and careers; and (c) provision of scholarship assistance to enable high ability, low- income students to pursue full- time studies in CSEM associate degree programs. These objectives are being accomplished through a network of existing programs, services and resources, as well as through the addition of new academic support initiatives. New initiatives include expanded partnerships with area schools, business and industry and agencies serving underrepresented populations to assist in recruitment of non- traditional students; the creation of a "student ambassador corps" to assist in recruitment of high school students; provision of targeted supplementary peer tutoring for students in barrier courses; peer mentoring by senior CSEM students for students enrolled in developmental courses; and provision of up to 40 scholarships per year for high- ability, low- income CSEMS students. The CSEM scholarship project is being implemented under the aegis of the New Jersey Center for Advanced Technological Education (NJCATE).</AbstractNarration>
