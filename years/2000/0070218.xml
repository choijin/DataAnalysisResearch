<AbstractNarration>The research described in this proposal is on a class of linear and nonlinear &lt;br/&gt;partial differential equations (PDE)which share the property that they can be &lt;br/&gt;written in the form of a Hamiltonian system with infinitely many degrees of &lt;br/&gt;freedom. Principal examples include nonlinear wave equations, nonlinear &lt;br/&gt;Schroedinger equations and Euler's equations for water waves.  The analogy &lt;br/&gt;with dynamical systems motivates a number of basic questions. (1) The &lt;br/&gt;existence of invariant tori for the nonlinear partial differential equations &lt;br/&gt;involves extensions of KAM theory to infinite dimensional settings. &lt;br/&gt;Implications of these results include the existence of solutions of nonlinear &lt;br/&gt;evolution equations which exist for all time and are recurrent. Techniques &lt;br/&gt;that have been developed for PDE also have bearing on several open problems in &lt;br/&gt;classical dynamical systems concerning the persistence of resonant tori. &lt;br/&gt;(2) A normal forms transformation of a Hamiltonian PDE gives details of its &lt;br/&gt;essential nonlinearities, and it has applications to Nekhoroshev stability &lt;br/&gt;results and to a proof of the Arnold condition of genuine nonlinearity. &lt;br/&gt;(3) Starting from a normal forms transformation, long time existence results &lt;br/&gt;for nonlinear PDE are important in a mathematically rigorous analysis of the &lt;br/&gt;classical asymptotic regimes of mathematical physics. In addition the proposer &lt;br/&gt;will address a number of related questions in the theory of PDE. (4) Estimates &lt;br/&gt;of dispersive smoothing for linear and nonlinear Schroeinger equations depend &lt;br/&gt;upon the scattering properties of bicharacteristics, and estimates of this &lt;br/&gt;form play a role in the study of the initial value problem for data of low &lt;br/&gt;smoothness. (5) The classical problems of standing waves in two dimensional &lt;br/&gt;water waves and traveling waves in three dimensional water waves are instances &lt;br/&gt;of problems in PDE which exhibit small divisors, and analytic results involve &lt;br/&gt;delicate questions of convergence. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Celestial mechanics, the problem of describing the motion of planetary &lt;br/&gt;bodies, has always intrigued mathematicians and motivated their discoveries. &lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of this century, the French mathematician H. Poincar' and his &lt;br/&gt;American contemporaries G.D. Birkhoff and G.W. Hill, essentially revolutionized&lt;br/&gt;the subject with their work, bringing it conceptual clarity and introducing &lt;br/&gt;powerful new analytic techniques. This work gave rise to a new paradigm in its &lt;br/&gt;field, and contributed to the birth of many modern branches of mathematics. An &lt;br/&gt;important question was and remains the n-body problem; the problem of stability&lt;br/&gt;of the motion of n planets in their mutual gravitational attraction. Indeed in &lt;br/&gt;the 1960's, 50 years after the death of Poincar'e, the development of a theory &lt;br/&gt;by three mathematicians, A.N. Kolmogorov, V.I. Arnold and J. Moser (it is now &lt;br/&gt;called KAM theory) made a significant contribution to the field. At the time of&lt;br/&gt;its development there were physical applications to the stability of high &lt;br/&gt;energy particles in a cyclotron, as well as to the classical questions of the &lt;br/&gt;stability of our solar system or to other important systems in mechanics. The &lt;br/&gt;equations which describe the motion of n bodies are examples of ordinary &lt;br/&gt;differential equations. It was a question at the time of the development of &lt;br/&gt;KAM theory whether such stability results could be extended to partial &lt;br/&gt;differential equations. These describe the evolution in time of a continuous &lt;br/&gt;medium such as a fluid, a gas, and electromagnetic field or an elastic solid. &lt;br/&gt;The analogy between mechanics and the motion of a continuum is mathematically &lt;br/&gt;quite elegant. However the n-body problem is a finite dimensional one, while &lt;br/&gt;problems of partial differential equations viewed with this analogy in mind &lt;br/&gt;are inherently infinite dimensional, and this summarizes the essential &lt;br/&gt;mathematical difficulty of extending the methods. The principal content of &lt;br/&gt;this research program is the extension of some aspects of the analytic &lt;br/&gt;techniques of Hamiltonian mechanics to physically important partial &lt;br/&gt;differential equations. These results will have some significant consequences &lt;br/&gt;in a variety of diverse physical applications, including the study of ocean &lt;br/&gt;waves, the propagation of signal pulses in optical fibers, and in the &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
