<AbstractNarration>The focus of the research supported by this award is the&lt;br/&gt;mathematical analysis of certain significant material failures in&lt;br/&gt;solids.  The goal of this endeavor is the qualitative prediction of&lt;br/&gt;the formation and growth of voids.  Toward this end the principal&lt;br/&gt;investigator will continue his studies of the relevant nonlinear&lt;br/&gt;partial differential equations, which constitute the mathematical&lt;br/&gt;model, in order to determine conditions under which these problems&lt;br/&gt;have singular solutions.  The underlying equations are those that&lt;br/&gt;arise in elasticity and viscoelasticity and the desired&lt;br/&gt;singularities are point discontinuities.  Problems that will be&lt;br/&gt;considered include:  the existence of singular solutions to&lt;br/&gt;quasilinear elliptic systems; the existence of, and admissibility&lt;br/&gt;criteria for, singular solutions to hyperbolic systems; the&lt;br/&gt;existence of singular solutions to certain parabolic systems; the&lt;br/&gt;existence of minimizers with singularities for problems in the&lt;br/&gt;calculus of variations; regularity, fine properties, and the&lt;br/&gt;asymptotic behavior of singular minimizers; the optimal location&lt;br/&gt;for an isolated singularity; and, the determination of whether&lt;br/&gt;known singular solutions to a quasilinear elliptic system are&lt;br/&gt;indeed minimizers of the corresponding problem in the calculus of&lt;br/&gt;variations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research area of this grant is the mathematical analysis of&lt;br/&gt;equations that arise in Materials Science.  The most common way to&lt;br/&gt;determine when a material will fail under the influence of external&lt;br/&gt;forces is to subject a piece of the actual material to tensile&lt;br/&gt;loads until failure occurs, i.e., "pull on it until it breaks".&lt;br/&gt;This is fine if one is interested only in the gross properties of&lt;br/&gt;the material.  However, if one wants to understand the reasons for&lt;br/&gt;material failure then one must have recourse to mathematical models&lt;br/&gt;of the material.  Experiments on certain rubbery polymers, called&lt;br/&gt;elastomers, have shown that when one pulls on an elastomer small&lt;br/&gt;holes appear in the material.  These holes then grow in size and&lt;br/&gt;combine to form cracks.  A similar phenomenon has been observed in&lt;br/&gt;optical fibers.  Catastrophic failure, due to a series of holes&lt;br/&gt;that cascade down the core of the fiber, can occur when excessive&lt;br/&gt;power is applied.  These holes seriously degrade the ability of the&lt;br/&gt;fiber to transmit information.  In this grant, the principal&lt;br/&gt;investigator will uncover the mechanisms that cause the creation&lt;br/&gt;and growth of holes in polymers and glasses by examining systems of&lt;br/&gt;partial differential equations from the theory of elasticity and&lt;br/&gt;viscoelasticity.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
