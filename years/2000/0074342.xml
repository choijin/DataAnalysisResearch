<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Compared to our understanding of the principles of persuasion, very little is known about the processes that motivate and enable resistance to persuasion.  This research will test the thesis that resistance is motivated, in part, by the need to protect the self-concept.  This thesis will be tested using the logic and methodology of self-affirmation theory.  This theory argues that if a given behavior (e.g., resisting persuasion) is motivated by the need to protect the self-concept, then affirming the self will reduce the need to engage in that behavior.  In three studies, individuals will or will not be given the opportunity to affirm their self-concept before being exposed to a persuasive message.  Study 1 will examine the influence of topic-relevance (i.e., whether or not the affirmation concerns the same topic as the persuasive message) on the resistance process.  Study 2 will examine the role of attitude strength in moderating the effects of self-affirmations on resistance.  Study 3 will examine a vital methodological question concerning the timing of the self-affirmation opportunity (i.e., whether it occurs before or after exposure to a persuasive message).  This research will contribute to our basic understanding of the processes that motivate and enable resistance to persuasion.  In addition, it will contribute to the development of a comprehensive theory of persuasion dynamics that is capable of explaining both yielding to and resisting persuasion.  The need for such a theory is critical not only for advancing basic science but also for practical reasons.  We must be able to teach ourselves and our children how to resist changing the things we should not change, how to change the things we should, and wisdom to know the difference.  This POWRE research program represents an innovative line of research that is different from Jacks' graduate training.  In addition, as a non-tenured assistant professor, she is at a critical stage in her career.  The release from teaching obligations enabled by this POWRE award will allow more time for research and thus will be vital to her ability to achieve her career objectives.</AbstractNarration>
