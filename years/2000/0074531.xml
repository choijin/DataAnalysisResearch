    <AbstractNarration>The Proposer intends to work on a number of diophantine questions, with&lt;br/&gt;particular emphasis on mixed polynomial-exponential type equations in&lt;br/&gt;several variables, and on Diophantine approximation in positive&lt;br/&gt;characteristic. For polynomial-exponential equations, the goal will be&lt;br/&gt;to obtain bounds for the number of solutions, which are independent of&lt;br/&gt;the coefficients of the equations. As for approximation in fields of&lt;br/&gt;power series of positive characteristic, the aim will be to exhibit new&lt;br/&gt;classes of algebraic series with explicit continued fraction expansions,&lt;br/&gt;and to obtain new information on "Roth exponents". The Proposer&lt;br/&gt;further plans to address the question (connected with a former conjecture&lt;br/&gt;of Artin) of how many variables are needed to guarantee that a form of&lt;br/&gt;degree d with p-adic coefficients has a nontrivial zero, and he is&lt;br/&gt;interested in a certain question on polynomials with applications to&lt;br/&gt;Sidon sequences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the advent of computers, and in modern cryptography, ``discrete''&lt;br/&gt;mathematical questions, in particular questions involving integers, have&lt;br/&gt;turned out to be of increasing importance. The Proposer intends to&lt;br/&gt;continue his work on "Diophantine equations", i.e., to study integer&lt;br/&gt;solutions of equations. Whereas most work up to now has been on&lt;br/&gt;polynomial equations, the new project will also involve exponential&lt;br/&gt;equations, involving terms with ``exponentially fast'' growth. There&lt;br/&gt;will be applications to linear recurrence sequences, of which the best&lt;br/&gt;known is the Fibonacci sequence, which occurs, e.g., as data relating to&lt;br/&gt;some plants. The approximation of more complicated numbers by the more simple&lt;br/&gt;"rational numbers" (i.e., ordinary fractions) is at the forefront of&lt;br/&gt;much current work. For instance, how well can the number "pi" be&lt;br/&gt;approximated? The Proposer intends to work on the analogous question, on&lt;br/&gt;how well a more general function can be approximated by the simpler&lt;br/&gt;rational functions. Again of particular interest here is the discrete&lt;br/&gt;(positive characteristic) case.</AbstractNarration>
