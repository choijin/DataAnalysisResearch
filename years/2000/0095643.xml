<AbstractNarration>Arrison&lt;br/&gt;OIA-0095643&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Government-University-Industry Research Roundtable (GUIRR), established in 1984, provides a unique forum for dialogue among top government, university and industry leaders of the national science and technology enterprise.  GUIRR is sponsored by the National Academy of Sciences and is guided by a Council that develops the Roundtable agenda and oversees plans and activities of various Working Groups appointed to examine additional topics in depth.  In recent years the Roundtable has sponsored numerous projects such as Removing Barriers to Industry-University Research Collaboration and Stresses on Research and Education at Colleges and Universities.  GUIRR is the convenor of the Federal Demonstration Partnership (FDP). The FDP, through meetings and issuance of reports, serves as an ongoing cooperative effort among sixty-five universities or research institutes and eleven Federal Agencies to address means to improve management of federally funded research.  Primary core support is received by each of the major federal research and development agencies.  In 1993, GUIRR created an affiliated University-Industry Partnership program as a supplemental component of its funding.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
