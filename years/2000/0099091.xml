    <AbstractNarration>Abstract: Issues in the Applied Analysis of Markets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal has several parts. The first is to extend prior models of demand&lt;br/&gt;systems in characteristic space. These models were primarily developed to&lt;br/&gt;provide a tool that enables the user to analyze (own and cross) price and&lt;br/&gt;characteristic elasticities of demand. The same models can (and have) been&lt;br/&gt;used to evaluate the demand for and the utility derived from new goods, but&lt;br/&gt;their implications in those contexts are questionable (these include applica-&lt;br/&gt;tions like evaluating the returns to innovations, or constructing price indices).&lt;br/&gt;This is because some of the model's properties vis a vis the evaluation of new&lt;br/&gt;goods are "counterintuitve".&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We consider a change in the demand model that gets rid of these coun-&lt;br/&gt;terintuitive implications, and then compare alternative ways of evaluating&lt;br/&gt;new goods. One of the alternatives is \hedonic" analysis; a technique which&lt;br/&gt;is currently used to correct the CPI for new goods bias. In doing this com-&lt;br/&gt;parison I will provide a detailed analysis of alternative ways of computing&lt;br/&gt;hedonic corrections. Hopefully this will be of use to the statistical agencies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second section of the proposal seeks to extend methods for computing&lt;br/&gt;and analyzing dynamic games to allow for asymmetric information. We focus&lt;br/&gt;on models which can detect and analyze collusive outcomes, and show how&lt;br/&gt;the learning and artificial intelligence literatures can help provide a simple&lt;br/&gt;tool for such an analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The third section of the proposal outlines a new and relatively simple&lt;br/&gt;procedure for estimation and subsequent empirical analysis of oligopolistic&lt;br/&gt;markets when either asymmetric information, or dynamic considerations, are&lt;br/&gt;important. I hope to explore the range of application and performance of&lt;br/&gt;this technique. The technique was developed while I was trying to sort out&lt;br/&gt;research strategies for two new empirical projects, one on the demand for&lt;br/&gt;pharmaceuticals and one on deregulated electric utility markets. The two&lt;br/&gt;final sections of the proposal outline these projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both empirical projects are joint with colleagues who have worked exten-&lt;br/&gt;sively on the industries studied. Our goal in the project on the demand for&lt;br/&gt;pharmaceuticals is to understand how past experience, marketing, and infor-&lt;br/&gt;mation on product performance, interact with other market characteristics&lt;br/&gt;to shape demand. We are particularly interested in the impact of advertis-&lt;br/&gt;ing on demand and on welfare, and on how recent institutional changes, like&lt;br/&gt;the development of the Over the Counter market for some durgs, impact on&lt;br/&gt;demand and welfare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project on deregulated British electric utility markets will initially&lt;br/&gt;focus on getting estimates of start up and capital costs. This should enable&lt;br/&gt;us to provide measures of profitability that take account of these costs. This,&lt;br/&gt;in turn, will enable us to quantify the incentives to invest in more generating&lt;br/&gt;capacity that are provided by the institutions which determine the newly&lt;br/&gt;derregulated market outcomes. Later we hope to engage in a more in depth&lt;br/&gt;analysis of the relationship between different aspects of these institutions&lt;br/&gt;and the price and quantity allocations that are likely to be generated by the&lt;br/&gt;market.</AbstractNarration>
