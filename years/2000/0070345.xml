<AbstractNarration>The purpose of this research is to extend knowledge about automated capture environments to better support long-term use. In earlier work, the goal was to make capture a ubiquitous service at any point in time and over a short period of time. However, as more live events are captured and views of the captured experiences are automatically prepared, having too much information available becomes a problem.  The objective of this project is to find information access solutions that scale over time, increasing the benefit of captured memories for the human as time passes and more information is captured, rather than increasing the burden of foraging through a morass of memories to find ones of importance.  Two approaches to this problem will be used. The first approach is to create an application-specific information model for a captured experience. This leads to captured experiences being contained in a searchable repository of experiences. The second approach is to view capture as only one part of the knowledge acquisition process in any given application.  Specifically, a general infrastructure for building capture and access applications, and storing, retrieving and visualizing large repositories of captured experiences that evolve over time will be built.  Capture and access in the educational domain as well as in distributed collaborative meetings will be explored.  The major contribution is general support for the construction of capture and access applications as well as deeper evaluation of long-term use of capture and access in educational and meeting environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
