<AbstractNarration>This project is centered around the study of  A-hypergeometric&lt;br/&gt;functions.  These have been introduced in the 80's by Gel'fand&lt;br/&gt;and his coworkers as solutions of a system of partial&lt;br/&gt;differential equations encoding combinatorial data of polytopes. &lt;br/&gt;Specific problems to be addressed in this project  include: the&lt;br/&gt;classification of rational hypergeometric functions and their&lt;br/&gt;relationship with toric residues; bounds for the holonomic rank&lt;br/&gt;and rational rank; hypergeometric functions arising as periods of&lt;br/&gt;Calabi-Yau manifolds.  Potential applications of this work&lt;br/&gt;include a deeper understanding of the properties of the&lt;br/&gt;A-discriminant and new algorithms for the computation of total&lt;br/&gt;residues -a rational expression on the coefficients of a system&lt;br/&gt;of polynomial equations which is of considerable interest in&lt;br/&gt;computational algebraic geometry- and, ultimately, the&lt;br/&gt;development of algorithms for solving polynomial equations.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study of polynomial equations is of fundamental importance on&lt;br/&gt;almost all branches of science and technology.  In the last few&lt;br/&gt;years it has become clear that the best approaches to their&lt;br/&gt;solution are those that combine numerical and symbolic methods. &lt;br/&gt;The work on this project attempts to answer some basic questions&lt;br/&gt;on the symbolic study of a class of partial differential&lt;br/&gt;equations closely related to systems of polynomial equations with&lt;br/&gt;the goal of developing new algorithms.  This same system of&lt;br/&gt;differential equations arise also in Mirror Symmetry, a&lt;br/&gt;fundamental theory in high-energy physics, with remarkable&lt;br/&gt;consequences in pure mathematics.  The investigator hopes to be&lt;br/&gt;able to relate the symbolic approach to the classical algebraic&lt;br/&gt;geometric (Hodge Theory) approach.</AbstractNarration>
