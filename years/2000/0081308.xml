<AbstractNarration>Advances in processor technology, both in increased processing power and decreased energy&lt;br/&gt;consumption, have led to the creation of a new breed of small intelligent devices from tiny&lt;br/&gt;laptops, to PDAs, to smart phones, to wearable computers made from a collection of small&lt;br/&gt;independent devices. The advent of such devices and wearable computers brings to light new&lt;br/&gt;possibilities and new needs, specifically: cooperation among devices and elimination of cables.&lt;br/&gt;The development of short-range radio technology, such as Bluetooth, enables the cooperation of&lt;br/&gt;such devices over wireless links. As users collect multiple small computing devices, the amount&lt;br/&gt;of communication resources available to the user increases and so the demand for coordination of&lt;br/&gt;resources between these devices increases. The overhead of this coordination may tax the&lt;br/&gt;available bandwidth and energy resources of the devices. The goal of this research is to support&lt;br/&gt;such cooperation and coordination through intelligent communication management with an&lt;br/&gt;emphasis on the efficient use of available resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the user moves between different environments, these MObile grouPEd Devices (MOPEDs)&lt;br/&gt;cooperate as a coordinated local area network that provides the user the desired mobile services.&lt;br/&gt;This cooperation and coordination between a single user's devices changes the definition of what&lt;br/&gt;it means to communicate with a user. With a MOPED, communicating with any of the devices in&lt;br/&gt;the MOPED represents a successful connection to the local area network, and so to the individual.&lt;br/&gt;In order to better support the needs of the user, the MOPED may interact with networks in the&lt;br/&gt;current environment surrounding the user in order to determine the availability of local services.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers' approach relies on decision algorithms; services and protocols for determining what communication channels are available to which devices, as well as resource and quality&lt;br/&gt;information about such channels. The researchers address four major challenges faced in the design of such a solution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Channel Discovery:  The researchers propose the design of intelligent service discovery protocols based on the requirements of the user and the tradeoff between having current&lt;br/&gt;information about the availability of communication channels with the overhead in&lt;br/&gt;resources (i.e. bandwidth and power) used to acquire that information.&lt;br/&gt;2) Resource Monitoring: The researchers propose the design of a distributed resource information&lt;br/&gt;repository, which is a database internal to the MOPED. The algorithms governing the&lt;br/&gt;dissemination of resource information to devices in the MOPED must take into&lt;br/&gt;consideration the topology of the network, the energy and bandwidth availability of each&lt;br/&gt;device, and the priority at which each device actually needs the information.&lt;br/&gt;3) Resource Allocation: The researchers propose the design of intelligent transport and routing&lt;br/&gt;protocols able to use the resource availability information to determine which and how&lt;br/&gt;many of the MOPED's external channels to use to complete a specific connection.&lt;br/&gt;4) Mobility Management: The researchers propose mobility management techniques to provide the ability for external users to communicate with the user, and so the devices of the&lt;br/&gt;MOPED, wherever it is currently connected to the Internet and propose the design of&lt;br/&gt;mobility management protocols based on the current technology for host mobility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of the research will enable simultaneous connections through all available&lt;br/&gt;communication channels. This creates a very robust environment, where it becomes easier to&lt;br/&gt;guarantee complete communication coverage. It allows using MOPEDs for critical tasks such as&lt;br/&gt;patient monitoring where it is important to maintain connectivity at all time, through there may be&lt;br/&gt;some flexibility in the amount of data that is transferred as well as the importance of that data. If&lt;br/&gt;the communication patterns of such a MOPED are not well monitored, certain devices may&lt;br/&gt;unacceptably lose power due to inefficient connection management.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
