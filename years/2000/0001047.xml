<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;PETER H. SCHULTZ&lt;br/&gt;EAR-0001047&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Argentine loessoid deposits collectively called the Pampean Formation (PF) represent an important depositional sequence extending back to the Miocene.  These deposits preserve a rich fossil record providing a reference for faunal evolution in South America.  It also records major climate changes in both paleosols and depositional rates.  Since the Late Cenozoic, 10-15 objects larger than 1 km in diameter should have impacted the Earth.  This translates into about 6 craters larger than 1 km in the thick PF deposits and continental shelf.  The high silica (60%), broad area (over a million square km), soft substrate, and relatively dry climate all create ideal conditions for generating, capturing, archiving, and identifying this impact record.  PI has discovered four such events and proposes to investigate their nature, distribution, and implications.&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, PI will determine the nature, origin, and distribution of impact glasses captured in the Argentine Pampas during the Late Cenozoic.  The first year will focus on:  (1) a broader database for absolute ages using Ar/Ar laser fusion and stepwise heating;  (2) a systematic petrographic and geochemical study of selected glasses at different localities;  (3) field studies to assess the extent and nature of glass-bearing layers at different sites; and (4) magnetostratigraphic profiling across selected intervals.  The second year will emphasize:  (1) paleomagnetic profiles of loess sections at different levels benchmarked by first-year results;  (2) compositional systematics of glasses as a means to determine the parent crater localities and substrates; and (3) detailed lithostratigraphy and correlation's with the fossil record.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
