<AbstractNarration>Agency:  NSF - Civil and Mechanical Systems (Alison Flatau)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI's:  Kevin D. Murphy and Matthew R. Begley&lt;br/&gt;  University of Connecticut&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal #: 0085122&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Development of Novel In-Situ Tests and Modeling for Integrated MEMS Research and Education&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;300 WORD PROJECT SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The performance of micro-electro-mechanical-systems (MEMS) is strongly influenced by adhesive forces and surface energies. In some regimes, these quantities cause device failure, when components come into sticking contact and cannot continue to perform their designated task. In order to identify acceptable operating regimes, significant advances are needed in our ability to quantify close range attractive forces and adhesion energies.&lt;br/&gt; This program will develop (i) novel experimental techniques to characterize these quantities in-situ and (ii) physics-based models to predict component performance when adhesion and stick-release events are critical factors. Both quasi-static and dynamic behavior of a model MEMS system will be studied, with an emphasis on the transition between sticking and no-stick regimes. These studies will determine if and when dynamic excitation may be used initiate and control stick-release events. Such information may be used to design novel vibratory assembly processes used to manufacture complex MEMS.&lt;br/&gt; A state-of-the-art nanoindentation facility will be integrated with an idealized MEMS device to directly measure forces and displacements at the micron level.  In addition to established dynamic measurement techniques used in nanoindentation systems, a combination of electronic and optical measurements will be implemented. Adhesive energies, electrostatic forces, and the dynamic response of the MEMS device will be quantified during both mechanical and electrical excitation. The measured MEMS behavior will be used to validate a combination of analytical and numerical models that incorporate electrostatic forces and surface energies. These models will be used to predict a priori transient dynamic response, including stick and stick-release events. &lt;br/&gt; The proposed program integrates research and education through the development of a MEMS test facility.  Graduate and undergraduate research assistants will design and fabricate test rigs and will contribute to model development.  Students will also spend time collaborating with the Micro-Technology Group at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
