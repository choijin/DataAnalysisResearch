<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;Industrial sectors are continually evolving in terms of the variety of products they offer, the mix&lt;br/&gt;of their active producers, the prices these producers charge, and their productive efficiency. Using&lt;br/&gt;plant-level panel data from developing countries, this project characterizes the way that these&lt;br/&gt;evolutionary processes respond to trade policy reforms and to changes in the exchange rate&lt;br/&gt;regime. The analysis is based on structural models of industrial evolution that highlight producer&lt;br/&gt;heterogeneity, firm-specific productivity shocks, new firms' start-up costs, and uncertainty about&lt;br/&gt;the future. By moving away from representative plant analysis, the project captures many micro&lt;br/&gt;features of industrial sector responses that the existing trade literature misses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basic model used in this project quantifies an industry's dynamic response to changes in the&lt;br/&gt;intensity of import competition. It characterizes the time paths of firm-level capital gains and&lt;br/&gt;losses, entry and exit patterns, price-cost mark-ups, job creation and destruction, average&lt;br/&gt;productivity, productivity dispersion, and the menu of product varieties available to consumers.&lt;br/&gt;Generalizations of the basic model are also analyzed. These allow firms to export some of their&lt;br/&gt;output when it is profitable for them to do so, and/or to make investments that expand their&lt;br/&gt;capacity or imperfectly control their productivity shocks. The generalized models address&lt;br/&gt;additional issues, including the question of how import competition or exporting opportunities&lt;br/&gt;might induce or discourage investment and productivity growth. All versions of the model&lt;br/&gt;quantify the role of expectations and policy credibility in shaping responses to policy reforms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The models are econometrically fit to large data sets that the principal investigators have acquired&lt;br/&gt;from Colombia, Morocco, and Taiwan. For each country, these multi-year data sets contain&lt;br/&gt;detailed plant- or firm-level information on sales revenues and input costs. Augmented by data on&lt;br/&gt;tariffs, the exchange rate, and the total value of imports, this cost and revenue information&lt;br/&gt;supports estimation of the basic model. For the extended models, data on export revenues and on&lt;br/&gt;productivity-enhancing expenditures (like fixed investment, worker training and technician&lt;br/&gt;salaries) are also used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The methodological contribution of the project is to adapt applied industrial evolution models to&lt;br/&gt;an open economy setting, and to implement these models using available micro data. In so doing&lt;br/&gt;the project breaks new ground concerning the measurement of sunk start-up costs and firm-specific&lt;br/&gt;productivity trajectories. The project also facilitates policy debates by quantifying many&lt;br/&gt;dimensions of industrial responses to policy reforms in a single integrated framework. The&lt;br/&gt;consequences of commercial policy reforms that are of interest to business and labor (changes in&lt;br/&gt;profitability, capital gains or losses, and job creation or job destruction) are measured and&lt;br/&gt;compared to the consequences of interest to consumers (changes in prices and the available menu&lt;br/&gt;of product varieties).</AbstractNarration>
