<AbstractNarration>This project will carry out LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC) research&lt;br/&gt;activities related to the analysis of data from the NSF-funded Laser&lt;br/&gt;Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO).  This includes&lt;br/&gt;the development and testing of algorithms and data analysis techniques&lt;br/&gt;to search for gravitational waves from known astrophysical&lt;br/&gt;sources. Since these will produce extremely weak signals, the data&lt;br/&gt;analysis problem is to find these signals in a noisy data stream,&lt;br/&gt;where the statistical properties of the noise are not straightforward&lt;br/&gt;to characterize.  The UWM group is developing and testing data&lt;br/&gt;analysis strategies and algorithms which are not adversely affected by&lt;br/&gt;instrumental anomalies.  This work includes the writing of both&lt;br/&gt;prototype and production codes, which are then tested and compared&lt;br/&gt;with other techniques. The best methods are then migrated into the&lt;br/&gt;LIGO Data Analysis System where they can be run on very large data&lt;br/&gt;sets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work is crucial to the success of LIGO, which is an NSF-funded&lt;br/&gt;project to detect gravitational waves of astrophysical origin.  Such&lt;br/&gt;waves are emitted by astrophysical sources such as coalescing pairs of&lt;br/&gt;binary neutron stars, supernovae, and pulsars, but are very weak and&lt;br/&gt;have never been directly observed.  This is why new and specialized&lt;br/&gt;types of data analysis methods are needed.  Direct observation would&lt;br/&gt;confirm a fundamental prediction of physics -- the existence of&lt;br/&gt;gravitational waves -- and provide a unique tool for observing exotic&lt;br/&gt;astrophysical phenomena.  The two LIGO observatories are located in&lt;br/&gt;Hanford, WA and Livingston, LA, and have been under construction since&lt;br/&gt;1995; they will be completed and operating sometime during 2001.</AbstractNarration>
