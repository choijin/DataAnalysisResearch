    <AbstractNarration>CTS-0079481&lt;br/&gt;Otto J. Gregory&lt;br/&gt;University of Rhode Island&lt;br/&gt;MRI: Acquisition of a High-Resolution Scanning Electron Microscope for Forensics and Surface Technology&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A high-resolution scanning electron microscope for forensic and surface sciences will be acquired. The capabilities of the instrument include low atomic number microanalysis (down to atomic number 4) along with the ability to characterize the microstructure and morphology of pressure and moisture-sensitive species in low vacuum (10-3 torr) environments. This latter feature is extremely important because it permits analysis of 'wet' specimens such as liquids with low vapor pressure, polymers, cements, organic membranes, solvated surfaces, and biological specimens. In addition to these capabilities, the microscope is equipped with an automated programmable specimen stage and appropriate software for residual gunshot-residue analysis, and it has an oversized chamber that permits multi-specimen analysis without operator intervention. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The state-of-the-art electron microscope with its expanded capabilities will have a major impact on the quality of research and teaching at the university. In particular, the equipment will provide an opportunity for university researchers in the Forensic Science Partnership and the State Crime Laboratory, located on campus, to develop new courses in textile classification, soils and marine specimen identification, and biological residue tracing. It will present new research opportunities in forensics such as residual gunshot residue analysis and bloodstain analysis. The university investigators in the Sensors and Surface Technology Partnership will also benefit from the acquisition. They are engaged in developing specialty thin-film materials for high sensitivity sensor applications ranging from optical strain gages to GMR high-density hard disk readers. Almost all of these materials developments depend on the ability to analyze rapidly and accurately the chemical composition, morphologies, and structures of the thin film materials involved in these devices, which frequently extend into the realm of nanotechnology.</AbstractNarration>
