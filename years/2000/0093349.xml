<AbstractNarration>CCR-0093349&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates aspects of reliable communications for very&lt;br/&gt;different types of network variability.&lt;br/&gt;The first part of the project is concerned with capacity and robustness of&lt;br/&gt;networks to permanent failures such as removal of a link or node. The&lt;br/&gt;approach in this project moves away from a pure graph-theoretic approach,&lt;br/&gt;based purely on routing, to consider network capacity using an algebraic&lt;br/&gt;framework. Capacity is considered as the characterization of  the set of&lt;br/&gt;connections that can be supported by a network in which the nodes are not&lt;br/&gt;only capable of traditional routing functions, but can also perform&lt;br/&gt;processing of the data that arrives to them. Such processing is considered&lt;br/&gt;as a code over the network. Coding is also applied to recovery to maintain&lt;br/&gt;certain connections in a network even after failure of a portion of the&lt;br/&gt;network, for instance after the disappearance of a link in the network. The&lt;br/&gt;second part of the project considers robustness in channels where fading&lt;br/&gt;varies over both time and frequency, especially over ultra wide frequency&lt;br/&gt;bands. The goal of this part of the project is to establish theoretical&lt;br/&gt;results that relate capacity, peak power, energy, bandwith and probability&lt;br/&gt;of error in such a way as to characterize the practical achievable&lt;br/&gt;performance in wide band wireless systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first part of this project investigates the reliability of networks&lt;br/&gt;under normal and  failure conditions when coding is used to ensure&lt;br/&gt;continuity of connections. This project shows that traditional methods of&lt;br/&gt;recovery in networks, such as rerouting, are subsets of network coding and&lt;br/&gt;establishes coding methods to increase the realibility of networks under&lt;br/&gt;failure conditions. Moreover, the projects investigates the issue of network&lt;br/&gt;management, where network management represents the information needed to&lt;br/&gt;modify the behavior of the network, defined as the code of the network, in&lt;br/&gt;response to failures. The algebraic approach taken in this project allows&lt;br/&gt;some characterization of the fundamental limits of the number of bits&lt;br/&gt;required to effect changes on the network code and of the portions of the&lt;br/&gt;network that require knowledge of failures. The second part of the project&lt;br/&gt;considers capacity of very wide band channels and the applicability of&lt;br/&gt;different types of signals and codes to achieve performance at or near the&lt;br/&gt;theoretical maximum. In particular, it explores to what extent very high&lt;br/&gt;peak power symbols, which are known to achieve capacity in the limit of very&lt;br/&gt;large bandwidths, are necessary to achieve capacity. The project also&lt;br/&gt;explores the ranges of bandwidth in which ultra-wideband results are&lt;br/&gt;achievable. This work bridges the theoretical limits of the channel&lt;br/&gt;(capacity) with the applicability of the techniques that achieve capacity by&lt;br/&gt;providing an explicit bound to the probability of error in terms of rate,&lt;br/&gt;bandwidth and peak power of the signal. Finally, the project consider the&lt;br/&gt;applicability, in the range of moderate to large bandwidths, of traditional&lt;br/&gt;spread spectrum approaches, such as direct-sequence code-division multiple&lt;br/&gt;access, that perform poorly in the limit of very large bandwidths.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
