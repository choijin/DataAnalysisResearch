<AbstractNarration>The MATE Center is building upon its past achievements in order to increase its impact on marine technology education and enhance student preparation for marine technology careers. In light of the national need for a well-prepared technical workforce and the changing ways in which society views technician work, MATE is building partnerships and collaborations that improve marine technical education and increase public awareness of technical education and career opportunities. They are also developing or enhancing model marine technology associate degree programs at Monterey Peninsula College and MATE partner community colleges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center has five major goals. These are to: (1) build active partnerships; (2) identify industry needs and develop industry guidelines for curricula development; (3) increase the quality and availability of curricula; (4) provide professional development for faculty and teachers; and (5) increase outreach and dissemination. The Center is building active partnerships with business, industry, research and academic institutions, and professional societies by strengthening existing partnerships and developing new ones. These partnerships are an important part of the Center's efforts to assess industry's needs. These needs in turn are being used to create industry-driven guidelines for curriculum development. These guidelines then form the basis for the development of skill competency clusters that reach across numerous occupations. The Center is also working with government agencies to define specific marine technical occupations. The guidelines and skill clusters form the basis of the Center's efforts to improve the availability and quality of curriculum and instructional materials at the high school and college level. Monterey Peninsula College is piloting this effort. The Center is offering an annual faculty summer institute and faculty internships to foster the process. Dissemination of Center products and information is being carried out using the Web site, extensive information services, conference attendance, and site visits to other programs and industry.</AbstractNarration>
