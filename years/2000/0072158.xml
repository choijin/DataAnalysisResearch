<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0072158&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Bong H. Lian&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses problems in three closely related areas in&lt;br/&gt;the context of mirror symmetry and duality. As a continuation of&lt;br/&gt;current joint work with K. Liu and S.T. Yau, Lian proposes to&lt;br/&gt;both generalize and specialize their theory ("mirror principle")&lt;br/&gt;for studying characteristic classes of vector bundles on a stable&lt;br/&gt;map moduli space. First, this work has thus far considered convex&lt;br/&gt;projective manifolds.  Dropping the convexity assumption is&lt;br/&gt;important if one wishes to consider general Calabi-Yau&lt;br/&gt;manifolds. Part I of this proposal outlines an approach which is&lt;br/&gt;expected to lead to the full generalization of mirror principle&lt;br/&gt;in in genus zero. The main new input here is a way to combine the&lt;br/&gt;difficult machinery of virtual cycles and the many ingredients of&lt;br/&gt;the mirror principle. Second, the mirror principle can be&lt;br/&gt;specialized to surfaces and many new questions which have&lt;br/&gt;recently arisen in local mirror symmetry, as well as enumerative&lt;br/&gt;geometry on surfaces.  In the former case partition functions of&lt;br/&gt;a given genus are related to modular forms whenever the&lt;br/&gt;underlying surface is elliptic. In the latter case, enumerating&lt;br/&gt;curves of a given genus with suitable incidence in a surface also&lt;br/&gt;yields modular forms. This project seeks to understand modularity&lt;br/&gt;from the point of view of characteristic classes of vector&lt;br/&gt;bundles on stable map moduli spaces. For positive genus, the&lt;br/&gt;mirror principle requires yet another generalization.  In Part II&lt;br/&gt;of this project, Hosono, Lian, Liu and Yau will examine these new&lt;br/&gt;questions. In recent joint work of Hosono, Lian and Yau, they&lt;br/&gt;have settled the problem of constructing the ubiquitous large&lt;br/&gt;radius limit for the "universal" family of Calabi-Yau&lt;br/&gt;hypersurfaces in a toric manifold. In Part III Lian, Todorov and&lt;br/&gt;Yau will study this limit for more general families.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;String physics is an ambitious effort to unify all the&lt;br/&gt;fundamental forces of nature. A remarkable prediction of String&lt;br/&gt;Theory is that nature apparently allows for many different&lt;br/&gt;versions of spacetimes.  A major current problem in string&lt;br/&gt;physics is to understand how a plethora of apparently different&lt;br/&gt;spacetimes are related, often in an unexpected and remarkable&lt;br/&gt;ways, under the rubric of ``String Duality''. Mirror symmetry is&lt;br/&gt;a special yet nontrivial case of String Duality. Though they come&lt;br/&gt;in vast variety, the spacetimes in questions are still highly&lt;br/&gt;restricted.  They turn out to be a class of geometrical objects,&lt;br/&gt;known as Calabi-Yau manifolds, which have been studied by&lt;br/&gt;mathematicians for over 100 years.  Physicists have discovered&lt;br/&gt;that string theories associated to certain pairs of Calabi-Yau&lt;br/&gt;manifolds ("mirror pairs") are equivalent.  This project aims at&lt;br/&gt;understanding the geometry of these mirror manifolds from the&lt;br/&gt;mathematical point of view.  A constant exchange of insights and&lt;br/&gt;feedback between physicists and mathematicians on mirror symmetry&lt;br/&gt;and other issues has been a hallmark of String Theory in its last&lt;br/&gt;20 years of development.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
