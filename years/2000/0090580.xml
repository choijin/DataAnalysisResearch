<AbstractNarration>In contrast to the short-lived model organisms most frequently studied by biologists (e.g., worms, flies, and mice), clonal colonial animals are relatively persistent and long-lived, occupying a given habitat for long periods of time.  Such longevity presents environmental challenges not faced by more ephemeral organisms.  Food supply, for instance, may vary in space and time in such habitats, and adjusting the timing and spacing of feeding structures (polyps) and gastrovascular connections may represent a major challenge for animals such as colonial hydroids.  Signaling by redox state (e.g., the relative oxidation or reduction of mitochondrial electron carriers and of the NAD+/NADH pool) is a reliable mechanism by which such an environmental signal can be transduced into pattern-forming gene activity.  For instance, if a growing hydroid colony encounters an area locally rich in food, polyps in the food-rich area will experience a surfeit of nutrients.  These nutrients will trigger contractions of polyp epitheliomuscular cells and resulting gastrovascular flow, and the colony's local redox state may be altered relative to that outside the food-rich area.  If such a metabolic gradient can differentially affect the timing of polyp and stolon tip development, adaptive changes in the local pattern of colony development can result.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using image analysis to assess colony development, polarographic measures to quantify oxygen uptake, fluorescent microscopy of NAD(P)H to measure redox state, fluorescent microscopy of 2', 7'-dichlorofluorescin diacetate to visualize reactive oxygen species, and video microscopy to quantify gastrovascular flow, this proposal will elucidate the role of redox control in adaptive development of colonial hydroids. &lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;This work promises a clearer understanding of redox signaling and animal diversity.  Generally, the animal "model systems" of modern biology are short-lived, sexually reproducing, and aclonal.  Such organisms are unlikely to use redox signals to iterate and pattern themselves in the fashion described here.  Thus this work on simple, primitive, colonial animals can provide insight into redox signaling when it does occur in more derived animals, as for instance in the human vascular system.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
