<AbstractNarration>This experimental condensed matter physics project will explore the dynamics at high frequencies, 10-100 GHz, of electrons in mesoscopic conductors and superconductors. The studies will focus on noise, dephasing due to microwave photons, photon-stimulated energy distributions and enhanced super currents in superconducting/normal/superconducting structures. The project will also explore the effect of a superconducting phase difference on the quantum statistics of the noise, via cross-correlation measurements. The goal is to understand the dynamical behavior of these mixed superconductor-normal systems. The project will provide students with training in state-of-the art measurement techniques, and will prepare them for careers in academe, industry and government.&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;An important fundamental and technical issue connected with quantum mechanical systems,  such as superconductors, is how fast they respond to external electric and magnetic fields. These problems become more difficult when the quantum systems are very small in size. Thus the continual downsizing of microelectronic device structures to smaller and smaller sizes presents substantial measurement challenges, particularly at high frequencies, in the microwave region. This experimental condensed matter physics project will explore the dynamics at high frequencies, 10-100 GHz, of electrons in mesoscopic conductors and superconductors. The project will explore current flows in superconducting loops and across barriers through which electrons tunnel via quantum mechanical motion. The goal is to understand the dynamical behavior of these mixed superconductor-normal systems. New measurement techniques are being developed to reach these goals. The project will provide excellent training for students and post-docs in state-or-the are measurement methods. It will prepare them for careers in academe, industry and government.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
