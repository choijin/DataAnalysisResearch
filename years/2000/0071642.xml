<AbstractNarration>Abstract &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bayes and frequentist approaches are the two main paradigms for statistical inference.  Of late, likelihood-based methods are also being proposed in many inferential problems.  The proposed research falls in the interface and considers asymptotic inference in these paradigms.  Higher order asymptotic expansions play an important role in Bayes, frequentist and likelihood approaches to inference.  This proposal considers developing such expansions and using them in specific applications such as Bayesian experimental design, small area estimation and contingency tables.  Small area estimation is becoming increasingly popular in many federal and local government programs.  Both hierarchical Bayes and empirical Bayes approaches are receiving favorable attention from the users of small area statistics.  Hierarchical Bayes procedures rely to a great extent on the use of noninformative priors.  Indeed, the wider acceptance of Bayesian techniques in recent years both in the theory and in the practice of statistics is partly due to various noninformative priors.  Higher order asymptotics have been used by the PI in his past research to (i) develop second order accurate approximations to measure of uncertainty in small area estimation, (ii) calibrate naive EB confidence intervals, (iii) compare various adjustments to profile likelihoods in likelihood-based inference, and (iv) obtain frequentist validation of various noninformative priors.  Specifically, the following problems will be investigated: (a) Asymptotic comparison of adjusted likelihoods via expected volumes of confidence sets, mean squared errors of point estimates and other criteria; (b) Optimal Bayesian designs in variance components problem; (c) EB interval estimation with applications in small area estimation; (d) Frequentist validation of noninformative priors in the context of small area estimation; (e) Higher order expansion of null distribution of score tests in two-way contingency tables; (f) Robust estimation in small area estimation using survey weights.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research on small area estimation has received considerable attention in recent years due to growing demand for reliable small area statistics by federal and local government agencies (e.g., the U.S. Census Bureau, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Statistics Canada, Australian Bureau of Statistics, Central Statistical Office of U.K.).  A small area usually refers to a subgroup of a population from which samples are drawn.  The subgroup may be a geographical region (e.g., county) or a group obtained by cross-classification of demographic factors.  Reliable small area statistics are needed in regional planning and fund allocation in many federal and local government programs.  Currently, the Census Bureau is engaged in developing small area estimates of number of poor children in school-going age at the county level, and developing adjustment factors to the census counts for various geographic and demographic classes.  Experimental designs play an important role in agriculture and industrial productions.  Optimal designs allow experimenters to derive maximum utility for a given budget.  Categorical data, which occur abundantly in every fields of quantitative study, especially in social sciences, consist of frequency of counts in various categories of interest to an experimenter.  Statistical solutions to be developed here are expected to lead to new and useful methodolgies on the research problems considered in this proposal.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
