<AbstractNarration>Proposal: CMS-0099638&lt;br/&gt;PI: Dorothy Reed&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Washington&lt;br/&gt;Date: May 22, 2001&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT CMS0099638 "Performance of Electric Utility Lifelines in Urban Centers for Earthquake Hazards" PI: Dorothy Reed, University of Washington. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The utility infrastructure system in the US is undergoing significant changes due to deregulation. Recently, structural component failures induced by natural hazards previously considered minor have caused widespread blackouts. The effects of shortages due to natural and man-made causes has been particularly critical for the Pacific Northwest, as compliance with environmental standards places constraints on the generation of power.  It has become clear that the US lacks a cohesive approach to electric utility infrastructure reliability.  Such a framework would be valuable in identifying the importance of system components and ultimately provide guidelines for improved performance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We propose to develop a reliability-based framework for the performance assessment of power delivery by an electric utility distribution system for earthquake hazards. The distribution system is defined to include components such as the distribution lines, poles, pole-based equipment and substations. Our framework will be focused on the performance of the structural system used to deliver power and its interactions with other critical lifelines.  Our approach will significantly expand the three-pronged model developed by Nojima of Gifu University in Japan in which component, system and societal performance measures are blended into a single standard. The valuable lessons learned through the Hyogoken-Nanbu (Kobe) and Nisqually earthquakes will also be incorporated into our investigation. This investigation will require the formulation of proposed performance levels in the context of the present US socio-economic, regulatory and political climate.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A major contribution of our project will be to explicitly include, and ultimately clarify, the role of the non-technical constraints of regulations, and in so doing, implicitly evaluate the conditional influence of the political climate upon the development of levels of performance for a US location. Although we will focus on a specific locale within the US [the Pacific Northwest], the adaptation of our approach to other locations in the US should be straightforward. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
