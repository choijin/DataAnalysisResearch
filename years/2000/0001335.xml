<AbstractNarration>This award is for partial support for the cost of an Engineering Foundation Conference entitled "Processing and Catalytic/Chemical Properties of Nanostructured Materials" to be held in Maui, Hawaii from January 16 to 21, 2000.  The grant will provide partial travel support, registration, and accommodation expenses for invited speakers, young researchers, and students to attend the conference.  There is significant technological potential for the emerging of area of nanostructured materials in chemical processing, especially in relation to catalytic applications. Because of recent developments in new chemical synthesis methods and improved characterization techniques, there are now possibilities for designing features for reactive materials on the nanometer scale.  Research advances in the past few years have clearly shown that nanostructure design can substantially improve the surface characteristics of materials as well as offering new insights into the structure sensitivity of chemical reactions.  In view of the great interest in nanostructured materials and the importance of catalytic materials to industrial processes, it is timely to have a conference that will bring together international researchers from academia and industry to present advances in the fields of chemical processing and catalytic properties of nanostructured materials and to discuss future research directions.</AbstractNarration>
