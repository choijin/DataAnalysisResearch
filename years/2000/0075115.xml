    <AbstractNarration>Tasayco&lt;br/&gt;0075115&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to establish the principles underlying oligomerization of disordered polypeptide chains through the zippering of b strands. Fragments of oxidized E. coli thioredoxin, a single domain a /b proteins of 108 residues well studied by fragment complementation, provide a unique opportunity to study oligomerization in the absence of the fully complementary fragment. The fragment 1-37 self assembles to produce large molecular weight homo-oligomers, and also interacts with fragment 74-108 to form hetero-oligomers. These homo and hetero-oligomers will be examined using recently developed solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (SSNMR) methods, as well as complementary biochemical and biophysical standard techniques to determine the topology. Solid state nuclear magnetic resonance methodologies are a powerful tool for detailed structural analysis of oligomers. This is a POWRE proposal, for the PI, a leader in studying protein recognition by fragment complementation, to collaborate with a colleague in a nearby institution who is experienced in SSNMR, and to learn these techniques.</AbstractNarration>
