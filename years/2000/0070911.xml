<AbstractNarration>0070911&lt;br/&gt;Zelevinsky&lt;br/&gt; The most important problems for nuclear physics in the new century are related to the boundaries of the existence of nuclei, properties of very short-lived isotopes and the clarification of the path of the synthesis of chemical elements in stars in the process of the evolution of the Universe. Recent developments in accelerators and experimental technology now make it possible to produce thousands of new isotopes and study their physics.  Along this road it will be possible to study what is the origin of the elements of the cosmos, what are the features of nuclear matter with unusual proton-neutron composition, what are sizes, shapes and excitation modes of exotic nuclei. The large discovery potential of nuclear physics in this vast terra incognita was already demonstrated by observation of nuclear halos, new types of radioactivity, superheavy elements and so on. Nuclear theory must meet a great challenge and find a consistent way of describing new phenomena and making reliable predictions for the future.  The proposal is directed toward achieving that goal. We hope to address a few important issues such as the limits of nuclear stability, nuclear reactions of astrophysical interest, the description of loosely bound nuclear systems, new cluster effects, new modes of collective behavior, weak interactions in exotic systems,the coexistence of chaotic and regular dynamics far from the line of nuclear stability. As happened in the past, the new theoretical approaches and computational methods are expected to cross-fertilize other areas of physics - mainly astrophysics and physics of mesoscopic systems.</AbstractNarration>
