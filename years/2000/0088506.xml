<AbstractNarration>Biological Sciences (61)  As part of a comprehensive reform to create a student-centered natural sciences learning community, we have implemented a new curriculum for Biology majors that stresses hands-on, experiential learning and provides progressively greater opportunities for semi-independent student research. In particular, our introductory biology course utilizes many approaches to assist Freshman students in transitioning to an active learning environment. First, to encourage students to embrace active learning, we have integrated an interactive, Web-based teaching strategy called Just-in-Time Teaching into the lecture component of the Principles of Biology I course. This strategy uses the rapid communication made possible by the Internet to keep students actively involved in the course and to allow the instructor to adjust lessons rapidly in response to student needs. Second, we utilize a desensitization strategy to address our students' unfamiliarity with the role of technology in research. By introducing two new experimental packages (instruments and organisms) into the laboratory component of the course in a two-week format, we are able to reduce student anxiety and foster mentoring. These two new experimental packages are based on adaptations of a gene structure and genetic homology laboratory developed at Davidson College and a Sea Anemone energetics laboratory developed at Hood College. Pre-service teachers are involved in all aspects of the projects as Freshman students enrolled in the course and later on as graduate assistants. Saturday morning workshops provide additional exposure to hands-on learning activities for both pre-service and in-service teachers. The combination of active and interactive teaching strategies have particularly positive effects on learning.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
