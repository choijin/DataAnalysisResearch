<AbstractNarration> &lt;br/&gt;Materials technology and science are an integral part of the manufacturing process and a key area of technician education. However, many academic and vocational instructors do not have experience in new materials technologies. To meet the materials training and curriculum requirements of high school and community college technology instructors, a curriculum and training center for Enhancement of Materials Technology for manufacturing (EMTECH) is being established at Edmonds Community College (EdCC), in Lynnwood, Washington. The project builds upon prior work in the areas of curriculum development, teacher training and student programs in Materials Technology, and upon participants' input from related NSF ATE Projects. In addition to a permanent facility at EdCC, EMTECH is utilizing facilities at high schools, community colleges, universities, professional organizations, and industry located throughout the nation as required for training and special workshops. Teacher training workshops are being held at three partner community colleges: Metropolitan Community Colleges, Kansas City, Missouri, Sinclair Community College, Dayton, Ohio; and Hudson Valley Community College, Troy, New York. The proposed project includes a clearinghouse to provide instructors nationally with the resources needed to help their students make better design and manufacturing process choices. These resources are being provided through workshops, field trips, curriculum development and materials, professional society and industry contacts, and Internet web pages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
