<AbstractNarration>Proposal # HRD-0099216  &lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Missouri at Columbia&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Gregory Holliday&lt;br/&gt;Title: "INTEGRATION OF ADAPTIVE TECHNOLOGY AND CLINICAL&lt;br/&gt;ASSESSMENT INTO MATHEMATICS"&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Department of Mathematics of the University of Missouri - Columbia (MU) in a unique collaboration with the university's Adaptive Computing Technology (ACT) Center and the Assessment and Consultation Clinic (ACC), proposes to create a highly supportive mathematics learning environment for students with learning disabilities (LD).  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will ensure retention and success in mathematics for students with LD by:  &lt;br/&gt;1.  enabling students with LD to amplify and successfully apply intact cognitive processes by using adaptive computing technology (ACT);  &lt;br/&gt;2.  increasing institutional capacity of the MU Department of Mathematics to effectively identify and instruct students with LD; and by  &lt;br/&gt;3.  developing field placement opportunities to support successful school-to-work transitions.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Success in mathematics depends on perceiving, processing, retaining, retrieving, and applying complex information.  A deficiency in any of these capacities places students with LD at high risk for failure.  Often, students have more than sufficient cognitive capacity to comprehend mathematical concepts and master essential skills if they have appropriate classroom and testing accommodations.  While technologies exist to compensate for weak processing capacities in students with LD, such technologies are of little benefit if they are not appropriately customized to the student or effectively utilized in the classroom.  In addition, the link between specific learning disabilities and appropriate compensatory technology, especially as applied to postsecondary students enrolled in mathematics coursework, has been largely conjectural.  Instructors and students have therefore underused this strategy.  Postsecondary success of students with disabilities has remained unsatisfactory.  The proposed model for mathematics instruction of postsecondary students with LD will consist of:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Enhancement of mathematics instructors' awareness of LD and how to effectively teach        students with LD through collaborative trainings offered by the ACT Center and the ACC;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;2. Collaboration between the ACC and ACT Center to link specific LDs to appropriate technology; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. Integration of the technology accommodations of the ACT Center into mathematics curriculum and instruction;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4. Collaboration among all three units (ACT Center, ACC, and Department of Mathematics) to identify placement opportunities and maximize student learning opportunities in the workplace. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
