    <AbstractNarration>0075823&lt;br/&gt;Nelson&lt;br/&gt;This award provides support for the travel of U.S. graduate students and post-doctoral fellows to participate in the Gordon Research Conference "Lasers in Medicine and Biology". Support is being provided primarily on the basis of research merit, however special consideration is to be given to applicants involved in biomedical engineering laser research. Selection of awardees will be by vote of the conference and session chairs based on information provided by applicants in response to the requirements in the application form. The form is to be sent by email to directors of all laser research laboratories plus graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in those institutions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Gordon Research Conference is one of the most useful meetings in the emerging fields of photomedicine and biomedical optics. The top research groups in this field are represented in the program. The major goal of the conference is to bring together key researchers from academia, industry and government to examine the future applications of lasers and the optical sciences in medicine. The graduate students and post-doctoral fellows that will be supported by this grant will benefit greatly from participating in this excellent meeting and listening to the talks given by the top researchers in the field. One of the valuable features of this meeting is the large amount of time devoted to discussion time in the informal atmosphere which lends itself to valuable interaction among the participants.</AbstractNarration>
