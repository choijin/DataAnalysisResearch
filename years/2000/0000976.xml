<AbstractNarration>The Division of Undergraduate Education (DUE) has funded Collaboratives for Excellence in Teacher Preparation (CETP) to prepare more teachers of mathematics and science to fill increasing demand; to produce a more diverse supply of mathematics and science teachers; and to prepare better teachers of mathematics and science at both the elementary and secondary level. However, there is little research on the effects that these innovations have had or would have on the education of prospective teachers. Therefore, this proposal seeks funds to examine one CETP project -- the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Teacher Education Collaborative (STEMTEC) -- as a way to gain knowledge that would allow us to identify and better understand the ways such a project affects the development of new science teachers. In particular, we will focus on the effects of STEMTEC on undergraduates enrolled in science courses and preservice teacher education programs, and the K12 teachers who have collaborated in the development and implementation of STEMTEC activities. In short, we seek to understand how and why STEMTEC innovations lead to, or fail to produce, a larger number and more diverse body of better prepared K12 science teachers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
