<AbstractNarration>Strogatz&lt;br/&gt;0078074&lt;br/&gt;     In several branches of science and technology, one like&lt;br/&gt;would like to imitate nature's success at designing networks that&lt;br/&gt;can synchronize themselves.  For instance, a semiconductor laser&lt;br/&gt;array generates greater collective power when it synchronizes,&lt;br/&gt;but such phase-locked operation is notoriously difficult to&lt;br/&gt;achieve in practice.  The investigator studies the nonlinear&lt;br/&gt;dynamics of oscillator networks, using mathematical methods of&lt;br/&gt;dynamical systems theory, bifurcation theory, and statistical&lt;br/&gt;mechanics, along with numerical simulation.  Three projects&lt;br/&gt;explore how synchrony emerges in a group of dissimilar&lt;br/&gt;oscillators, motivated by both biological and laser applications.&lt;br/&gt;Areas of investigation include the stability of partial locking&lt;br/&gt;in the Kuramoto model of coupled biological oscillators; the&lt;br/&gt;dynamics of biological oscillators coupled by phase-response&lt;br/&gt;curves; and phase-locking in slightly detuned laser arrays.  Two&lt;br/&gt;other projects address the relation between the connectivity of a&lt;br/&gt;network and its ability to synchronize.  Small-world networks,&lt;br/&gt;which combine small diameter with large clustering, are&lt;br/&gt;investigated to test whether they synchronize more readily than&lt;br/&gt;lattices.&lt;br/&gt;     The goal of this project is to develop a deeper&lt;br/&gt;understanding of complex systems that are made of many&lt;br/&gt;oscillating parts and that manage to synchronize themselves.  For&lt;br/&gt;instance, the thousands of pacemaker cells in the heart always&lt;br/&gt;fire in unison, even though they are all slightly different from&lt;br/&gt;one another.  Unfortunately, a similar kind of coordination&lt;br/&gt;sometimes happens in the brain, where it leads to epilepsy.  In&lt;br/&gt;both cases, nature has provided us with examples in which&lt;br/&gt;millions of cells begin to act in unison.  By understanding&lt;br/&gt;better how this synchrony is achieved, it should be possible to&lt;br/&gt;design arrays of technologically important devices that can&lt;br/&gt;synchronize themselves.  Such self-synchronizing systems would&lt;br/&gt;have important technological applications in many areas of&lt;br/&gt;national interest, including environment (atmospheric pollution&lt;br/&gt;monitoring uses sensitive detectors based on arrays of&lt;br/&gt;oscillators), civil infrastructure (the proper functioning of the&lt;br/&gt;national power grid depends on self-synchronization of the&lt;br/&gt;generator network), and nanotechnology (where arrays of millions&lt;br/&gt;of microscopic mechanical oscillators are being used in new&lt;br/&gt;devices).&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
