<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0070405&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Muhly will study a variety of problems in operator algebra that may be&lt;br/&gt;divided into three groups: General Operator Algebras, Groupoids, and&lt;br/&gt;Toeplitz and Related Operators.  Under the first heading are found a number&lt;br/&gt;of problems pertaining to the structure and representation theory of&lt;br/&gt;non-self-adjoint operator algebras.  The theory of these algebras has been&lt;br/&gt;reinvigorated in recent years through advances in what has come to be known&lt;br/&gt;as quantized functional analysis, i.e., the theory of operator spaces.  This&lt;br/&gt;subject coupled with the recent work of Muhly and Solel that identifies the&lt;br/&gt;C*-envelopes of various very general operator algebras allows one to make&lt;br/&gt;good progress on the program proposed more than thirty years ago by Wm.&lt;br/&gt;Arveson as a generalization of the Sz.-Nagy - Foias model theory of&lt;br/&gt;contraction operators on Hilbert space: study the representations of an&lt;br/&gt;operator algebra in terms of the C*-representations of its C*-envelope. In&lt;br/&gt;the area of groupoids, emphasis will be placed on the study of Fell bundles&lt;br/&gt;over groupoids.  The impetus for this study comes from the representation&lt;br/&gt;theory of groupoids and from efforts to understand co-actions of groupoids.&lt;br/&gt;Further, these bundles (more accurately, generalizations of them) occur in&lt;br/&gt;the theory of product systems and the structure of non-self-adjoint operator&lt;br/&gt;algebras just mentioned.  Toeplitz operators have long been a subject of&lt;br/&gt;intense interest in operator algebra/theory.  In recent years Muhly and Xia&lt;br/&gt;have identified the automorphisms of the C*-algebra generated by all&lt;br/&gt;Toeplitz operators.  The identification is described in terms of constructs&lt;br/&gt;that have played important roles in function theory and harmonic analysis on&lt;br/&gt;the disc.  A particular importance is played by commutator singular&lt;br/&gt;integrals.   Muhly proposes to extend these results, to the extent possible,&lt;br/&gt;to multivariable settings.  Again, commutator singular integrals should play&lt;br/&gt;a decisive role, but the jump to dimensions greater than one presents&lt;br/&gt;difficult challenges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Muhly's work on non-self-adjoint operator algebras, while inspired primarily&lt;br/&gt;by developments in pure mathematics, has connections with problems of an&lt;br/&gt;applied nature, most particularly, mathematical systems theory - the theory&lt;br/&gt;of so-called H-infinity control. This, basically, is a body of knowledge&lt;br/&gt;dedicated to the problem of building machines, such as cars and airplanes,&lt;br/&gt;so that they meet certain performance criteria.  Among these are such things&lt;br/&gt;as the responsiveness of the steering wheel, in the case of cars, or the&lt;br/&gt;rudder, in the case of airplanes.  In short, Muhly's work will contribute to&lt;br/&gt;theoretical underpinnings of design problems ensuring the safety of all&lt;br/&gt;sorts of conveyances.  Much of Muhly's work on tensor algebras over&lt;br/&gt;C*-correspondences, which has been inspired by the operator theory that&lt;br/&gt;underwrites this kind of control theory, seems to be usable in multivariable&lt;br/&gt;control problems.  Indeed, quite serendipitously, it appears to be&lt;br/&gt;ready-made for multivariable problems.  Muhly expects his research to&lt;br/&gt;provide a theoretical underpinning of multivariable control problems that&lt;br/&gt;here-to-fore have been handled by essentially ad hoc methods.  Muhly's work&lt;br/&gt;in non-self-adjoint algebras and the theory of groupoids has made unexpected&lt;br/&gt;connections with quantum Markov processes - the theory of so-called open&lt;br/&gt;systems that arise in a variety of places such as the theory of lasers and&lt;br/&gt;materials science devoted to super conductivity.  They also arise naturally&lt;br/&gt;in quantum field theory through the constructs known as sectors.  It is&lt;br/&gt;anticipated that Muhly's work will help to provide the mathematical&lt;br/&gt;underpinnings of quantum field theory and advances in laser and materials&lt;br/&gt;science.  Finally, Muhly's work on Toeplitz operators has made connections&lt;br/&gt;with perturbation theories that arise in areas of relativistic quantum&lt;br/&gt;theory and in quantum chemistry.  It is anticipated that his projects on&lt;br/&gt;higher dimensional Toeplitz operators will have an increased impact in this&lt;br/&gt;arena.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
