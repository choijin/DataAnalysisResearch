<AbstractNarration>     Toward building large-scale switches, the current industry focus is on increasing packet handling&lt;br/&gt;capacities of switch fabrics from Gb/s to Tb/s. Although an increase in packet handling&lt;br/&gt;capacities and line card data rates requires a corresponding increase in call handling capacities of&lt;br/&gt;switches, this problem has received little attention. This is because most of the work on scalability&lt;br/&gt;of packet switch fabrics has targeted connectionless internet protocol (IP) routers, while call handling&lt;br/&gt;arises only in connection-oriented networks. However, in the last few years, resource reservation&lt;br/&gt;to support Quality-of-Service (QoS) guaranteed flows has gained attention. Internet&lt;br/&gt;Engineering Task Force (IETF) is addressing this issue by augmenting IP routers with connection-oriented&lt;br/&gt;capabilities.&lt;br/&gt;     In a connection-oriented network, the signaling protocol that is used to set up and release connections&lt;br/&gt;impacts its call handling capacity. Signaling messages can be complex with many parameters&lt;br/&gt;and timers and the state information associated with calls can become unwieldy.&lt;br/&gt;Consequently, signaling protocols have traditionally been implemented in software. QoS control&lt;br/&gt;solutions are being developed and evaluated based on the premise that call handling capacities do&lt;br/&gt;not scale with the packet handling capacities of switch fabrics. This assumption regarding call&lt;br/&gt;handling capacities has also relegated circuit-switched networks, including high-speed Wave-length&lt;br/&gt;Division Multiplexed networks, to just serve as wires. This proposal challenges this basic&lt;br/&gt;assumption by demonstrating call handling capacities in the order of millions of calls/sec. Changing&lt;br/&gt;this basic assumption regarding call handling capacities would indeed have a far-reaching&lt;br/&gt;impact on both QoS control mechanisms for packet-switched networks, and on the use of emerging&lt;br/&gt;high-speed circuit-switched networks for challenging new applications.&lt;br/&gt;     Our solution approach is to implement signaling protocols in reconfigurable Field Programmable&lt;br/&gt;Gate Array (FPGA) hardware. FPGAs can be reprogrammed as signaling protocols evolve&lt;br/&gt;while significantly improving the call handling capacities relative to software implementation. To&lt;br/&gt;manage complexity, we propose to implement the basic and frequently-used operations of the protocol&lt;br/&gt;in hardware, and relegate the complex and infrequently-used operations to software. In contrast&lt;br/&gt;to stateless protocols, signaling protocols maintain state information for each call. To&lt;br/&gt;manage associated memory requirements, we propose to maintain only the essential state information&lt;br/&gt;for each call in hardware. In this project we propose to (i) implement a typical signaling&lt;br/&gt;protocol in FPGAs, (ii) design a switch controller board using the signaling protocol FPGAs, and&lt;br/&gt;(iii) quantify measures of the implementation to demonstrate achievable call handling capacities.</AbstractNarration>
