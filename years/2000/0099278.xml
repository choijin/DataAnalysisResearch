<AbstractNarration>We trust others to gain the benefits of cooperation.  In the business&lt;br/&gt;world, trust supports interfirm alliances, acceptance of organizational&lt;br/&gt;change, the transfer of knowledge, and more.  In public life, trust&lt;br/&gt;underlies voting for candidates and support for government initiatives. &lt;br/&gt;In private life, trust guides relations among patients, physicians, and&lt;br/&gt;medical organizations.   Given this clear, pervasive importance of trust&lt;br/&gt;to our lives, it is not surprising that it has become the focus of a&lt;br/&gt;growing body of research activity.  The goal of our project is to test a&lt;br/&gt;new model of social trust within the applied context of environmental&lt;br/&gt;risk management.  Our model differs from others by clearly&lt;br/&gt;distinguishing social trust from confidence as separate, but&lt;br/&gt;interacting, paths to cooperation.  Social trust is based on judgments&lt;br/&gt;of values or intentions; confidence is based on judgments of past&lt;br/&gt;performance.  Social trust is associated with uncertainty and risk; it&lt;br/&gt;is required when confidence fails.  Confidence is the normal state of&lt;br/&gt;affairs, sometimes lost when performance is judged to be bad, but&lt;br/&gt;restorable through the establishment of social trust.  Social trust is a&lt;br/&gt;bridge between steady states; it has primacy and control over&lt;br/&gt;confidence.  Our model has clear, practical implications for the&lt;br/&gt;practice of risk management: attempts to communicate about performance&lt;br/&gt;(i.e., the management of risk) should be preceded by the establishment&lt;br/&gt;of social trust relations.  The state of trust relations conditions the&lt;br/&gt;interpretation of performance information.  In a state of distrust,&lt;br/&gt;presumably good performance information is discounted and does not lead&lt;br/&gt;to confidence.  Similarly, in a state of trust, presumably bad&lt;br/&gt;performance information does not lead to the loss of confidence.  Social&lt;br/&gt;trust, according to our model, is resilient, and helps us to remain&lt;br/&gt;confident in the lives we lead; it can be progressive or conservative. &lt;br/&gt;Our research project will provide a test of this model of social trust&lt;br/&gt;and confidence in risk management, improving our understanding, moving&lt;br/&gt;us closer to the goal of using social trust to improve our lives.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
