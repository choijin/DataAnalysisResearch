<AbstractNarration>Abstract :&lt;br/&gt;   &lt;br/&gt; In broad terms, the purpose of this project is to increase our knowledge about&lt;br/&gt;linear operators acting on a complex, separable, infinite dimensional Hilbert space.&lt;br/&gt;The proposer plans to continue work that was done under prior NSF grants, using&lt;br/&gt;results and techniques that were obtained in the recent past by the proposer, his&lt;br/&gt;coauthors, and his students, to accomplish this. In particular, the proposer will&lt;br/&gt;work on  the invariant subspace problem for various classes of operators such&lt;br/&gt;as the Lomonosov-amenable operators, the sub-n-normal operators, the contractions&lt;br/&gt;with spectral radius one, and the power bounded operators. These classes are more&lt;br/&gt;general than some others in which the proposer has been instrumental in the solution&lt;br/&gt;of the invariant subspace problem.&lt;br/&gt;    Operators on Hilbert space may be thought of as the natural generalization of&lt;br/&gt;finite complex matrices, and such matrices play an important role presently in&lt;br/&gt;the solution of many problems in the real world such as signal processing, populationstudies, various types of optimization procedures, etc. But the natural mathematical&lt;br/&gt;setting in which to cast certain problems in computing, quantum physics, nuclear&lt;br/&gt;fuel processing, etc. is in the more general setting of operators on Hilbert space.&lt;br/&gt;And there is ample evidence to show that knowledge about such operators, obtained&lt;br/&gt;from a purely mathematical investigation, very frequently is useful in resolving&lt;br/&gt;real-world problems of the sort mentioned above. This project aims to increase&lt;br/&gt;such basic knowledge about operators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
