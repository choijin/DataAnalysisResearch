    <AbstractNarration>The investigator's main theme is to explore the representation theory&lt;br/&gt;of wild finite dimensional algebras by analyzing specific classes of&lt;br/&gt;representations and the homomorphisms among them with an array of&lt;br/&gt;methods, ranging from geometric through combinatorial to&lt;br/&gt;homological. Roughly, these classes can be grouped under the&lt;br/&gt;following headings: (1) Classes of modules having fixed sequence of&lt;br/&gt;radical layers and, more generally, classes of modules with fixed top&lt;br/&gt;and fixed vector space dimension. (2) Classes of modules forming&lt;br/&gt;contravariantly finite or covariantly finite subcategories within the&lt;br/&gt;full category of finitely generated modules. (3) Classes of infinite&lt;br/&gt;direct sums (mainly of generic and finitely generated modules)&lt;br/&gt;enjoying finiteness conditions over their endomorphism rings. A&lt;br/&gt;related investigation aims at the geometry of finite complexes of&lt;br/&gt;modules and derived categories as an alternate setting for the study&lt;br/&gt;of maps among representations. There are methodological&lt;br/&gt;interconnections among these lines, as well as strong links in terms&lt;br/&gt;of the overall strategy of gaining a better understanding of algebras&lt;br/&gt;that have wild representation type. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Under a wider angle, the project should be seen in the following&lt;br/&gt;framework: The majority of our physical models for the universe are&lt;br/&gt;placed within finite dimensional vector spaces. Frequently, such&lt;br/&gt;spaces carry additional structure, such as a Lie or associative&lt;br/&gt;algebra structure, for example. Associative finite dimensional&lt;br/&gt;algebras are the objects of the investigator's research. One approach&lt;br/&gt;towards understanding them is to explore their representations, which&lt;br/&gt;can be thought of as 'linearized photographs' within sets of square&lt;br/&gt;matrices, both coarse-grained and fine-grained pictures containing&lt;br/&gt;valuable information. The representation type of the considered&lt;br/&gt;algebra is called 'tame' if the representations of any fixed matrix&lt;br/&gt;size can be subdivided into finitely many 'manageable' series (these&lt;br/&gt;series themselves may be infinite), otherwise it is called 'wild'.&lt;br/&gt;The wild case being the one predominantly encountered in mathematical&lt;br/&gt;nature, this is the case which the investigator is presently&lt;br/&gt;tackling. Her idea is to thoroughly understand important subclasses&lt;br/&gt;of the full class of representations of algebras of wild type, and to&lt;br/&gt;thus establish an interlinked mosaic of analyzed territory. Attention&lt;br/&gt;is being paid to choosing lines that optimally connect with the needs&lt;br/&gt;of adjacent fields (such as the theory of algebraic or quantum groups)&lt;br/&gt;and with the body of insights already established.</AbstractNarration>
