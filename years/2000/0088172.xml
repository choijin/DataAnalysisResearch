<AbstractNarration>Interdisciplinary (99)  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is introducing and integrating an interdisciplinary materials science emphasis into the undergraduate chemistry and physics programs. The objective of this new materials science and applied technology emphasis is to increase the number of undergraduate students choosing to study chemistry and physics, to foster collaboration, and to prepare students for increasingly interdisciplinary industry or research careers. The project includes development of a laboratory-based, team-taught interdisciplinary materials science course, and introduction of innovative discovery-based projects into the freshman laboratories. The project is adapting an inter-departmental approach utilized at Gustavus Adolphus College as well as specific laboratory projects developed in the materials physics course at Miami University. An upper-level course is using investigative, hands-on projects that model modern research collaborations in physics and chemistry. It is adapting an innovative, expert/novice, peer-learning scheme from Miami University in which students from two disciplines learn from each other. The hands-on projects in the course include the study of metals, semiconductors, superconductors, polymers, and other materials science topics presented from the perspectives of both disciplines. The equipment requested for this project is improving the freshman as well as the upper level chemistry and physics laboratory courses, providing a foundation for a materials science/applied technology emphasis in both departments. The equipment complements the expertise of the current faculty, and thereby helps to ensure the on-going growth of collaboration between the two departments beyond this specific project.</AbstractNarration>
