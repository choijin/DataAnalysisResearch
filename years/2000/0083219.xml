<AbstractNarration>0083219&lt;br/&gt;Kroll&lt;br/&gt;Complex fluids such as amphiphilic mixtures are characterized by structure on mesoscopic length-scales, ranging from nano-to micro-meters, and energy scales comparable to the thermal energy.   The mesoscale structures of these systems endow them with many interesting and unique features, and they are widely used in the processing, chemical, and energy industries.  The modeling of these systems requires the use of "coarse grained" or mesoscopic approaches that capture the essential physics of atomistic systems on the length scales of interest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mesoscopic structures which form in a wide range of self-assembling fluids consist of membranes which divide the material into distinct volumes.  Such two-dimensional assemblies can form a large number of thermodynamic phases, such as vesicles, lamellar or cubic crystals, and disordered bicontinuous networks.  They also determine the architecture of biological systems.  At the mesoscale, the elastic properties of these assemblies can be described using network models which consist of two-dimensional sheets of tethered particles.  These models have proven to be very versatile, and they can be used to model fixed connectivity surfaces, such as polymerized membranes, fiber mats, and thin elastic shells, dynamically triangulated surfaces, such as fluid membranes, and dynamically triangulated surfaces with fluctuating topology, such as microemulsions and sponge phases.  Monte Carlo simulations of network models have made a number of important contributions to our understanding of the equilibrium thermodynamics, structure, and phase behavior of these systems.  Experience gained using these simulations will be used to address new issues involving both the equilibrium and non-equilibrium behavior of these systems.  In particular, we will study the vesicle size distribution in dilute surfactant solutions, budding and vesiculation of clathrin coated membranes, and the shape, fluctuation spectrum, interaction, and dynamics of active membranes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We will also develop and implement a new particle-based mesoscopic simulation technique for fluid flow.  This approach retains many of the attractive features of other mesoscopic simulation schemes such as the lattice-Boltzmann and dissipative particle dynamics methods while avoiding several of their shortcomings.  Since it is a particle method, collisonal coupling to embedded polymers, membranes and vesicles is straightforward.  A significant benefit of the method is the ease and efficiency with which it can be implemented on parallel computers.  Part of this work will involve the extension of this appoach to treat binary and amphiphilic mixtures, using Landau-Ginzburg models to describe the equation of state of the fluid, and part will entail simulation studies of the rheology and dynamics of vesicles in flow, using network models to describe the membrane degrees of freedom and the new mesoscopic simulation technique for the solvent degrees of freedom.  One goal of this research is to obtain a better understanding of the viscoelastic behavior of vesicles under capillary flow conditions.  This work will be a first step towards integrating simulation techniques for network models of membranes with mesoscopic solvent simulation techniques.  We anticipate that this approach will have significant modeling advantages over more traditional methods for simulating flows with dynamic interfaces.  Furthermore, this work will lead to advanced parallel algorithms for mesoscopic modeling which we believe will be competitive with appoaches based on continuum mechanics.&lt;br/&gt;%%% &lt;br/&gt;This research will study the properties of complex fluids, such as those found in biological and polymeric solutions, using computer simulation techniques.  New simulation methods will be developed and applied using parallel computers.  The research has wide application.&lt;br/&gt;*** &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
