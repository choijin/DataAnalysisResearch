    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is directed at improving the capabilities of high resolution x-ray imaging systems. The enabling technology in this approach is a novel x-ray detector formed from transparent scintillation crystals. A prototype developed in Phase I demonstrates a spatial resolution of six microns. This surpasses the resolution of commercial systems based on microfocus x-ray sources, and is 4-6 times better than current x-ray detectors. Based on these results it is anticipated that a resolution of 1-2 microns can be achieved in Phase II. If fully successful, the end result of Phase II will be a commercialized x-ray microscope with five to ten times the resolution of existing products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;High-resolution x-ray imaging is used in many fields, including manufacturing, medicine, and scientific research. The product developed in Phase II will have better technical performance and be lower in cost that presently available systems.</AbstractNarration>
