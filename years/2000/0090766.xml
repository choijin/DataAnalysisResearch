<AbstractNarration>Research is proposed to investigate the extent and roles of polypeptide &lt;br/&gt;signaling in plants.  Animals and yeast utilize polypeptide signals for &lt;br/&gt;regulating a host of physiological processes, including stress, &lt;br/&gt;reproduction, development and defense, and many others. Until 1991, when &lt;br/&gt;this laboratory discovered the first polypeptide signal in plants, the &lt;br/&gt;accepted dogma was that plants did not utilize polypeptide signals, but used &lt;br/&gt;small chemical hormones such as auxin, cytokinins, gibberillins, ethylene &lt;br/&gt;and abscisic acid as regulators of physiological processes.  Since the first &lt;br/&gt;isolation of a polypeptide signal in 1991, four new polypeptide signals have &lt;br/&gt;been identified in other laboratories, and five more have been identified &lt;br/&gt;and purified in our laboratory.  The signaling polypeptides in plants &lt;br/&gt;reported to date are involved in defense, development, and reproduction.  &lt;br/&gt;Thus, we expect many more to be identified in the near future.  We have &lt;br/&gt;developed a novel, rapid assay to identify polypeptide signals in plants &lt;br/&gt;using suspension-cultured cells, which respond to receptor-mediated &lt;br/&gt;polypeptide signals by causing the pH of the cell culture medium to &lt;br/&gt;increase. Using the assay to monitor the signaling polypeptides during &lt;br/&gt;purification, we have identified five receptor-mediated polypeptide signals &lt;br/&gt;from tobacco, tomato and alfalfa and are utilizing the assay to investigate &lt;br/&gt;the presence of polypeptides throughout the plant kingdom. We have &lt;br/&gt;extensively studied the first discovered polypeptide defense signal that is &lt;br/&gt;released upon herbivore and pathogen attacks.  It is an 18 amino acid &lt;br/&gt;polypeptide isolated from tomato, that is derived from a 200 amino acid &lt;br/&gt;precursor.  We have published extensively on its signaling pathway in plants &lt;br/&gt;and have identified and isolated its receptor on tomato cell membranes.  We &lt;br/&gt;are currently isolating the receptor gene for studies of the structure and &lt;br/&gt;function of the receptor in tomato cells.  We are also seeking the genes for &lt;br/&gt;the new polypeptides we have isolated to determine their precursors, the &lt;br/&gt;mode of release and action, and their localization in plants.  We will &lt;br/&gt;continue to identify and isolate the receptors of these polypeptides and &lt;br/&gt;begin to learn the broad fundamental principles that underlie polypeptide &lt;br/&gt;signaling in plants.  Our studies of signaling polypeptides and their &lt;br/&gt;receptors in plants will provide an entirely new understanding of plant &lt;br/&gt;signaling for defense and development, with important relevance to ecology &lt;br/&gt;and agriculture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
