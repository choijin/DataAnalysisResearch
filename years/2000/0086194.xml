<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;The underlying purpose of the AK RSI has been to implement a set of initiatives to document&lt;br/&gt;the indigenous knowledge systems of Alaska Native people and develop pedagogical practices&lt;br/&gt;and curricula that appropriately incorporate indigenous knowledge and ways of knowing into&lt;br/&gt;the formal education system. The systemic reform focus of the AKRSI reform strategy is the&lt;br/&gt;fostering of connectivity and complementarity between two interdependent but historically&lt;br/&gt;disconnected, alienated complex systems - the indigenous knowledge systems rooted in the &lt;br/&gt;Native cultures that inhabit rural Alaska, and the formal education systems imported to serve &lt;br/&gt;the educational needs of rural Native communities. Within each of these evolving systems is &lt;br/&gt;a rich body of complementary scientific and mathematical knowledge that can serve to &lt;br/&gt;strengthen the educational experiences and improve the academic performance of students &lt;br/&gt;throughout rural Alaska. The following initiatives constitute AKRSI educational reform strategy: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Culturally Aligned Curriculum/Cultural Standards&lt;br/&gt;Village Science Applications and Careers/ANSES Chapters, Camps and Fairs&lt;br/&gt;Indigenous Science Knowledge Base/Multimedia Cultural Atlas Development&lt;br/&gt;Native Ways of Knowing/Parent Involvement&lt;br/&gt;Elders and Cultural Camps/Academy of Elders&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The initiatives above will be implemented on a region-by-region basis, building on Phase I&lt;br/&gt;to integrate the reform process into the everyday workings of the schools and districts&lt;br/&gt;to a sustainable level by the end of Phase Il.  Also an array of statewide intiative will be &lt;br/&gt;implemented to support the activities at the local and regional levels.&lt;br/&gt;Following is a summary of the statewide initiatives relative to the implementation of the &lt;br/&gt;Regional initiatives during Phase II.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Math/Science Performance Standards and Assessments&lt;br/&gt;Alaska Standards for Culturally Responsive Schools&lt;br/&gt;Cultural Frameworks for Curriculum&lt;br/&gt;Native Educator Associations&lt;br/&gt;Alaska Native Knowledge Network&lt;br/&gt;Consortium for Alaska Native Higher Education&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The experience and academic achievement successes gained during Phase I, are &lt;br/&gt;the basic strategy for Phase II, but will be continued with greater intensity and delineation. &lt;br/&gt;of emphases. The locus of activity will be in the same 20 rural school districts as partners &lt;br/&gt;in those schools with the primary differences during Phase II being the concentration of &lt;br/&gt;effort and increased emphases on sustainability of the initiatives.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
