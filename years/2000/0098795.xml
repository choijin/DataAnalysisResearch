    <AbstractNarration>The fundamental particles and interactions in nature are currently&lt;br/&gt;described by the Standard Model, with the sector of strong&lt;br/&gt;interactions described by Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). The quark&lt;br/&gt;mass eigenstates of QCD are related to the physical weak eigenstates&lt;br/&gt;of the Standard Model through the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM)&lt;br/&gt;matrix. A requirement of this matrix is that the sum of the squares&lt;br/&gt;of the three elements across each row or each column be unity. &lt;br/&gt;Currently, the sum for the first row falls below unity by 2 to 2-1/2&lt;br/&gt;standard deviations. The possible deficiency opens up the&lt;br/&gt;possibility for new physics, such as additional quark families or&lt;br/&gt;super-symmetry models. One of these matrix elements can be&lt;br/&gt;determined by a measurement of the decay rate of the K meson into a&lt;br/&gt;pion, a positron, and a neutrino, known as Ke3. Experiment E927 at&lt;br/&gt;Brookhaven National Laboratory will use the Crystal Ball &lt;br/&gt;spectrometer to make a new, high-precision measurement of the Ke3&lt;br/&gt;decay rate. This improvement by about a factor of 3 over the&lt;br/&gt;current value, along with new neutron decay experiments, will permit&lt;br/&gt;a critical test of CKM unitarity. Experiment E927 will also provide&lt;br/&gt;data concerning weak interactions in hadrons, and may help with the&lt;br/&gt;interpretation of recent related data on the production of neutron&lt;br/&gt;mesons from nucleons and nuclei.</AbstractNarration>
