<AbstractNarration>This is a project in Arithmetic Algebraic Geometry comprising&lt;br/&gt;two parts. The first part deals with the study of values of L-functions&lt;br/&gt;of varieties (motives) over number fields. In previous work the investigator&lt;br/&gt;and his collaborator have extended the conjectures of Bloch&lt;br/&gt;Kato, Fontaine, Perrin-Riou to motives with (possibly noncommutative)&lt;br/&gt;coefficients. At the same time they have established a precise link&lt;br/&gt;between these conjectures and classical Galois module theory, thereby&lt;br/&gt;generalizing various conjectures and theorems in this latter area to&lt;br/&gt;arbitrary motives. With the conjectural picture firmly in place, the&lt;br/&gt;main task now is to prove more cases. What seems within reach of&lt;br/&gt;current techniques are Tate motives over number fields, CM elliptic&lt;br/&gt;curves (with CM by non-maximal orders) and the adjoint of a modular&lt;br/&gt;form (with action of the integral Hecke algebra). The last two are&lt;br/&gt;currently looked into by students of the investigator. Equally within&lt;br/&gt;reach seems to be a proof of the compatibility of the equivariant special&lt;br/&gt;value conjectures with the functional equation of the L-function.&lt;br/&gt;The second part of the project is a rather concrete question in deformation&lt;br/&gt;theory (of schemes, vector bundles or representations of profinite&lt;br/&gt;groups). Using the theory of the cotangent complex one can define&lt;br/&gt;higher Kodaira Spencer maps and the investigator proposes to study&lt;br/&gt;the injectivity of these maps. In degree 1 this is known and leads to a&lt;br/&gt;criterion for smoothness of the deformation ring. The case of most&lt;br/&gt;interest is degree 2 where a similar injectivity would lead to a simple&lt;br/&gt;criterion for the deformation ring to be a local complete intersection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a project in number theory which has been part of the mathematical&lt;br/&gt;heritage ever since the Babylonians discovered that there can be triangles&lt;br/&gt;with all sides of integer length and one angle of ninety degrees. By the&lt;br/&gt;theorem of Pythagoras this gives integer solutions of an algebraic equation.&lt;br/&gt;Modern number theory still looks for integer solutions of algebraic equations&lt;br/&gt;but this search is informed and enriched by much deeper connections with ideas&lt;br/&gt;from geometry and topology than the ones alluded to in this introductory&lt;br/&gt;example.  The theory of special values of L-functions is a case in point. While defined&lt;br/&gt;by counting solutions of equations modulo prime number it turns out that values&lt;br/&gt;of these functions can sometimes be expressed in terms of integrals of&lt;br/&gt;differential forms, or volumes of certain lattices. Nobody knows exactly why such a relationship&lt;br/&gt;should hold. The examples one can prove all seem to rely on some happy&lt;br/&gt;coincidences, although they follow a pattern that leads one to guess ("conjecture") what&lt;br/&gt;happens in general. This is much like the situation in an experimental science. The&lt;br/&gt;investigator and his collaborator have generalized this picture to situations where the&lt;br/&gt;system of equations has some additional symmetries and they now try to collect&lt;br/&gt;further evidence for (or indeed falsify!) their conjectures. As far as applications are&lt;br/&gt;concerned, number theorists would probably agree that L-functions are a key concept in their&lt;br/&gt;field. On the other hand, number theory as a whole no longer needs to be defensive about its&lt;br/&gt;applicability, with much of cryptography and coding, on the internet and&lt;br/&gt;otherwise, being based on its results.</AbstractNarration>
