<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;CTS-0004499&lt;br/&gt;C. Montemagno, Cornell University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As current technology permits the production of nanostructures smaller than typical cell dimensions, it has become possible to consider useful applications based on their non-destructive, orderly injection inside the cells.  In this fashion, cells could be repaired or functionally modified.  Of special interest would be the possibility to inject biomolecular motors which could energize the self-assembly of nanostructures inside living cells.  This could be accomplished by developing arrays of nanosyringes, each of which to deliver chosen structures on preplanned location and time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed effort will unfold in three steps:&lt;br/&gt;1. The fabrication of individual ("standalone") syringes with dimensions suitable for the injection of biomolecular rotary motors (e.g. flagella/ATP), capable of initiating a variety of modifications inside a cell.  Silicon wafers will be shaped by existing etching processes, yielding a 10nm diameter for the tips and a 1-micron diameter for the shaft.  Testing will be done with green fluorescence protein measurements.&lt;br/&gt;2. Since many useful cell modifications may involve a number of different injections, it is desirable to produce, as a first step, a set of self-aligned syringe arrays.  These will allow, given a line-up of cells, for simultaneous (and possibly different) injections, followed by other injection patterns if so desired.  Testing will be similar to the standalone case.&lt;br/&gt;3. The syringes concepts discussed above will be refined: a suspension mechanism will make possible both vertical and horizontal controlled displacements of the syringe.  The motion will be tracked with the help of an optical microscope.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
