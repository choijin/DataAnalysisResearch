<AbstractNarration>0093525&lt;br/&gt;Pham&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The next generation of electronic integration will require a technology that can combine solid-state integrated circuits (IC), functional microelectromechanical devices (MEMS), passive components, and sensors into a package.  The demand for this multiple device integration poses substantial challenges at microwave and millimeter wave frequencies.  Furthermore, a major factor that must be addressed for millimeter wave applications is the development of integration techniques to miniaturize electronic components.&lt;br/&gt;The author proposes to develop an organic micromachining technique which provides revolutionary concepts to address the need for future millimeter wave integration (28-40 GHz).  The organic micromachining technology will provide a platform for integrating solid-state ICs, functional MEMS devices, passive components, and sensors into a system on a package.  The compatibility of this technology with multilayer polymer thin-films is key to integrate ultra-light weight, small size and portable components.  The major tasks of the proposed research include (1) Development of micromachined, 3-dimensional (3-D), polymer-based transmission lines to achieve ultralow loss, (2) Development of micromachined vertical interconnects to transport signals in 3-D multi-layer structures, and (3) Integration of multiple device technologies into the organic micromachining platform to develop future communication systems at millimeter wave frequencies.  This integration scheme represents a packaging paradigm known as a system-on-a-package (SOP).  The proposed tasks involve collaborative efforts with industry and national research centers including General Electric (GE CRD), Agilent Technologies, the National Science Foundation (NSF) Center for Advanced Engineering Fibers and Films at Clemson University, and the NSF Packaging Research Center at Georgia Tech.  These collaborative efforts provide infrastructure and skills to study multiple aspects of the organic micromachining technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this research will lead to innovations and fundamental understanding of the next generation micromachining technology developed in a multilayer organic platform.  Based on this effort, significant impact is expected upon the development of future communication systems by providing a means to combine unique functionalities of heterogeneous components.  These systems will be able to sense, compute, and communicate through a wireless sensor network.  Furthermore, this organic micromachining system, which is processed with conventional spin-coating and optical lithography to achieve high resolution and high aspect ratio, can be applied to the development of functional MEMS devices (switches, resonators, and tunable filters) and their integration with conventional solid-state ICs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI's teaching plan addresses the education from grade school to graduate studies.  He has begun and will continue to develop a research program to assist students in transitioning from high school to college and from college to graduate studies.  He would like to extend the opportunity to the disabled and under represented students who may have been traditionally left out of college and graduate studies.  He has strong interests in developing R-F/Wireless design and laboratory courses integrating into the department's on-going wireless program at Clemson University.  He will incorporate a web-based technology to broadcast interactive laboratory experiments to outreach high school students and college freshmen.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
