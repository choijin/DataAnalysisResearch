<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;An important recent application of economic theory has been to the design &lt;br/&gt;of markets. For example, the design of the spectrum auctions in the United &lt;br/&gt;States and around the world has been much influenced by recent developments &lt;br/&gt;in auction theory and the theory of mechanism design. However, much of the &lt;br/&gt;theory has been developed with a simplified view of (1) how different &lt;br/&gt;market participants value the objects for sale; and (2) what they believe &lt;br/&gt;other market participants' beliefs. Such simplifying assumptions have been &lt;br/&gt;made for the sake of tractability and the resulting theories have been &lt;br/&gt;highly successful. However, one concern of practitioners and theorists &lt;br/&gt;alike has been that the "optimal" mechanisms derived from theory are &lt;br/&gt;sometimes too complex to be implemented in practice, which has lead for a &lt;br/&gt;search for simpler mechanisms that seem to be more robust to the underlying &lt;br/&gt;description of the environment. Our project will use new developments in &lt;br/&gt;game theory, allowing for richer "types" of market participants (including &lt;br/&gt;richer beliefs) to provide a theoretical justification for the use of &lt;br/&gt;simple mechanisms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project addresses two separate but linked objectives. First, we examine &lt;br/&gt;how robust received mechanisms are to allowing the richer type spaces. In &lt;br/&gt;particular, researchers often argue that solution concepts stronger than &lt;br/&gt;Bayes-Nash equilibrium, such as dominance solvability and ex post &lt;br/&gt;equilibrium, are desirable because they are "robust," although the exact &lt;br/&gt;notion of robustness is not always described. One way of formalizing &lt;br/&gt;robustness is to examine whether results continue to hold on richer type &lt;br/&gt;spaces. In our proposal, we discuss various type spaces in between the &lt;br/&gt;naive type space and the universal type space, and examine how different &lt;br/&gt;mechanisms' performances vary as we vary the type space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our second objective is to develop new optimal mechanisms for particular &lt;br/&gt;type spaces, intermediate between the standard space of all payoff-relevant &lt;br/&gt;types and the universal type space. Optimality in this context refers to &lt;br/&gt;the objective of the mechanism designer, which may coincide with social &lt;br/&gt;efficiency or simply be a revenue maximization problem for the designer. &lt;br/&gt;When the objective of the mechanism designer requires him to maximize an &lt;br/&gt;expected value, it will be appropriate to consider subspaces of the &lt;br/&gt;universal type space, which can be generated from a prior distribution &lt;br/&gt;function.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
