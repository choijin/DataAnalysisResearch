<AbstractNarration>Chemistry (12)  This project addresses the needs of undergraduate engineering students. Educational materials are being developed which target materials chemistry, the chemistry of energy processes and environmental chemistry. More specifically, this curriculum is linked to a theme-based approach that draws from real-world examples centered around the ubiquitous automobile. A compendium of materials entitled "Chemistry and the Automobile" is being assembled to serve as a faculty resource guide to permit other faculty to teach their engineering students using this curriculum/theme. It will be made available to the chemistry education community at large. This Proof of Concept project is intended to show 1) that this curriculum, coupled with the overarching theme of "Chemistry and the Automobile," provides a more appropriate foundation in Chemistry for engineering students than the traditional General Chemistry curriculum; and 2) that the audience is more receptive to the subject matter because they see relevance in what they are doing. This curriculum/theme is being adopted at the University of Michigan-Dearborn to coincide with the launching of a new two-semester General Chemistry course specifically for engineering students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
