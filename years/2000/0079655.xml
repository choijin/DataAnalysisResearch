<AbstractNarration>0079790&lt;br/&gt;Salano&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant makes possible the acquisition of a new instrument capable of producing 20nm patterned line widths, 10nm scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and 20nm scanning Auger microscopy (SAM), all while simultaneously providing atomic resolution with a scanning tunneling microscope (STM/AFM). The new instrument will be attached to the present molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) growth facility to provide expanded research opportunities with semiconductor quantum dots and wires for scientists and engineers at the University of Arkansas.&lt;br/&gt;Initial investigations are on the use of patterned substrates to produce laterally ordered self-assembled quantum dots and how to engineer strain to produce quantum dots. The project  explores the underlying science important to the homogeneity of quantum dots, single electron spin dynamics in a quantum dot, and the optical behavior of a single quantum dot and the interaction between them. There will be an investigation of the possibility of forming photonic band structures from quantum dot arrays.  While the new instrument is aimed at enhancing the research capability of faculty and students at the University of Arkansas, it will also play a significant role in a new Ph.D. degree program in electronic-photonic materials and devices supported under the NSF IGERT program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nanotechnology is a new field, centered on the study of nanometer-sized materials. One nanometer, or one billionth of a meter, is one thousand times smaller than the smallest electronic devices that exist today. As a result, progress in scientific understanding on the nanoscale will play an important role in realizing future electronic and optoelectronic devices. This project makes possible the acquisition of a new instrument which when attached to the present molecular beam epitaxy growth facility at the University of Arkansas will provide the opportunity for scientists and engineers to explore and advance our current understanding of nanosize semiconductor quantum dots and wires. It will also play a significant role in a new Ph.D. degree program in electronic-photonic materials and devices, supported under the NSF/IGERT program. The educational goal of our program is to produce graduates that are fully prepared to drive the advancement of nanostructures. We will accomplish this goal by utilizing our molecular beam epitaxy facility, coupled with the newly acquired diagnostic and device fabrication tools made possible by this award, as a novel educational tool.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
