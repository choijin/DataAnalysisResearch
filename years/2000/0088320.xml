<AbstractNarration>Biological Sciences (61)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Biology Department is implementing a new core curriculum for biology majors consisting of four laboratory courses; 1) Fundamental Processes of Organisms, 2) Evolution and Ecology, 3) Cell and Molecular Biology, and 4) Genetics and Development. These courses replace five required courses, two of which did not have laboratories and only one of which had an experimentally-based laboratory. Laboratories in the new courses include a combination of traditional and inquiry- based exercises. Cutting across the new courses are three, multi- week, thematic, inquiry- based laboratories on microbes, plants and animals that are based on research expertise within the Department. By developing a set of research themes in the core courses students are able to see the strong link between research and education, and are better prepared to conduct research in upper- level courses. Our approach in the inquiry- based laboratories is to have small groups of students first learn about an organism or a process and any technical skills associated with the experimental system or mode of observation. Students then develop hypotheses, conduct experiments or observations, and complete the scientific method including presentation of findings to peers via posters, oral presentations or the Internet. The purchase of technologically-sophisticated equipment allows us to fundamentally improve the content and the means of delivery of the required curriculum. These courses engage students in using the process of science to explore scientific concepts, enhance learning through collaborative experiences, and develop a learning community. The development of student skills in problem solving, analytical methods, scientific writing and the use of computers also better prepares them for upper- level courses and careers in the biological sciences.</AbstractNarration>
