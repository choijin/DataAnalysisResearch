<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;   Optimization of linear or nonlinear parabolic differential equations&lt;br/&gt;in the context of optimal control, optimal design, or parameter estimation &lt;br/&gt;plays an important role in science and engineering. Algorithms for the&lt;br/&gt;solution of parabolic equations often involve marching in time, starting&lt;br/&gt;from an initial condition. In optimization, however, the values of the&lt;br/&gt;solution of the parabolic equation at later times feed into the&lt;br/&gt;optimization at early times. This coupling in time makes the practical&lt;br/&gt;solution of these very large-scale optimization problems challenging.&lt;br/&gt;To cope with storage and computer time demands required by an exact&lt;br/&gt;optimization of parabolic systems, so-called suboptimal control techniques, &lt;br/&gt;such as reduced bases techniques and instantaneous control have recently &lt;br/&gt;been proposed. The analysis of these techniques is still incomplete and &lt;br/&gt;the limits of their applicability are not clearly described. This&lt;br/&gt;research integrates selected suboptimal control techniques into an&lt;br/&gt;optimization framework, where they are interpreted as truncated &lt;br/&gt;iterative methods or are used as preconditioners in optimization methods.&lt;br/&gt;This improves our theoretical understanding of these techniques and broadens &lt;br/&gt;their applicability. The resulting methods are applied to specific optimal &lt;br/&gt;control problems in or related to fluid mechanics.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;   Optimal control attempts to determine system parameters or inputs &lt;br/&gt;to increase the performance of the system. For example, micro electromechanical&lt;br/&gt;systems may be used to alter the flow characteristics on an aircraft wing &lt;br/&gt;to reduce drag, or heaters may be adjusted to achieve a desired temperature&lt;br/&gt;profile in a furnace while minimizing energy consumption. Many systems&lt;br/&gt;can be modeled by mathematical equations. In this case mathematical &lt;br/&gt;techniques can be used, at least in principle, to determine the optimal&lt;br/&gt;system inputs. For systems that can be adequately modeled by moderately&lt;br/&gt;complex mathematical equations this is done routinely and successfully.&lt;br/&gt;Detailed mathematical descriptions of other systems, including flow &lt;br/&gt;over an aircraft wing or the temperature distribution in a furnace, however,&lt;br/&gt;are so complex that present mathematical techniques for the determination&lt;br/&gt;of optimal control strategies require such large computer resources that&lt;br/&gt;render them impractical. The goal of this research is to develop and analyze&lt;br/&gt;computational mathematics tools for the determination of optimal control &lt;br/&gt;strategies for a class of complex systems and the demonstration of&lt;br/&gt;the practicability of these tools using selected applications in fluid &lt;br/&gt;mechanics.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
