    <AbstractNarration>0201351&lt;br/&gt;Richards-Kortum&lt;br/&gt;Funding is sought to enable graduate students, post-doctoral fellows and young investigators to participate in the Lasers in Medicine and Biology Gordon Conference Kimball Union Academy, Meriden, NH July 14-19, 2002. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference is to include investigators from academia, government agencies, national laboratories, and industry in examining emerging applications of lasers and optical sciences in medicine and surgery. Particular emphasis is given to technological advances close to clinical application and/or commercial development. Sessions include: Optical Coherence Tomography; Nanotechnologies for Optical Sensing, Imaging, and Manipulation; Biological Applications of Micro-optical Devices; Combined Imaging Methodologies; Fluorescence Methods for Biomedical Diagnostics; Advances in Optical Microscopy; Intra-vital Imaging and Microscopy; Wavefront Sensing and Adaptive Optics in Vision Correction; and Photodynamic Therapy. Seven of the nine program sessions include at least one talk with substantial applications in the area of early diagnosis. An important feature is to bring students and post-doctoral fellows in biomedical engineering together with academic engineers and scientists, clinicians, and members of industry to discuss and define the most important questions and problems to be solved in this field. Two special symposia will facilitate the discussion process. The first symposium, "Career Paths in Biomedical Engineering", features short presentations from clinicians and engineers in academia, industry, and government to provide career advice to graduate students and post- doctoral fellows. The second symposium highlights new technologic developments on the cusp of clinical viability. A special issue of the Journal of Biomedical Optics is to be devoted to "Optical Detection: Clinical and Industrial Advances". &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The meeting is of high intellectual merit with the program being organized so as to focus on emerging medical technologies holding a high likelihood of making broad and important impacts on medicine and surgery.</AbstractNarration>
