<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; A grant has been awarded to Dr. David Ribble of the Biology Department at Trinity University to fund state of the art image acquisition and analysis instrumentation and software. This equipment will be housed in the Center for Image Acquisition and Analysis, a multi-user research facility that will enhance the research capabilities of all faculty and undergraduate students in the Department of Biology at Trinity University.  Trinity University will remodel an existing laboratory to provide a site for this Center and will share in the cost of the equipment and software. To satisfy the needs of this diverse research community, the Center will contain equipment and software to acquire, store, and analyze images appropriate to research studies in molecular biology, cellular biology, physiology, ecology, and evolution. To meet these needs, the following items of equipment will be purchased:  a gel documentation system; a fluorescence microscope with deconvolution capabilities, digital cameras, computers, and support software.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The Center for Image Acquisition and Analysis will significantly increase faculty and student research capabilities, enhancing the activities of the varied research groups within the Department of Biology. Each of these groups will make intensive use of this new facility. These ongoing research projects include the study of the following topics:&lt;br/&gt; The mechanisms for selective destabilization of secretory protein mRNAs at the ER &lt;br/&gt; Changes in ovarian gene expression during ovulation &lt;br/&gt; Regulation of photosystem production by a putative GTP-binding protein in Rhodospirillum                 centenum &lt;br/&gt; Paracellular permeability of tight junctions in intestinal epithelial cells &lt;br/&gt; Rat epidermal cell responses to radiofrequency radiation &lt;br/&gt; Evolution of monogamy and conservation of mammals &lt;br/&gt; Sociality and social parasitism in galling aphids &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Not only will this equipment support the ongoing research activities of faculty and students; the sensitivity, resolution, and analysis capabilities of the proposed equipment will provide opportunities for research initiatives and directions not currently possible at Trinity. Furthermore, use of this shared facility will help develop collaborative research projects between the diverse sub-disciplines within the Department of Biology.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
