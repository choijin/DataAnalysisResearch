<AbstractNarration>The Great Lakes Science Center (GLSC), in collaboration with the Cleveland Municipal School District, corporations and universities, proposes a three-year "After School Science Adventures" program.  To address the developmental needs of youth, the program will use multi-level mentoring and a learning cycle approach to engage participants in learning, doing and presenting science.  Science content will center around six themes:  (1) information technology, (2) environmental science, (3) polymers/materials science, (4) engineering, (5) biotechnology and (6) biomedical research that are directly relevant to local scientific research and industry.  Each year a team of 20 High School Science Ambassadors will facilitate science activities for at least 100 middle level students.  Middle level students will participate in a series of eight weekly sessions for each theme.  In year one there will be three themes, and an additional three themes in years two and three.  Science experiments, team projects, youth mentoring, presentations by research and industry scientists, and fieldtrips are key program activities.  Participants will present science to their families in family science events throughout the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
