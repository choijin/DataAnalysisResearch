    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project will address the problem of creating robust and efficient software for the solution of large-scale nonlinear optimization problems. Taking advantage of recent advances in algorithm design, the project will investigate novel versions of both interior-point and active-set methods for nonlinear optimization, and will examine an innovative integrated approach that takes advantage of both methods to achieve greater speed and reliability than are available from current single-method codes. Optimization software resulting from this research is expected to have commercial applications to difficult nonlinear problems in such areas as network planning, optimal power flow, computer-aided design, and aerospace engineering, as well as in applications for decision analysis in such areas as finance and revenue management.&lt;br/&gt; Broader impacts of the activity include enhanced understanding of optimization techniques that play a key role in engineering and commerce; an advance for NSF's educational goals by providing support to a postdoctoral researcher; and commercial software products whose further development can be supported by sales revenues.</AbstractNarration>
