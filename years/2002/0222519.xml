<AbstractNarration>By their nature, volumetric data sets, such as  CT, MRI and the Visible Human cryosection &lt;br/&gt;images,  are  not  subject  to  the  same  form  of  visual  inspection and  cognitive  refinement  that &lt;br/&gt;human experts apply when viewing and interpreting 2D images. &lt;br/&gt;The internal cycle of choices made by humans as they  visually survey  an image is disrupted and&lt;br/&gt;forced into an external process where users must adapt to the technical requirements of the&lt;br/&gt;visualization system. This project proposes to continue research into an immersive visualization&lt;br/&gt;system that is a first step toward  creating  a  user  interaction  paradigm  that  more  naturally&lt;br/&gt;allows  users  to  apply  their interpretive  expertise  to  the  visualization  and  segmentation  of&lt;br/&gt;volumetric  data  sets.  In  this environment, segmentation, the process of isolating discrete structures within a data volume, is performed in parallel with visualization. Users have continuous control of the visualization and segmentation algorithms and can freely exercise their expert&lt;br/&gt;interpretive knowledge. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The current implementation, called the  Immersive Segmentation Environment, emphasizes the &lt;br/&gt;controlled application of high computational cost algorithms to local regions of the data volume. &lt;br/&gt;Using  stereo  graphics,  the  user  is  presented  with  the  illusion that  the  data  volume  occupies &lt;br/&gt;physical space. The user interacts with the system using a 3D space tracked probe. Visualization &lt;br/&gt;and segmentation algorithms continuously operate on the data volume within a local &lt;br/&gt;neighborhood of the user.s position. This neighborhood corresponds to the user.s visual focus &lt;br/&gt;point. The algorithms initialize themselves based upon an analysis of the local neighborhood and &lt;br/&gt;heuristics. The system is implemented as a client/server application and consequently allows a &lt;br/&gt;user  at  a  low-cost  workstation  to  effectively  use  remote computational  resources  to visualize &lt;br/&gt;large volumetric data sets. The system implements two main classes of segmentation algorithms. &lt;br/&gt;Both determine initial algorithm parameters based upon a cluster analysis of the local neighborhood and are characterized by an iterative refinement approach. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will continue to investigate the capabilities of this unique user interaction &lt;br/&gt;model for visualizing, exploring and interpreting volumetric data sets. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research plan contained in this proposal is a natural outgrowth of prior work performed by &lt;br/&gt;the PI. This ongoing work has had a positive impact on the curriculum, student research projects &lt;br/&gt;and faculty research within the Computer Science department at the UW-La Crosse. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
