<AbstractNarration> &lt;br/&gt;Traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) is increasingly recognized as a valid partner to ecological sciences.  Prototypes of course materials are being developed to achieve integration between TEK and the science of ecology. Such materials will be a valuable resource to educators at tribal colleges and at mainstream universities as we endeavor to support the development of increasing numbers of Native Americans in science disciplines. Education of mainstream scientists in the approaches of TEK increases cross-cultural competence, reduces barriers to participation by Native Americans, and enriches the perspectives available for environmental problem solving. Prototypes are being developed collaboratively between two institutions and two PIs with shared goals, but different audiences: a tribal college, Little Big Horn College (LBHC), and a mainstream university,  SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry (ESF). At LBHC the prototype is intended as a culturally responsive, place-based ecology course, which will integrate the science of ecology with TEK, primarily from Crow culture. At SUNY ESF, the prototype will be concept-based and span a wide diversity of cultures and ecosystems. The materials we develop will be incorporated into a course presently taught at both institutions, General Ecology. The scope of traditional knowledge has many parallels with the content of a typical ecology course, making it an excellent forum for introducing TEK. An Ecology course is also a nearly universal part of college biology curricula, and it thus provides an appropriate venue for wider dissemination of the materials developed.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
