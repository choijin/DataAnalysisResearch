<AbstractNarration>0206951&lt;br/&gt;Rebarber&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will focus on developing techniques for sampled-data &lt;br/&gt;feedback for infinite dimensional systems.  A discrete time controller can &lt;br/&gt;operator with only limited frequency response, and infinite dimensional &lt;br/&gt;systems often have high frequency effects which cannot be ignored, so &lt;br/&gt;there is not only interest in what can be done with sampled-data control &lt;br/&gt;design, but also in its limitations.  The following question is basic: can a &lt;br/&gt;given continuous-time controller be replaced by a related sampled-data &lt;br/&gt;controller, while maintaining the desired response of the closed-loop &lt;br/&gt;system?  Both idealized and generalized sample-and-hold will be &lt;br/&gt;considered. Generalized hold can be used as a design parameter, and &lt;br/&gt;generalized sampling can be used when the output is not sufficiently &lt;br/&gt;smooth to accommodate point evaluations in time.  The PI will &lt;br/&gt;characterize as completely as possible those continuous-time feedback &lt;br/&gt;systems which do not lose their closed-loop stability when a sampled data &lt;br/&gt;scheme (with sufficiently small sampling time) is applied to the feedback, &lt;br/&gt;and will determine whether the performance of the sampled-data system &lt;br/&gt;can approximate the continuous time performance.  The performance &lt;br/&gt;measures considered are closed-loop growth rate and stability radius. &lt;br/&gt;Tracking techniques for infinite dimensional systems will also be studied &lt;br/&gt;and developed.  Suppose a system has an external disturbance term which &lt;br/&gt;is to be rejected, or an external reference term to be tracked.  One common &lt;br/&gt;approach to doing this is by a low-gain controller suggested by the internal &lt;br/&gt;model principle.  The effectiveness of such a controller for a wide class of &lt;br/&gt;systems will be studied, as well as its sensitivity to frequency variations in &lt;br/&gt;the external signal. Sampled-data versions of tracking controllers will also &lt;br/&gt;be considered.  These sampled-data and tracking results will be applied to &lt;br/&gt;PDEs in more than one space variable, especially coupled PDE models &lt;br/&gt;with at least one hyperbolic component.  Due to the fact that these models &lt;br/&gt;involve two different of PDEs, coupled via highly unbounded operators, &lt;br/&gt;the analysis has features which are distinct from the analysis for &lt;br/&gt;uncoupled systems.  For this problem a central concern for output &lt;br/&gt;feedback design is the analysis of the input-output map, i.e. the map from &lt;br/&gt;the control to the observation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Advances in digital technology have led to an emphasis on sampled-data &lt;br/&gt;design in control engineering, but the development of sampled data &lt;br/&gt;control for infinite-dimensional systems such as PDEs has been limited.  &lt;br/&gt;In many applications output data is available in discrete time rather than &lt;br/&gt;continuous time, and a feedback controller for such a system should be &lt;br/&gt;designed to take discrete data as its input, but act in continuous time.  &lt;br/&gt;Since there is already an enormous literature on continuous time &lt;br/&gt;stabilization of PDEs, the project will involve the investigation of how to &lt;br/&gt;modify continuous time controllers to obtain sampled data controllers, &lt;br/&gt;while maintaining system performance.  Also of interest are techniques for &lt;br/&gt;designing effective sampled-data controllers without reference to &lt;br/&gt;continuous time design.  Another topic to be considered is the design of &lt;br/&gt;active feedback control tracking external signals and rejecting noise. As an &lt;br/&gt;application, these methods will be used to design a controller to reject &lt;br/&gt;noise in a PDE model which describes the interaction between sound &lt;br/&gt;waves in a cavity (for instance, an airplane cockpit) and the motion of a &lt;br/&gt;flexible wall of the cavity.  Suppose that there is an external noise source, &lt;br/&gt;such as engine noise, which is to be rejected, and active feedback control &lt;br/&gt;is to be applied to smart material actuators on the cavity walls.  Then a &lt;br/&gt;properly designed low-gain controller (either continuous time feedback or &lt;br/&gt;sampled-data) will attenuate the sound pressure at and near finitely many &lt;br/&gt;points of the cavity.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
