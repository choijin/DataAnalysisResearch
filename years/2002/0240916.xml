<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;OPP-2040916&lt;br/&gt;Zhang&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Significant changes in arctic climate have been detected in recent years. One of the most striking changes is the decline of sea ice concurrent with changes in atmospheric circulation and increased surface air temperature.  This arctic warming trend is likely to continue, as projected by global climate models  (GCMs), leading to a diminished arctic sea-ice  cover.  Diminution of ice  cover  will  have  a  significant  impact  on  the  regional  and global  climate,  and  on  the socio-economics and ecosystems in the north polar region. It is important to understand the changes that the arctic system has undergone in the past and predict how it will evolve in the future. The Principal Investigators will use a coupled ocean and sea ice model to conduct a retrospective investigation and future projections of the arctic ice-ocean system. The model is global; its grid emphasizes the Arctic Ocean and its linkages to the subarctic oceans. They will investigate the historical and contemporary changes of the Arctic Ocean and the adjacent seas, and to project future changes that are associated with a diminished arctic ice cover under various plausible warming scenarios. There are two science goals:  1) to examine the historical evolution of the arctic system and to understand changes that have occurred in sea ice and the upper ocean in recent decades, and 2) to project a diminished arctic sea-ice cover in future warming scenarios and to examine key linkages among atmospheric forcing, sea-ice processes, and oceanic processes in an ice-diminished Arctic Ocean and the adjacent seas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will be done in two-stages:  a retrospective investigation, and multiscenario  future  projections. In the first stage, the Principal Investigators will interpret the large-scale changes that have occurred in sea ice and the upper Arctic Ocean over the past five decades. In the second stage, they will qualitatively and quantitatively  examine  when,  where,  and  under  what  circumstances  the  arctic  ice  cover  is  likely  to diminish or disappear in the future. They will also study changes in oceanic circulation and processes in an ice-depleted Arctic Ocean and in its interactions with the subarctic oceans.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The retrospective  investigation  complements  and  expands  on  other  investigations  of  arctic climate change  that  use regional models with a limited domain. The future projections of an ice-diminished  Arctic  Ocean  complement  GCM  projections  of  possible  global  warming  with  Arctic implications.  This work will make important contributions to the multi-agency Study of Environmental Arctic Change (SEARCH)  effort  to understand  the  large-scale  arctic  environmental  changes  that  have  occurred  in  the  last  several  decades and to assess possible future changes.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The nature of the work, interpreting the historical and contemporary changes and projecting future trends in the arctic system and its key linkages with the rest of the world ocean, is essential  to  science,  society,  and  policy  formulation.  The results will be accessible to  researchers  and  the  general  public  through  archival  Web  pages. The systematic predictions of a retreating sea-ice  cover  will  facilitate  scientific  studies  on  biogeochemical and ecosystem changes in the Arctic. Knowledge of the extent, thickness, and duration of the ice cover in the future will have an  impact  on  the  livelihood  of  arctic  and  subarctic  people.  The Principal Investigators will provide information  about navigability,  length  of  shipping seasons, etc., along the Northern Sea Route and the Northwest  Passage  and  in  other  arctic  areas  that  are  presently  seasonally  navigable  and may  become more  easily  navigable,  with  a  huge  impact  on  economic  activities  in  the  north  polar  region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
