    <AbstractNarration>A grant has been awarded to Dr. David Stock, Dr. William Friedman, Dr. Pei-San Tsai, and Dr. Robert Boswell at the University of Colorado to establish a common-use confocal microscopy facility. The research of these investigators in the broad areas of developmental and/or evolutionary biology requires three-dimensional characterization of anatomical structures and domains of gene expression in relatively thick specimens. Traditional histological methods for such characterization are laborious, prone to artifacts, and cannot be applied to living specimens. Confocal microscopy is ideal for such applications, as it allows collection of data from single focal planes ("optical sections") which can then be assembled by a computer into a three-dimensional reconstruction. This technique does not require physical sectioning of samples and can therefore be used with living material. The major item of equipment to be purchased is a laser scanning confocal microscope. Two additional pieces of equipment, an epifluorescence compound microscope and a fluorescence stereomicroscope, will be purchased to facilitate the preparation of specimens for analysis with the confocal microscope. These microscopes, along with an existing scanning electron microscope, will be housed in a facility open to all researchers at the University of Colorado.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The common-use imaging facility to be established at the University of Colorado is expected to contribute to intra- and interdepartmental interactions. Developmental and Evolutionary Biology, the research fields of the users of this facility, are both split between two separate departments at the University of Colorado, with the majority of developmental biologists located in the Department of Molecular, Cellular &amp; Developmental Biology and the majority of evolutionary biologists in the Department of Environmental, Population &amp; Organismic Biology. Interactions between these departments have been minimal in the past, despite common interests highlighted by the recent rise of the subdiscipline of Evolutionary Developmental Biology. A facility bringing together researchers on the basis of shared technology is expected to encourage the exchange of ideas among developmental biologists of all types as well as between developmental and evolutionary biologists. In addition to representing a full spectrum of questions in and approaches to Developmental and Evolutionary Biology, potential users of this facility employ a diversity of organisms ranging from animals to plants. As these groups of organisms represent independent inventions of multicellular development, interactions among plant and animal biologists catalyzed by the planned facility may bring into sharper focus universal versus labile features of development and evolution. Students in particular should benefit from such interactions, as they are likely to be the ones spending the most time in the facility. Their educational experience will further be enhanced by the incorporation of confocal microscopy into an existing histology course, as well as by periodic training sessions aimed at attracting new users. In summary, in an era of increasing specialization in research and training throughout Biology, a common use confocal microscopy facility is seen as a means of exposing researchers in Developmental and Evolutionary Biology to a diversity of questions, approaches and organisms.</AbstractNarration>
