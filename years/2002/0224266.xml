    <AbstractNarration>This proposal was received in response to the Spin Electronics for the 21st &lt;br/&gt;Century Initiative, Program Solicitation NSF 02-036. The proposal focuses &lt;br/&gt;on the development of a room temperature ferromagnetic compound &lt;br/&gt;semiconductor material, Ga1-xMnxN, for spintronic devices based on the spin &lt;br/&gt;property of electrons. Many advances have been made in developing the &lt;br/&gt;materials and devices for III-V compound semiconductor materials doped with &lt;br/&gt;manganese (Mn), with Ga1-xMnxAs showing the most promise. However, the low &lt;br/&gt;Curie temperatures (Tc) for these materials require potential devices to be &lt;br/&gt;operated at temperatures below 77K. There is a need to produce a new class &lt;br/&gt;of materials that can operate at, or near, room temperature to facilitate &lt;br/&gt;the ease of measurement and the eventual commercialization of this &lt;br/&gt;technology. The III-Nitrides will be excellent for this application &lt;br/&gt;because recent theoretical predictions show that Ga1-xMnxN could have Tc &lt;br/&gt;higher than room temperature. The Ga1-xMnxN can also be integrated into &lt;br/&gt;existing base of microelectronics or optoelectronics existing for GaN-based &lt;br/&gt;devices.&lt;br/&gt;In this work it is proposed to produce Ga1-xMnxN by Metalorganic Chemical &lt;br/&gt;Vapor Deposition, the growth technique of choice for GaN based &lt;br/&gt;devices. There are no published reports of the growth of Ga1-xMnxN by this &lt;br/&gt;growth technique at this time. A systematic study of the growth of &lt;br/&gt;Ga1-xMnxN will be completed. Detailed characterization of the physical &lt;br/&gt;properties Ga1-xMnxN will be investigated using x-ray analysis, Hall &lt;br/&gt;measurements, time resolved photoluminescence, and other techniques. A &lt;br/&gt;novel Ga1-xMnxN/Ga1-xAlxN/Ga1-xInxN LED structure will be grown so that &lt;br/&gt;spin injection can easily be investigated at room temperature.&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this work is clear: Spintronic devices that can be &lt;br/&gt;operated at or near room temperature will be required if quantum computing &lt;br/&gt;based on compound semiconductor materials is going to have a commercial &lt;br/&gt;viability in the future.</AbstractNarration>
