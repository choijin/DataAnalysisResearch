<AbstractNarration>This individual investigator award supports an investigation of the behavior of electrons confined in one-dimensional wires.  The project consists of a comprehensive experimental investigation of Coulomb drag between interacting quantum wires in the ballistic transport regime.  This relatively unexplored phenomenon will be used as a tool to experimentally probe the Luttinger liquid (LL) behavior of interacting, strongly correlated, one-dimensional electron systems. The Coulomb drag resistance and the shot noise will be measured as a function of a number of sample and environmental parameters, such as sample length, inter-wire separation, Fermi energy, temperature, applied magnetic field, etc. The dual-wire samples will be fabricated from high-mobility AlGaAs/GaAs heterostructures and quantum wells using high-resolution, electron beam lithography.  The work is expected to lead to new and important results, proving that the LL state exists in condensed matter and establishing the applicability boundaries of the Fermi liquid theory.  The project involves training graduate students in nanoscience and nanotechnology.  It includes the participation of undergraduate students in the research.  It brings together researchers, educators, and students, leading to an integration of research, learning, and training.  In addition, a strong commitment to educational outreach K-16 and teacher programs is integrated into the research agenda. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This individual investigator award supports an investigation of the behavior of electrons confined to very narrow, essentially one-dimensional wires.  The project consists of a comprehensive experimental investigation, supported by theoretical analysis, of the interaction forces between two closely spaced and interacting one-dimensional wires in a regime where very little scattering of the electrons occurs.  These relatively unexplored interactions can be used as a tool to probe the behavior of confined interacting electron systems. The resistance and electronic noise will be measured as a function of a number of sample and environmental parameters, such as sample length, inter-wire separation, energy, temperature, applied magnetic field, etc.  The behavior of electron systems in one dimension is an important issue in condensed matter physics.  As the dimensions of technological interest become smaller, it becomes more important to understand such systems.  This research is expected to lead to a better understanding of such small systems. This project involves the training of graduate student researchers in nanoscience and nanotechnology as well as the participation of undergraduate students in the research.  It brings together researchers, educators, and students, leading to an integration of research, learning, and training.
