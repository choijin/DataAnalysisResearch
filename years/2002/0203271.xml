    <AbstractNarration>Under the direction of Dr. Christopher R. DeCorse, Mr. Gerard Chouin will collect data for his doctoral dissertation. He will continue his archaeological and historical study of the Eguafo State, an historic polity located in coastal Ghana. The landscape of Eguafo includes a number of sacred groves which are patches of tropical forest recognized by today's' farming communities as dwelling places of spiritual beings. A set of preliminary surveys suggest a correlation between the presence of such groves and the location of early settlements founded before the arrival of the Europeans in this part of West Africa in the late fifteenth century and probably abandoned in the late seventeenth century. Far from being surviving patches of virgin forest degraded by people, as common sense often put it, sacred groves are major historical and archaeological markers of sites where the archaeologist can study the transformation of pre-contact coastal communities into a mercantilist society fully integrated in the Atlantic world. The dissertation will aim at 1) understanding the processes that led to the formation, conservation and, nowadays, accelerated clearing of sacred groves in relation to archaeological sites; 2) ascertaining and interpreting the chronology of regional change in human occupation in relation with the opening of the Atlantic trade. To this end, a sample of an estimated forty to sixty groves within the study area will be surveyed. Oral history and ethnographic observations will be recorded. Excavations will be conducted at five settlement sites associated with surveyed sacred groves. Analyzes of ceramics and the artifact inventory, will allow the establishment of a regional chronological sequence and insights into change in settlements patterns, material culture and sociopolitical organization during the little known transition between the Late Iron Age and the period of post-European contact in coastal West Africa. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The chronology of change in settlement patterns will be used to critically assess the notion of "impact" that is largely used in culture contact studies in the sense of brutal, rapid change induced by the emergence of European actors in West African trade. If indeed, it can be demonstrated that from the late fifteenth to the late seventeenth century, the network of settlements (and therefore trade routes), remained the same as before the Portuguese arrival in West Africa, the idea that the European presence brought about sudden structural change in West Africa will have to be reconsidered. Instead, Mr. Chouin's research will contribute to understanding how the opportunities of the Atlantic trade and the gradual adoption of mercantilism generated internally induced mechanisms of social change. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research is also important because it will call the attention on the on-going massive destruction of cultural resources in West Africa, including archaeological and 'natural' sites such as sacred groves, it will help to document and salvage part of this endangered heritage. It will also assist a young social scientist to lay a foundation for a much-needed larger historical and archaeological study of long-term social change in the West African forest environments.</AbstractNarration>
