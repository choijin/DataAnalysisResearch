<AbstractNarration>Collaborative Research: An Integrated Interior Infill System for Mass Customized Housing&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;In the future, homes will contain the most complex activities of any building type. With the aging of the&lt;br/&gt;baby boomers, homes must become centers for proactive healthcare, distributed energy production, work,&lt;br/&gt;commerce, learning, etc. Homes must become agile environments that accommodate rapidly changing&lt;br/&gt;needs, activities, and technologies. They must respond to demands of sophisticated, affluent baby&lt;br/&gt;boomer generation who want choice and tailored solutions that closely reflect their values and needs. But&lt;br/&gt;places of living are poorly prepared for this future. Most new apartments are generic, low-grade, low-tech,&lt;br/&gt;inflexible, disruptive to upgrade, high maintenance, and ill-designed. Architects and engineers play no&lt;br/&gt;significant role in the creation of places of living, except at the very high end of the market. Most housing&lt;br/&gt;research is focused on cost reduction - not on preparing places of living to meet new requirements in the&lt;br/&gt;future.&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research project is to conceptualize and assess the viability of a new approach that that may result in high-value, customized, reconfigurable, adaptable, multifamily housing. The  three coordinated thrusts are as follows.&lt;br/&gt;1) The development of design concepts for the use of prefabricated, volumetric module ioshellslc of a&lt;br/&gt;dimension that can be efficiently and affordable shipped to the jobsite, combined with the application&lt;br/&gt;of a mass customized cabinetry-like integrated interior infill (I 3 ) system for apartment fit-out. Modular&lt;br/&gt;construction is the fastest growing segment of the housing market, but its potential is limited by a&lt;br/&gt;narrow range of design possibilities, its failure to take advantage of modern manufacturing&lt;br/&gt;technologies, and the labor intensive operations required to connect modules at the site. This&lt;br/&gt;research will employ modular construction for what it is most suited for - structural shells with building&lt;br/&gt;services that can be rapidly assembled. &lt;br/&gt;2) The development of concepts for automated, web-based, consumer design tools based on&lt;br/&gt;parametrically defined I 3 components. This effort will take advantage of prior work developed at MIT&lt;br/&gt;and in industry for user customization of apartment design and cabinetry.&lt;br/&gt;3) The development and testing of an I 3 production methodology. The following issues will be&lt;br/&gt;investigated: Can an I 3 system allow mass-customized components to be manufactured efficiently and&lt;br/&gt;with the same quality as identical mass-produced units? Can the controlled and precise fabrication of&lt;br/&gt;integrated components allow new materials such as advanced polymers, composites, and special-&lt;br/&gt;purpose metals to find their way into the home? Can delicate electronics and devices be more easily&lt;br/&gt;integrated into I 3 components than with conventional construction? Can parallel manufacturing of the&lt;br/&gt;modular shell and interior components reduce production cycle time?&lt;br/&gt;In summary, this research will give the homebuilding supply chain, suppliers, factory producers, and&lt;br/&gt;builders a vision of the future - and an approach to the design tools and lean production systems that can&lt;br/&gt;make that vision a reality. The research will attempt to leap beyond incremental improvements in the&lt;br/&gt;conventional process, to an agile and adaptable system of mass-customization using technologies&lt;br/&gt;processes that could be put into effect in the near term. The research will also have important academic&lt;br/&gt;impacts. It will provide two Masters thesis topics and multi-disciplinary research experiences for two&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate research assistants. The class project in EIN 3314 Work Measurement and Design,&lt;br/&gt;involving lean manufacturing in local industry, will provide valuable, team-based, real world learning&lt;br/&gt;experiences for about 30 undergraduate engineering students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
