<AbstractNarration>With funding from NSF since 1998, Athens Technical College (ATC) has developed and alpha tested a six-module, contextually driven, laboratory-based curriculum in chemical technology, known as C3T. The curriculum module development has been carried out in two phases. In the first phase, the project team developed and alpha tested three modules which address Aqueous Systems, Polymer Systems, and Metal Systems. During the second phase three additional modules on Drug Delivery Systems, Petroleum Energy Systems, and Remote Monitoring Systems were developed. Each laboratory module has a flexible design to facilitate integration into the first or second year of any two-year chemical technology program. All six modules have been field tested at ATC and Los Angeles Trade-Technical College.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The current project constitutes the final phase of work to complete the contextually-based, laboratory-driven curriculum. Specifically, this project is (1) field testing all six modules at 12 two-year technical colleges, (2) conducting two summer faculty training workshops for two-year college faculty to prepare for use of the curriculum materials at their sites, and (3) preparing and disseminating the modules, including student and instructors manuals in electronic and printed form for two-year chemical technology faculty as well as undergraduate chemistry faculty.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
