<AbstractNarration>The objective of this project is to plan different strategies that enable a&lt;br/&gt;competency-based individualized education in such a diverse engineering school.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While education is significantly different than industrial production of goods and services, we&lt;br/&gt;believe that there exist several concepts one can borrow, modify and implement to education&lt;br/&gt;systems to answer today's increasing demands. At the very least, one such concept is mass&lt;br/&gt;customization of goods and services, which translates into a competency-based&lt;br/&gt;individualized education system. This concept aims to provide a set of measurable&lt;br/&gt;outcomes (namely, skills, knowledge base and competency of graduates) by characterizing and&lt;br/&gt;Individualizing each student's learning process and potential.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ultimately, we envision the development of a competency-based learning system that would&lt;br/&gt;reflect a unified academia-industry perspective, provide for the immediate needs of the industry&lt;br/&gt;and facilitate scholarly development of future engineers and researchers. In this project, we&lt;br/&gt;propose to develop a plan to implement a systems approach and the manufacturing strategy of&lt;br/&gt;mass customization to the education process. More specifically, we propose to develop a&lt;br/&gt;fundamental framework for curriculum design, which allows for individualized education while&lt;br/&gt;still optimizing the capacity of the teaching assets we have for each academic year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The findings from the project will be published in various journals on education&lt;br/&gt;research. We also intend to work with local industry to extend our findings and insights to the&lt;br/&gt;mass customization of their education and training systems. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
