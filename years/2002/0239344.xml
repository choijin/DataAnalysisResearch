    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is focused on research and development of whole hand interaction with computer aided design (CAD) models. This project incorporates advanced numerical constraint optimization techniques, tessellated and algebraic collision detection algorithms, and CyberGlove-based input devices to interactively manipulate the kinematics of large commercial CAD models. Immersion will develop techniques for enforcing graphical non-penetration of virtual avatars with CAD models. Grasping and manipulation-state machines will permit users to naturally grasp and manipulate CAD parts. Force feedback will be calculated and displayed to users with CyberForce hardware devices. A client-server infrastructure for offloading the computationally intense algorithms from desktop workstations will be developed. All CAD related development would occur in CATIA V5 from Dassault Systeme SA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technology has potential for a broad impact on virtual prototyping of consumer products and processes. Enabling real-time interaction with a virtual design will facilitate higher quality products with reduced development costs. Virtual prototyping of manufacturing processes will reduce laborer stress and injury by allowing detailed analysis of human factors before a factory work-cell is developed. Immersion will realize commercial returns from this project through a combination of increased hardware sales, product revenue, intellectual property licensing, and contract opportunities.</AbstractNarration>
