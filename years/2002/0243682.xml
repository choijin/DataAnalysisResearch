    <AbstractNarration>ICHMM 2003 Participant Support Program Abstract&lt;br/&gt;D.L. McDowell, Georgia Tech, Co-Chair of ICHMM 2003&lt;br/&gt;The International Conference on Heterogeneous Material Mechanics (ICHMM 2003), to be held June 24-29, 2003 in China (http://www.ichmm.org), will highlight contemporary and emerging research directions of Asian, North American and European solid mechanics communities. It will provide both a traditional format in ChongQing (2.5 days), followed by working workshop-format sessions aimed at emergent research issues (2.5 days) on a cruise down the YangTze River. It is proposed that the US NSF provide $15,000 in participant support costs to foster attendance of key western participants. Tremendous cultural and technical diversity are major themes of the ICHMM 2003; we will encourage participation of underrepresented groups. The final report will include the list of participants and conference schedule, summary of panel discussions, and extended abstracts. ICHMM 2003 will have profound impact on scientific and cultural exchange of leading international segments of the solid mechanics community. The novel format of this meeting will illuminate issues in emerging areas of common research emphasis (materials by design, nanomechanics, biomaterials, etc.) through both panel discussions and informal exchanges during the YangTze River segment.</AbstractNarration>
