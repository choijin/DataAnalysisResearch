<AbstractNarration>This proposal will organize a national workshop entitled: Modernizing the National Power Grid. The practical and fundamental problems associated with operating the existing grid are widely known while there are still strong needs to identify an adequate research agenda that will address the solutions. This workshop will address some of the most critical areas where future research may bring some fundamental breakthroughs reflecting in a more secure, efficient and reliable power grid operation.   &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The stakeholders in addressing the grid modernization issue are the public, government, &lt;br/&gt;academia, various research organizations and industry. The workshop attendees will include researchers from academia, policy makers, research managers, and industry representatives. Special invitation will be extended to DOE, FERC, NERC and EPRI to address the background issues related to the grid modernization. Representatives from some foreign countries (Canada, Europe and Africa) will be invited to share their experiences in modernizing the grid. The workshop will result in a discussion of the strategic approaches to pursuing the grid modernization. The research needs and directions will be identified as a result. The following grand challenges are selected as the &lt;br/&gt;focus of the workshop: &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;o    Improving Planning and Reliability &lt;br/&gt;o    Enhancing Security and Vulnerability &lt;br/&gt;o    Developing New Tools (Engineering and Market) and Technology &lt;br/&gt;   &lt;br/&gt;Modernizing the national power grid is of interest to every citizen of this country. The organizer will make sure that the attendance diversity, proper dissemination of the results to the other researchers and public at large, and the economic impacts of the workshop discussions on the well being of each member of our society are kept as a focus. The quality of our lives is profoundly affected by the energy supply. The security, efficiency and reliability of the national power grid are the issues of concern not only to the professionals closely related to the subject matter but also to the public at large.  This workshop will have much broader impact than just serving, as a vehicle for identifying the research needs; it will also serve as a vehicle for enhancing public awareness and confidence regarding the electric energy supply.  &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
