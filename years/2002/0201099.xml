<AbstractNarration>The goal of the project is to investigate the behavior of&lt;br/&gt;Fourier transforms under various restrictions and to obtain&lt;br/&gt;sharper estimates of Fourier transforms and Periodizations.&lt;br/&gt;The research will be focused on two main objectives. The&lt;br/&gt;first one is to obtain new versions for the  Uncertainty&lt;br/&gt;Principle in Harmonic Analysis. The Uncertainty Principle&lt;br/&gt;is a statement which says that a function and its Fourier&lt;br/&gt;transform can not be simultaneously concentrated on small&lt;br/&gt;sets. The famous Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle in&lt;br/&gt;Quantum Mechanics is one of the examples of the more general &lt;br/&gt;Uncertainty Principle in Harmonic Analysis. In particular,&lt;br/&gt;the investigator will study functions with Fourier&lt;br/&gt;transforms supported on sets with certain type of densities&lt;br/&gt;to get new versions of the Uncertainty Principle and apply&lt;br/&gt;the results for Partial Differential Equations and Signal&lt;br/&gt;Processing. The second objective is devoted to the relation&lt;br/&gt;between functions and their periodizations over integer&lt;br/&gt;lattices in higher dimensions. Periodizations are often&lt;br/&gt;used in Harmonic Analysis as a link between Fourier series&lt;br/&gt;and Fourier integrals. They arise in problems having&lt;br/&gt;periodic structure  that is why they are an important tool&lt;br/&gt;in such applied sciences as Electrical Engineering, Signal&lt;br/&gt;Processing and Crystallography.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this proposal the investigator  studies various&lt;br/&gt;properties of Fourier transforms. The Fourier transform is&lt;br/&gt;a major mathematical tool extensively used to  represent,&lt;br/&gt;convert and recover digital data, information and signals&lt;br/&gt;in Signal Processing, Computer Science and Electrical&lt;br/&gt;Engineering, Crystallography and Tomography. The author&lt;br/&gt;proposes to further investigate  properties of Fourier&lt;br/&gt;transformations  which should lead to a deeper understanding&lt;br/&gt;of the behavior of  Fourier transforms under various&lt;br/&gt;restrictions. The development of the proposed Uncertainty&lt;br/&gt;Principle in Harmonic Analysis will lead to tools to determine&lt;br/&gt;how much information is sufficient to recover signals and&lt;br/&gt;data. In return, this study of Fourier transforms will give&lt;br/&gt;new techniques not only in theoretical  areas such as&lt;br/&gt;Mathematical Physics, in particular, Partial Differential&lt;br/&gt;Equations but also in applied sciences such as Image&lt;br/&gt;Processing, Electrical Engineering and Numerical Methods.</AbstractNarration>
