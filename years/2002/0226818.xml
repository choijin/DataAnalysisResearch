<AbstractNarration>Concerns about changes in the world's environment have led scientists from many different nations to collaborate on a broad range of research and training activities.  Many of these activities are coordinated by one or more of three major international organizations: the World Climate Research Program (WCRP), which is overseen by the World Meteorological Organization; the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP), which is overseen by the International Council of Science (ICSU); and the International Human Dimensions Programme on Global Environmental Change (IHDP), which is overseen by the International Council of Science (ICSU) with cooperation from the International Social Science Council (ISSC).  The objective of the IHDP is to initiate, coordinate, and find support for research on the human dimensions of global change.  IHDP also places strong emphasis on developing research capacity on this topic and on strengthening national and international research networks.  A major emphasis of IHDP activities is the development and conduct of core projects.  Projects already established by IHDP deal with Land-Use and Land-Cover Change (LUCC; co-sponsored by IGBP), Institutional Dimensions of Global Environmental Change (IDGEC), Global Environmental Change and Human Security (GECHS), and Industrial Transformation.  This award will provide support for the IHDP Secretariat, which coordinates IHDP at the University of Bonn in Germany, and for activities undertaken by the Chair of the IHDP Scientific Committee and by its major coordinating committees.  Core support for the IHDP and its Secretariat is provided by NSF on behalf of agencies participating in the U.S. Global Change Research Program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through support of the IHDP, a solid investment is made in the infrastructure that fosters broader and deeper international, interdisciplinary collaborative networks.  This further strengthens scientific inquiry across a range of topics and projects, thereby helping to enhance fundamental knowledge about very important topics and issues.  Through its capacity-building activities, especially support for activities that education and involve more scientists from developing nations, the IHDP also facilitates a strengthening and diversification of the international scientific workforce.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
