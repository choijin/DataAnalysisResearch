<AbstractNarration>Research:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the United States makes the transition to a hydrogen economy, various technical challenges must be met. For vehicle fuel cell applications, a need exists for efficient production of hydrogen from liquid fuels. Liquid fuel reformer methods for hydrogen production must consider thermal interaction, startup procedures, and operating condition changes before these systems can become a truly viable energy alternative. Efficient operation often requires that chemical processing systems work well in different operating conditions and/or close to safety limitations. Chemical reaction systems may exhibit varied dynamic behavior based on the current operating conditions (nonlinear dynamics) and can sometimes switch to qualitatively different modes of operation (hybrid dynamics). This project considers nonlinear hybrid dynamic systems and with process safety constraints. The proposed methods require computational solution of difficult numerical optimization problems involving unknown variables that may take either continuous or integer values (mixed-integer optimization). Specifically, development and application of deterministic mixed-integer nonlinear optimization techniques for nonlinear process control applied to hydrogen production systems are considered. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project also examines integration of research and education in the development of research-related educational tools and student programs with student impact at both the national and local level. Process control educational software will be developed for national dissemination. A cross-disciplinary undergraduate process control laboratory will be developed using a collaborative research-based environment. Here, enrollment would be encouraged from an existing National Science Foundation sponsored undergraduate research communication studio and student groups not normally drawn to systems engineering careers such as the Society of Women Engineers and National Society of Black Engineers. Finally, an outreach program will be started with graduate students presenting engineering demonstrations in area high schools. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Impact &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Development and application of methods for improved operation of hydrogen production systems may have broad societal impact, aiding the transition to a hydrogen economy by improving system efficiency and speeding adoption of new technologies. In support of improved hydrogen production operation, development of novel chemical process control methods for complex nonlinear dynamic systems will be considered. Development of these concepts may have lasting effects across the chemical industry, in addition to improved hydrogen production system operation. Finally, development of improved general purpose deterministic mixed integer nonlinear programming solution methods may have impact across scientific and engineering disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
