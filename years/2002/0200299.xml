<AbstractNarration>The project focuses on cluster algebras recently discovered by the&lt;br/&gt;investigator in collaboration with S.Fomin. Cluster algebras are&lt;br/&gt;integral domains of a special kind designed to provide an&lt;br/&gt;algebraic framework for the study of total positivity and&lt;br/&gt;canonical bases in semisimple groups and their representations.&lt;br/&gt;The investigator studies structural properties of cluster algebras&lt;br/&gt;and their quantum deformations. This study uncovers unexpected&lt;br/&gt;connections with such diverse subjects as the structural theory of&lt;br/&gt;Kac-Moody algebras, thermodynamic Bethe ansatz, quiver&lt;br/&gt;representations, and integrable systems. One of the main&lt;br/&gt;instruments of the study is polyhedral combinatorics, more&lt;br/&gt;specifically, an interplay between piecewise-linear and&lt;br/&gt;subtraction-free birational transformations based on the tropical&lt;br/&gt;calculus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main motivation for this project comes from two classical areas&lt;br/&gt;of mathematics: representation theory and the theory of total&lt;br/&gt;positivity. Representation theory is a mathematical approach to&lt;br/&gt;studying symmetry; more specifically, it encodes the symmetry&lt;br/&gt;properties of various physical and biological systems that occur in&lt;br/&gt;nature. Total positivity is a remarkable property of matrices (arrays&lt;br/&gt;of numbers) that generalizes the familiar notion of positive numbers.&lt;br/&gt;Both theories&lt;br/&gt;find numerous applications in physics, chemistry and other&lt;br/&gt;sciences, as well as in other mathematical disciplines. In fact,&lt;br/&gt;representation theory serves as the mathematical foundation of&lt;br/&gt;quantum mechanics, while total positivity is a major tool for&lt;br/&gt;explaining oscillations in mechanical systems. During the last&lt;br/&gt;decade, deep connections were found between the two fields, and&lt;br/&gt;the scope of their applications was greatly extended. This&lt;br/&gt;project explores the modern framework of representation&lt;br/&gt;theory and total positivity, with the goal of making its formalism&lt;br/&gt;much more explicit and understandable.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
