    <AbstractNarration>The PI studies several problems about triangulations of (lattice)&lt;br/&gt;polytopes which are motivated by connections to other fields of&lt;br/&gt;mathematics:&lt;br/&gt;The reconstruction problem is concerned with the relation of a&lt;br/&gt;polytope and its graph, which is of interest for linear &lt;br/&gt;optimization. Algebraic applications are concerned with polytopes &lt;br/&gt;whose vertices have all integral coordinates. The existence &lt;br/&gt;problem of unimodular triangulations and its variations has &lt;br/&gt;implications to computational algebra, algebraic geometry, and &lt;br/&gt;physical string theory. The methods used are mainly discrete &lt;br/&gt;geometric or combinatorial, with some ideas borrowed from &lt;br/&gt;topology and differential geometry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Convex polytopes are fascinating objects that have intrigued not &lt;br/&gt;only mathematicians since the ancient Greeks. The Platonic &lt;br/&gt;solids --- the tetrahedron, the cube, the octahedron, the &lt;br/&gt;dodecahedron, and the icosahedron --- are the most prominent and &lt;br/&gt;most mystified examples. Since George Dantzig's simplex method, &lt;br/&gt;linear optimization has been a driving force behind polytope &lt;br/&gt;theory, and it certainly is one of the most successful &lt;br/&gt;applications of mathematics to the `real world'. In the mean time, &lt;br/&gt;polytope theory found many more applications within mathematics, &lt;br/&gt;and beyond. Besides linear and integer programming, there are &lt;br/&gt;optimization, CAD, visualization, and even theoretical physics,&lt;br/&gt;just to name a few.</AbstractNarration>
