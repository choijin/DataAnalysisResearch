    <AbstractNarration>With this renewal proposal the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports the ongoing work of Professor Angel E. Kaifer in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Miami. Professor Kaifer's work examines the electrochemistry of several macromolecular and supramolecular systems. The PI will synthesize and characterize redox active dendrimers, investigate new host-guest binding interactions between guest residues in these dendrimers and freely diffusing host molecules, and design and develop novel systems capable of forming molecular capsules under redox control. The PI has presented a clearly articulated plan intended to better understand the factors that control the thermodynamics and kinetics of electron transfer to redox groups appended to the focal point of dendrimers. These are important studies, because unlike the bioinorganic community, Kaifer's work is intended to use the secondary structure around the redox group to control redox properties. This is precisely what happens in proteins. The success of this work is leading Professor Kaifer in a new direction that involves the assembly of dendrons using smaller host molecules. In the future, this should provide a means to assemble more complex supermolecules that are even better protein analogs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this Award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program of the Division of Chemistry supports the research activities of Professor Angel E. Kaifer in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Miami. Professor Kaifer's work is significant since his studies may lead to the development of novel electrochemical sensors and intelligent materials. Also, it may provide insight into biological electron transfer reactions. The work will be carried out by a diverse group of graduate students and postdoctoral associates who will be trained in synthetic, chromatographic, spectroscopic and electrochemical techniques.</AbstractNarration>
