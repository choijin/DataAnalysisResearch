<AbstractNarration>Objective: The overall goal of this career proposal is to explore the purely interdisciplinary subject&lt;br/&gt;of feedback control system design for generation of rhythmic patterns found in animal locomotion,&lt;br/&gt;and to develop effective pedagogical methods for inspiring engineering students with benefits of&lt;br/&gt;biological knowledge in the context of systems and control.&lt;br/&gt;Specific Goals:&lt;br/&gt;I. Develop an orbital trajectory analysis method for a class of nonlinear systems arising from&lt;br/&gt;modeling of biological pattern generators.&lt;br/&gt;II. Establish a method for designing a dynamical system that achieves pattern generation with a&lt;br/&gt;prescribed oscillation profile.&lt;br/&gt;III. Revise the dynamics and control curriculum to provide a broader view of systems through&lt;br/&gt;crossdisciplinary training in neuroscience.&lt;br/&gt;IV. Integrate the bio-control research into the science and engineering education at broad levels&lt;br/&gt;including K-12 and college undergraduate.&lt;br/&gt;V. Broadly disseminate the results of the proposed activities.&lt;br/&gt;Methods and Procedures (Keyed to the Specific Goals):&lt;br/&gt;I. Mathematically formulate an oscillation analysis problem and derive a solution using tools&lt;br/&gt;from robust control theory. Examine the degree of conservatism exploiting the biological knowl-edge&lt;br/&gt;of particular central pattern generator (CPG) architectures.&lt;br/&gt;II. Use the analysis result in I as a basis for developing a general theory for the design of CPGs&lt;br/&gt;utilizing linear matrix inequality methods. Test the applicability of the design conditions against&lt;br/&gt;the CPGs known from biology.&lt;br/&gt;III. Improve an undergraduate course on systems modeling by introducing neuronal modeling&lt;br/&gt;and pattern generation mechanism. Develop a new graduate course on robust and nonlinear control&lt;br/&gt;for regulation and biological oscillation.&lt;br/&gt;IV. Develop research-based educational tools through multidisciplinary, teamworking, senior&lt;br/&gt;thesis projects. Use the tools to stimulate K-12 and undergraduate students' intellectual curiosity&lt;br/&gt;into engineering and science through a series of outreach/educational activities.&lt;br/&gt;V. Utilize conference presentations, publications in archival journals, invited seminars, and&lt;br/&gt;possibly tutorial workshops in major international conferences.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The central theme of feedback control theory has been the regulation around an&lt;br/&gt;equilibrium point of a dynamical system. In contrast, much less attention has been paid to control&lt;br/&gt;specifications involving periodic motion (or oscillation) generation despite their practical impor-tance.&lt;br/&gt;The basic research outlined in this proposal will provide an initial stepping stone toward a&lt;br/&gt;new control paradigm that focuses on autonomous pattern generation by feedback dynamics. In&lt;br/&gt;particular, the project will establish a systematic method for analysis and design of pattern genera-tors&lt;br/&gt;through the exploitation of biological knowledge on neuronal oscillators.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The crossdisciplinary research activities over biology and control fields are in-tegrated&lt;br/&gt;into educational activities at all levels. The revised curriculum will provide undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;and graduate students with a broader perspective on engineering problems. The senior thesis project&lt;br/&gt;will develop students with team-oriented problem-solving skills in a multidisciplinary environment.&lt;br/&gt;The outreach activities will contribute to improve scientific literacy of K-12 students.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
