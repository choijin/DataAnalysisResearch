    <AbstractNarration>This dissertation project posits that biomedicine, even in the face of mounting ethical dilemmas raised by Islamic scholars' condemnations of new body-modifying and life-altering possibilities such as organ donation, maintains authority and social legitimacy in the culture of contemporary Egypt. Further, the project proposes that the Egyptian state plays a crucial role in maintaining biomedical authority and its cultural legitimacy by closely mediating the relationship between Egypt's biomedical community and the&lt;br/&gt;opinions of Islamic legal scholarship. The project seeks to critique the polarization of "Islam" and "science," predominant in local and international discourse, by uncovering the ways in which the production of knowledge about bioethics in the domains of biomedicine and Islamic scholarship in Egypt in fact occur within the same social and structural field. This study further questions how patients' interests and understandings of bioethical dilemmas fit within this institutional complex in Egypt through a detailed ethnography of the reception and application of emerging biomedical technologies, Islamic legal decisions about them, state legislation, and their consumption by the general public. The politics of organ donation, currently the central problematic in contemporary Egyptian bioethics, constitutes a primary site through which to analyze how these various institutions manage bioethical debates. The project will rely on ethnographic analysis of biomedical practice involving organ donation in clinical settings (based in Kasr el Aini Teaching Hospital) in order to analyze patients' lived experiences of these debates. Specifically, it will examine the ways in which physicians and patients encounter and manage ethical dilemmas. Further evidence will be drawn from analyses of medical training in ethics (whether explicit or implicit), interviews with Islamic legal scholars and state legislators, and textual analyses of contemporary bioethical debates in Egypt (including Islamic legal texts, state legislative reports and decisions, media reports, and biomedical treatises). This project will contribute significantly to the study of how Islamic scholarship deals with, and may often be overshadowed by, new scientific knowledge. It will also offer a non-western case study to the emerging field of science studies, in which scholars have provided analyses of the ways in which biomedical knowledge is produced and codified into daily practice. By focusing on ethics in an Islamic context, this study will offer new insights into the role religion plays in simultaneously embracing and shunning new biotechnologies. The study focuses on the place of an "Islamic response" to biotechnologies within the confines of the modern state, and within the context of global debates about bio-ethics. Results from this research will have broader implications for understanding what the collusion among dominant fields of knowledge (Islamic scholarship, science, and state legislature), in their negotiation of bio-ethical concerns, means for ordinary people faced with new technological possibilities for the management of their lives.</AbstractNarration>
