<AbstractNarration>Providing assurance of security and privacy is becoming more difficult with current trends towards building computing infrastructure out of distributed components connected by networks, including untrusted client machines. Important to this assurance are the confidentiality and integrity properties of distributed systems that serve principals whose trust in each other is incomplete. This description encompasses, among others, clinical information systems, joint military information&lt;br/&gt;systems, and financial information systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A new security mechanism, secure program partitioning, can provide stronger, end-to-end assurance that data remains confidential.  In this approach, programs are transformed according to strong security&lt;br/&gt;policies, resulting in secure distributed systems.  This is an attractive way to specify and enforce confidentiality and integrity in environments that include untrusted, possibly malicious host machines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because the integrity of distributed computations and data is difficult to maintain in the presence of untrusted hosts, this research investigates an extension of secure program partitioning to use&lt;br/&gt;redundant computation to preserve integrity.  In addition, new models of information flow in concurrent systems are being explored because the current theory and practice of security for concurrent systems is&lt;br/&gt;restrictive, yet also unsound. This is especially important because distributed systems are naturally concurrent.  Solutions to these problems are being implemented as part of the Jif language system.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
