<AbstractNarration>This project will develop techniques for trusted systems that can provide correct information and take correct actions when needed and where needed.  The focus will be on peer-to-peer (P2P) systems, where computers or nodes operate autonomously, without any central control.  In a P2P system, each node provides storage and compute resources. It connects to other neighbor nodes, and the community provides services like file sharing, document archiving, or data analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;P2P systems are especially well suited as the "backbone" of a trusted system because nodes operate independently, without reliance on particular network connections or on nodes with a fixed functionality.  Thus, a P2P system can adapt to a changing environment, and with the proper mechanisms, can isolate or ignore malicious nodes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As part of the project, several important problems will be addressed such as: &lt;br/&gt; Denial of Service (DoS): How does one protect against malicious sites that generate excess load to prevent others from receiving resources or service?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Searching: How does one efficiently find information without using centralized index facilities, and in a dynamically changing environment? &lt;br/&gt;Information Authenticity: How does one verify the authenticity of documents or information?&lt;br/&gt; Preservation: How does one preserve information past the lifetime of the originating node?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research is high risk, but there is also the potential for a large payoff.  The research is high risk because the problems faced are difficult: Building a trusted community out of building blocks that may be transient and malicious, is not an easy task.  However, the only way to build a trusted system is, as proposed, by making as few assumptions as possible about the trustworthiness of its components. The techniques to be developed, if successful, will provide a solid foundation for building truly reliable, secure, and trusted systems for electronic commerce, military applications, healthcare, and many other applications.</AbstractNarration>
