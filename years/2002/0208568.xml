<AbstractNarration>    The increasing requirements on data rate and quality of&lt;br/&gt;service for wireless communications systems call for new&lt;br/&gt;techniques to improve radio link reliability and to increase&lt;br/&gt;spectral efficiency.  The three key technologies to achieve these&lt;br/&gt;goals are equalization, diversity, and channel coding.&lt;br/&gt;Mathematics is of fundamental importance to these technologies,&lt;br/&gt;providing the theoretical basis as well as the means for&lt;br/&gt;efficient numerical implementations.  The investigator derives a&lt;br/&gt;theoretical and numerical framework for designing equalization&lt;br/&gt;techniques for time-varying channels.  Using methods from&lt;br/&gt;pseudo-differential operator theory and time-frequency analysis,&lt;br/&gt;he develops a qualitative and quantitative theory for the&lt;br/&gt;approximate diagonalization of operators associated with&lt;br/&gt;time-varying systems.  These theoretical results form a keystone&lt;br/&gt;in the construction of fast and reliable numerical equalization&lt;br/&gt;methods that are based on Krylov subspace techniques.  The&lt;br/&gt;investigator also studies the use of frame theory in wireless&lt;br/&gt;communications.  Using concepts from sphere packings and group&lt;br/&gt;theory, he analyzes theoretical properties of special frames such&lt;br/&gt;as Grassmannian frames.  Furthermore, he develops theoretical and&lt;br/&gt;numerical schemes in connection with multi-carrier communication&lt;br/&gt;systems such as OFDM.  This includes the design of transmission&lt;br/&gt;signals with specific properties using a generalization of the&lt;br/&gt;concept of prolate spheroidal wave functions.  By taking recent&lt;br/&gt;tools from harmonic analysis into the wireless communications&lt;br/&gt;community, this project enables further advances and&lt;br/&gt;breakthroughs in wireless communications.  At the same time it&lt;br/&gt;stimulates new research areas in applied mathematics and paves&lt;br/&gt;the road for further interactions between applied mathematicians&lt;br/&gt;and communication engineers.&lt;br/&gt;     The goal of this project is to develop mathematical concepts&lt;br/&gt;and computational methods for wireless communications technology.&lt;br/&gt;The investigator combines modern tools from mathematics with&lt;br/&gt;methods from information theory and signal processing to develop&lt;br/&gt;new concepts and algorithms for key technologies in wireless&lt;br/&gt;communications, such as coding, transmission, and equalization.&lt;br/&gt;Mathematics is of fundamental importance to these technologies,&lt;br/&gt;because it provides the theoretical basis as well as the means&lt;br/&gt;for efficient numerical implementations.  By providing tools to&lt;br/&gt;improve radio link reliability and increase data rates, this&lt;br/&gt;project is instrumental in meeting the increasing requirements on&lt;br/&gt;future wireless communications systems.  The project produces&lt;br/&gt;conceptual deliverables in the form of new mathematical methods&lt;br/&gt;to analyze and construct wireless transmission systems.  The&lt;br/&gt;project also produces concrete deliverables in the form of&lt;br/&gt;numerical algorithms for use in the scientific and industrial&lt;br/&gt;sector.</AbstractNarration>
