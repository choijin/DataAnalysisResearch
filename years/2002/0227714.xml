<AbstractNarration>0227714&lt;br/&gt;Edwards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Society for the Study of Evolution (SSE) and the Society of Systematic&lt;br/&gt;Biologists (SSB) are the premier Societies in the US for discussion and&lt;br/&gt;dissemination of ideas relating to evolution. This proposal will provide&lt;br/&gt;travel costs, registration costs, and lodging costs to approximately 15&lt;br/&gt;minority undergraduates for the annual meetings of these societies for the&lt;br/&gt;years 2003 - 2006.  These undergraduates will also present posters at the&lt;br/&gt;meetings.  The proposal is an outgrowth of a pilot program conducted at&lt;br/&gt;the 2001 meetings which raised awareness and enthusiasm for the need to&lt;br/&gt;broaden the undergraduate base at the meetings.  During the meetings the&lt;br/&gt;undergraduates will be mentored by graduate student and faculty mentors,&lt;br/&gt;who will help the undergraduate network at the meetings, help demystify&lt;br/&gt;talks for the undergraduates, and generally make the students feel more&lt;br/&gt;welcome at the meetings.  There will also be an official mentoring session&lt;br/&gt;for undergraduates, consisting of a 'pep-talk'/seminar that will help&lt;br/&gt;encourage the students to prepare for careers and/or graduate school in&lt;br/&gt;evolutionary/environmental biology.  These activities will be supplemented&lt;br/&gt;by social activities not covered by this grant, as well as further efforts&lt;br/&gt;on the part of both societies for encouraging undergraduate participation,&lt;br/&gt;such as reduced registration fees, daily fees for attendance by students&lt;br/&gt;at the host site, and an undergraduate poster session.  These activities&lt;br/&gt;will help increase the amount of minority and other undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;participation at the meetings, and ultimately should have a positive&lt;br/&gt;effect on minority participation in evolutionary biology nationally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
