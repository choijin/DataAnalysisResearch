<AbstractNarration>Social and ecological influences on the anti-predator defenses of black-tailed prairie dogs: a role for behavior in conservation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Donald H. Owings, Ph.D. and Debra M. Shier&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project integrates the study of animal behavior and conservation biology by investigating how black-tailed prairie dogs become skillful at dealing with danger from predators. It has long been hypothesized that animals reared in captivity and released into the wild suffer exceptionally high mortality from predation, but to date little organized research has addressed this topic.  If this hypothesis receives support, then the conditions that support development of skillful response to predators need to be provided to prairie dogs and other threatened species who are reared in captivity for release and re-establishment of wild populations. Research will test the hypothesis that experience with predators is needed for prairie dogs to learn to be effective in evading predation, and that other family members are an especially important source of that learning in this highly social species. Though an animal's social environment has been shown to affect the development of behaviors such as novel foraging strategies, the impact of social inputs on the development of defensive behavior has received little attention.  Over the course of four field seasons, three experiments will be conducted to examine 1) whether animals trapped and moved in family groups show a higher survival rate following release to a new site than animals trapped and moved without regard to family composition; 2) if repeated exposure to predators during the first few weeks of life affects the development of effective antipredator behavior; and 3) how the presence of the mother, other experienced relatives, and/or inexperienced siblings affect the development of defensive behavior.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
