<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;Pathogens and parasites are a major component of biological diversity, and have&lt;br/&gt;important impacts on natural populations. A central question in host-parasite ecology concerns&lt;br/&gt;what features of host behavior, life history, and environment best explain the diversity and&lt;br/&gt;evolution of infectious diseases. Significant theoretical progress has advanced our understanding&lt;br/&gt;of factors that influence infectious disease dynamics within populations, yet relatively few&lt;br/&gt;studies have analyzed ecological variables that underlie observed variation in pathogen diversity&lt;br/&gt;and characteristics. This project will examine patterns of parasite diversity across three&lt;br/&gt;mammalian orders to explicitly test predictions derived from both epidemiological models and&lt;br/&gt;island biogeography theory. Major questions this project will address include (1) What are the&lt;br/&gt;key ecological variables that determine variation in the types and diversity of parasites in wild&lt;br/&gt;mammal populations? (2) How do parasite transmission mode and the degree of specificity&lt;br/&gt;depend on host ecology? (3) Does evolutionary diversification of hosts correlate with patterns of&lt;br/&gt;parasite species richness? (4) Does knowledge of parasite diversity have important implications&lt;br/&gt;for wildlife conservation?&lt;br/&gt;Establishing a large database on the pathogens and parasites infecting wild mammals is&lt;br/&gt;critical to conducting comprehensive analyses and represents a major goal of this project. The&lt;br/&gt;investigators have recently assembled a large database on the pathogens and parasites of&lt;br/&gt;primates and will extend this effort to two other well-studied groups - carnivores and ungulates.&lt;br/&gt;These databases capture (i) ecological, behavioral and life history traits relevant to theoretical&lt;br/&gt;models of disease spread, (ii) records of parasites and pathogens recovered from wild&lt;br/&gt;populations, (iii) data on parasite transmission mode and degree of host specificity, and (iv)&lt;br/&gt;phylogenetic information on the hosts. Database development requires an immense effort and&lt;br/&gt;following this study all data will be made freely available over the World Wide Web so that&lt;br/&gt;other scientists can access the fruits of this labor.&lt;br/&gt;Understanding factors that underlie parasite diversity and characteristics is vital to&lt;br/&gt;managing vulnerable wildlife populations and mitigating threats to human health. This study&lt;br/&gt;extends the scope of previous host-parasite comparative work by examining a rich diversity of&lt;br/&gt;both micro- and macroparasites, including information on parasite characteristics, and by&lt;br/&gt;assessing phylogenetic information involving tree topology, branch lengths and rates of host&lt;br/&gt;diversification. Analytical comparative methods will control for sampling effort, test multiple&lt;br/&gt;variables simultaneously, and will assess whether host and parasite traits are correlated with&lt;br/&gt;phylogeny. A synthetic approach that links ecology, parasitology, epidemiology, and&lt;br/&gt;phylogenetic comparative methods is crucial for developing a broad conceptual framework to&lt;br/&gt;explain parasite diversity and characteristics in relation to host features. To advance these goals,&lt;br/&gt;the investigators will organize three annual workshops composed of experts from each of these&lt;br/&gt;disciplines to refine predictions for comparative research, explore methods for examining&lt;br/&gt;ecological and evolutionary interactions in host-parasite assemblages, and chart future directions&lt;br/&gt;for both theoretical and empirical work.</AbstractNarration>
