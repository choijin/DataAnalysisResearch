<AbstractNarration>This award from the Major Research Instrumentation program supports the University of California at Santa Barbara with the acquisition of a state-of-the-art field emission transmission electron microscope (FE-TEM) with capabilities for atomic resolution Z-contrast imaging and spectroscopy. The instrument is crucial to meet needs in ongoing and future research projects in electronic, inorganic, and structural materials, UCSB proposes the acquisition.  The needs of the research can be fulfilled with a 200 kV TEM/STEM equipped with a field emission source, high angle annular dark field detector, a 2Kx2K CCD detector, and state-of-the-art electron spectrometer/energy filter. Z-contrast imaging and atomic resolution spectroscopy have been routinely demonstrated on the instrument with a 1.4 Angstrom probe size, 20 picoAmpere beam current, and energy resolution of ~0.7 electron Volts.  The acquisition of the proposed FE-TEM will free an existing conventional 200 kV TEM for studies of soft materials.  &lt;br/&gt;The acquisition of the new FE-TEM will strengthen the education of students in advanced TEM.  Graduate students and post-doctoral researchers are the primary 'hands-on' users of TEM at UCSB.  Formal training in TEM is provided in a series of courses is offered in the Materials Department. A new course in advanced TEM that reflects the unique capabilities of a FE-TEM will be offered.  The advanced TEM course will include a lab module to provide hands-on training in high-resolution imaging in CTEM and in STEM and in advanced analytical techniques, such as electron energy-loss spectroscopy.  Through the Outreach program of the MRSEC, the scientists will work with high school teachers on TEM sample preparation and imaging and thus teach and connect  to a broad community of students and teachers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To meet needs in ongoing and future research projects in advanced electronic, inorganic, and structural materials, UCSB will acquire a state-of-the-art field emission transmission electron microscope (FE-TEM).  Such an instrument produces an atomic scale electron probe.  This sub-nanometer probe (~2 x 10-10 meters) can be used to image individual atoms and atomic columns with direct information on structure, composition, and bonding.  An advanced FE-TEM provides a unique combination of atomic-scale information that is essential for the advancement of nanoscience and nanotechnology.&lt;br/&gt;Graduate students and post-doctoral researchers are the primary 'hands-on' users of TEM at UCSB.
