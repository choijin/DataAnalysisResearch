<AbstractNarration>PROPOSAL NO.: 0230535&lt;br/&gt;PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Kukreti, Anant&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION NAME: University of Cincinnati Main Campus&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: Science and Mathematics Authentic inquiRy-based Teaching: Project SMART for K-12&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project SMART partners engineering and education faculty members with K-12 educators to&lt;br/&gt;empower high school students to successfully complete college.. Project SMART recognizes that effective student education requires authentic, inquiry-based learning. By solving open-ended problems based upon real world examples, students will link the relevance of their education with their daily lives and appreciate&lt;br/&gt;the intrinsic and tangible values of science and mathematics in modern society. The five goals of Project&lt;br/&gt;SMART include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Improving science and mathematics achievement of ALL students, consistent with our overarching&lt;br/&gt;goal ioTo Leave No Child Behind.l_&lt;br/&gt; Training secondary science and mathematics educators to incorporate authentic, inquiry-based&lt;br/&gt;education into current secondary science and mathematics curricula.&lt;br/&gt; Attracting secondary school students to engineering; enhancing the perception of career opportunities in engineering; and improving students SMET related skills to become successful engineers.&lt;br/&gt; Instilling an awareness of the importance of learning science and mathematics skills in K-6&lt;br/&gt;administrators, teachers, parents, and students.&lt;br/&gt; Increasing the quantity and quality of gender and ethnic student diversity in SMET related courses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The partners  form a unique alliance among engineering and education faculty of the University of&lt;br/&gt;Cincinnati (UC), the Southwest Ohio section of High Schools That Work (HSTW), and the Greater&lt;br/&gt;Cincinnati Tech. Prep. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For this planning proposal, we have presented our preliminary thoughts on the main elements envisioned&lt;br/&gt;for Project SMART, including: 1) teacher professional development; 2) educational resources for&lt;br/&gt;teachers; 3) student programs: out of the classroom and into the world of science and mathematics; 4) pre-&lt;br/&gt;engineering program for high school students; and 5) evaluation, assessment and improvement. In&lt;br/&gt;particular, we have proposed special programs specifically targeting traditionally underrepresented groups&lt;br/&gt;in SMET related fields including ethnic minorities and girls. In addition, we have presented our views on&lt;br/&gt;ininstructional theorylu which will form the context for the planning and development of these elements.&lt;br/&gt;The Project Committee believes that the implementation of Project SMART in the microcosm of&lt;br/&gt;Cincinnati is transferable to other school districts struggling with similar education problems. During the&lt;br/&gt;last century, Ohio lead the nation as a strong manufacturing state. Now, we must change our educational&lt;br/&gt;style to keep up with society's technological demands. Project SMART is envisioned to transform the&lt;br/&gt;lives of students it touches by tearing down barriers to high paying jobs and creating informed citizens.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
