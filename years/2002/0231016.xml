<AbstractNarration>Inventive computer-based technology has been developed over the last few years to allow students to design and conduct supervised experiments within their undergraduate courses.  This is a desirable trend because encouraging students to view psychology as a science enhances their critical thinking and hypothesis-testing skills.  At present, however, resources for classroom experimentation in developmental cognition are scarce, largely due to logistical difficulties that arise with children as research subjects. To fill this gap, in this proof of concept project we are developing Interactive Video Assignments -- a digital library accompanied by researcher-designed activities that guide students' interactions with the videos, ultimately allowing virtual experimentation with a diverse group of children, both longitudinally and cross-culturally. To test our concept, we are using LessonLab's innovative technology to develop two interactive video assignments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary components of the project include a) videotaping children participating in related experimental tasks (i.e., the theory of mind Assignment) and/or in naturalistic settings (i.e., the language acquisition Assignment); b) digitizing and transcribing the videos; c) compiling a digitized set of empirical readings and researcher interviews to accompany and enhance the videos; d) creating integrated, concept-based tasks that encourage students to interact with the resources in the digital library and to think critically about the research methods as well as the behavioral outcomes; and e) conducting assessments of the prototype based on student/faculty interest and engagement as well as educational outcomes. CD-ROMs containing the digitized resources will be distributed to our beta testers at universities and colleges, along with access to the interactive tasks through the LessonLab network portal via licensed password. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
