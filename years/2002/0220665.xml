<AbstractNarration>This program provides scholarships to talented, low-income students majoring in computer science, computer technology, engineering, engineering technology and mathematics. Special consideration for scholarships is given to the recruitment and retention of women and minorities in these fields. Students are retained in the program through strategies to enhance learning experiences, by participation in cohort group learning and support, and with academic tutoring and faculty advising. Information about the scholarship program is broadly disseminated in order to encourage other low-income students to aspire to and prepare for college careers in these fields. The program builds on relationships with industry to assist in recruitment, retention and in providing employment opportunities. The college also continues to foster relationships with 4-year colleges for both AS and AAS transfer students. Ridgewater College Foundation, the financial aid office, and the counseling office, ensure timely and careful selection of scholarship winners and processing of student information. Scholarship recipients are identified as winners on campus and in the community and are encouraged to participate in cohort groups of 15 members on each of two campuses. An advocacy team made up of faculty, counselors, industry representatives and high school staff meet twice yearly to review progress in achieving program goals and to make recommendations for improvements.</AbstractNarration>
