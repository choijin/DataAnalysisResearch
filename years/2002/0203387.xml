<AbstractNarration>0203387&lt;br/&gt;Lin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program will systematically develop a nonsmooth feedback design &lt;br/&gt;methodology for the control of genuinely nonlinear systems that may not &lt;br/&gt;be dealt with, even locally, by any smooth feedback. Nonsmooth feedback &lt;br/&gt;designs offer the potential to overcome some topological obstructions of &lt;br/&gt;the system that cannot be addressed by smooth controls, for example, to &lt;br/&gt;globally stabilize a nonlinear system that is not stabilizable by any linear &lt;br/&gt;or smooth state feedback. The research will address some of the most &lt;br/&gt;critical and challenging issues in the field of nonlinear control, including &lt;br/&gt;global strong stabilization, practical output tracking and adaptive control &lt;br/&gt;for nonlinearly parameterized systems with uncontrollable unstable &lt;br/&gt;linearization.  A unique thread in our development is the explicit &lt;br/&gt;construction of homogeneous-like Lyapunov functions and non-Lipschitz &lt;br/&gt;continuous controllers, based on a synthesis of methods drawn from &lt;br/&gt;differential geometric control theory, homogeneous systems theory, as &lt;br/&gt;well as the development of feedback domination design techniques for the &lt;br/&gt;control of nonlinear systems whose Jacobian linearization contains &lt;br/&gt;uncontrollable modes associated with eigenvalues on the right-half plane.   &lt;br/&gt;This work will also include a geometric characterization and a higher-&lt;br/&gt;order normal form for a significant class of nonlinear systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many control systems of practical importance (e.g. internet network, &lt;br/&gt;manufacturing systems, biomimetic actuator systems, electrically &lt;br/&gt;stimulated muscles, underwater or aerospace vehicles and so on) have &lt;br/&gt;genuinely nonlinear characteristics that cannot be dealt with by existing &lt;br/&gt;feedback design methods; most of them are smooth in nature. In fact, a &lt;br/&gt;goal of active research has been to transform a physical dynamic system &lt;br/&gt;into a linear one for which the well-developed modern control techniques &lt;br/&gt;(linear systems theory) are readily applicable. These "linearizing" &lt;br/&gt;techniques have serious limitations due to canceling the system &lt;br/&gt;nonlinearity by feedback or neglecting the complexity of dynamic &lt;br/&gt;systems. Consequently, these design methods have not found wide &lt;br/&gt;applications in a number of new real-world problems, such as control of &lt;br/&gt;complex network (e.g. internet or power systems network) or controlling &lt;br/&gt;the position and speed in sophisticated weapons (e.g. missiles and &lt;br/&gt;advanced combat aircraft). The purpose of this research is to find ways to &lt;br/&gt;take advantage of the potentially dramatic, though nonintuitive, effects &lt;br/&gt;caused by the inherent nonlinearity or complex interactions of physical &lt;br/&gt;forces with physical systems. The main outcome of the proposed research &lt;br/&gt;will be new, nonsmooth feedback design methodologies for the control of &lt;br/&gt;dynamic systems. It is expected that the benefits to a systematic approach &lt;br/&gt;towards using nonsmooth control will be becoming widely appreciated, &lt;br/&gt;particularly in industries (e.g. manufacturing, aerospace, power and &lt;br/&gt;biomedical engineering) where many applications of nonsmooth control &lt;br/&gt;can be found.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
