<AbstractNarration>A grant has been awarded to Florida A&amp;M University under the direction of Dr. Michael Hubbard to enable online access to research collections of mayflies at Florida A&amp;M University (FAMU).  The grant continues NSF support of these important collections by providing resources to move historical records onto an internet accessible museum database.  FAMU is responsible for the care of collections representing original surveys of many aquatic insects in the Southeastern states.  Other extensive holdings are of worldwide importance and represent research accomplishments of FAMU faculty and collections donated to FAMU because of the University's internationally recognized expertise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant continues previous NSF support for taking care of historic donations.  A major portion of the grant is concerned with moving the information contained in these collections to online access using a museum database designed under NSF support.  Records will be converted from a card catalog to electronic format for internet access.  The records at FAMU, dating from the 1940's, formed the basis for developing biological water quality standards in the state and provide the records necessary to document change over time.  These records can be located on a modern georeferencing system with the planned addition of latitude-longitude coordinates.  As an affiliate of the Florida State Collection of Arthropods, all records at FAMU can also link to other databases within the state. &lt;br/&gt;         &lt;br/&gt;NSF recognizes that there is a wealth of information to be found in historic collections that must be available to modern researchers using modern data-gathering techniques.  NSF support also helps undergraduate students and provides training in museum management and care of scientific material.  Students under previous NSF support have already gone on to entomological or biological careers, some with graduate degrees.  All entomological programs at FAMU support school enrichment activities, provide workshops and training programs, identify insects on request, and participate in the community.  Research specimens are loaned internationally and numerous visitors from abroad visit Tallahassee to study these mayflies, all as a result of important NSF support.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
