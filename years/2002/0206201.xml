<AbstractNarration>The Year of Algebra 2002- 2003 at the University of Florida &lt;br/&gt;is highlighted by the celebration of the 70th birthday of John&lt;br/&gt;G. Thompson.  The general theme of the Year of Algebra is provided &lt;br/&gt;by the wider context of Thompson's monumental contributions: the &lt;br/&gt;beauty and power of group theory, and how it applies to problems of&lt;br/&gt;arithmetic via the basic principle of Galois. The Year of Algebra &lt;br/&gt;features a conference in Galois Theory (Nov. 3--9, 2002), a conference&lt;br/&gt;in Group Theory (March 9--16, 2003) and a workshop on Computational&lt;br/&gt;Aspects of Algebraic Curves, and Cryptography (March 9--15, 2003).&lt;br/&gt;The Galois conference centers around the Inverse Problem of Galois&lt;br/&gt;Theory, one of the major open problems of mathematics. The conference&lt;br/&gt;on Finite Group Theory has speakers involved in the completion/&lt;br/&gt;revision of the Classification, as well as speakers in Representation&lt;br/&gt;Theory, and applications of Finite Groups to Finite Geometries and&lt;br/&gt;other areas. The workshop deals with interactions between modern &lt;br/&gt;computational tools/questions and the theory of algebraic curves,&lt;br/&gt;emphasizing the application to public key cryptography. It has a &lt;br/&gt;strong instructional component (mini-courses).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Group Theory is the abstract study of symmetry patterns (of any&lt;br/&gt;object), and Galois Theory provides tools for applying Group Theory&lt;br/&gt;to algebra and arithmetic. Recent applications to data security&lt;br/&gt;(public key cryptography) are the topic of the workshop. Galois &lt;br/&gt;Theory and Group Theory have further applications to physics, &lt;br/&gt;chemistry and coding theory. The Year of Algebra provides an&lt;br/&gt;opportunity for young mathematicians, women and minorities to &lt;br/&gt;learn the latest advances.  It was John G. Thompson who shaped &lt;br/&gt;finite group theory like no-one else, leading the way towards a &lt;br/&gt;major milestone of 20th century mathematics, the classification&lt;br/&gt;of finite simple groups.  After the classification, it was again&lt;br/&gt;J. Thompson who led the way in exploring its implications for&lt;br/&gt;Galois Theory.  For these contributions, Thompson has recently&lt;br/&gt;been awarded the National Medal of Science. He also won the Fields&lt;br/&gt;Medal, the highest honor in mathematics. For the Year of Algebra,&lt;br/&gt;University of Florida Graduate Research Professor John G. Thompson&lt;br/&gt;acts as an advisor. His powerful ideas continue to inspire the young.&lt;br/&gt;We want to use this opportunity in a special effort to integrate&lt;br/&gt;research and education during the Year of Algebra. While the two&lt;br/&gt;conferences emphasize latest advances in research, the workshop &lt;br/&gt;has a strong instructional component.</AbstractNarration>
