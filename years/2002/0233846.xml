    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a trace-gas detection system based on a novel laser spectroscopic technique called Phase Sensitive Spectroscopy. This new spectroscopy technique may increase sensitivity by an order of magnitude compared to existing capabilities, and it is expected have lower capital and operating costs as well. The proposed technique relies on measurements of phase shifts of an amplitude modulated laser beam that occur when the laser is tune through a molecular resonance. Unlike current technologies, the measured quantity is insensitive to variations in the amplitude of the frequency components within the modulated laser beam. This fundamental difference promises to eliminate the need for calibrations that are currently required. Phase II will develop the fundamental understanding and lay the groundwork for commercialization. A prototype instrument will be fabricated by utilizing the 'backbone' of an existing commercially successful laser based trace-gas detector. The detection limit, stability, and cost of the prototype instrument will be characterized.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Potential commercial applications are expected in monitoring gases in aluminum production and in other industries as environmental regulation and work place safety may require.
