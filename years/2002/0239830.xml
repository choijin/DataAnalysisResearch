<AbstractNarration>This project will examine the behavior of the ring current under different solar wind conditions and during different phases of the solar cycle.  The mechanisms by which solar wind energy is coupled into the magnetosphere will also be examined.  Data from ground-based magnetometers as well as data from in situ spacecraft measurements will be utilized to characterize the status of the ring current.  This will allow an improved understanding of the dynamics of the ring current, particularly during different phases of a magnetic storm.  The work will be performed at the University of Texas El Paso (UTEP), a university that has traditionally served an under-represented minority (Hispanic) in scientific research.  The grant will fund students working on Master's theses as well as a number of undergraduate research projects.  It is likely that one or more of the graduate students will go on to earn a Ph.D. in space physics or a closely related field.  The project will also develop space-science-focused Peer Instruction concept questions.  These questions will be collected and disseminated via the NSF-supported Project Galileo website.  By disseminating the results through Project Galileo the material will effect physics education not only at UTEP but at many other institutions as well.</AbstractNarration>
