<AbstractNarration>LAY ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;BARTNESS, TIMOTHY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Animals in nature must forage for food to help pay their energy debts.  Once they find a food source, the food found has three fates. First, it can be eaten and the energy used immediately if they have an immediate energy debt to pay. Alternatively, if no immediate need exists, the energy can be stored as body fat. Finally, it can be brought to their homes and stored as a food hoard. Little is know about what drives the animals to forage for food, in terms of underlying brain or hormonal factors, or what causes them to eat and burn the calories, eat and store the calories as fat, or hoard the food for later consumption. The purpose of the first experiments is to test some brain chemicals that control these fates of the foraged food, as well as foraging itself by applying them to the brain.  The purpose of the second experiments is to test whether changes in body fat affect foraging, food hoarding and food eaten by experimentally removing or adding body fat and measuring these responses.  How animals acquire, use and store food energy is a fundamental problem in the regulatory biology of all species.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
