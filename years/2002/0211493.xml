    <AbstractNarration>The Molecular Genetics of Bacteria and Phages Conference, traditionally held at Cold&lt;br/&gt;Spring Harbor and now being held in alternate years at the University of Wisconsin in Madison&lt;br/&gt;and at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, is a central forum for the presentation of new results&lt;br/&gt;in prokaryotic molecular genetics. On the order of 200-400 participants attend, representing&lt;br/&gt;laboratories throughout the world, and most present either short talks or posters. Its breadth&lt;br/&gt;makes it an important focus for the exchange of information in this era of scientific&lt;br/&gt;specialization. Topics covered include fundamental work on bacterial replication,&lt;br/&gt;recombination, repair, transposition, transcription, control of gene expression, translation,&lt;br/&gt;signalling, heat shock, protein folding and secretion, cell development and division, and&lt;br/&gt;pathogenesis.&lt;br/&gt;For many graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, this is the first large meeting at&lt;br/&gt;which they have an opportunity to speak. Due to its highly interactive nature, the meeting&lt;br/&gt;provides an important opportunity for these young scientists to meet and talk to the senior&lt;br/&gt;scientists they know from the literature. In response to the large numbers of students who attend&lt;br/&gt;the meeting and the diversity of topics covered, established and distinguished scientists are&lt;br/&gt;invited to chair each session. This strengthens the meeting because each chairperson gives a&lt;br/&gt;short introduction in which he or she summarizes some of the key facets of the field to be&lt;br/&gt;covered and provides a conceptual framework for the major questions that the talks will address.&lt;br/&gt;As an additional benefit, publicizing the judiciously chosen chairpeople and session topics in&lt;br/&gt;announcements of the meeting, encourages the submission of abstracts in exciting new areas and&lt;br/&gt;stimulates attendance by a larger constituency</AbstractNarration>
