<AbstractNarration>The Principle Investigator studies a new class of inequalities &lt;br/&gt;on the flag f-vector of convex polytopes. The flag f-vector &lt;br/&gt;contains all the enumerative incidence information between the &lt;br/&gt;faces of a polytope. Thus to classify the set of all possible &lt;br/&gt;flag f-vectors is one of the great open problems in discrete &lt;br/&gt;geometry.  To date only partial results to this problem have &lt;br/&gt;been obtained.  In a related problem, the Principle Investigator &lt;br/&gt;and his Research Assistant will study the homology groups of &lt;br/&gt;Newtonian coalgebras that arise in polytopal theory.  These &lt;br/&gt;homology groups were recently used to give an algebraic proof &lt;br/&gt;of the existence of the cd-index, an important invariant in&lt;br/&gt;poset theory.  Understanding the homology of these chain &lt;br/&gt;complexes will give insight into new applications of Newtonian &lt;br/&gt;coalgebras.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Polytopes are basic mathematical objects that appear in &lt;br/&gt;discrete geometry.  The methods to attack these problems are &lt;br/&gt;unusually interdisciplinary as they involve insights from both &lt;br/&gt;geometry and algebra.  The results of this investigation are &lt;br/&gt;important as they relate both to the pure branches of &lt;br/&gt;mathematics, such as commutative algebra, algebraic geometry &lt;br/&gt;and Hopf algebras, and to the applied sciences, including &lt;br/&gt;optimization and computer science.  Understanding the enumerative &lt;br/&gt;information of polytopes will give a theoretical basis for stress &lt;br/&gt;and rigidity problems in mechanical engineering, for the &lt;br/&gt;reconstruction using sampling problem in computer vision, and for&lt;br/&gt;determining the complexity of geometrically-based problems in&lt;br/&gt;optimization.</AbstractNarration>
