<AbstractNarration>The University of California, Berkeley is developing "Windows on Research," a two-year experimental exhibit project at the Lawrence Hall of Science focused on engaging and informing the public about current scientific research.  The project will develop and evaluate different media to translate the leading edge of nanotechnology research for the science center audience by featuring live demonstrations and presentations, physical- and technology-based exhibits, and Internet-based exhibits.   Formative evaluation of all products, including ongoing public focus groups and surveys, will be used to establish which of the several media, alone or combined, work best to communicate research content.  The project team also is developing new assessment tools to test usability and effectiveness of the artificial intelligence and technology-based components in conveying content.  The results of this prototype effort to present ongoing research in a museum setting will be disseminated to the informal science education field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI, Marco Molinaro, and the team from the Lawrence Hall of Science will work closely with scientists representing research in a number of nanotechnology fields.  These scientists bring expertise in the areas of materials science, chemistry, education, bioengineering, mechanical engineering, molecular and cell biology, geochronology and isotope geochemistry, and psychology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
