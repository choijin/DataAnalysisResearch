<AbstractNarration>The principal investigator plans to work on three &lt;br/&gt;problems. The first is to find relationships&lt;br/&gt;between the topology of a real algebraic variety and&lt;br/&gt;its complex geometry, more precisely its Kodaira dimension.&lt;br/&gt;The ultimate is to prove that a topologicaly complicated&lt;br/&gt;(for intance hyperbolic) threefold can be represented&lt;br/&gt;only by a variety of maximal Kodaira dimension.&lt;br/&gt;The second project is to do a systematic investigation&lt;br/&gt;of the connections between hyperbolic differential equations&lt;br/&gt;and real algebraic geometry. Many instances of this have been&lt;br/&gt;noted in the past, but no systematic theory was ever developed.&lt;br/&gt;The third project is the study of arithmetic properties of&lt;br/&gt;rationally connected varieties, especially the existence of&lt;br/&gt;rational points and curves over fields which are not algebraically&lt;br/&gt;closed. It is quite likely that geometry governs these questions&lt;br/&gt;over local fields, while the problems over global fields are more&lt;br/&gt;arithmetic in nature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hyperbolic differential equations describe processes that&lt;br/&gt;change with time. For instance the heating up of a furnace,&lt;br/&gt;the flow of water through a turbine and the spreading of bacteria&lt;br/&gt;in a medium can all be described, more or less accurately, by&lt;br/&gt;hyperbolic differential equations. These differential equations&lt;br/&gt;and their solutions are rather complicated, both theoretically&lt;br/&gt;and computationally. It has been noticed that many questions about &lt;br/&gt;these differential equations can be approached through simple &lt;br/&gt;algebraic manipulations. It is the principal investigator's plan &lt;br/&gt;to put these diverse observations into a general conceptual &lt;br/&gt;framework. The principal investigator expects that this will &lt;br/&gt;lead to several new applications in the theory of hyperbolic &lt;br/&gt;differential equations. Conversely, relating the abstract &lt;br/&gt;algebraic machinery to physical phenomena in a new way should &lt;br/&gt;also provide insights to the behaviour of algebraic systems.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
