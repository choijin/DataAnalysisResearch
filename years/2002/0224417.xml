<AbstractNarration>EIA-0224417&lt;br/&gt;Aravind K. Joshi&lt;br/&gt;Mark Liberman&lt;br/&gt;University of Pennsylvania&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CISE RR: Discourse Penn Trebank and Multimodal FORM: Development of Two Richly Annotated Corpora&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project, providing critical resources for research discourse modeling and conversational interaction, aims at developing new technologies and systems for information retrieval and human computer interaction.  Centering on the construction of annotated corpora, two large-scale resources, one in the discourse domain and one in the dialog domain will be built:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Discourse Penn Treebank (DPTB) and&lt;br/&gt;2. MultiFORM: Augmenting the FORM corpus with body movements, speech, and intonation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The former project develops a large scale and reliably annotated corpus that will encode coherence relations associated with discourse connectives, including their argument structure and anaphoric links, thus exposing a clearly defined level of discourse structure and supporting the extraction of a range of inferences associated with discourse connectives.  This annotation will be "on top of" the Penn Treebank (PTB) annotations as well as the predicate-argument annotations of PTB (called the Proposition Bank or Prop Bank).  The latter involves a corpus of gesture-annotated videos, FORM that was designed to be extensible in order to eventually represent the entire multimodal experience of conversational interaction.  This multimodal FORM , MultiFORM, will be created by adding body movement, speech and syntactic structure, and intonation.  Large-scale annotated corpora have played a critical role in speech and natural language research by enabling large-scale integration of statistical knowledge (derived from the corpora) with linguistic knowledge (as represented in annotations) leading to scientific and technological advances.  Representative examples constitute robust parsing and automatic extraction of relations and coreferences and their applications to information extraction, question answering, summarization, and machine translation.  PTB, a resource developed a decade ago, represents an example of such a resource that impacts natural language processing worldwide.  PTB deals with corpora at the sentence level warranting a new large scale and reliable discourse and dialog structure annotated corpora.  Although intellectual and practical connections exist between studies of the structures of discourse and dialog, the initial requirements for resources to study these areas diverge while overlapping in conception.  On the discourse side, we need for corpora that deals with the kinds of structures found in composed text such as journalistic articles.  The dialog side needs to focus on interactions among people and on extemporized rather than pre-composed material.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
