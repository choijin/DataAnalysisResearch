<AbstractNarration>Wisconsin Academy Staff Development Initiative -- Teacher Retention and Renewal (WASDI-TRR), a four-year Teacher Enhancement project, is designed to increase teacher retention in K-12 mathematics and science by providing 90 novice teachers with teacher induction experiences, developing 90 subject-specific mentor teachers, building school and district capacity to support teacher induction and mentoring programs, engaging 90 school principals, and creating relationships between teachers, schools, districts and disciplinary faculty at universities.  Preference is given to urban and rural schools with significant staffing needs and underachievement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project participants attend summer academies available throughout the State on mathematics and science content, pedagogy and instructional materials.  On-going and sustained support is provided through school-based mentoring sessions, online learning communities, mentor and novice teacher follow-up sessions, electronic conferencing with mathematicians and scientists, and sessions for school administrators.   Electronic conferencing is prominently featured as a vehicle for professional development to reach teachers and schools in remote communities.  Over the course of the project, novice teachers will receive 268 professional development hours with approximately 50% delivered electronically.  One-hundred forty-five professional development hours are planned for the mentor teachers with approximately 30% representing online delivery.  The school administrators' component includes 30 professional development hours augmented by additional electronic conferences and on-line communication opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project evaluation focuses on teacher retention, teacher content knowledge, change in classroom practice and examination of the project as a model for teacher induction and mentoring.  The project is housed at the Wisconsin Educational Partnership Initiative and works collaboratively with colleges and universities, school districts, state agencies and local businesses.  An advisory committee representative of important stakeholders including representatives from the State Department of Education provides guidance and direction to the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With new State teacher licensing requirements mandating teacher induction and mentoring experiences for novice teachers, project replication is likely.  As a result of the program, mentor teachers will implement teacher induction and mentoring programs in their home districts and schools upon program completion.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
