<AbstractNarration>This individual investigator award will support a project with the objective of using microwave and optical measurements to study the changing character of both static and dynamic aspects of electromagnetic transport in the transition from diffusive propagation to localization. By using a wide variety of samples, measurement techniques, and methodologies, it is expected that a description of wave propagation will be developed that can deal effectively with the complexity of the Anderson localization transition, which is the touchstone of wave transport in disordered systems. A new statistical approach will be pursued, in which the statistics of transport in a single sample, rather than in an ensemble or random samples, will be studied. The statistical approaches that will be developed are expected to further our understanding of a full range of fundamental and applied problems including: electronic mesoscopic physics, lasing in random media, propagation in photonic band gap materials, liquid crystals, and structured thin films, multiantenna cellular communication, medical imaging, atmospheric communication and sensing. The success of this work will strengthen the nascent CUNY Photonic Center, established to strengthen the technological base of the New York City metropolitan area and to serve as a magnet for students and researchers from our immediate area and around the world. The graduate and undergraduate students involved in this research will receive world-class training in skills and ideas that will be of use to their future academic or technological careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This individual investigator award will support a project with the objective of using microwave and optical measurements to chart the changing character of static and dynamic aspects of electromagnetic transport in the transition from diffusive propagation to strong trapping of radiation.  By using a wide variety of samples, measurement techniques, and methodologies, it is expected that a description of wave propagation will be developed that can deal effectively with the complexity of wave transport in random media. The research will further our understanding of such fundamental issues as electronic conduction, lasing in disordered media, and wave propagation in photonic materials, liquid crystals, and fabricated thin films.  In addition, the research will have an impact on applied problems including bandwidth enhancement for cellular communication, medical imaging, and atmospheric communication and sensing.
