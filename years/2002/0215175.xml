    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to develop innovative visible blind UV detectors based on a novel metal-oxide system that is analogous to Gallium Aluminum Nitride (GaN). It is based on a wide band gap oxide system that is realized by alloying two primary oxide compounds, exhibiting a wider and tunable band gap, creating semiconductor materials which have energy gaps from 3.3 eV to 7.9 eV with high radiation hardness. The project investigator has already patented the concept of making and applying tailorable band gap oxide materials. The goal of this proposal is to study the feasibility of growing wide band gap metal-oxides and ultraviolet detectors on low cost substrates such as glass, polyimide, and silicon for commercialization of cost effective products. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This technology can be extended to produce large format detector arrays and which can improve their reliability. Other areas where GaN detectors can be used are in telecommunications, chemical sensing, and homeland security.</AbstractNarration>
