    <AbstractNarration>This U.S.-Czech research project involves two teams led by Carol Auer of the University of Connecticut and her counterparts in Prague, Vaclav Motyka and Radomira Vandova, from the Institute of Experimental Botany, Czech Academy of Sciences. Their collaboration features examination of a group of plant hormones called cytokinins which influence plant growth. Plants regulate the level of active cytokinin molecules within tissues and cells to achieve normal vegetative and reproductive development. In the complex process of cytokinin homeostasis, the regulatory mechanism is the reversible or irreversible conjugation of cytokinins to sugar molecules. This US-Czech effort looks at irreversible conjugation that down-regulates active cytokinin levels in cells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to biochemicaly characterize the enzyme N-glucosyltransferase (N-GT) so that we may understand its function in cytokinin homeostasis and plant development. Radish and Arabidopsis are the primary experimental materials. The Czech partners will define the biochemical properties and enzyme(s) of the regulatory pathway while isolation of mutants and eventually cloning of genes involved in N-GT will be conducted by the U.S. team members. If successful, findings may be applicable in future efforts to manipulate plant growth and develop agricultural crops. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This international project in plant hormone research fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling experts in the Untied States and Central Europe to combine complementary talents and share research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.</AbstractNarration>
