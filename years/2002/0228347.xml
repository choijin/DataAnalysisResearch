<AbstractNarration>In 1998 the President's Partnership for Advanced Technology in Housing, or PATH, program was initiated, with the goal to develop and disseminate new technologies for the housing industry. The specific goals of the PATH program are to reduce the monthly cost of housing by 20%, to improve the durability and reduce maintenance costs of housing, to reduce the environmental impact and energy use of housing, and to reduce the risk of loss of life, injury and property destruction from natural hazards.  Since 2000, more than twenty research projects have been funded by the National Science Foundation in support of the PATH program. The purpose of this project is to supplemental travel support for eleven of the NSF-funded PATH principal investigators to attend the International Conference on Advances in Building Technology, which will be held in December 4-6, 2000 in Hong Kong. The NSF funded investigators will be presenting the results of their investigations in two technical sessions at the conference, devoted specifically to the NSF-funded PATH projects. This will provide a unique opportunity to showcase the NSF-funded work to the international community in a single, coherent, venue. The supplemental support will help offset the high cost of foreign travel.</AbstractNarration>
