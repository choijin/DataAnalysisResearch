<AbstractNarration>DMS-0244401&lt;br/&gt;Hida, Haruzo&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator and his collaborators&lt;br/&gt;will embark on his study of arithmetic geometry of &lt;br/&gt;Shimura varieties of symplectic and unitary type.  &lt;br/&gt;After the development of the p-adic&lt;br/&gt;deformation theory of automorphic forms on reductive groups&lt;br/&gt;admitting Shimura varieties, one should now be able to fathom &lt;br/&gt;its full implication in more arithmetic research in algebraic&lt;br/&gt;number theory.  We pursue the following goals:&lt;br/&gt;1. construction of p-adic automorphic L-functions of general&lt;br/&gt;linear groups;&lt;br/&gt;2. proof of non-vanishing modulo a given prime  p  of such  L-values;&lt;br/&gt;3. determination of divisibility by  p  of the  L-functions;&lt;br/&gt;4. possible proof of the anticyclotomic main conjectures&lt;br/&gt;in an non-abelian setting.&lt;br/&gt;In addition to these main projects, the investigator will study&lt;br/&gt;jointly with his graduate students, the zeta function of Shimura varieties&lt;br/&gt;twisted by non-soluble mod p Galois representations &lt;br/&gt;and Hilbert's twelfth problem over general totally real fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A systematic study of elliptic modular forms whose coefficients&lt;br/&gt;are (p-adic) analytic functions was started&lt;br/&gt;by the principal investigator and has been developed &lt;br/&gt;into a deformation theory of automorphic forms on larger &lt;br/&gt;classical groups. The elliptic theory has found numerous &lt;br/&gt;profound applications. For example, it was used as an &lt;br/&gt;essential ingredient of a proof of Iwasawa's conjecture by Wiles,&lt;br/&gt;of the proof of longstanding Fermat's last theorem and the Shimura-Taniyama&lt;br/&gt;conjecture by Wiles and R. Taylor and of a proof of the&lt;br/&gt;Artin conjecture of many non-soluble two dimensional Artin representations&lt;br/&gt;by R. Taylor and his collaborators.  The principal investigator&lt;br/&gt;will pursue such applications in a more general framework&lt;br/&gt;of automorphic forms on classical groups.  &lt;br/&gt;This would results new cases of non-abelian class number formulas&lt;br/&gt;(that is, a proof of some main conjectures of automorphic Iwasawa theory)&lt;br/&gt;which connect purely arithmetically defined invariants to purely analytically&lt;br/&gt;defined values of zeta functions (thus opening a way of computing&lt;br/&gt;such numbers by analytic means).&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
