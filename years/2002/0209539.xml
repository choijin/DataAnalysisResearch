<AbstractNarration>This project, to be conducted by a doctoral student in anthropology from Rutgers University, investigates how two processes, public health discourse and TV consumer culture, are reshaping  adolescent values surrounding gender relations on Nevis, a small English-speaking island in the Eastern Caribbean. While social and economic life throughout the Caribbean has historically been built upon a complex and dynamic interchange between local and global forces, new forces are rapidly changing Caribbean societies. At the present time, Nevis is experiencing an influx of returning nationals as well as immigrants who arrive to work in the growing tourist industry. In addition to this demographic influence, mass media (cable television) brings more global influence. The growing Caribbean AIDS epidemic, in tandem with the other global forces, is transforming the economic and social milieu in which Nevis adolescents come of age. Relying on surveys, focus groups, in-depth interviews, and participant observation to collect data, this project investigates how adolescent gender role identity is produced within the emerging complex and changing social context of Nevis life. The majority of the research will be conducted in two communities, Charlestown, the capital of Nevis and Gingerland, a small rural agricultural community located inland. The results of this project will contribute to knowledge on gender identity, globalization, and cultural change. In terms of wider impacts, this project will inform policy makers in their effort to work with adolescents so as to limit the spread of HIV</AbstractNarration>
