<AbstractNarration>The goal of this CAREER project is to develop a general methodology for the synthesis of gold nanoparticles with single surface functional groups through a unique solid phase synthesis approach. These gold nanoparticles can be treated as "extended" molecules and traditional synthetic chemistry can be conducted on them to make complex nanoparticle "polymers" and "macromolecules." In contrast to the extensively studied self-assembling techniques, our research will demonstrate an alternate approach of using traditional synthetic chemistry to develop novel nanomaterials and to "synthesize" nanoelectronic devices such as quantum cellular automata. The success of this project will open a completely new direction in the nanoparticle and nanomaterial field. Centered on this research goal, two educational activities will be pursued to bring the following advanced chemistry research and industrial applications to student training: (1) a new graduate course entitled "Topics in Supramolecular Chemistry" will be developed; and (2) a strong link will be established among nanotechnology industries through collaborative research and by inviting renowned industrial scientists to become members of the Industry Advisory Board in our department. The establishment of a research and education link emphasizing nanotechnology and industry will facilitate technology transfer and bring unique opportunities to graduate and undergraduate training.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed CAREER research project will develop a novel methodology to synthesize gold nanoparticles with unique chemical structures. Gold nanoparticles are among one of the most important nanomaterials for nanoelectronic devices and nanocomputer development. The development of this research area is not only important for the advancement of basic science, but also holds enormous potential commercial value. A "bottleneck" in nanoelectronics and nanodevice research is how to manipulate and assemble nanoparticles into extremely complicated integrated circuits (IC). Our research provides an innovative approach to "synthesize" complex nanodevices and nanoelectronics though traditional chemical reactions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
