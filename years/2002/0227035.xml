    <AbstractNarration>This targeted Math and Science Partnership includes the Duke University Pratt School of Engineering, four school districts (Alamance/Burlington Schools, Orange County Schools, Iredell/Statesville Schools, Harnett County Schools), the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction, and the North Carolina Science, Mathematics, and Technology Education Center. Focusing on K-8 science education, Teachers and Scientists Collaborating (TASC) is providing curriculum units selected from an array of inquiry-based curricula, inservice professional development, and support from Duke University scientists. Objectives include establishing a cadre of scientists who provide ongoing teacher assistance in science content that is aligned with state/national standards, instituting a professional development system to prepare teachers to use inquiry-based instructional modules and to benefit from scientist resources, creating a fee-based lending library of inquiry-based modules available to teachers, and institutionalizing science education support. TASC seeks to narrow achievement gaps, improve end-of grade science and mathematics scores, and to improve the quality of science teaching in participating school systems by increasing content knowledge, the use of inquiry-based teaching techniques, and the engagement of scientists in assisting teachers in implementing science standards. The project is expected to serve 7,560 teachers and 352,800 students.</AbstractNarration>
