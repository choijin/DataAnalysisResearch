<AbstractNarration>The explosive demand for communication services, fueled by the&lt;br/&gt;rapid growth in the areas of mobile communications and the&lt;br/&gt;Internet, has generated and will continue to generate immense&lt;br/&gt;research efforts in the area of wideband wired/wireless&lt;br/&gt;communications. To accommodate the demanding future applications,&lt;br/&gt;systems must be designed to perform joint equalization, detection,&lt;br/&gt;decoding and estimation of the unknown and possibly time varying&lt;br/&gt;channel parameters, while maintaining reasonable complexity (and&lt;br/&gt;low cost). Motivated by these requirements, and using an OFDM&lt;br/&gt;indoor wireless system as a design example, two main directions&lt;br/&gt;are investigated in this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the first direction, receiver algorithms are designed for&lt;br/&gt;iterative, joint equalization, detection and decoding, that&lt;br/&gt;address the critical issues mentioned above. The investigation&lt;br/&gt;starts by identifying a powerful model that encompasses all the&lt;br/&gt;salient features of the OFDM transmission system. Data detection&lt;br/&gt;in OFDM is then stated as a problem of two-dimensional (2D) data&lt;br/&gt;detection in the presence of localized, 2D intersymbol&lt;br/&gt;interference, non-linear distortion, and unknown and time varying&lt;br/&gt;parameters. We then identify fast, joint data detection and&lt;br/&gt;channel estimation schemes which are utilized as building blocks&lt;br/&gt;for powerful adaptive iterative detection receivers. Unlike the&lt;br/&gt;entire iterative receiver, these sub-blocks are optimal in a&lt;br/&gt;precisely defined sense, and can be implemented with&lt;br/&gt;less-than-exponential complexity with respect to the data sequence&lt;br/&gt;length.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second direction is the development of a unified framework for&lt;br/&gt;the analysis of the transient and steady-state behavior of&lt;br/&gt;adaptive iterative algorithms. In the proposed study, the receiver&lt;br/&gt;is assumed to have no explicit knowledge about the channel&lt;br/&gt;parameters, other than their statistical description. The minimum&lt;br/&gt;signal-to-noise ratio required for convergence to error-free&lt;br/&gt;transmission, and the optimal allocation of power in pilot and&lt;br/&gt;coded symbols, are some of the issues that are investigated for a&lt;br/&gt;wide variety of adaptive iterative receiver architectures.&lt;br/&gt;Regarding propagation modeling for the indoor environment, the&lt;br/&gt;approach followed herein is a direct divergence from the classical&lt;br/&gt;approaches that include either measurements, or the&lt;br/&gt;well-established ray-tracing techniques. In particular, ultra-fast&lt;br/&gt;algorithms for the numerical solution of the electromagnetic&lt;br/&gt;problem are developed. These algorithms result in almost exact&lt;br/&gt;solutions that can be evaluated with complexity comparable to the&lt;br/&gt;less accurate ray-tracing techniques.</AbstractNarration>
