<AbstractNarration>0241505 McCartney&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Guiana Abyssal Gyre Experiment (GAGE) placed  a moored array of current  meters  across  the  Guiana  Basin,  to  measure  the  deep  boundary  current  and  to  attempt  to  detect  and quantify the hypothesized northward flow to its east.  As implemented the array was placed at 16 N for 27  months,  and  GAGE  was  enhanced  through  collaboration  with  a  German  .Meridional  Overturning Variability  Experiment.  (MOVE,  based  at  U.  Kiel).    Together  the  GAGE/MOVE  program  fielded  10 moorings  with  72  current  meters  (measuring  temperatures  and  currents)  and  48  moored temperature/salinity instruments (CTDs).  Considerable shipboard CTD measurements were made in the Guiana Basin  in  concert  with  mooring deployments  and recoveries.  GAGE completed  its  fieldwork  in May 2002, with the exception of one GAGE mooring that failed to release and will be recovered in March of 2003.    A  first  look  at  the  results  from  the  moored  instruments, confirms the Gambia Abyssal Gyre hypothesis.  The deep western boundary current at 16 N is strong, estimated as 38 Sverdrups.  It has an unexpected  two-regime  structure  in  hydrography  and  in  measured  currents:    an  onshore  regime  with strong  southward  flow  near  1600  m,  declining  with  depth  to  weak  flow  near  4000 m,  and  an  offshore regime  with  strong  flow  near  3600-4600  m,  declining  in  strength  upwards  and  reversing  to  northward flow  at  1600  m.    The  hypothesized  northward  recirculation  is  found  in  three  regimes.    Immediately offshore and adjacent to the deep western boundary current the entire water column between 1600 m and 5400 m flows northward.  On the opposite side of the Guiana Basin adjacent to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge northward flow extends from the seafloor at 5400 m to 3600 m.  All array instruments across the Basin at or  below  3600  m,  except  one  in  the  deep  boundary  current,  exhibit  northward  flow.    This  yields  a surprisingly strong flow of what is called Antarctic Bottom Water, the coldest abyssal water.  Together these northward flow elements are preliminarily estimated as 19-23 Sverdrups, yielding a net transport of 15-19 Sverdrups, the expected amplitude for the cold limb of the overturning circulation.   The large GAGE/MOVE datasets will be worked up in collaboration with the MOVE scientists.  The measured currents and the measured hydrography will be combined to produce a complete quantitative characterization of deep flow at 16 N, including its variabilities in amplitude and structure.  With that as a powerful constraint, the full hydrographic dataset within the Guiana Basin will be reexamined to fully characterize the Guiana Abyssal Gyre and establish its role in the cold limb of the meridional overturning circulation.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
