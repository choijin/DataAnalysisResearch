    <AbstractNarration>With this renewal proposal the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports the on- going work of Professor Stephen Nelsen in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Wisconsin- Madison. This work by Professor Nelsen outlines several mechanistic studies of electron transfer in various bridged donor-acceptor compounds, primarily bis-hydrazines. Professor Nelsen seeks to continue his work on the mechanistic and energetic aspects of intramolecular electronic transfer using a synthetic, measurement, and modeling approach to focus on six well-defined questions. In this proposal he has identified the most important technical and conceptual problems in the electron transfer field, and success with this proposal will go a long way toward solving these problems. Investigation of chemical reactivity in physical organic chemistry has long been the realm of electron pair transfer reactions. However, single electron transfer has attracted increasing attention where the interest has been concerned with outer- sphere reactions and with more complex processes where electron transfer is coupled with bond breaking or bond formation. There is much to be discovered in this field in terms of mechanisms and reactivity and Professor Nelson's work will go a long way toward making these discoveries. Electron transfer reactions are very important in both chemistry and biology, and are found, for example, in photosynthesis and respiration, two very important life processes. In general, science as a whole and society will naturally benefit from the training that Professor Nelsen will provide younger scientists in this important area of chemical research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this Award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program of the Division of Chemistry supports the research activities of Professor Stephen Nelsen in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Wisconsin- Madison. Professor Nelsen continues to be a world leader in understanding electron transfer reactions. In addition to answering some fundamental questions in physical organic chemistry, post-doctoral and graduate students will receive unique training in synthesis, measurement, and modeling of important chemical reactions.</AbstractNarration>
