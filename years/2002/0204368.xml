    <AbstractNarration>DMS-0204368&lt;br/&gt;Margaret F. Symington&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Principal Investigator proposes to use singular Lagrangian fibrations to &lt;br/&gt;gain insight into the topology of symplectic manifolds. The ultimate goal is &lt;br/&gt;to develop an effective language for constructing and analyzing symplectic &lt;br/&gt;four-manifolds, analogous to Kirby calculus for smooth four-manifolds.&lt;br/&gt;This work lies at the intersection of toric geometry, integrable systems&lt;br/&gt;and smooth four-manifold topology. Progress on this project will allow the &lt;br/&gt;presentation of symplectic four-manifolds as generalized sums of well-understood &lt;br/&gt;manifolds. For instance, this approach has allowed the Principal Investigator &lt;br/&gt;to specialize a smooth surgery to the symplectic category and thereby determine &lt;br/&gt;the existence of symplectic structures on an infinite family of four-manifolds &lt;br/&gt;with exotic smooth structures. Further work will include extensions to &lt;br/&gt;dimension six where such fibrations arise in the ground-breaking theory of &lt;br/&gt;mirror symmetry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A manifold is the generalization of a surface to other dimensions. For a &lt;br/&gt;manifold to be symplectic it must have an internal structure akin to the space &lt;br/&gt;of positions and velocities of a mechanical system such as a pendulum. &lt;br/&gt;Symplectic manifolds are ubiquitous in topology, geometry and physics.&lt;br/&gt;Recently great progress has been made in understanding symplectic manifolds,&lt;br/&gt;especially of dimension four, but many basic questions remain unanswered.&lt;br/&gt;For instance, given a manifold there is no general way to determine if it &lt;br/&gt;permits the internal structure required for it to be symplectic. One way to &lt;br/&gt;attack such a question is to require some additional structure on the manifold.&lt;br/&gt;The Principal Investigator proposes to deepen our understanding of these &lt;br/&gt;manifolds by appealing to a higher-dimensional analog of topographic maps for &lt;br/&gt;measuring elevation. The additional structure could be thought of as the analog &lt;br/&gt;of lines of constant elevation. In essence, the Principal Investigator plans to &lt;br/&gt;develop two-dimensional maps that yield enough information to completely &lt;br/&gt;determine the terrain (the four-dimensional manifold) and a legend that make &lt;br/&gt;these maps interpretable.</AbstractNarration>
