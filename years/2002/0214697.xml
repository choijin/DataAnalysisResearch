    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop an efficient and reliable enhanced Raman spectroscopy probe by integrating a microspherical resonator with nanoparticles providing Surface Enhanced Raman scattering. This spectral information provides a chemical "fingerprint" and analyte identification. However, broader application of this technology is hindered by the powerful laser sources and sensitive optical detection equipment that the inherently weak Raman scattering requires. The proposed probe addresses these limitations by (1) locally increasing the light intensity at the probe head with an optical resonator to permit the use of lower power sources and (2) improving the Raman scattering efficiency with metallic nanoparticles to permit the use of less sensitive detection equipment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Raman spectroscopy has wide commercial application in chemical process monitoring, pharmaceutical analysis, and environmental site monitoring because it provides rich spectra arising from the chemical structure of the analyte. In addition to expanded use in the above-mentioned industries, reducing the cost and size of Raman spectroscopy equipment will enable point-of-care systems for medical diagnostics and field portable systems for rapid identification of chemical unknowns from accidental or intentional releases.</AbstractNarration>
