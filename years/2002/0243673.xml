    <AbstractNarration>This 10-week summer research program is aimed at involving 8 undergraduate students in active research &lt;br/&gt;under the supervision of applied mathematicians who are dedicated researchers and mentors. The major area &lt;br/&gt;of concentration will be applied mathematics emphasizing population dynamics and wave propagation in nonhomogeneous media. At the end of the summer program the students will have developed a good understanding of mathematical modeling, interpretation of solutions to explain the underlying physical problems, dependence of solutions on the parameters used in the models, inverse problems and their importance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary focus of the REU site project is mathematical training, active participation in research, and mentoring. The objectives are to provide the undergraduate students with meaningful research experience in applied mathematics, to show them the enjoyment of doing research, to encourage them to pursue advanced degrees in mathematics, science, and engineering, and to increase participation by women and other &lt;br/&gt;underrepresented groups. There will be various scientific, cultural, and social activities enhancing the program and helping to improve the students' computational and communication skills.</AbstractNarration>
