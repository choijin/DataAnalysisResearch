    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Futuyma 0206448&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers will test the mechanisms by which herbivorous insects affect the cost of resistance to the herbicide triazine in pigweed Amaranthus hybridus (Amaranthaceae). The triazine-resistance mutation imposes a cost by slowing photosynthesis. Mutant plants are preferentially eaten by herbivores, are less tolerant of feeding damage, and suffer an increased fitness cost when exposed to herbivores. &lt;br/&gt;This work will address how the availability of light and nutrients affects a mutant plant's allocation to carbon-based defenses and its susceptibility to herbivores. The potential for herbivores to impose frequency-dependent selection will be tested. Additionally, the researchers will test if a mutant plant's increased allocation to carbon acquisition (i.e. leaves) at the expense of nutrient and water acquisition (i.e. roots) causes its reduced tolerance. &lt;br/&gt;This research will provide an independent test of how photosynthetic rate shapes patterns of defense and tolerance, and it will contribute to future strategies for managing resistance to herbicide.&lt;br/&gt;The researchers will test the mechanisms by which herbivorous insects affect the cost of resistance to the herbicide triazine in pigweed Amaranthus hybridus (Amaranthaceae).
