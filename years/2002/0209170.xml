<AbstractNarration>This research investigates a new architecture designed to provide&lt;br/&gt;data to wireless users using a broadcast technique. The objective of this research is to develop schemes for implementing the concept ``DAta in your space (DAYS)" which combines broadcasting (push) and traditional querying (pull) techniques into one global wireless approach. In this scheme the data broadcasters (special servers) will continuously&lt;br/&gt;broadcast (push) requested data to a set of ``dedicated" wireless&lt;br/&gt;channels, which will be captured by clients (users of the data) at&lt;br/&gt;any time and at any place.  The space will thus be used as&lt;br/&gt;persistent storage for all mobile as well as static devices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A universal wireless broadcast approach requires that mobile users be able to find and use the right broadcast information.   Some of the questions to mbe addressed include:&lt;br/&gt;1.  How can the mobile user know which channel has the correct data?&lt;br/&gt;2.  How is data to be assigned to channels?&lt;br/&gt;3.  What techniques can be used to effectively determine the best contents of each channel given many mobile users?&lt;br/&gt;4.  Without explicit user queries, how can the mobile user be assured that the needed data is being broadcast?&lt;br/&gt;5. How can the mobile user be assured that the needed data moves with&lt;br/&gt;  him?&lt;br/&gt;These issues have to be examined on a global scale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
