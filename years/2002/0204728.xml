<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0204728&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Martin Zeman&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research focuses on various aspects of the inner&lt;br/&gt;model theory and can be divided into two areas. The first area&lt;br/&gt;puts emphasis on the determining the internal structure of&lt;br/&gt;extender models, fine structure theory and infinitary&lt;br/&gt;combinatorics. The PI has done extensive research here, making&lt;br/&gt;substantial contributions to the existing results. Extender&lt;br/&gt;models are generalizations of Goedel's constructible universe&lt;br/&gt;which admit a very complex structure of large cardinal&lt;br/&gt;axioms. The key element behind the inner model theory is&lt;br/&gt;iterability -- a method which enables us to iterate countable&lt;br/&gt;structures that are elementarily embeddable into initial segments&lt;br/&gt;of these models. Granting iterability, the author and his&lt;br/&gt;collaborators were able to develop a fine structure theory of&lt;br/&gt;these models, which is a means enabling to investigate the&lt;br/&gt;internal structure and combinatorics (Jensen's principles) of&lt;br/&gt;these models abstractly, without any direct reference to&lt;br/&gt;iterability. The aim of this project is to extend the existing&lt;br/&gt;methods in a manner that would yield the complete description of&lt;br/&gt;combinatorial properties of extender models. The open problems&lt;br/&gt;are related mainly to cardinal transfer theorems and stationary&lt;br/&gt;reflection. This part of the project includes also direct&lt;br/&gt;applications of the inner model theory in determining the&lt;br/&gt;consistency strength of various principles from infinitary&lt;br/&gt;combinatorics. The focus here is on improving the PI's results on&lt;br/&gt;Jensen's guessing principle. The second part of the project&lt;br/&gt;consists of two areas that are less tightly related to the PI's&lt;br/&gt;past research, namely the construction of inner models,&lt;br/&gt;iterability and applications in the descriptive set theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The subject of set theory is the analysis of methods which arise&lt;br/&gt;in mathematics. The methods that are widely accepted by the&lt;br/&gt;mathematical world have been formalized into so-called&lt;br/&gt;Zermelo-Fraenkel system of axioms (briefly ZFC). However, it&lt;br/&gt;turns out that we more and more often encouter questions whose&lt;br/&gt;solutions require more than mere ZFC. Set theory provides us with&lt;br/&gt;tools for recognizing such problems and approaches which enable&lt;br/&gt;us to determine which methods to use. More precisely, set theory&lt;br/&gt;provides us with a general method for determining the complexity&lt;br/&gt;of various problems quantitatively. The scale used here is the&lt;br/&gt;hierarchy of the large cardinal axioms. Extender models play a&lt;br/&gt;crucial role here -- there are the actual technical means which&lt;br/&gt;enables us to establish the connection between various concrete&lt;br/&gt;problems from mathematics and large cardinal axioms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research focuses on various aspects of the inner&lt;br/&gt;model theory and can be divided into two areas.
