<AbstractNarration>Abstract for "Contact geometry, complex analysis and imaging"&lt;br/&gt;DMS- 0203705&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Epstein's research proposal contains projects in four distinct areas: (1)&lt;br/&gt;Invariants of contact structures, (2) Problems in CR-geometry, (3)&lt;br/&gt;Multi-parameter perturbation theory, (4) Magnetic resonance imaging. The&lt;br/&gt;proposed work in (1) will likely be done in collaboration with Richard Melrose.&lt;br/&gt;They intend to use their prior work on the Heisenberg calculus to find&lt;br/&gt;invariants of contact manifolds. A problem of particular interest is to use&lt;br/&gt;spectral flow invariants of Toeplitz operators to distinguish contact&lt;br/&gt;structures with homotopic hyperplane fields. The work in (2) is part of&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Epstein's ongoing project on embeddability of CR-manifolds, he proposes to&lt;br/&gt;consider CR-structures in dimensions greater than 3 to understand why some&lt;br/&gt;CR-functions are unstable and why some are stable under deformation of the&lt;br/&gt;underlying CR-structure.  The project described in (3) concerns the problem of&lt;br/&gt;analytically parameterizing the eigenvalues and eigenspaces of a "self adjoint"&lt;br/&gt;analytic family of matrices.  In broad terms Dr. Epstein would like to see what&lt;br/&gt;the modern theory of functions of several complex variables has to say about&lt;br/&gt;multi-parameter perturbation problems. Preliminary investigations show that&lt;br/&gt;real progress is now possible in this field. His main goal is to find&lt;br/&gt;reasonably simple and explicit analytic spaces on which the eigenvalues and&lt;br/&gt;eigenspaces of a self adjoint family are analytically parametrized.  Finally&lt;br/&gt;(4) is an entirely new direction for Dr. Epstein's research.  He plans to study&lt;br/&gt;the feasibility of magnetic resonance imaging using inhomogeneous background&lt;br/&gt;fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Epstein's work is in the application of analysis and algebra to problems in&lt;br/&gt;geometry. A principal focus of his research is the geometry and analysis of&lt;br/&gt;contact manifolds. These arise is many contexts from several complex variables&lt;br/&gt;to differential geometry to topology to partial differential equations. Using&lt;br/&gt;the tools developed in collaboration with Richard Melrose, Dr. Epstein hopes to&lt;br/&gt;elucidate the analysis and geometry of these ubiquitous spaces. Dr. Epstein&lt;br/&gt;also plans to investigate the feasibility of magnetic resonance imaging using&lt;br/&gt;inhomogeneous background fields. This is largely beyond the capabilities of&lt;br/&gt;present day technology. If it proves feasible it would allow many new&lt;br/&gt;applications of MR imaging and should also lead to less expensive equipment.&lt;br/&gt;This is a multifaceted problem with significant mathematical and&lt;br/&gt;engineering aspects.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
