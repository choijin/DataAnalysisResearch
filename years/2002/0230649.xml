<AbstractNarration>PROPOSAL NO.: 0230649&lt;br/&gt;PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Cheung, Harry&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION NAME: University of Akron&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: Use of a Vertically Integrated Team Design Project as an Adjunct to and Change Instrument for the Chemical Engineering Curriculum at The University of Akron&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will explore the use of the Vertically Integrated Team Design Project in an expanded role as a component of the chemical engineering curriculum and as a change instrument for the chemical engineering curriculum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enhancing the Vertically Integrated Team Design Project as a component of the ChE curriculum by:&lt;br/&gt;o Increasing and improving the use of outside, industrial mentors&lt;br/&gt;o Establishing the Vertically Integrated Team Design Project as an integral part of the core curriculum&lt;br/&gt;o Increasing the assessment component of both the students participating in the&lt;br/&gt;project and the project itself&lt;br/&gt;o Developing additional project modules to incorporate emerging technologies as&lt;br/&gt;the project themes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Planning for the use of the Vertically Integrated Team Design Project as a change instrument for the ChE curriculum by using it as:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;o an assessment tool for specific affective and technical skills in our students&lt;br/&gt;o a collaborative vehicle for involvement of industrial colleagues in shaping the&lt;br/&gt;ChE curriculum&lt;br/&gt;o a test bed for incorporating professional level computational tools into the core&lt;br/&gt;ChE curriculum&lt;br/&gt;o a test bed for material and methods intended to displace rote solution legacy&lt;br/&gt;materials and methods in the core ChE curriculum&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We believe that this use of a Vertically Integrated Team Design Project  will provide a tool for continuous improvement of our department's chemical engineering curriculum, the model should be very easily extensible to other chemical engineering departments and easily extensible to other engineering disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
