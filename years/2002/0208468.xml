<AbstractNarration>Integrating humans with their naturally developed control algorithm and robots with their extended capability of applying forces and torques into one system offers multiple opportunities for creating a new generation of assistance technology for both healthy and disabled people suffering from neuromuscular diseases and neuro-degenerative disorders. The exoskeleton is a wearable robotic arm. It is worn by the human as an orthotic device and acts as a human-amplifier allowing the operator natural control of the device as an extension of his/her body while sharing an external load. One of the primary innovative ideas of this research is to set the human machine interface at the muscular level of the human physiological hierarchy using an expression of body's own control command (surface electromyography - sEMG) signals as one of the primary command signals of the exoskeleton for improving the synergy between the operator and the exoskeleton. The goals of this research are to design, build, and experimentally study the integration of a powered exoskeleton controlled by myosignals (sEMG) for the human arm with healthy people. It is anticipated that the scientific activity involved in this research will integrate and fuse multidisciplinary knowledge by promoting dialogues and collaborative work between students and faculty members from different disciplines with a long-term goal of improving the quality of life of the physically disabled community.</AbstractNarration>
