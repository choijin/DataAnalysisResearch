<AbstractNarration>This research addresses the creation of efficient algorithms for incrementally re-placing and re-routing small portions of a VLSI circuit to correct problems such as signal integrity, speed and high heat density that have been discovered therein via simulation.  The challenge is to quickly re-layout only the affected portion of the circuit, while minimizing any layout changes of the much larger unaffected part of the circuit in order to capitalize on the enormous resources and time already spent on the physical design of the chip, to retain the already optimized features of the design, and to meet time-to-market requirements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Algorithms for both regular VLSI chips and field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are being addressed in this project.  For the incremental placement problem, a min-cost network-flow based algorithm is being investigated using both deterministic and probabilistic edge costs.  In the incremental routing realm, the following areas are being researched:   (a) Algorithms for constraint-driven "bump-and-refit" (this allows exploration of solution spaces with different sets of constraints like upper bounds on the increase in net lengths and/or delays, on the number of vias, and on crosstalk coupling). (2) Performing incremental global and detailed routing in one consolidated framework in order to obtain better optimized routings.  (3) Incremental Satisfiability (SAT) methods and their application to incremental routing.  (4) Various additional issues and solution techniques needed for incremental routing of VLSI circuits.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
