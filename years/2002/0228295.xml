<AbstractNarration>Arguably the largest scale-up of an educational program occurring in the United States at the &lt;br/&gt;present time is the implementation of standards-based accountability (SBA) in all 50 states as a &lt;br/&gt;result of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB). SBA involves several elements &lt;br/&gt;including content and performance standards, aligned assessments, and a set of consequences &lt;br/&gt;tied to assessment results. The utility of standards-based accountability was demonstrated in a &lt;br/&gt;few pioneering states in the 1990s, and a number of studies suggest that SBA systems may &lt;br/&gt;influence both student learning and instructional practices. The government cited the success of &lt;br/&gt;these accountability systems as justification for requiring SBA in all states. This investigation is &lt;br/&gt;designed to identify factors that enhance the implementation of SBA systems, foster changes in &lt;br/&gt;school and classroom practice, and promote improved student achievement.  It addresses four &lt;br/&gt;broad questions: &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; What strategies are used in implementing SBA at the state, district, and school levels?  &lt;br/&gt;Which state, district, and school implementation strategies are associated with &lt;br/&gt;changes in classroom practice?  &lt;br/&gt; How valid are the standards-based test scores as indicators of changes in student &lt;br/&gt;achievement? &lt;br/&gt; Which features of SBA implementation are associated with student attainment of &lt;br/&gt;academic standards?   &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The study involves three states that vary in their approaches to SBA.  Data will be collected from &lt;br/&gt;state and district officials, principals, and teachers using a combination of questionnaires, &lt;br/&gt;interviews, and artifact examination. The data collection approach is longitudinal, and is &lt;br/&gt;designed to provide information on SBA implementation at all levels, as well as on factors that &lt;br/&gt;influence implementation, such as the clarity of the standards and the methods for promulgating &lt;br/&gt;them, teachers. and principals. understanding of the SBA policies, and the professional climate &lt;br/&gt;of the school.  Student achievement data will also be collected to address the third and fourth &lt;br/&gt;research questions.  The evaluation of the validity of standards-based test scores involves &lt;br/&gt;examination of the content and format of test items as well as a comparison of score trends on &lt;br/&gt;the standards-based test and on other tests such as the National Assessment of Educational &lt;br/&gt;Progress (NAEP).  Relationships among implementation, practices, and student achievement will &lt;br/&gt;be explored using longitudinal multilevel modeling techniques.   &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Answers to the four research questions will help policymakers, educators, and researchers &lt;br/&gt;understand the ways SBA policies are implemented at all levels of the system; explain &lt;br/&gt;relationships among implementation, instructional practices and student achievement; and &lt;br/&gt;identify successful practices that can be promulgated to make SBA function more effectively. &lt;br/&gt;Over the next three to five years, SBA will affect every public school student in the country, so &lt;br/&gt;insights gained from this research will have wide applicability.</AbstractNarration>
