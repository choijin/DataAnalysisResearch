<AbstractNarration>The Morehouse School of Medicine proposes to develop a unique framework for stimulating and increasing interest in science, mathematics, engineering and technology within the predominantly minority K-12 student population of Atlanta.  The program provides a formal structure for coordinated science enrichment activities concentrated in the summer, and for year-round science outreach and partnership programs with schools in the Atlanta, Fulton and Dekalb school districts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project builds on several well established programs at the medical school such as Elementary&lt;br/&gt;Science Education Partners (ESEP).  Ten Saturday Academy sessions per year providing 22.5 "contact hours" per student combine with a four-week Summer Science Camp of six hours per day, five days per week providing an additional130 "contact hours" per student for 25 elementary and middle school students in grades 6-8.  The program expands to include the high school student population by providing experiences in the laboratory with medical school faculty and research scientists.  The Science Education Resource Center (SERC) will serve as a conduit for the delivery of inquiry-based educational experiences and hands-on science materials.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A parental support group is involved via the Ben Carson Science Academy Parent Association.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
