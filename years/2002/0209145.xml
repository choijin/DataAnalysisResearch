<AbstractNarration>Finding sequences similar to a given query sequence in a large data set&lt;br/&gt;is a fundamental problem in many database applications including&lt;br/&gt;computational genomics and proteomics, computational finance, audio, text&lt;br/&gt;and multimedia image processing.  This proposal considers proximity search&lt;br/&gt;problems for strings and sequences in such applications where existing&lt;br/&gt;methods typically employ distance functions based on character edits only&lt;br/&gt;(commonly unweighted edit distance) and modify off-the shelf index&lt;br/&gt;structures to improve search efficiency.  However, in many applications&lt;br/&gt;block edit operations such as translocations, deletions and copies, as well&lt;br/&gt;as linear transformations on strings are as common and important&lt;br/&gt;as character edits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately, computation of distance measures that allow block edits&lt;br/&gt;are generally known to be NP-hard.  Thus the investigators propose to work&lt;br/&gt;on practical methods for approximating the block edit distances and performing&lt;br/&gt;approximate searches under such measures.  These measures are many times&lt;br/&gt;not symmetric (transforming a long sequence to a short one may be&lt;br/&gt;performed through a single deletion whereas transforming the short&lt;br/&gt;sequence to the long one may require many copy operations) or do not&lt;br/&gt;satisfy the triangular inequality (string space under edit operations is&lt;br/&gt;fundamentally different from Euclidean space) and thus do not provide a metric.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However many of them can be proven to be almost-metrics, i.e.,&lt;br/&gt;the symmetry and/or the triangular inequalities may be satisfied within&lt;br/&gt;multiplicative constants. This property can be fundamental in sequence&lt;br/&gt;proximity search as it seems possible that known distance based indexing&lt;br/&gt;methods for metric spaces could be extended for use in almost-metric&lt;br/&gt;spaces.  Thus a main component of the proposal is the investigation of&lt;br/&gt;the limitations and extendibility of distance based indexes for&lt;br/&gt;almost-metrics and other string/sequence measures which may be&lt;br/&gt;non-symmetric or fail to satisfy the triangular inequality because they&lt;br/&gt;allow block edits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An alternative/complementary approach to distance based indexing is based&lt;br/&gt;on approximate random mappings of the space of items to be searched to&lt;br/&gt;Euclidean spaces. This general strategy has received considerable&lt;br/&gt;attention in the context of vector spaces. The mappings used guarantee&lt;br/&gt;(with high probability) to reduce the number of comparisons during search&lt;br/&gt;from linear to poly-logarithmic, provided some error of approximation can&lt;br/&gt;be tolerated in the answers obtained. This approach was later generalized&lt;br/&gt;to sequence spaces through a mapping of sequences under block edit distance&lt;br/&gt;to binary strings under Hamming distance. The error tolerance is not&lt;br/&gt;very practical. Thus a second component of this proposal is to obtain&lt;br/&gt;novel mappings of sequence spaces to Euclidean spaces within smaller&lt;br/&gt;approximation errors. The goal is to generalize such mappings to both&lt;br/&gt;character and block based edit distances, especially those which assign&lt;br/&gt;weights to edit operations (that reflect the likeliness of that&lt;br/&gt;particular edit).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
