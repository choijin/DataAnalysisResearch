<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0102316&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Tao Li&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Essential laminations and immersed essential surfaces are two&lt;br/&gt;important objects in 3-manifolds.  They generalize embedded&lt;br/&gt;incompressible surfaces, and are remarkably useful in obtaining&lt;br/&gt;topological and geometric information of 3-manifolds.  The main&lt;br/&gt;goal of this project is to explore the relationships between the&lt;br/&gt;topology of 3-manifolds and these two objects.  The tools that&lt;br/&gt;the investigator will use include branched surfaces and immersed&lt;br/&gt;branched surfaces that have been proved to be extremely useful in&lt;br/&gt;the investigator's previous work.  The investigator intends to&lt;br/&gt;continue his research on essential laminations and immersed&lt;br/&gt;surfaces with the following goals.  (1) To construct essential&lt;br/&gt;laminations in 3-manifolds obtained from Dehn surgery on&lt;br/&gt;hyperbolic knots.  The techniques to be developed in this&lt;br/&gt;research could potentially have great impact on some famous&lt;br/&gt;conjectures in knot theory, e.g., Property P for knots and the&lt;br/&gt;cabling conjecture.  (2) To find an algorithm to decide whether a&lt;br/&gt;3-manifold is a Seifert fiber space.  The investigator intends to&lt;br/&gt;use immersed branched surfaces and normal surface theory to find&lt;br/&gt;a practical algorithm.  (3) To show that two homotopy equivalent&lt;br/&gt;3-manifolds, which contain essential laminations, are&lt;br/&gt;homeomorphic.  (4) To find an algorithm to decide whether a&lt;br/&gt;3-manifold contains an essential lamination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three-manifolds are objects modeled on the 3-dimensional space&lt;br/&gt;that we are living in.  These objects can be found in many other&lt;br/&gt;sciences, such as physics, biology, and chemistry.  A geometric&lt;br/&gt;way of studying 3-manifolds, which is extremely fruitful, is to&lt;br/&gt;view a 3-manifold as a collection of 3-dimensional pieces glued&lt;br/&gt;together along 2-dimensional surfaces.  The investigator plans to&lt;br/&gt;study the structure of 3-manifolds using such 2-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;surfaces, which are called essential laminations and immersed&lt;br/&gt;essential surfaces.  The research in this project is related to&lt;br/&gt;knot theory, which has helped to understand the structure of DNA;&lt;br/&gt;it is also related to hyperbolic geometry, which has been used by&lt;br/&gt;physicists to understand the universe.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
