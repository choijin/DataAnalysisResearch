<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this grant is to develop a new class of high damping structures having a shape memory metal alloy composite casing over a carbon fiber reinforced polymeric (FRP) composite tube. It is expected that the traditional FRP core will provide the high stiffness while the damping capacity accomplished by the shape memory alloy casing. The research will be conducted in three key segments: (1) developing the fabrication technology (spray forming) for building shape memory alloy casings on the FRP cores, (2) characterizing the stiffness, strength and damping capabilities of the new structures, and (3) integrating the design, manufacture, and field testing of prototype automotive half -shafts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fabrication technology to be developed as part of this project will introduce a new way of making multi-material, multi-functional structures that cannot be conveniently fabricated by other manufacturing methods.  These novel high damping structures would find use in challenging, vibration prone applications in the automotive, aerospace, and cutting tool industries.   The project includes collaboration among university researchers, REU students, and industrial engineers. The automotive and composite manufacturing industries have pledged support for the project and will be collaborative partners providing composite manufacturing and prototype field-testing. Learning modules will be developed from the research and included in the undergraduate and graduate curriculums. A goal is to stimulate undergraduate and graduate students to pursue advanced educational degrees. The integrated research and educational objectives will benefit the participating industries and will provide their engineers with unique training for further advancing the state-of-art.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
