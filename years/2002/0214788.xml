    <AbstractNarration>International Conference on Representations of Algebras and Related&lt;br/&gt;Topics, July 15 -- August 10, 2002, Toronto, Canada&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI and the organizing committee plan to provide support for the&lt;br/&gt;participation of as many junior US mathematicians as possible in the&lt;br/&gt;biennial international meeting in Toronto this summer. Next to the&lt;br/&gt;presentation of cutting-edge research, several series of overview&lt;br/&gt;lectures by leading experts and an extensive workshop program aim&lt;br/&gt;at introducing start-up researchers to the field. Central subjects&lt;br/&gt;are the geometry of module varieties, invariants and deformations,&lt;br/&gt;homological developments -- specifically, derived categories,&lt;br/&gt;representation type, including the in-depth exploration of pivotal&lt;br/&gt;classes of tame or wild algebras. Among the applications -- their&lt;br/&gt;thorough documentation is one of the highest priorities -- are the&lt;br/&gt;theories of complex semisimple Lie algebras and algebraic groups,&lt;br/&gt;singularities and categories of perverse sheaves, new insights into&lt;br/&gt;the structure of the Bernstein-Gelfand-Gelfand category, as well&lt;br/&gt;as the homological treatment of finite group schemes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The representation theory of algebras has its origin in the study&lt;br/&gt;of 'groups', originally certain collections of motions of space&lt;br/&gt;which allow for concatenation and inversion. The next idea was to&lt;br/&gt;represent more abstract algebraic objects, arising in theoretical&lt;br/&gt;physics and chemistry for instance, in terms of linear motions of&lt;br/&gt;suitable spaces, to render their structure more transparent. In the&lt;br/&gt;meantime, the scope of objects studied along this line has been&lt;br/&gt;dramatically enlarged, and a big arsenal of methods to analyze such&lt;br/&gt;representations has been assembled. Tools which have proved&lt;br/&gt;particularly effective include geometrical and combinatorial&lt;br/&gt;setups, and variations of a general theme which can be outlined as&lt;br/&gt;follows: One starts by establishing optimal situations, which can&lt;br/&gt;be completely analyzed, and then measures the deviation of a more&lt;br/&gt;challenging situation from the optimal ones to make headway in&lt;br/&gt;steps dealing with progressive increases in complexity.&lt;br/&gt;Applications extend to almost all parts of mathematics and provide&lt;br/&gt;the theoretical frames for models in theoretical physics.&lt;br/&gt;In fact, some of the recent initiatives were prompted by physicists&lt;br/&gt;and feed back into quantum physics.</AbstractNarration>
