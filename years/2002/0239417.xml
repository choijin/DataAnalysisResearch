<AbstractNarration>The goal of this research program is to develop and apply more physically&lt;br/&gt;accurate potential energy functions for polymeric macromolecules than are&lt;br/&gt;presently available, in particular functions that, in addition to the&lt;br/&gt;usual prediction of structures and energies, give spectroscopically&lt;br/&gt;accurate reproduction of vibrational frequencies (which is not achieved by&lt;br/&gt;current standard functions). This is accomplished by the spectroscopically&lt;br/&gt;determined force field (SDFF) methodology previously developed in this&lt;br/&gt;laboratory. Under this proposal, current SDFFs will be extended to include&lt;br/&gt;polarization, which is very important in describing properties of polar&lt;br/&gt;groups such as amides. A new protocol for determining parameters in the&lt;br/&gt;energy function assures the avoidance of correlations and indeterminacy&lt;br/&gt;in these quantities. The newly developed formalism for molecular dynamics&lt;br/&gt;in internal coordinates (ICMD) will be implemented on macromolecular&lt;br/&gt;systems. The hydrocarbon SDFF will be applied to the analysis and&lt;br/&gt;resolution of questions concerning structural transitions and the origin&lt;br/&gt;of spectral bands in trans-1,4-polybutadiene and band splittings in cis-&lt;br/&gt;1,4-polybutadiene. The SDFF to be developed for the amide group will be&lt;br/&gt;used to calculate the normal modes of nylons 6 and 66 to provide deeper&lt;br/&gt;insights into the analysis of vibrational and inelastic neutron scattering&lt;br/&gt;spectra of these polymers. The new ICMD formalism will be applied to&lt;br/&gt;calculations on crystalline polyethylene, with the particular goals of&lt;br/&gt;correcting published spectral intensity inaccuracies and of comparing&lt;br/&gt;spectral predictions from normal mode analysis with those from the Fourier&lt;br/&gt;transformation of the time-autocorrelation function of the dipole moment.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to its intellectual contributions, this research program will&lt;br/&gt;have broader impacts. New research results will be incorporated into&lt;br/&gt;advanced courses, and graduate students and postdocs will develop and&lt;br/&gt;report a more sophisticated understanding of an important area of&lt;br/&gt;science. The previous emphasis on involvement of women in the research&lt;br/&gt;program will continue. Advanced computer programs for analysis of&lt;br/&gt;properties of polymers will be made available to the scientific&lt;br/&gt;community. The more acurate theoretical understanding of properties will&lt;br/&gt;lead to advances in commercial polymer technology and the amide group&lt;br/&gt;aspect of the work have will an important impact in the study of &lt;br/&gt;biological systems.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
