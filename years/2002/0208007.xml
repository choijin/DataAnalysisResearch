    <AbstractNarration>PROJECT SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;Across the interior American West,cattle ranches are being converted to subdivisions,in order to&lt;br/&gt;accommodate exurban population expansion.What are the biodiversity consequences of this&lt;br/&gt;profound land use change?That is the core question addressed by this proposed research.&lt;br/&gt;Conversion of rangelands to subdivisions may negatively impact native biodiversity through&lt;br/&gt;direct habitat loss.It has been argued that finding ways to keep ranchers from selling their lands&lt;br/&gt;to developers is vital to conservation.On the other hand,most western ranches include some&lt;br/&gt;public lands that cannot be sold,and even on private lands the developments usually are low&lt;br/&gt;density.Therefore,western exurban development often results in relatively little direct habitat&lt;br/&gt;loss.If a landscape is converted by scattered subdivisions,but simultaneously released from the&lt;br/&gt;controlling influence of livestock grazing,will this result in net gains or losses of regional&lt;br/&gt;biodiversity?So far,a volatile mixture of prediction and passion has fueled this debate,but&lt;br/&gt;rarely has it been informed by data.&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this proposed study is to quantify components of native biodiversity in a&lt;br/&gt;grassland/savanna in the Sonoita Valley of southeastern Arizona,where some cattle ranches are&lt;br/&gt;being converted into subdivisions.This study will compare flowering plant,grasshopper,&lt;br/&gt;butterfly,bird,and rodent populations in landscapes that are being grazed,or subdivided,or&lt;br/&gt;both,or neither.It also will quantify the demographics of three bird species known to be&lt;br/&gt;particularly responsive to the effects of livestock grazing and/or landscape conversion through&lt;br/&gt;subdivision.The data will be used to test a series of hypotheses and predictions about the&lt;br/&gt;independent and interactive effects of exurban development and livestock grazing on 1)species&lt;br/&gt;richness and evenness of native biotic communities,2)invasions of exotic species into those&lt;br/&gt;communities,3)population and community stability,and 4)avian demographics.&lt;br/&gt;The centerpiece of this work will be the Appleton-Whittell Research Sanctuary,a 3200 ha&lt;br/&gt;preserve that has been ungrazed and otherwise undisturbed since 1968,and that has been the&lt;br/&gt;focus of extensive fieldwork since the early 1970 's.Unlike many land use studies in the West,&lt;br/&gt;this one will have a control,to the degree that 33 years protection have permitted patterns of&lt;br/&gt;native biodiversity to express themselves in the absence of either agriculture or exurban&lt;br/&gt;development.&lt;br/&gt;Results of this study will address basic and unanswered questions about the relative impacts of&lt;br/&gt;local forces (livestock grazing)versus landscape conversion (subdivision)on biodiversity in arid,&lt;br/&gt;non-forested western ecosystems,where 1)natural landscape heterogeneity is high,2)&lt;br/&gt;development is distant from the controlling influences of large urban centers,and 3)subdivision&lt;br/&gt;usually consists of scattered landscape intrusions rather than fragmentation of the grassland into&lt;br/&gt;isolated patches.The study will make societal contributions that are both timely and urgent,&lt;br/&gt;given present rates of development in the rural West,and the many uncertainties about its&lt;br/&gt;ecological consequences.</AbstractNarration>
