<AbstractNarration>A central problem for theoretical physics is the description of the structure of hadrons&lt;br/&gt;and their interactions.The building blocks of hadrons are quarks and gluons,among which&lt;br/&gt;the distribution of .avor,momentum,and spin is an area of intense study.This project will&lt;br/&gt;study two of the outstanding challenges to theory posed by recent experimental results:1)&lt;br/&gt;.avor asymmetry in the proton sea,measured by E866 at FermiLab,in which the excess of&lt;br/&gt;d -antiquarks (Pd )over u -antiquarks (Pu )for low values of x (the fraction of proton momentum&lt;br/&gt;carried by the antiquark),is replaced by a dominance of Pu over Pd for larger values of x ,and 2)&lt;br/&gt;the spin transfer measurements of PS185 at CERN,for Pff production from Pp collisions with a&lt;br/&gt;polarized proton target,which disagree with all theoretical predictions.These investigations&lt;br/&gt;will be extended to calculation of polarized .avor asymmetry in the proton sea,and to other&lt;br/&gt;antihyperon-hyperon (PYY )production reactions.A new area of research,singular potentials&lt;br/&gt;and limit cycles,will be studied in the context of e .ective .eld theory.&lt;br/&gt;Flavor asymmetry in the proton sea will be calculated in terms of a meson cloud model,&lt;br/&gt;in which the proton can .uctuate into meson-baryon states,whose quark distributions then&lt;br/&gt;contribute to the measured quark distributions of the proton.The quark and gluon degrees&lt;br/&gt;of freedom of the proton will also be included in a statistical model of the gbare proton, hthe&lt;br/&gt;leading term in the proton wave function.E .ects of charge symmetry violation,arising from&lt;br/&gt;di .erences in the masses of the Pd and the Pu ,will be included.The goal of this project is to&lt;br/&gt;explain the x -dependence of the experimentally determined unpolarized .avor asymmetry,&lt;br/&gt;and to predict the polarized asymmetry.&lt;br/&gt;High precision calculations of Ppp&lt;br/&gt;PYY will be carried out which will include:a)e .ective&lt;br/&gt;interactions that represent the leading contributions to Pqq annihilation and creation,b)&lt;br/&gt;an initial state interaction which has been determined by .t to PNN reaction data in the&lt;br/&gt;momentum region spanned by the strangeness production experiments,and c)a contribution&lt;br/&gt;to the reaction mechanism from a spin singlet term,for which there is evidence from the&lt;br/&gt;recent spin-transfer data.The goal of this project is to learn about the reaction mechanism&lt;br/&gt;and the otherwise unknown PYY interactions in the .nal state.&lt;br/&gt;The study of singular potentials and limit cycles will include investigation of real and&lt;br/&gt;complex potential regulators and their renormalization properties.Applications to cold atom&lt;br/&gt;scattering and problems in e .ective .eld theory will be made.&lt;br/&gt;This project has intellectual merit because,as described above,it addresses important&lt;br/&gt;problems in hadron structure and interactions for which there is signi .cant disagreement&lt;br/&gt;between nuclear theory and experiment.It extends prior work to new areas.The preliminary&lt;br/&gt;work necessary for the project has been successfully completed by the P.I.&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the project include placing the research in an undergraduate setting,&lt;br/&gt;in which students are drawn from a diverse population (40%minority)with a high percent-&lt;br/&gt;age of women physics majors (40%).The student research experience will be complemen-&lt;br/&gt;tary to coursework,and provide an integration of classroom learning and the excitement&lt;br/&gt;of contemporary research.Students will receive training in research methods and scienti .c&lt;br/&gt;communication.They will work in teams,mentor younger students and present their work&lt;br/&gt;in papers,posters and talks at meetings of professional societies.In addition to presentation&lt;br/&gt;of research .ndings in journal articles and at scienti .c meetings,seminars and colloquia will&lt;br/&gt;be given at other undergraduate institutions.</AbstractNarration>
