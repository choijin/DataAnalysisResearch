<AbstractNarration>The objective of this proposed research is to develop micro- and nanotechnologies that will enable precise engineering of cellular environments and allow correlation of subcellular signaling with cellular function. Genomics has greatly advanced our knowledge concerning how biological systems are programmed. This "software", however, is embedded in the "hardware" of a cell, which interacts with its environment to compute its specific outputs such as growth, differentiation, or death. The micro- and nanotechnology developed in this project will enable control over configuration of the cellular hardware such as receptor clustering and cell shape. The technology will then be used to study how different hardware configurations affect subcellular signaling and cell function. Specifically, multiple laminar flow technology will be used to stimulate subcellular microdomains with growth factors and soft lithographic three-dimensional protein nanopatterning technology will be developed to perform nanoscale extracellular matrix engineering. The two technologies will provide, with subcellular resolution, control of cross-talk between growth factor signals and adhesive signals. This type of knowledge is specifically relevant to understanding physiological processes such as embryonic development and wound healing as well as pathological states such as fibrosis and cancer. The research will be tightly coupled with the education and training of a work force that can translate these scientific and engineering discoveries into tangible social and economic improvements. A major component of the educational program is a Biological Micro- and Nanotechnology course that will seamlessly integrate micro- and nanotechnology with cell biology and provide both theoretical training and hands-on laboratory experiences to students.</AbstractNarration>
