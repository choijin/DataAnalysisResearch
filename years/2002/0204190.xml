<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT DMS - 0204190.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator is interested in concrete  problems &lt;br/&gt;in classical differential geometry and topology of curves and &lt;br/&gt;surfaces in Euclidean space, specially  those which involve some notion of convexity. &lt;br/&gt;The proposed investigations include:  (i) Certain nodal domains (shadows) cast on &lt;br/&gt;a surface by  vectorfields which correspond to  natural transformations, and developing &lt;br/&gt;the applications of these for surfaces of constant mean curvature, and surfaces whose &lt;br/&gt;gauss map satisfies a two-piece-property; (ii) Closed curves without parallel tangent lines&lt;br/&gt;(skew loops) and their relation to  quadric surfaces; (iii) Global properties of&lt;br/&gt;locally convex surfaces with boundary, including connections with Monge-Ampere&lt;br/&gt;equations, and a convex hull property which is dual to that of minimal surfaces;&lt;br/&gt;(iv) Existence and regularity of certain deformations of space curves (unfoldings)&lt;br/&gt;to study extremals of knot energies and distortion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study of curves and surfaces  has been the primary motivation&lt;br/&gt; for the development of much of differential geometry and geometric topology, which in &lt;br/&gt;turn has found significant applications in physical sciences.  Notions of convexity have &lt;br/&gt;often proved fruitful for solving problems in this area, specially those which involve &lt;br/&gt;optimizing various quantities.  Those aspects of the principal investigator's work dealing &lt;br/&gt;with shadows on illuminated surfaces is motivated in part by a study of soap films and&lt;br/&gt;may lead to applications for computer vision. Further, the investigations on knot&lt;br/&gt;energies may be of interest in studying the DNA. The primary motivation of the&lt;br/&gt;investigator, however, is based on aesthetic considerations and the intuitive&lt;br/&gt;visual appeal of low dimensional geometric problems.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
