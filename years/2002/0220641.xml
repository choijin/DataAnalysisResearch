<AbstractNarration>This project outlines a solution to a two-fold problem in Texas. The two-fold pieces of &lt;br/&gt;this problem are: 1) the productivity of the flourishing high technology economy in the &lt;br/&gt;state of Texas is being negatively impacted by the severe lack of well-educated &lt;br/&gt;engineering professionals; and, 2) a significantly large human resources, particularly &lt;br/&gt;minorities living in the state, do not participate in the development of the high &lt;br/&gt;technology industry. Consequently, economic prosperity bypasses this group. Therefore, &lt;br/&gt;what is needed is some economically feasible funding source that allows all Texas state &lt;br/&gt;residents to gain employment in the high technology industry. Hence, the scholarships &lt;br/&gt;afforded through this grant are assisting in alleviating this dual dilemma. The MEET-SWT &lt;br/&gt;project management plan is providing a system of prudent strategies for recruiting, retaining &lt;br/&gt;and ultimately graduating traditionally underrepresented individuals. These graduates enter &lt;br/&gt;into and to become productive members of the Texas high technology workforce. The &lt;br/&gt;Department of Technology at SWT is optimistic about the opportunity that this scholarship &lt;br/&gt;program is having in promoting education and career opportunities in engineering and &lt;br/&gt;engineering technology for all Texas state residents.</AbstractNarration>
