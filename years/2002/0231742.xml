<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;Graduate and Undergraduate Fellows are working  directly with Teachers drawn from 13 participating Environmental Science and Forestry  in the High School schools to  cooperatively lead course-specific, co-curricular and inter-school environmental science  classroom, laboratory, and field experiences. In addition they are helping organize a district-wide 7th/8th grade science fair (The  Environmental Challenge) and a 13-high school student science research symposium  (The Environmental Summit) as two specific synthesizing events.  Formative evaluation  information is being collected and used to monitor, take corrective actions as necessary, and ensure the project  achieves four outcomes:  improved Fellow communication and teaching-related skills; teacher content gain and professional development; enriched student science learning;  and strengthened school/college partnerships  The project uses specific instructional and professional development activities to present environmental science themes such as sustainability, human population  growth, a global perspective, the urban environment, and ethics.  As examples: the  Onondaga Lake Ecosystem Study provides a setting for study of a severely polluted  urban lake and its restoration/recovery plan;  the Onondaga City Park landscape frames  vital issues of urban ecosystem biodiversity, land use and sustainability; and the Adirondack  Highlands Regional Ecosystem Study offers opportunities for learning about the globally  significant phenomenon of ecological impacts of chronic atmospheric deposition on  aquatic and terrestrial communities and projected recovery as Clean Air Act emissions  reductions are implemented.  The broader impacts of the project include the widely diverse audience in the schools served; the Syracuse City School District with  25,000 students is one of New York State's "Big Five" urban school districts, while the additional partnering school districts represent a rich mix of suburban and rural  characteristics.  This project is partially supported from funds from the Directorate for Biological Siences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project Title:  Enhancing Scientific Literacy Through Environmental  Science: Developing Scientists and Citizens  &lt;br/&gt;Institution:  State University of New York College of Environmental  Science and Forestry (SUNY ESF)  &lt;br/&gt;PI/co-PI:  Dudley J.
