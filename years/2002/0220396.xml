    <AbstractNarration>This project will utilize Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of the interaction of the solar wind with the Earth's magnetosphere to study the dynamics by which the system changes from its normal condition to the magnetic storm condition and then back to the normal state. Previously it was thought that magnetic storms were characterized by a rapid series of magnetic substorms, but that the basic configuration of the magnetosphere and its current systems remained the same. More recent studies have suggested that the storm-time morphology of the electrical current systems in the magnetosphere may be quite different from the usual configuration. In addition to MHD simulations, the project will utilize data from a variety of satellites that cross the magnetopause at high latitudes. The project will also utilize measurements of the cross polar cap potential obtained from the DMSP satellites and other ground-based data, to determine if the polar cap potential drop shows the saturation effect that is predicted by the model to be investigated here.</AbstractNarration>
