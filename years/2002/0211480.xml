<AbstractNarration>ADLER - 0211480&lt;br/&gt;In natural systems, organisms face simultaneous direct and indirect interactions with mutualists and&lt;br/&gt;antagonists, yet our understanding of the relative importance of these competing pressures in&lt;br/&gt;shaping the evolution of phenotypic traits is still rudimentary. For example, flowering plants may&lt;br/&gt;face the dilemma of attracting pollinators while discouraging floral enemies, such as nectar&lt;br/&gt;robbers. Because robbers are competing with pollinators for the same resource (e.g., nectar), it may&lt;br/&gt;be particularly difficult for plants to evolve defensive mechanisms that are effective against&lt;br/&gt;antagonists without also deterring mutualists. The goal of the proposed research is to determine&lt;br/&gt;how a ubiquitous but poorly understood floral trait, toxic nectar, influences interactions with both&lt;br/&gt;nectar robbers and pollinators, and how these simultaneous interactions shape selection on this&lt;br/&gt;phenotypic trait.&lt;br/&gt;Toxic nectar, or nectar that contains secondary compounds, is a widespread trait that may confer&lt;br/&gt;resistance to floral robbers, but at a potential cost to pollinator attraction. Currently, the costs and&lt;br/&gt;benefits of toxic nectar are unknown. In addition to resistance traits, plants may cope with&lt;br/&gt;antagonists via tolerance. The concepts of resistance and tolerance have traditionally been used in&lt;br/&gt;reference to herbivores; however, nectar robbers, like herbivores, have profound effects on plant&lt;br/&gt;fitness and plants are likely to use resistance and tolerance as defensive mechanisms against&lt;br/&gt;robbers. The proposed research will extend resistance and tolerance concepts to a wider range of&lt;br/&gt;plant-animal interactions through an examination of the role of nectar traits, such as nectar toxicity&lt;br/&gt;and production, as mechanisms of resistance and tolerance to nectar robbing.&lt;br/&gt;The aim of this work is to understand the ecological role of toxic nectar within the context of&lt;br/&gt;interactions between mutualists (pollinators) and antagonists (nectar robbers), and to determine the&lt;br/&gt;extent to which resistance and tolerance mediate the impact of nectar robbers on plant genotypes.&lt;br/&gt;The research proposed will experimentally manipulate nectar toxicity in Gelsemium sempervirens,&lt;br/&gt;a perennial vine with documented alkaloids in its nectar, to determine the impact of toxic nectar on&lt;br/&gt;the community of insect pollinators and robbers as well as on male and female plant reproduction&lt;br/&gt;and offspring success. In addition, this study will manipulate nectar robbing and pollination in&lt;br/&gt;genotypes of G. sempervirens with known variability in nectar toxicity to determine the direct and&lt;br/&gt;indirect effects of nectar robbing on plant fitness, genetic variation in resistance and tolerance to&lt;br/&gt;nectar robbing, and costs of toxic nectar in the absence of nectar robbing. The research combines&lt;br/&gt;manipulative field experiments with observations to address four main questions: 1) Is there&lt;br/&gt;genetic variation in nectar toxicity? 2) Does toxic nectar benefit plants by increasing resistance to&lt;br/&gt;nectar robbing without reducing pollinator attraction? 3) Does nectar robbing reduce plant fitness&lt;br/&gt;directly or indirectly, and do plant genotypes vary in their resistance or tolerance of nectar robbing?&lt;br/&gt;and 4) Is there a cost of toxic nectar in the absence of robbing?&lt;br/&gt;The work proposed here is novel in that it integrates the costs and benefits of resistance associated&lt;br/&gt;with a ubiquitous but poorly understood floral trait, toxic nectar, in the context of joint forces of&lt;br/&gt;selection exerted by both mutualistic and antagonistic floral visitors. This work extends an existing&lt;br/&gt;conceptual framework and provides empirical insight into the diversity of roles a single floral trait&lt;br/&gt;can serve, from attraction to defense. Consideration of the broader context in which organisms&lt;br/&gt;evolve is fundamental to our understanding of how multiple-species interactions shape genetic and&lt;br/&gt;biological diversity at ecological, microevolutionary, and macroevolutionary scales.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
