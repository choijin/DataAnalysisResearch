    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will investigate the feasibility&lt;br/&gt;of developing a technology to optimize accumulation and subsequent removal of a valuable element from integrated gasification combined-cycle (IGCC) systems. IGCC is a highly efficient, low-emissions technology that uses coal and other feed stocks to produce electricity, process heat, and high-value fuels and chemicals. Deposits containing a valuable metalloid accumulate in an IGCC system, requiring significant downtime for&lt;br/&gt;cleaning and loss of revenue. The proposed technology will lead to recovery of a&lt;br/&gt;metalloid as part of routine operation of IGCC systems. Metalloid capture will be performed using bench-scale laboratory equipment with a simulated gasification environment. Bonding mechanisms will be characterized to determine if spalling of deposits through thermal cycling and soot blowing is a feasible method of recovering deposits on-line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This innovation would substantially increase revenue by providing a marketable product stream and would decrease operating and maintenance costs by improving the efficiency of the system.</AbstractNarration>
