<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;    A  grant has been awarded to the State University of New&lt;br/&gt;York  at  Stony Brook under the direction of Dr. Raleigh for the acquisition of an analytical ultracentrifuge.&lt;br/&gt;The  analytical  ultracentrifuge was first developed more than 50 years ago&lt;br/&gt;and  its  invention  lead  to a Nobel Prize. Since that time it has evolved&lt;br/&gt;from  a custom made piece of specialized apparatus to an essential everyday&lt;br/&gt;tool  for the investigation of basic biochemistry and chemistry. Analytical&lt;br/&gt;ultracentrifugation  is the method of choice for studying the properties of&lt;br/&gt;large  molecules that associate in solution. It is applicable to biological&lt;br/&gt;and  non-biological  systems  and  it  is now an important research tool in&lt;br/&gt;biochemistry,  structural  biology  and  polymer  science.  The  ranges  of&lt;br/&gt;applications  of  this  technique  are  immense and are rapidly increasing.&lt;br/&gt;Acquisition  of an analytical ultracentrifuge will complement major ongoing&lt;br/&gt;initiatives  in  polymer science and in structural biology and biochemistry&lt;br/&gt;at SUNY Stony Brook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Ten  investigators representing five academic departments at SUNY Stony&lt;br/&gt;Brook  will  conduct basic research projects. Their research interests span&lt;br/&gt;the  range  from  the  development  of  new  materials, to biology, polymer&lt;br/&gt;chemistry,  enzyme  mechanisms,  protein  dynamics  and  folding, and viral&lt;br/&gt;assembly.  Together  they supervise more than 90 researchers. Professor Chu&lt;br/&gt;will  use  the instrument in his investigations of novel vesicle structures&lt;br/&gt;and  surfactants  formed by modified fullerenes. These new materials have a&lt;br/&gt;range of potential applications including delivery agents. Professor Kisker&lt;br/&gt;will  use  the  ultracentrifugation  in  her  studies  of  DNA repair while&lt;br/&gt;Professor  de  Los Santos will make use of the instrument in his studies of&lt;br/&gt;damaged  DNA.  DNA  repair is essential for maintaining the correct genetic&lt;br/&gt;information.  Mutations  are  the  primary cause of hereditary diseases, as&lt;br/&gt;well  as  cancer, and may also be involved in aging. Professors' London and&lt;br/&gt;Smith will investigate fundamental issues in membrane protein structure and&lt;br/&gt;folding  and the ultracentrifuge will play an important role in their work.&lt;br/&gt;It  is  estimated  that 30 % of all proteins are membrane proteins but very&lt;br/&gt;little  is  known  about  their structure and folding despite the fact that&lt;br/&gt;they  play a central role in many important biological processes. Professor&lt;br/&gt;Raleigh  will  use  the instrument in his studies of the process of protein&lt;br/&gt;folding.  The  protein-folding  problem refers to the mechanism by which an&lt;br/&gt;initially  unfolded protein achieves its final functional structure. It has&lt;br/&gt;long  been  known that the linear sequence of aminoacids dictates the final&lt;br/&gt;folded  structure  of  proteins but the rules that govern this key assembly&lt;br/&gt;process are still not understood. Professor Sampson will use the instrument&lt;br/&gt;in  her  studies of the important enzyme cholesterol oxidase, which is used&lt;br/&gt;as  a  cholesterol  sensor. Professor Sampson and Professor Tonge will make&lt;br/&gt;use  of the instrument in their basic studies of enzyme functions while the&lt;br/&gt;laboratory  of  Professor  Scarlata will apply the instrument to studies of&lt;br/&gt;viral  assembly.  Professor  Schindelin will use the ultracentrifuge in his&lt;br/&gt;studies of the proteins involved in the biosynthesis of critical molybdenum&lt;br/&gt;cofactors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The  consortium  of  investigators  who will make use of the analytical&lt;br/&gt;ultracentrifuge  study  fundamental  problems  in biology, biochemistry and&lt;br/&gt;polymer  chemistry.  Many  biologically important molecules as well as many&lt;br/&gt;man  made  macromolecules  work in tandem with closely associated partners.&lt;br/&gt;Understanding   the  detailed  nature  of  these  interactions  is  key  to&lt;br/&gt;understanding  these  complex  systems.  An  analytical  ultracentrifuge is&lt;br/&gt;required  for  these  studies. Examples taken from work at SUNY Stony Brook&lt;br/&gt;include  studies  of  critical  proteins  involved in the repair of damaged&lt;br/&gt;genetic  material,  the  assembly  of  viruses,  the  behavior of novel new&lt;br/&gt;materials  made  from  C60  ("buckyball"  derivatives),  and studies of the&lt;br/&gt;fundamental  processes  by which proteins acquire their biologically active&lt;br/&gt;state.  The  instrument  will  also  greatly enhance the infrastructure for&lt;br/&gt;training  graduate  students  at  SUNY  Stony  Brook  and will also benefit&lt;br/&gt;researchers at nearby Brookhaven National Laboratory</AbstractNarration>
