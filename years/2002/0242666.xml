    <AbstractNarration>This proposal will develop a middle-school curriculum designed to facilitate inquiry projects in biology, ecology, animal behavior and natural history. "Classroom Birdwatch" will be developed by the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology (CLO) and the Lawrence Hall of Science. The curriculum will guide students as they collect data about local birds, submit the data to CLO, use the project database to answer questions about birds and conduct original bird research projects. Usable in all schoolyards, "Classroom Birdwatch" will cover biological topics including flight, migration, nesting behavior, and habitat utilization, and will incorporate math and statistics through data analysis, geography through online mapping, and technology through online data submission and retrieval. Twenty-five explorations that investigate bird biology and behavior, explore the process of scientific investigation, and help students conduct research will be developed. Students can submit their findings to a student journal produced by CLO, "Classroom Birdscope," and will have continued access to CLO scientists, who will answer questions about birds and guide participants through the scientific process. Materials will include a student handbook, teacher's guide, reference guide, and a web site incorporating software for data submission, retrieval and analysis. Assessments include tools for evaluating students' current and ongoing understanding of science content and inquiry process skills.</AbstractNarration>
