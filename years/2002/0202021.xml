<AbstractNarration>Proposal Number: DMS-0202021&lt;br/&gt;PI: Akos Magyar&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will deal with several problems in&lt;br/&gt;harmonic analysis some of which are also of interest in&lt;br/&gt;ergodic and number theory. The emphasis is on a combination&lt;br/&gt;of techniques from analysis and of other fields such as&lt;br/&gt;analytic number theory and singularity theory. The objects&lt;br/&gt;of study are related to diophantine equations, maximal&lt;br/&gt;averages over subvarieties and their discrete analogues,&lt;br/&gt;polynomial type ergodic theorems as well as oscillatory&lt;br/&gt;integrals and integral operators with degeneracies. A set&lt;br/&gt;of problems are discrete in nature, where mapping properties&lt;br/&gt;of operators related to classical exponential sums play a&lt;br/&gt;crucial role. Tough these appear as discrete analogues of&lt;br/&gt;well known constructs in analysis, they in turn can yield&lt;br/&gt;to new insights both in ergodic and number theory. Another&lt;br/&gt;direction is to study problems related to oscillatory&lt;br/&gt;integrals with degeneracies, where the usual "curvature"&lt;br/&gt;type conditions are replaced by assumptions on the&lt;br/&gt;singularities or only assuming genericity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During roughly the past decade the scope of harmonic&lt;br/&gt;analysis has been vastly extended by  incorporating methods&lt;br/&gt;from seemingly different fields of mathematics. This has&lt;br/&gt;led to an essentially deeper understanding of basic partial&lt;br/&gt;differential equations under periodic conditions (such as&lt;br/&gt;the nonlinear Schrodinger equation of quantum mechanics and&lt;br/&gt;the Wave equation), new phenomena in ergodic theory meaning&lt;br/&gt;that measurements do not have to be taken regularly but&lt;br/&gt;only very rarely to understand physical processes. The&lt;br/&gt;proposed research will concentrate on these types of&lt;br/&gt;problems Where a combination of methods of different fields&lt;br/&gt;of mathematics seems to be needed.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
