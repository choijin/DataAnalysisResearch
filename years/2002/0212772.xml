<AbstractNarration>The objectives of this work are to develop DNA base-pair analogs which can self assemble (using hydrogen bonding) into oligomers and polymers that adopt defined three dimensional structures.  They will start this investigation by preparing new base-pair analogs and study the structural factors that determine base-pair stability.  They will also work to develop a model to predict analog base-pair stability.  Oligomers and polymers of these base pair analogs will then be synthesized with the goal being the preparation of self assembled polymers which can equilibrate between folded and sheet-like structures.  Molecules which can use light to accomplish this equilibration are particularly desirable and will be studied in detail.  These self assembling polymeric materials may have properties, such as self healing, which are not currently available with traditional covalently bonded polymers.  The incorporation of these small molecules with defined hydrogen bonding capabilities into bulk commerical polymers may one day lead to higher performance materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. Steven C. Zimmerman of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Illinois.  Dr. Zimmerman and his students will work on the development of DNA base-pair analogs which can self assemble into oligomers and polymers that adopt defined three dimensional structures.  Polymers of these base-pair analogs will then be prepared with the goal being the preparation of self assembled polymers which can equilibrate between folded and sheet-like structures.  Molecules which can use light to accomplish this equilibration are particularly desirable and will be studied in detail.  These self assembling polymeric materials may have properties, such as self healing, which are not currently available with traditional covalently bonded polymers.  The incorporation of these small molecules with defined hydrogen bonding capabilities into bulk commerical polymers may one day lead to higher performance materials.  Students trained during the course of this interdisciplinary work will gain skills needed by the pharmaceutical, polymer and speciality chemicals industries. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
