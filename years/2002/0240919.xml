<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;Anderson&lt;br/&gt; OPP-0240676&lt;br/&gt;Mann&lt;br/&gt;OPP-0240919&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a collaborative proposal by Principal Investigators at the Universities of California-Santa Cruz and Alaska -Fairbanks.  This award will be jointly supported by the Arctic Natural Sciences Program and Geology and Paleontology Program in the Division of Earth Sciences.  Glaciers produce large amounts of fine-grained sediment, exposing vast amounts of mineral surface area to chemical weathering processes. Despite the tremendous potential for glaciers to influence global weathering rates and hence atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) levels, this effect has not yet been demonstrated. Silicate weathering rates underneath glaciers are subdued, and rates in recently deglaciated terrain are below average. The hypothesis is that loess weathering provides the key link between the physical erosion done by glaciers and global geochemical cycles. This project is to study silicate weathering fluxes from glacial loess, and assess their global significance. Loess is a silt-clay sized sediment, transported by wind off unvegetated braid plains of glacier-fed rivers, and deposited over broad vegetated areas. Both the fine grain size and vegetation should render loess deposits highly susceptible to silicate weathering. These deposits effectively extend the impact of glaciation to a much broader area than the extent of glacier ice. Weathering of loess has never been examined from the perspective of contribution to global geochemical cycles.  The project is designed to answer two questions: 1) does loess deposition increase the silicate weathering flux from a soil profile, and 2) does the weathering of loess occur at rates that can affect global weathering rates, and hence, global CO2 levels? Laboratory experiments, field measurements, and modeling will be used to address these questions. The field site is the Delta River valley in central Alaska, a glacial outwash system with on-going loess deposition at variable rates. Results from lab and fieldwork will be synthesized in a one-dimensional model of soil weathering fluxes as a function of loess deposition rate, precipitation rate, organic matter content, and grain size distributions. The model will be extended to the landscape scale to assess the global significance of loess deposition on CO2 consumption.  Weathering of loess may be a significant, but it is still an unrecognized, component of carbon cycling.  If this proves to be the case, then loess formation and weathering over timescales much longer than the duration of glaciation must be considered in models of atmospheric CO2 variation.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
