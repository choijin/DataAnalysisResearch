<AbstractNarration>Host Institution: University of Missouri-Columbia&lt;br/&gt;Partner Institutions:   Florida A&amp;M University, Grinnell College (IA), Long Island University-Brooklyn Campus, Medgar Evers College (NY), Prairie View A&amp;M University (TX), Southwest Missouri State University, St. Elizabeth's College (NJ), Truman State University (MO), University of Arkansas-Pine Bluff, Xavier University (LA)&lt;br/&gt;Major Field: Biological Sciences&lt;br/&gt;Subfields: Cell Biology, Molecular Biology, and Genetics&lt;br/&gt;Project Title: Cellular, Molecular, and Genetic Approaches to Biological Problems&lt;br/&gt;Number of Students: 10 per year&lt;br/&gt;Summer Weeks on Site: 8&lt;br/&gt;Point of Contact:       Dr. Linda Blockus;  573-882-5979;  BlockusL@Missouri.edu&lt;br/&gt;Web Site:        www.lsurop.Missouri.edu/undergrad/oncampus/NSF_REU.html&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our NSF-REU Site Program provides summer research opportunities for 10 undergraduates from 10 partner institutions including four Historically Black Colleges and Universities (Florida A&amp;M University, Prairie View A&amp;M University, University of Arkansas-Pine Bluff, Xavier University), two minority-serving institutions (Long Island University-Brooklyn Campus, Medgar Evers College), three primarily undergraduate institutions (Grinnell College, Southwest Missouri State University, Truman State University), and a women's college (St. Elizabeth's College).  The University of Missouri (MU) provides a research experience at a major comprehensive research university, while faculty at the partner institutions are responsible for the selection of the interns.  The partners also help prepare the interns for their summer research experience at MU and continue their training when they return to their home campus.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our partnerships are designed to provide a summer research experience for undergraduates, especially members of minority groups underrepresented in the sciences, who would not otherwise have an opportunity to conduct research in a state-of-the-art environment.  This Program is specifically designed to stimulate interest in graduate study.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research programs of the MU faculty mentors center on "Cellular, Molecular, and Genetic Approaches to Biological Problems."  These research programs use methodology ranging from recombinant DNA technology to molecular cytology to sophisticated population genetics. The research experience is the heart of the summer program.  Interns also develop communication skills through brown-bag lunches, lab group meetings, and an end-of-program Summer Undergraduate Research Science Symposium and poster session.  They are strongly encouraged to present their research at regional and national scientific meetings, with the Program providing financial support.  Enrichment activities include seminars by research faculty, panel discussions on preparation for graduate school and career options, and a science ethics workshop.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
