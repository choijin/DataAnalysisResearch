<AbstractNarration>The long-running and highly successful National Public Radio series "Science Friday" is venturing in new directions.  Given that basic research underlies all of the technological advances influencing our world and that tax dollars pay for that research, the public needs to be informed about the basics of research.  To address this need for public education, "Science Friday" will examine the importance of research as a theme underlying all science and technology changes by:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finding the research roots at the bottom of each story;&lt;br/&gt;Exploring the cooperation among corporations, private institutions, and research foundations and illuminating how each plays a role in the research process;&lt;br/&gt;Following the research "bumps" along the road to illustrate that research success depends upon failures --  not all research produces positive results; &lt;br/&gt;Illuminating the barriers to successful research;&lt;br/&gt;Helping listeners understand the thought process of researchers;&lt;br/&gt;Scaling the "ivory tower" by enabling listeners to question and talk directly with researchers; and &lt;br/&gt;Helping listeners understand the role of basic research in policy-making.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ira Flatow, the host, will take "Science Friday" on the road and produce programs in Oklahoma, Iowa, Michigan, Massachusetts, Arizona and other locations.  He also will visit schools and universities and will speak at public events.  NPR also will reactivate the "Science Friday Kids Connection" which will take each week's program and its guest scientists directly into classrooms across the country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
