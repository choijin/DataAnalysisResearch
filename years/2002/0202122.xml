<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT DMS - 0202122.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to study the geometry of conformally&lt;br/&gt;compact Einstein manifolds and other related problems.&lt;br/&gt;These manifolds were first studied by mathematicians about ten&lt;br/&gt;years ago. New ideas and stimuli came up a couple of years ago when &lt;br/&gt;it was found that they are the mathematical framework for the new proposal &lt;br/&gt;ADS/CFT correspondence in string theory. Therefore the study of conformally &lt;br/&gt;compact Einstein manifolds has even become important for physics. The author &lt;br/&gt;has done work on the geometry of such manifolds, but there remain many problems &lt;br/&gt;to be studied. In the future the author hopes to tackle the problem of existence.&lt;br/&gt;If the conformal infinity has enough symmetry one hopes to find explicit&lt;br/&gt;solutions. The global uniqueness is also a challenging problem and&lt;br/&gt;requires new ideas. Many recent results have shown that there is a&lt;br/&gt;profound relationship between the global geometry of ambient manifolds&lt;br/&gt;and the conformal geometry of the boundary. The author intends to further explore &lt;br/&gt;this direction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal studies a class of geometric objects called conformally&lt;br/&gt;compact Einstein manifolds. They are not only mathematically interesting,&lt;br/&gt;but also important for physics because they serve as the framework for&lt;br/&gt;a deep correspondence in string theory. The author will study various&lt;br/&gt;geometric aspects of these manifolds as well as problems arising in&lt;br/&gt;physics. The study of this special class of noncompact manifolds whose&lt;br/&gt;geometry at infinity is well under control will also provide insights&lt;br/&gt;and ideas to study more general noncompact manifolds.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
