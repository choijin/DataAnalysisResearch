<AbstractNarration>Near-surface fault patterns of strike-slip systems are now reasonably well understood, in&lt;br/&gt;large part because of extensive societal interest (seismic hazard) and a wealth of&lt;br/&gt;subsurface information obtained from petroleum exploration. What happens to these&lt;br/&gt;faults at depth, however, is poorly understood. One approach to resolve these questions&lt;br/&gt;is geophysical imaging, but these studies are expensive and typically ambiguous because&lt;br/&gt;of imaging problems of structures ranging from low to high angle in crystalline rocks that&lt;br/&gt;often lack sufficient variation in physical properties for clear imaging. A much higher&lt;br/&gt;resolution technique to resolve these issues is to examine well-exposed down-plunge&lt;br/&gt;sections of strike-slip shear zones. Such a structure exists in eastern Chugach Mountains&lt;br/&gt;of southern Alaska, and this project proposes to examine this structure in detail to&lt;br/&gt;investigate the three-dimensional architecture of strike-slip systems at mid to lower&lt;br/&gt;crustal depths. Previous NSF funded research by the PI and V.B. Sisson has documented&lt;br/&gt;the structural geometry of the lower and upper portions of the system, but a mid-crustal&lt;br/&gt;portion of the system has not been examined in detail. In light of recent theoretical&lt;br/&gt;developments (e.g. Teyssier et al., in press) the PI's initial conclusions require re-evaluation because the classic hypothesis of steep shear zones penetrating through the crustal column predicts a different geometry than a crustal column in which the upper and lower crust are detached along a broad zone of distributed flow. This project will test these alternative predictions through a combination of field structural studies, kinematic analyses (finite and incremental strain, shear-sense determination, and strain path information through growth fibers and development of quartz LPO's). </AbstractNarration>
