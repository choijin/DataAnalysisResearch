<AbstractNarration>0208311&lt;br/&gt;Paterson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BAC libraries for key branches of the flowering plant family tree will greatly accelerate progress in unraveling the 200-million year history of angiosperm evolution.  Extensive prior investments in the Poales and Brassicales make them important nucleation points for the monocots and dicots, respectively, from which to reach out across plant diversity to further investigate evolution of genome size, gene repertoire and function, and plant morphology.  We will make 5 libraries totaling 423,936 BACs from carefully-selected angiosperm genomes (see below) to empower new investigations of well-delineated questions in developmental, evolutionary, and comparative biology.  Among these, two (Ananas, Opuntia) will be the first BAC libraries known in their taxonomic orders, and two will be the first for important genome types (A, F) within a species complex (Gossypium) that is especially facile for asking fundamental questions about morphological transformations, polyploid evolution, and genome organization&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These libraries will empower new investigations in monocots and dicots respectively, of general mechanisms associated with plant diversification, and the specific events that may account for major morphological-developmental transformations, by virtue of making possible important new comparisons to many taxa already well studied.  These libraries will also offer opportunities to shed new light on the genomic consequences of polyploidy, and new insights into the developmental genetics of other scientifically important features that are inadequately studied at the molecular level.  All of the taxa we will study are closely-related to economically-significant crops that exhibit features 'amplified' by human selection, and as such comprise botanical models in their own right for various aspects of plant growth and development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will empower many scientific synergies to be realized by links with prior investments by the Arabidopsis and Rice Genome Initiatives, NSF Plant Genome Program (in the Poales and Malvales), USDA-IFAFS (in the Brassicales), and USDA-NRI genome programs (Malvales).  Community involvement in decisions relating to this project has been substantial.  Our research is closely-tied to strong training and outreach programs with a successful history of engaging undergraduates and groups under-represented in the sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Binomial Common name Family  1C value (Mbp)  # of BACs Genome coverage &lt;br/&gt;Ananas comosus pineapple Bromeliaceae 531 55,296 10x&lt;br/&gt;Gossypium herbaceum A-genome cotton Malvaceae 1785  92,160 5x&lt;br/&gt;Gossypium longicalyx F-genome cotton Malvaceae 1592  92,160 6x&lt;br/&gt;Gossypioides kirkii  Malvaceae 579 73,728 12x&lt;br/&gt;Opuntia cochellinifera prickly-pear cactus Cactaceae 869 110,592 10x&lt;br/&gt;   TOTAL 423,936 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
