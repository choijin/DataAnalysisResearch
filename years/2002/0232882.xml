    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a novel process capable of high-volume production of monodisperse nanoparticles of arbitrary metallic composition. Such highly-controlled materials are desired as components for engineered nanostructures. The current standard precipitate or aerosol processes for metal nanoparticle formation are limited in available materials, the particle size distribution, or productivity. In this project an adaptation to jetting processes will be used to enable formation of metal nanojets and nanoparticles. Because this is entirely a physical process, it is expected to be able to be adapted to any metal alloy. second The specific tasks of the project will inolve survey of possible approaches, analyzing the proposed process, and preparing the preliminary design of the key parts of a prototype apparatus. The objective is a system capable of the precise formation of nanojets and monosize nanoparticles at rates greater than one gram per second.&lt;br/&gt; Commerically, there are many possible long-term applications for metal nanoparticles. Nanoelectronics and high-density data storage are two appealing examples. The established markets for the technology described with the most initial opportunity relevant to this proposal appear to be in the following fields: solid propellants, explosives, and catalysts. Monodisperse nanoparticles will allow &lt;br/&gt;mechanical packing into ordered array structures for filtration. The high surface area of nanoparticles enables their use as substrates for catalysis of chemical reactions. While supported by these initial markets, further innovation in many other markets and derivative technologies (such as oxide ceramic nanoparticles, and nano-patterning devices) will be developed from this new technology. This technology offers a means of producing significant quantities of monodisperse nano-spheres at commodity prices. It also enables further significant innovations in nanoscale fabrication, materials and processing.</AbstractNarration>
