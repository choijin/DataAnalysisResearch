<AbstractNarration>0226422&lt;br/&gt;Henry Kelly&lt;br/&gt;Federation of American Scientists&lt;br/&gt;"Question Generation and Answering Systems R&amp;D for Technology-Enabled Learning Systems"&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project involves bringing research and development leaders together across disciplines and the public and private sectors to identify promising research that addresses the challenge of incorporating question generation and answering capabilities into learning systems.  Advice from panels of experts from companies, universities, government research facilities, and others with unique related expertise will result in: 1) A comprehensive review of recent research on questioning and answer systems from multiple perspectives: psychology, cognitive science, computational linguistics, and information systems design; 2) Telephone interviews with relevant researchers, program managers, and industry representatives; 3) Assimilation of the findings from tasks 1) &amp; 2) into a preliminary report; 4) A workshop of acknowledged experts, researchers, developers, and implementers of question generation and answering systems to evaluate, discuss and contribute to the final report; 5) A final report that will synthesis the discussions from the workshop that can serve as a comprehensive and strategic view of the field which researchers, industry, and funding may use as a guide for developing and applying question and answer systems. This project addresses a critical need to raise awareness of research results, tools, and on-going programs and projects across research disciplines, industry efforts, and government funding organizations related to question generation and answering. The work combines the skills of many disciplines including information science, software engineering and design, and cognitive science.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
