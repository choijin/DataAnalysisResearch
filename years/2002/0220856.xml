<AbstractNarration>Linn-Benton Community College's (LBCC) project expands opportunities for education,&lt;br/&gt;increases retention to baccalaureate degree achievement, and improves employability of low-income,&lt;br/&gt;academically talented students in transfer programs in Computer Science, Engineering, and Mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;This is accomplished by providing targeted academic, career, and other support services to the&lt;br/&gt;recipients of 30 scholarship awards each year.&lt;br/&gt;The four main components of the LBCC Tech Scholars Program (TSP) are:&lt;br/&gt;oFinancial support through TSP scholarships to allow talented low-income students to pursue full-time studies in Computer Science, Engineering, and Mathematics&lt;br/&gt;oAcademic support through existing programs and new initiatives to assist students with current coursework and prepare them for success in upper division coursework&lt;br/&gt;oMentoring and student support to increase retention at LBCC and to promote a smooth transition to the transfer institution&lt;br/&gt;oActivities to strengthen employability, including career explorations, preparation for internships, and development of job-seeking skills&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theme permeating all components of this project is 'community building' a focus on establishing a&lt;br/&gt;cohort that provides peer support; develops an increased sense of belonging; and promotes identification&lt;br/&gt;with the discipline at LBCC, the target transfer institution, and the chosen profession. Enhancements to&lt;br/&gt;existing support services as well as new initiatives are designed specifically to strengthen these bonds and&lt;br/&gt;reduce feelings of isolation. There is a great need in Oregon for skilled high tech employees. LBCC is in a prime position to work toward meeting that need because of high unemployment in parts of our service district, a large percentage of students who have financial need, strong community support for this community college, robust transfer programs in Computer Science, Engineering, and Mathematics, and extensive articulation with both high schools and transfer institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LBCC initially recruits low-income students who are currently enrolled at the college and who&lt;br/&gt;have demonstrated academic talent in Computer Science, Engineering, or Mathematics into the TSP.&lt;br/&gt;After the first year, the program expands to include low-income high school students who have&lt;br/&gt;demonstrated academic talent and expressed an interest in majoring in one of these three areas. The&lt;br/&gt;financial support provided by the scholarships increases full-time enrollment and improve academic&lt;br/&gt;life by reducing the need to work long hours for an income. TSP scholars are then able to more fully&lt;br/&gt;utilize the academic, career, and personal support services. TSP scholars benefit from extensive academic support systems currently available, including free tutoring; Supplemental Instruction; and a Learning Center with Math, Science, Writing, Reading, and Study Skills assistance. Enhancements and additions included as part of the project include the establishment of a Tech Scholar Center (a designated room on campus where TSP scholars can hang out, work on their studies together, and get academic assistance); expanded connections between TSP scholars and faculty, students, and organizations at transfer institutions; site visits and presentations by industry representatives; development of job-seeking skills; and increased participation in career-enhancing activities such as internships.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
