    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to improve inquiry-based instruction of science, technology, and mathematics in Appalachian middle schools. The program will provide fellowships for eight graduate and four undergraduate students per year to work with twelve science and mathematics middle school teachers from six different middle schools. Each Fellow will team up with a middle school teacher and a university mentor to develop and implement inquiry-based activities, designed to meet Kentucky and national education standards. Several training sessions, including an intensive one-week summer workshop, are planned for all participants. Overall the project will have broad impact, as it is expected to lead to enriched learning by middle school students, provision of professional development opportunities for middle school teachers, improved communication and teaching skills for the Fellows, and strengthened partnerships between EKU and regional middles schools. Part of the support for this project comes from the Directorate for Mathematics and Physical Sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Enhancing Inquiry-Based Science and Math in Appalachian Middle Schools&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Eastern Kentucky University&lt;br/&gt;PI: Tom Otieno.
