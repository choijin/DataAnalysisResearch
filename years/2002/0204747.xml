<AbstractNarration>DMS Award Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Award #:   0204747&lt;br/&gt;PI:    Schult, Daniel&lt;br/&gt;Institution:   Colgate University&lt;br/&gt;Program:   Applied Mathematics&lt;br/&gt;Program Manager:  Catherine Mavriplis&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: RUI: Spatial and Temporal Variation in Smoldering Combustion&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Models of smoldering combustion require a description of porous fluid flow as well as a description of the reaction process.  The resulting partial differential equations are highly nonlinear, making description of the solutions difficult.  Numerical simulations involving adaptive methods which change resolution as the process evolves are necessary to resolve these solutions.  Asymptotic methods have also been successful in describing steady and slowly varying approximate solutions to these models.  The proposed project involves extending both asymptotic and numerical methods in order to study non-steady and spatially varying smolder combustion.  These techniques will then be used to describe the details of the dynamics and transitions of these solutions.  The techniques developed will likely be applicable in other areas of combustion and problems of flow in porous media.  This project should be of interest to scientists using asymptotic methods, using adaptive numerical methods for high-performance computing, interested in issues of stability of solutions with many time scales, or interested in the development of chaotic solutions.  The results should be of particular interest to fire safety experts and combustion control engineers who wish to understand dynamics of smoldering near extinction limits, transitions from smoldering to flaming and patterns such as fingering of smolder waves as they move through materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Smoldering combustion refers to fire in a porous medium in which the oxygen supply to the reaction site is limited, for example when it must flow through the porous substance to reach the fuel.  Smolder is often a precursor to airborne flames and is particularly dangerous because of the amount of smoke produced and the difficulty of ensuring extinction.  When controlled, smolder also has important applications to material synthesis (high temperature synthesis) and to the design of timing devices (fuses).  A better understanding of the processes controlling smolder combustion will enhance fire safety as well as allow better control for engineering uses of smoldering combustion.  This Research in Undergraduate Institutions project includes a training program and participation of several undergraduate students, mentored by the principal investigator. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Date: May 7, 2002&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
