<AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Microbial Biology for FY2002.  The fellowship supports training and research on the basic biology of protozoan, microalgal, fungal, archaeal, bacterial and viral species that are not generally considered to be model organisms. Further, it provides opportunities for a recent doctoral recipients to obtain additional training in microbial biology, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of established scientists, and to broaden his/her scientific horizons beyond the research experiences during the undergraduate and graduate training. These fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including foreign locations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research and training plan is entitled "Molecular and biogeochemical investigations of microbial communities associated with ocean-ridge basalts."  The proposed research is directed towards identifying which microorganisms are involved in the initial stages of basalt weathering reactions, their phylogeny and modes of metabolic activity, and how transient these microbial communities may be.  The research combines sampling of marine, ocean-ridge environments with laboratory enrichment culturing techniques and molecular biology methods.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
