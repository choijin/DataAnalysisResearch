<AbstractNarration>0201623&lt;br/&gt;O'Connor&lt;br/&gt;This award provides continued funding to the American Institute for Medical and Biological Engineering (AIMBE) to help promote scientific collaboration and improve communication among Biomedical Engineering researchers and their professional societies from 48 countries worldwide. AIMBE is the U.S. member organization to the International Federation of Medical and Biological Engineering and this award provides funds to support travel of AIMBE'S appointed representative to participate in meetings of IFMBE's Administrative Council. Representation on the Administrative Council provides the United States with the opportunity to develop new lines of communications and collaborative projects among biomedical engineering researchers globally, thereby extending the U.S. leadership role in medical science and technology research and development. This is particularly relevant to investigations concerning emerging medical technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The current AIMBE representative to IFMBE is Dr. Dov Jaron, who also serves as the current President of IFMBE. Proceeds from a grant would be used to support the cost of attending Council meetings and regional conferences in Asia, Latin America, and Europe. The Council meetings entail strategic planning of the organization, planning of scientific meetings, publications, dissemination of scientific information and initiation of advanced projects in critical and emerging areas. The regional conferences are designed to promote collaboration and networking among Bioengineering researchers and educators from the United States and developing countries and as a mechanism to implement the critical projects. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The funding level is modest compared to the anticipated value for the U.S. community of biomedical engineering researchers. And the project is expected to promote the role of the National Science Foundation in advancing research and education in this field globally while assisting NSF in achieving its strategic objectives.</AbstractNarration>
