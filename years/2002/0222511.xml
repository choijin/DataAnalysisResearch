<AbstractNarration>The focus of this research is to design molecules to self assemble into   one- and two-dimensional supramolecular motifs or aggregates that will   serve as scaffolds with which to control three-dimensional structures.    Cyclic diamides are targeted as the molecular building blocks .  Among   those to be studied are 2,5-diketopiperazines, 3,6-dioxo-1,2,4-triazines   and 3,6-dioxo-1,2,4,5-tetrazines.  The robust one-dimensional `tapes`   obtained from these building blocks will then be used as precursors of   interesting solid state materials.  The educational focus of the project   is the integration of supramolecular chemistry into the undergraduate   curriculum.  With this Faculty Early Development (CAREER) award, the   Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research   and educational activities of Dr. G. Tayhas R. Palmore of the Department   of Chemistry at the University of California, Davis.   Professor Palmore    will focus her research efforts on  understanding how the self assembly   of molecules into supramolecular motifs can be used to control solid   state structure.  Self assembly of nanostructures promises to be one of   the most powerful approaches to device miniaturization.  The aim of the   proposed educational activities is to stimulate interdisciplinary   discussion and research in supramolecular chemistry and to integrate   supramolecular chemistry into the undergraduate curriculum.</AbstractNarration>
