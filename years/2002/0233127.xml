<AbstractNarration>0233127&lt;br/&gt;Johnson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This three-year award for US-France collaboration in wireless telecommunications involves students and researchers at Cornell University and the French National Institute for Telecommunications.  C. Richard Johnson in the US and Phillip Regalia in France lead this cooperative project on the theory, design, and pedagogy of broadband telecommunications receivers.  As communication systems become sophisticated and hardware advances allow for more complex algorithms in telecommunications receivers, these systems will become more critical to emerging applications.  The investigators will address four topics:  (1) adaptive multi-carrier equalization; (2) ultra wideband receivers; (3) turbo equalization; and (4) equalizer initialization strategies.  The investigators have complementary expertise in adaptive system theory for control, signal processing and communications applications.  Their expertise will be used in studies of the interplay of broadband receiver subsystems such as synchronization, equalization and coding.   The French expertise in joint coding and equalization has potential for adaptation to wireless personal area networks under development in the US.  Similarly, US expertise in multi-carrier and ultra wideband could be applied to problems of inefficient spectral band in local wireless links in Europe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award represents the US side of joint proposals to the NSF and the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS).  NSF will cover travel funds and living expenses for the US investigator and graduate student.  CNRS will support the visits of the French researchers and graduate students to the United States. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
