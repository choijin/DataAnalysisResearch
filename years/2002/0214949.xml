    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to develop a new type of&lt;br/&gt;nanoengineered surface to epitaxially nucleate protein crystals. These surfaces should greatly accelerate most high throughput Structural Genomics efforts. The basic concept for the epitaxial surfaces is to prepare a surface that possesses chemical modulations commensurate in size and periodicity to protein unit cells. It is speculated that exposure of the protein growth solution to certain compositional periodicities (5-100 nm) on the surface of the heterogeneous nucleants induces an ordered layer of sorbed protein molecules which form the incipient nucleus of the protein crystal. Since for a given unknown protein the unit cell is not known in advance, the heterogeneous nucleants are prepared as a combinatorial library in a chip based format, with a wide variety of modulations per unit chip area. In this Phase I proposal, methods and techniques will be developed to allow a more efficient survey of surfaces and proteins with the goal of better defining the role of the surfaces in inducing nucleation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial applications of this project are in the area of biological research and in drug discovery and development.</AbstractNarration>
