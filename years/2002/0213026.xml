<AbstractNarration>Population density cycles that appear synchronous, or irin-phasel, over large geographic areas&lt;br/&gt;are some of the most striking phenomena in population biology. In theory, such synchrony is&lt;br/&gt;caused either by widespread meteorological factors, or by movement of individuals between&lt;br/&gt;populations. Theory for predator-prey 'metapopulationsl' that extend over groups of patches&lt;br/&gt;also links synchrony to regional persistence. The study of these phenomena in nature has been&lt;br/&gt;hampered by difficulty in identifying both the cause of population cycles and the roles of&lt;br/&gt;environmental factors and interpatch movement in modifying population fluctuations and&lt;br/&gt;synchrony. The environmental forcing of metapopulations which is explored here is relevant to&lt;br/&gt;biological control of pest species and conservation. Additionally, extreme weather events&lt;br/&gt;caused by global warming have the potential to synchronize regional populations, which might&lt;br/&gt;cut short regional persistence. The proposed work uses mathematical techniques focused on&lt;br/&gt;phase dynamics to analyze synchrony and build precise links among environmental variability,&lt;br/&gt;population dynamics and extinction. Phase dynamics have been widely used in neurobiology,&lt;br/&gt;but their potential in ecology is only just beginning to be realized. This project develops new&lt;br/&gt;analytic tools for an ecological audience and uses a model experimental system, bacteria and&lt;br/&gt;protozoa in laboratory microcosms, to bridge the gap between populations and metapopulation&lt;br/&gt;theory. The work starts with a classic model and then develops more precise and biologically&lt;br/&gt;realistic models, which in turn will fuel further, more precise, experimental tests.&lt;br/&gt;Two-patch predator-prey systems coupled by random dispersal will provide a link with&lt;br/&gt;analytical solutions, which numerical simulations and experiments can build on to consider more&lt;br/&gt;complex and realistic situations. Two patch models will be used to derive equations which relate&lt;br/&gt;phase, the point in a predator-prey cycle, to population dynamic processes. The dynamics of&lt;br/&gt;phase difference between two patches will be derived and used as a measure of synchrony,&lt;br/&gt;which can be related to regional persistence and within-patch predator-prey dynamics. Phase&lt;br/&gt;dynamics can also distinguish whether persistence is controlled not by deterministic equilibrium&lt;br/&gt;dynamics (the focus of most theoretical studies), but instead by long-lived transient dynamics&lt;br/&gt;which may dominate during ecologically relevant time scales; specifically regression of phase&lt;br/&gt;difference through time will be used to calculate the duration of transient dynamics, when phase&lt;br/&gt;difference becomes zero. Experimentally, the initial phase difference of predator-prey&lt;br/&gt;oscillations in two linked patches will be manipulated by starting microcosms with different&lt;br/&gt;predator and prey densities in each patch. Statistics will then quantify the phase difference&lt;br/&gt;between patches and test its correlation with regional persistence time. Repeating this&lt;br/&gt;procedure in microcosms with different movement rates between patches (lengths of corridors)&lt;br/&gt;will test the prediction that increased movement rate between patches will reduce phase&lt;br/&gt;differences and regional persistence time. Experiments with 1-8 patches will manipulate&lt;br/&gt;environmental variability through temperature fluctuations and control whether this operates&lt;br/&gt;uniformly across a region or just in a single patch. Quantification of regional persistence time&lt;br/&gt;and phase differences between patches will then test the predictions that local variability&lt;br/&gt;enhances regional persistence, but regional variability and increased movement reduce regional&lt;br/&gt;variability.&lt;br/&gt;This project will demonstrate how and why environmental variability influences dynamics&lt;br/&gt;and extinction in regionally-distributed predator and prey systems. The techniques of phase&lt;br/&gt;dynamics will be brought to a broader ecological audience, and two graduate students will be&lt;br/&gt;trained with the necessary mathematical, modeling, statistical and experimental techniques that&lt;br/&gt;are required to understand the links between the environment and populations. This work will&lt;br/&gt;provide a paradigm on which future combined experimental and theoretical studies of population&lt;br/&gt;synchrony and persistence can build.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
