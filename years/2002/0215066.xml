    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will synthesize semiconductor interconnects by using a novel chemical vapor deposition technique for deposition of silver and copper films on high aspect ratio patterned substrates for sub 100 nm CMOS devices. This technique called hybrid chemical vapor deposition combines the advantages of conventional Chemical Vapor Deposition to achieve integrated circuit super filling, of trenches and vias under low temperature processing conditions. This technique utilizes precursors made with metallic nanoparticles (size of metallic particles: 35 nm) that can be uniformly dispersed inorganic solutions using appropriate surfactants. The liquid precursor can be transported to the patterned wafer surface in the form of mist and under appropriate low temperature thermal conditions can form a conformal film of metal on the surface, which further aggregates inside the pores to achieve super filling. Initial work conducted on copper films has shown very promising results. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Application of the research is expected in microelectronics industry. The important are of reliable interconnects will help signal integrity. The successful development of hybrid chemical vapor deposition process has not yet been reported in the literature and would represent an important advancement in metal thin film deposition process.</AbstractNarration>
