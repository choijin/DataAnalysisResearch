    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I Project will investigate self-imaging in fiber structures, and determine feasibility of developing two classes of novel device: highly efficient, near diffraction-limited rare earth ion-doped glass lasers and amplifiers, and high power/energy fibers for transport, routing and coupling of diffraction-limited beams. Conventional single mode fiber lasers can deliver similar performance at low power/ energy, but higher power systems require larger fiber apertures, leading to multi spatial mode propagation. Self-imaging accesses a new operating regime for guided wave devices, enabling diffraction-limited power scaling of lasers and beam-transport fibers. In comparison, bulk lasers are less efficient, and more susceptible to thermo-optic distortions. The self-imaging proof-of-concept has been demonstrated in a 16W planar waveguide laser fabricated from diffusion-bonded crystals. However, that approach is not well suited to fabricating 2-dimensional waveguides where 4 separate polishing/bonding steps are needed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Application of this work would be the design and development of optimized waveguides for the telecommunications industry. The end product would be an integrated product with improved optical characteristics.</AbstractNarration>
