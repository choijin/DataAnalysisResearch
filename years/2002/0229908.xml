<AbstractNarration>This project develops instructional materials to support in-class instruction of introductory programming. The materials supplement existing curricula to encourage greater student participation and understanding and are compatible with many teaching styles and modes of instruction. The approach is to specialize various Classroom Assessment Techniques (CATs) [Angelo and Cross 1993] for use in introductory programming classes.  CATs provide a mechanism for students to supply feedback to the instructor about the instructor's teaching, about the course material, and about their own learning. CATs can also be used to create more active learning experiences for students by engaging them in classroom activities. The CATs developed in this project will be evaluated in introductory computer science courses at the University of Washington. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The goals for the materials include: to provide active learning experiences for students in introductory computing courses, to provide instructors a means to assess students, understanding of introductory programming concepts, and to widen the communication channel between students and the instructor. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Classroom Assessment Techniques and supporting technology will be constructed to accomplish these goals.   The deliverables for this project are: &lt;br/&gt;- Classroom assessment tools for use in CS1/CS2 courses based on either C/C++ or Java. &lt;br/&gt;- Preliminary usage notes for instructors on how to use individual assessments in class. &lt;br/&gt;- Prototype work on technological support for classroom assessments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The materials will be evaluated through four quarters of classroom use at UW.  At the end of the project, the classroom assessment tools will be made available for other instructors to use.  The distribution mechanism will be to publish the materials available on the web for instructors to download them. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
