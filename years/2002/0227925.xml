<AbstractNarration>0227925&lt;br/&gt;Korpchak   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is to the Southern Illinois University at Carbondale to support the activity described below for 36 months.  The proposal was submitted in response to the Partnerships for Innovation Program Solicitation (NSF 02060).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Partners&lt;br/&gt;The partners for the proposed scope of work are Southern Illinois University at Carbondale (Lead Institution), ADM Animal Health and Nutrition, Illinois Fish Farmers Cooperative, Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs, City of Carbondale/Southern Illinois Research Park. ADM Animal Health and Nutrition is contributing its trademarked animal feed supplements to be used by the Southern Illinois University at Carbondale Fisheries and Illinois Aquaculture Center in dietary /feeding experiments.  The Illinois Fish Farmers Cooperative will contribute technical support in fish processing and storage, and coordinate participation of its members in field trials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aquaculture is the most rapidly growing sector of U.S. agriculture. Illinois is the largest inland state consumer of seafood and the second leading consumer of farm-raised fish in the country.  The state of Illinois has recently invested $12 million to build a state-of-the-art fish processing facility.  This effort will build on this initiative by addressing the issues of feed for farm-raised fish, which is the most costly factor in aquaculture. The following innovations are included: (1) farm-raised fish with substantially higher levels of long-chain, omega-3 fatty acids in their edible fillets, (2) healthier fish in terms of growth and survival in winter, (3) higher survival percentage for the hatchlings. Potential economic benefits include, less expensive food for farm-raised fish, higher production yields for fish farms, reduction of over fishing of thee oceans, and increased new jobs in fish-processing plants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The creation of new jobs will have a significant impact on the region, which currently has a high unemployment. In addition, lowered food costs and environmental improvements from less over fishing of the oceans plus a fish supply from waters known to be free from industrial contaminants will have obvious benefits to society.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
