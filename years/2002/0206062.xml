    <AbstractNarration>As tropical forests are cleared for agriculture, tropical &lt;br/&gt;trees become restricted to isolated "islands" of habitat. If pollen &lt;br/&gt;and seeds do not move effectively among these fragments, local mating &lt;br/&gt;occurs, increasing inbreeding and the erosion of genetic diversity. &lt;br/&gt;Inbreeding and reduced genetic diversity, in turn, can diminish seed &lt;br/&gt;production and seedling vigor, threatening population viability. &lt;br/&gt;This study uses genetic markers to study how fragmentation affects &lt;br/&gt;pollen movement and inbreeding in three animal-pollinated tropical &lt;br/&gt;tree species in Costa Rica. DNA fingerprinting will be used to &lt;br/&gt;determine pollen sources for seeds produced in forest fragments and &lt;br/&gt;how levels of inbreeding and genetic diversity are affected by pollen &lt;br/&gt;movement. Comparing patterns of gene flow and seedling vigor between &lt;br/&gt;fragments and a nearby continuous forest will allow assessments of &lt;br/&gt;genetic threats posed by fragmentation. Geographic analyses will &lt;br/&gt;show how patterns of gene flow are affected by fragment size and &lt;br/&gt;surrounding landscapes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Declines in biological diversity represent a profound global &lt;br/&gt;threat. This study will illuminate how habitat loss and fragmentation &lt;br/&gt;are affecting reproductive success, genetic diversity and inbreeding, &lt;br/&gt;all of which can reduce population viability. Because they depend so &lt;br/&gt;obviously on animals for pollination and seed dispersal, tropical &lt;br/&gt;trees in forest patches are at particular risk of extinction. As &lt;br/&gt;plants represent the foundation for biological productivity and &lt;br/&gt;diversity, such losses can result in cascades of extinctions. The &lt;br/&gt;data from this study are thus needed to identify both proximal &lt;br/&gt;threats to tropical trees and to guide longer-term management.</AbstractNarration>
