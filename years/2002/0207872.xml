    <AbstractNarration>0207872&lt;br/&gt;Henyey&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EarthScope is a major earth science research initiative that will integrate scientific information derived from seismology (US Array), geodesy (Plate boundary Observatory), subsurface sampling and measurement (SAFOD), remote sensing (InSAR), and complementary geology and geophysics to understand continental scale plate deformation and evolution. Funding for the EarthScope initiative is currently being discussed in Congress as part of NSF's FY 2003 budget. The Division of Earth Sciences has made FY 2002 funds available for projects that qualify as pre-EarthScope activity, i.e. activities that will facilitate or enable the construction, fabrication, installation or operation of EarthScope once it is funded under the MREFC (Major Research Equipment Facilities and Construction) account. Such activities include meetings and workshops, prototype development, site selection or characterization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides funds to hold a workshop on the role of complementary geophysics in the EarthScope program. By complementary geophysics is meant those geophysical techniques and data that are not at the core of the EarthScope facilities initiative, including gravity, magnetics, magnetotellurics, electromagnetics, petrophysics, heat flow, geophysical well logs, remote sensing data, TM images, DEM data and industry seismics. The principal focus will be on the "value added" aspect of the complementary geophysical data. It should be noted that a similar workshop to consider complementary geologic effors will be held at the GSA Annual Meeting in Denver in October, 2002.&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>
