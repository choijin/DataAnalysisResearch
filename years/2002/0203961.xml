<AbstractNarration>0203961&lt;br/&gt;Pascu&lt;br/&gt; The PI will study several connected problems related to reflecting Brownian motion in convex domains. Motivated originally by the interest of the proposer in solving the hot spots conjecture, the first problem concerns the construction of couplings of reflecting Brownian motion in convex domains. The author introduced a new type of coupling of reflecting Brownian motions, which led him to a partial resolution of the hot spots conjecture; the author will try to develop these coupling arguments, with the hope of solving this long-standing conjecture with roots in mathematical physics. In connection to this problem is the more general conjecture of the diagonal monotonicity of the Neumann heat kernel of convex domains with one axis of symmetry (which implies the hot spots conjecture). A related open problem which the PI intends to study is Chavel's conjecture on the domain monotonicity of Neumann heat kernel. In the view of the PI, coupling techniques can be used here to obtain classes of domains for which Chavel's conjecture holds true. Finally, in connection to all above-mentioned problems is the more general problem of finding a precise dependence of the Neumann heat kernels of two convex planar domains. &lt;br/&gt; Reflecting Brownian motion has been observed and studied for more than one century, since it was first observed by the English botanist Robert Brown in 1827. Its most recent spectacular application is probably the famous work of Black-Scholes, which changed forever the guessing game of the price of a stock option in a mathematical sense by tying it to the random behavior of a Brownian motion. This led to the award of a the Nobel prize for Economics in 1997. Other applications of reflecting Brownian motion are in potential theory, partial differential equations, mathematical physics and mathematical finance. The present research aims to develop and study certain properties of reflecting Brownian motion (monotonicity properties and domain dependence of the transition density), which will give a deeper understanding of this fundamental stochastic process. In turn, this gives as applications properties of functions arising from real-life situations, whenever a connection to this process can be established (for example the extremum properties of the temperature of a thermally insulated body). &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
