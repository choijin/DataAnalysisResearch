<AbstractNarration>AST 0205964&lt;br/&gt;Peterson, B M&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program will explore the very inner structure of active galactic nuclei, to determine masses of the central black holes using continuum and emission-line variability to probe the physical processes in the accretion-disk/broad-line region environment.   The current  program in progress to measure the bulge velocity dispersions in the host galaxies of active galactic nuclei will be expanded to test whether the relationship between the black-hole mass and bulge velocity dispersion is the same for active galaxies and quiescent galaxies.  This relationship will be used to estimate masses for local AGNs for which reverberation masses have not been measured, concentrating initially on radio-loud AGNs and narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies, objects that are not well represented in reverberation-mapped samples.  Optical ground-based support for multiwavelength monitoring programs will be provided, in particular a long-standing program of optical spectrophotometry on the well-studied Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 5548.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
