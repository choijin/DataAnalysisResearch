<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will contribute to our nation's capacity for increasing the number of&lt;br/&gt;people with disabilities employed in the science, technology, engineering, and&lt;br/&gt;mathematics (STEM) work force by demonstrating the effectiveness of an innovative&lt;br/&gt;combination of person centered career planning activities, ongoing mentoring, and hands&lt;br/&gt;on experiences in the sciences. This combination of activities is designed to 1.) increase&lt;br/&gt;recognition of the interests and needs of students with disabilities in the STEM career&lt;br/&gt;areas, 2.) create a more supportive academic and professional climate for persons with&lt;br/&gt;disabilities, 3.) promote accessibility and appropriateness of instructional materials and&lt;br/&gt;educational technologies at multiple levels (high school, community college, and&lt;br/&gt;university), and 4.) increase the availability of academic enrichment experiences such as&lt;br/&gt;mentoring and hands-on experiences in the STEM areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To meet these broad goals, the SIU SY-STEM project will:&lt;br/&gt;*Identify students' preferences and interests for specific STEM-related career&lt;br/&gt;areas.&lt;br/&gt;*Increase receptivity of educators (secondary and post-secondary math and science&lt;br/&gt;educators) and of guidance counselors for including of students with disabilities&lt;br/&gt;in STEM-related curriculum experiences.&lt;br/&gt;*Impact adaptations, accommodations, and instructional strategies used by&lt;br/&gt;educators in STEM classes and labs at multiple levels.&lt;br/&gt;*Foster academic and professional development in STEM related career areas by&lt;br/&gt;increased access to career exploration experiences and mentoring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A fundamental premise of this project is that the best way to impact employment of&lt;br/&gt;persons with disabilities in the sciences is by simultaneously increasing the numbers of&lt;br/&gt;people in the pipeline leading to these careers and enhancing the capacity of secondary&lt;br/&gt;and post-secondary training institutions to successfully include students with disabilities.&lt;br/&gt;Twenty-five teams of students, parents, educators, and guidance counselors from 25 high&lt;br/&gt;schools in southern Illinois will participate in intensive one-day workshops on person&lt;br/&gt;centered career planning.  From these 25 student teams, six students will be selected to&lt;br/&gt;participate in an intensive, on-campus Summer Institute at Southern Illinois University.&lt;br/&gt;This Institute will expose students to a variety of careers in the sciences and engage them&lt;br/&gt;in a series of rotations in various lab sciences.  University students with disabilities will be&lt;br/&gt;recruited to work in close affiliation with a graduate student mentor and faculty mentors&lt;br/&gt;to provide ongoing support for the workshop and Institute participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SIU SY-STEM project will impact involvement of persons with disabilities in&lt;br/&gt;STEM areas of study at multiple levels, including the personal and professional&lt;br/&gt;development of high school and college students with disabilities, and changes in the&lt;br/&gt;educational resources, willingness, and capacity to support these students in high school,&lt;br/&gt;community college, and university programs.  Although this project is designed as a&lt;br/&gt;regional demonstration involving high schools, consortia of community colleges, and&lt;br/&gt;Southern Illinois University, it is the intention of the applicant to sustain this initiative by&lt;br/&gt;building broader, more comprehensive regional/national networks and alliances.  To that&lt;br/&gt;end, the project includes a comprehensive evaluation component and widespread&lt;br/&gt;dissemination plan.</AbstractNarration>
