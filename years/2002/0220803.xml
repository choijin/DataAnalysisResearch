<AbstractNarration>This project provides thirty scholarships to academically talented financial needy sophomore students majoring in electrical, civil and industrial engineering. Students are selected based on grade point average and strength of essays and recommendation letters. The motivations of the student and career goals are also important factors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project centers on building a community of engineering scholars using faculty mentors and other support mechanisms. The engineering Student Work Employment office plays a significant role by coordinating efforts with partners in industries and government for summer internship opportunities, career placement and seminar development, which are designed to enhance career or higher education placement. Faculty members in the students' disciplines mentor the scholars throughout the duration of the program. The mentorship program is expected to be a major component of the project, building students' confidence and enhancing students' learning. Professional development is also an important part of the program, where students attend professional meetings or professional development workshops. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
