    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop highly proton conductive, water insoluble and thermally stable electrolytes for proton exchange membrane fuel cells, based on a hybrid membrane of a functionalized polyoxometalate (POM) cluster in a sol-gel matrix. Phase I will focus on developing the technology of fabrication of cathode/electrolyte and anode/electrolyte membranes. The procured cathode/electrolyte and anode/electrolyte membranes can then be pressed together and thermally cured to form a cathode/electrolyte/anode membrane assembly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development of small fuel cell systems for residential may provide the&lt;br/&gt;householder with electricity and heat at a significant saving over conventional services. &lt;br/&gt;Fuel cells make distributed cogeneration a competitive alternative as they provide a&lt;br/&gt;unique combination of advantages. Being small, clean and quiet, they can be sited wherever&lt;br/&gt;electricity is needed, even in the most congested urban location. Fuel cell generators can&lt;br/&gt;be used in hospitals and computer centers where there is a need for uninterruptible, high&lt;br/&gt;quality power. Micro fuel cells as portable generators and to replace batteries since they&lt;br/&gt;are quick and easy to refuel, have longer operating times and lower operating costs.&lt;br/&gt;Systems are suitable for a number of applications, including portable computers and&lt;br/&gt;telephones, video cameras and generators for camping, boating and emergency power.</AbstractNarration>
