<AbstractNarration>Power is becoming increasingly as important, if not more important than &lt;br/&gt;performance in many digital systems ranging from PCs and servers to &lt;br/&gt;Internet routers and embedded systems-on-a-chip. While there has been &lt;br/&gt;substantial research exploring the power efficiency of the processing &lt;br/&gt;and memory elements of digital systems, research investigating the power&lt;br/&gt;consumption of communication elements has been lagging. As a wide range &lt;br/&gt;of digital systems becomes increasingly interconnected, it is now&lt;br/&gt;both timely and critical to explore power-aware interconnection networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this proposal, we outline our plans to research, develop and build &lt;br/&gt;self-regulating power-aware interconnection networks that trade off &lt;br/&gt;power and performance automatically while meeting design constraints. In &lt;br/&gt;these networks, power-aware router and link mechanisms export knobs by &lt;br/&gt;which network power and performance can be adjusted. Policies then &lt;br/&gt;control these knobs to deliver network power-performance that meet &lt;br/&gt;design goals. Self-regulating power-aware networks alleviate designers &lt;br/&gt;from the daunting task of reconciling two highly divergent goals -&lt;br/&gt;high performance, and low power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In highlighting and demonstrating the importance of power awareness in &lt;br/&gt;networks, our proposed research advances a deeper understanding of &lt;br/&gt;networks from a fresh perspective, with a potential for high-impact &lt;br/&gt;contributions in research. In addition, we see our research leading to &lt;br/&gt;power efficiency being an integral part of networking curriculum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
