<AbstractNarration>This grant will be used to develop non-photochemical laser-induced nucleation as a&lt;br/&gt;method for providing nucleation-on-demand, for controlling crystal structure, and for&lt;br/&gt;improving the current understanding of nucleation from solution. The basis of this&lt;br/&gt;technique is the discovery, made by the PIs several years ago, that intense near-infrared&lt;br/&gt;laser pulses could induce crystallization in aged supersaturated solutions of small organic&lt;br/&gt;molecules. In cases studied so far, laser-induced nucleation enhances the rate of&lt;br/&gt;nucleation by a factor of 10 13 . Even more intriguing is the case of aqueous glycine,&lt;br/&gt;which crystallizes into two different polymorphs depending on the laser polarization state&lt;br/&gt;(linear vs. circular), which implicates the optical electric field as being responsible for the&lt;br/&gt;phenomenon. This "polarization switching" of polymorphs represents a clean method for&lt;br/&gt;controlling crystal structure. It is hypothesized that the oscillating electric field of the&lt;br/&gt;light is aligning solute molecules in a pre-nucleating cluster, aiding its organization into a&lt;br/&gt;particular crystal structure. The method also has the potential of creating new&lt;br/&gt;polymorphs of some substances. New polymorphs constitute novel materials that may&lt;br/&gt;have important industrial applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the next three years the PIs propose to gain a better understanding of the mechanism&lt;br/&gt;of non-photochemical laser-induced nucleation, by systematically studying its&lt;br/&gt;dependence on illumination parameters such as intensity, wavelength, laser pulse width&lt;br/&gt;and polarization state. With the same goal, they will also explore the effect of a strong&lt;br/&gt;static electric field on supersaturated solutions. Other experiments would focus on&lt;br/&gt;screening a large number of solvent/solute systems, as well as melts, to correlate the form&lt;br/&gt;of the inducing electric field to the crystal structure that is induced. Such screening&lt;br/&gt;would also include a search for new polymorphs.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
