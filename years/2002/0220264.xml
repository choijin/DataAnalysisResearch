    <AbstractNarration>ourier analysis appears in many of the celebrated cornerstones of&lt;br/&gt;theoretical computer science. It plays essential roles in expander&lt;br/&gt;graph construction and derandomization, complexity lower bounds,&lt;br/&gt;probabilistically checkable proof systems, quantum computing, lower&lt;br/&gt;bounds for distributed computation, and traditional applications to&lt;br/&gt;computer algebra. The majority of these applications involve the&lt;br/&gt;familiar framework of commutative Fourier analysis. The proposed&lt;br/&gt;project brings together a multidisciplinary research team to apply the&lt;br/&gt;beautiful tools of non-Abelian (that is, noncommutative) Fourier&lt;br/&gt;analysis to investigate open questions in two areas where non-Abelian&lt;br/&gt;groups have recently become very important: lower bounds for parallel&lt;br/&gt;computation and quantum algorithms. The program also further develops&lt;br/&gt;efficient algorithms for the discrete Fourier transform over finite&lt;br/&gt;non-Abelian groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on developing tools for separating the complexity&lt;br/&gt;classes ACC^0 and NC^1, in order to demonstrate that there are natural&lt;br/&gt;(polynomial-time computable) problems which simply cannot be&lt;br/&gt;parallelized in the sense of ACC^0. The project applies a new family&lt;br/&gt;of tools for separating such circuit classes, using non-Abelian&lt;br/&gt;Fourier analysis to bound their computational power. These tools apply&lt;br/&gt;also to the problem of solving equations over finite groups, and the&lt;br/&gt;development of new probabilistically checkable proof systems based on&lt;br/&gt;non-Abelian groups. In addition, the project applies non-Abelian&lt;br/&gt;Fourier analysis to develop improved lower bounds on the standard&lt;br/&gt;Quantum Fourier Transform approach to Graph Isomorphism and study&lt;br/&gt;quantum Monte Carlo algorithms. Finally, the project focuses on&lt;br/&gt;adaptations of Bratelli diagrams and quivers to develop classical and&lt;br/&gt;quantum algorithms for the non-Abelian Fourier transform itself.</AbstractNarration>
