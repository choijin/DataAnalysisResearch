    <AbstractNarration>Proposal Number DMS - 0205643 Investigator Emma Previato ep@math.bu.edu&lt;br/&gt; Moduli spaces and differential equations&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project combines projective geometry and differential &lt;br/&gt;algebra. For a few decades now, moduli spaces of vector bundles&lt;br/&gt;over curves have been prominent in mathematical physics. A few &lt;br/&gt;interrelated open problems are the object of this research. &lt;br/&gt;In projective space, models of moduli of vector bundles still don't have &lt;br/&gt;explicit description, by equations or by classification. The generalized &lt;br/&gt;theta functions (sections of higher-rank vector bundles) are not developed &lt;br/&gt;to the point that one can describe flows of completely integrable &lt;br/&gt;hierarchies or perform the necessary calculations of quantum field theory&lt;br/&gt;(partition function, e.g.) Finally, flows of commutative rings &lt;br/&gt;of partial differential operators (generalized KP flows) have not been &lt;br/&gt;described explicitly. In the proposed work: on the projective-geometry side, &lt;br/&gt;equations for moduli spaces of higher-rank bundles and dimensions of &lt;br/&gt;Brill-Noether loci will be calculated by methods of representation theory &lt;br/&gt;and correspondences between Grassmannians. On the analytic side, &lt;br/&gt;differential equations for the Kleinian functions (which generalize the &lt;br/&gt;Weierstrass p-function) will be derived and applied to integrate new &lt;br/&gt;Hamiltonian systems and the generalized KP flows. A theme that runs through &lt;br/&gt;the proposed research is the classical problem of reduction: Weierstrass' students &lt;br/&gt;Koenigsberger and Kowalevski, respectively, characterized the abelian integrals &lt;br/&gt;of genus 2, 3 respectively, that reduce with "multiplicity" 2 to an &lt;br/&gt;elliptic integral; since then, very little was found in general &lt;br/&gt;(e.g., higher genus or multiplicity). Progress on this problem &lt;br/&gt;is now under way, partly due to results that revisit the Kleinian&lt;br/&gt;functions, and partly to the aid of computer algebra. The problem of reduction is linked &lt;br/&gt;with the problem of curves with automorphisms, and the project includes applications of &lt;br/&gt;the results to differential Galois theory, monodromy of ordinary differential equations, &lt;br/&gt;and decoding algorithms for algebraic (Goppa) codes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Elliptic functions have an "unreasonable effectiveness",to borrow E.P. Wigner's phrase. &lt;br/&gt;They occur when modeling harmonic oscillators, shooting billiards, measuring the &lt;br/&gt;amplitude of ocean waves, computing the partition functions of quantum field theory. &lt;br/&gt;The word "elliptic" refers to the number of periods of the functions &lt;br/&gt;(one over the real, two over the complex numbers). Theta functions are the multi-periodic &lt;br/&gt;analog of elliptic functions. Although Old Masters such as Klein, H.F. Baker and O. Bolza,&lt;br/&gt;obtained equations for genus-2 (4 complex periods) theta functions, most &lt;br/&gt;properties of theta functions are still inexplicit, including their dependence on the &lt;br/&gt;period lattice. New impetus in the study of such functions came from the theory of &lt;br/&gt;integrable PDEs, such as the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equation, and the attendant&lt;br/&gt;algebraically completely integrable systems that have been intensively studied since the &lt;br/&gt;1970s. This project will combine projective geometry and differential algebra to identify &lt;br/&gt;differential equations satisfied by the (Kleinian) theta functions, and apply them to &lt;br/&gt;find exact solutions of Hamiltonian systems and non-linear PDEs.&lt;br/&gt;At the same time the project will pursue the other major, &lt;br/&gt;"non-abelian" generalization of theta functions, by embedding moduli spaces into projective &lt;br/&gt;space. Theta functions that can be reduced to expressions in elliptic functions will be &lt;br/&gt;characterized geometrically and used in effective decoding algorithms.</AbstractNarration>
