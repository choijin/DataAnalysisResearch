    <AbstractNarration>This Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement project analyzes the gender-based dimensions of human-wildlife conflict in agricultural communities located near Corbett National Park, in the north Indian state of Uttaranchal. The research examines the gender differentiated impacts of conflict with wildlife in terms of: (i) livestock predation, crop raiding, property damage, and attacks on humans, and (ii) the spatial and temporal patterns of these incidents. The research emerges from a growing awareness among scientists that human-wildlife conflicts threaten both conservation objectives and human well-being. Recent studies indicate that vulnerability to conflict with wildlife in North India may be directly influenced by such factors as gender, age, and relative poverty. While it is clear that vulnerability is strongly shaped by socioeconomic and political factors, the implications for individuals within the household - particularly women - are often eclipsed by the focus on `the household as the primary unit of analysis. The project addresses this gap in understanding by examining the inter-household consequences of human-wildlife conflict. Data will be collected through a combination of in-depth qualitative field techniques and quantitative survey interviews. The field research will be supplemented by an analysis of governmental wildlife conflict data logs from 1998-2001. Fieldwork in India will be conducted in 2 stages over a period of 24 months, beginning in June 2002. Qualitative data will be subject to cluster and text analysis, and quantitative data will be spatially and statistically analyzed using Geographic Information System (GIS) and standard statistical computer software. The study will reveal the extent to which women, compared with men, in the study area are at increased risk of negative encounters with wildlife, the ways in which conflict with wildlife is defined by different members of the household, and the degree to which such conflicts impact the ability of various members of the household to maintain their livelihoods. The research will also identify factors that exacerbate the frequency and intensity of human-wildlife conflict in the study area. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will contribute to a deeper understanding of human-nature relationships by describing the interaction between humans and wildlife in both forest and agricultural contexts, the role of women in securing household subsistence needs, and the importance of women's work in maintaining child health and overall family well-being. The research will also have implications for the study of rural livelihoods through its investigation of women's access to resources and contributions to household-level poverty alleviation. The research has relevance for endangered species protection initiatives, park design and management models, and sustainable economic development planning efforts for communities living in and around protected areas in India and elsewhere. As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.</AbstractNarration>
