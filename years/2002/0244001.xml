<AbstractNarration>Nine students who have a solid background in mathematics will be selected to participate in  an eight-week research experience in computational number theory and combinatorics to be held at Clemson University.  Preference for four of these positions will be given to qualified applicants who have roots in the Southeastern United States, provided that there are a sufficient number of qualified applicants from this region.  No more than two of these four special positions will be filled by Clemson University students.  The nine students  selected will be offered up to $350 in travel support, a dorm room to be shared with another participant in the REU, up to $600 for meals and a stipend of $2,660 in return for their participation in this program.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Participants will be introduced to various tools, techniques and problems from computational number theory and combinatorics.  The participants will be divided into teams of two or three and allowed to pick one problem on which to focus for the remainder of the REU.  The goal of the program will be to help students attain a higher level of independence in mathematical research by giving them the opportunity to take part in a significant and interesting research project.  Students will also  be encouraged to attend the SouthEast &lt;br/&gt;Regional Meeting On Numbers (SERMON) in the spring of the following year and present their work there. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a complement to working on their research, students will be required to attend a weekly lecture series.  These lectures will be given by faculty who have been recognized as leaders in the various fields related to the students' research problems and who have demonstrated the ability to clearly communicate &lt;br/&gt;mathematical ideas to audiences of varying levels of mathematical maturity.</AbstractNarration>
