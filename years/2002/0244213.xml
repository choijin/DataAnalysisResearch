<AbstractNarration>The Biology Program at the University of Alaska Southeast (UAS) offers research experience to undergraduate students interested in the physiology, ecology, and behavior of marine organisms.  The UAS Juneau Campus, located on Auke Bay, provides opportunities for 10 weeks of hands-on research experience with marine algae, invertebrates, birds and mammals.  In addition to the Juneau area, field research projects take place in Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve, the Gulf of Alaska, and the Arctic Ocean.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Student participants will conduct research under the guidance of UAS Biology faculty and collaborating research scientists.  The program is supported with funds from the National Science Foundation and the University of Alaska Southeast.  Each student participant will receive a stipend $350 per week and housing while in Juneau.  Travel and subsistence costs to the site and within Alaska will also be provided.  Living arrangements during the REU program may involve sharing an apartment with male and female students, and you may also share a room with another (same-sex) student.  Juneau is located in southeastern Alaska and accessible only by ferry (Alaska Marine Highway) or air (Alaska Airlines). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A workshop on the UAS campus will include training in the conduct of science, selected field methods, and field and laboratory safety.  Students will work intensively with their mentors on individual projects and present their results in a seminar at the completion of the program. Opportunities also exist to present at national meetings. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Applicants must be U.S. citizens or permanent residents and enrolled as undergraduate students at accredited institutions.  Graduating seniors are not eligible.  The program seeks academically strong students interested in marine biological research.  Minority applicants are especially encouraged. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All applications received by 28 February 2003 will be considered in a review during the first week in March. Applications received after 28 February will be considered only if all positions are not filled during review of the original pool. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For more info, please contact Elizabeth Mathews at (907) 465-1827 or beth.mathews@uas.alaska.edu.
