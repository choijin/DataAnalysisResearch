    <AbstractNarration>0212005&lt;br/&gt;Zedler&lt;br/&gt;Ecosystem degradation often involves the loss of topographic heterogeneity, a critical&lt;br/&gt;ecosystem property that declines as sediments fill in depressions, flatten surfaces and&lt;br/&gt;raise elevations. In southern California, coastal habitat that is highly valued for its&lt;br/&gt;support of endangered plants and animals has suffered catastrophic sedimentation,&lt;br/&gt;followed by altered species distributions and lowered biodiversity. When recovery is&lt;br/&gt;attempted, topographic complexity is typically ignored as sediments are excavated and&lt;br/&gt;restoration sites contoured by bulldozer. Insufficient vertical and horizontal&lt;br/&gt;heterogeneity might be a key constraint on the restoration of wetlands toward structural&lt;br/&gt;and functional equivalency with undisturbed sites.&lt;br/&gt;In this project, we will investigate how adding topographic heterogeneity might&lt;br/&gt;accelerate the progress of ecosystem restoration. The principal hypothesis is that adding&lt;br/&gt;vertical and horizontal pattern at to will facilitate the restoration of wetland structure and&lt;br/&gt;function. To test this hypothesis, an entire 8-ha tidal wetland restoration site within the&lt;br/&gt;Tijuana River National Estuarine Research Reserve (San Diego County, CA) was&lt;br/&gt;designed to support the large-scale, ecological experiment. The $3.1-million excavation&lt;br/&gt;was completed in February 2000 with the connection of the site to a main tidal channel,&lt;br/&gt;and we have monitored several attributes over the 22 months since tidal flushing was&lt;br/&gt;reinstated. We propose to take full advantage of the experimental treatments and&lt;br/&gt;examine the influence of (1) a vertical pattern of topographic heterogeneity, in the form&lt;br/&gt;of complex tidal creek networks, and (2) a horizontal pattern furnished by varying&lt;br/&gt;densities of planted salt marsh halophytes, on the diversity, abundance and composition&lt;br/&gt;of multiple response variables and trophic levels: geomorphology, algae, vascular plants,&lt;br/&gt;invertebrates, and fish.&lt;br/&gt;In addition to testing methods for recovering wetlands, the integrative work proposed&lt;br/&gt;herein will demonstrate the power of restoration experiments and contribute fundamental&lt;br/&gt;new insights into the relationship between topographic heterogeneity and the&lt;br/&gt;development of ecosystem structure (species composition and abundance) and function&lt;br/&gt;(e.g., foraging by fish). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conservation and Restoration Biology (CRB).</AbstractNarration>
