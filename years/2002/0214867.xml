<AbstractNarration>The goals of this three-year research project include investigation of the operation of devices based on alternate device technologies, including p-channel strained SixGe1-x and narrow-width SOI device structures.  The simulation tools that will be developed for this purpose will begin at the semi-classical Boltzmann equation level in the hierarchy of approximations, and extend to direct simulation of quantum transport within various approximation schemes at the most fundamental level.  The main goals are to&lt;br/&gt;develop tools based on direct solution of the semiclassical Boltzman equation using either full-band or non-parabolic energy band models.  These techniques will be combined with robust, multi-processor field solvers based on multi-grid and Bi-CGSTAB methods including non-uniform grids for arbitrary device geometries.  Discrete impurity effects will be included through a quantum molecular dynamics scheme to assess the fluctuation in device operating characteristics based on random impurity distributions.  Collaboration with industrial partners will be undertaken for comparison and calibration with state of the art device technologies. Due to the computational demands of both 3D semi-classical and quantum device modeling, the proposed research will be supported by high-performance computing environments based on distributed workstation clusters. In addition to research, there will be significant educational enhancements that will accompany this research project.  These include introduction of new classes in the area of Computational Electronics, Web-based activities and inclusion of minorities and undergraduates in research.  As such, they will help introduce our graduate students to the challenging world of Computational Electronics in both Industry and Academia.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
