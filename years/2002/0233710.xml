    <AbstractNarration>Proposal ID: 0233710&lt;br/&gt;PI: Herbert Lee&lt;br/&gt;Title: Bayesian methods for spatio-temporal, inverse, and multi-resolution problems&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator and his collaborators study a new class of spatial models derived from the convolution representation of Gaussian process models. By expanding the class of distributions for the underlying process being convolved, the result is a range of flexible spatial models that are especially useful for inverse problems and spatial processes over time. The research specifically examines convolutions of Markov random fields and convolutions of temporally evolving processes. The researchers also explore the use of coupled chains, parallel computing, and surrogate modeling to develop efficient computational methods for this computationally intensive modeling approach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spatio-temporal models have a broad spectrum of applications, and the development of more flexible models is a problem of high priority. The motivation for the models developed under this project comes from an inverse problem in hydrology and a space-time problem from meteorology. The research, that addresses both theoretical and methodological aspects in a Bayesian framework, will develop models that are useful for dealing with multiple scales, a phenomenon encountered in physical processes in both hydrology and meteorology.</AbstractNarration>
