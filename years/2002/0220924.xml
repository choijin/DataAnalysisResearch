<AbstractNarration>This grant provides partial financial support for the 5th CIRP International Workshop on Modeling of Machining Operations to be held at Purdue University (West Lafayette, IN) on May 20-21, 2002. The objective of the proposed workshop is to review the current state of the art and to promote modeling research aligned with industry needs. The workshop program covers three major areas: materials, processes, and performance.  It is planned to have paper sessions, three breakout discussion sessions and a final analysis/discussion session.  The goal of the workshop is to identify existing and future research capabilities for modeling of machining operations. The NSF grant will be used for participation by young researchers/faculty and graduate students and for producing a bound volume of workshop proceedings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop participants will benefit from the paper sessions, focused breakout discussion sessions, and the final discussion.  The industry viewpoint in all planned sessions will provide stimulus for initiating, broadening or redirecting current academic research.  The workshop will provide deeper insights into contemporary research issues providing an opportunity for the exchange of research ideas leading to cooperative research.  The analysis of the breakout session findings will set the direction for future research. A bound volume of the workshop proceedings containing presented papers from the workshop will be produced.  Also, discussion summaries will be made available to all participants.   The academic researchers will have an opportunity to bring the new knowledge into the classroom for teaching, labwork, and for dissemination through seminars, projects, etc.  It is also planned to develop a website containing the proceedings of the workshop including a summary of the final discussion and conclusions.  The list of participants (with their contact information) will also be included to facilitate networking and for the dissemination of new knowledge. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
