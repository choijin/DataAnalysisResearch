    <AbstractNarration>The National Science Foundation began the development of the National Science Digital Library (NSDL) several years ago and it is scheduled to come online this coming year. The NSDL is a connection or system of separate data or information sources. Bringing these disparate sources together is a complex issue, from both the technical perspective and organization dynamics&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will focus on the institutionalization of NSDL from both a technical and contextual perspective. The latter includes such factors as priorities and culture of the participating organizations, how they interact with the technical considerations. A comparative case study will be used, with the internet serving as a comparison, a system that has already been institutionalized and studied. The study will provide an evaluative framework to employ with the NSDL as it is implemented but will be applicable to large-scale IT systems, as well.</AbstractNarration>
