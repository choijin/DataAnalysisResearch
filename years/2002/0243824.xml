<AbstractNarration>The Training and Research Experiences in Nonlinear Dynamics (TREND) REU Site focuses on nonlinear dynamics because of its wide applicability to increasingly important state-of-the-art research areas and because its consideration of simple systems is particularly suited to achieve our goal of involving undergraduates in front-line research. The program is located in the Institute for Research in Electronics and Applied Physics (IREAP) of the University of Maryland, an interdisciplinary center, which brings together faculty from engineering and physical sciences.  The program involves ten students who will spend 11 weeks in the summer on campus involved in research in small teams consisting of undergraduates, graduate students and faculty&lt;br/&gt;advisors. Research projects will be theoretical, experimental or both. Examples of research topics are: theoretical studies of chaos in time and space, experimental studies of patterns in granular media, the development of singularities in fluids and solids, nonlinear dynamics in optical systems, nonlinear dynamics in charged particle beams and devices, and turbulence and nonlinear phenomena in plasmas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A seminar series will be given to complement and reinforce the learning experience.  Students will present the results of their research at a mini-conference at the end of the session. They will also be encouraged to maintain contact with group members to further their research findings and prepare them for publication in journals and presentation at national meetings.  Targeted students are top undergraduates who have completed their sophomore year in the Physical Sciences and Engineering and who are interested in the possibility of a career in research and/or education.  Effort will be made to recruit students from under represented groups and students from schools lacking similar research opportunities.  An equal balance between University of Maryland and non-University of Maryland students will be maintained.  This site is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
