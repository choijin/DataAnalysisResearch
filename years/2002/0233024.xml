    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop and commercialize novel monodisperse ceramic membranes and membrane-reactors. Our innovation is based on self-organized anodic alumina with precisely engineered porous structure and previously unattainable pore size (down to&lt;br/&gt;1 nm or less), greatly enhanced chemical and thermal stability, and superb mechanical properties. Commercially available anodic alumina membranes have limited practical application due to their fragility, susceptibility to acid and base attack, as well as the lack of membranes with pore size smaller than 100 nm for symmetrical membranes. The proposed approach addresses these limitations by combining innovative synthesis of highly ordered nanoporous anodic alumina with symmetrical porosity, conversion of anodic alumina into polycrystalline ceramic while preserving its morphology, and conformal deposition of functional layers. The proposed technology will enable the fine-tuning of the pore diameter in the ranges from below 1 nm to 200 nm. Deposition of materials inside the nanopores will afford desired functionality. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The membranes will target selected applications, such as fuel cell reformers sized for Next Generation Vehicles, integrated mesoscopic power sources for micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS), as well as future portable energy sources.</AbstractNarration>
