<AbstractNarration>Enlightening Lightning!&lt;br/&gt;Coupling Earth Systems Research to K-12 Education&lt;br/&gt;Using Planetarium Presentations&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project introduces students to the foundations of earth and atmospheric processes using planetarium presentations as an out-of-classroom learning milieu.  This project develops a curriculum ensemble on the topic of thunderstorms, with a concentration on lightning. The curriculum targets students in grades 5 through 8 and includes both a multi-media sky-dome program (slides, video, simulations) and companion written and laboratory materials with inquiry-based exercises. These materials are the first in a series of curriculum ensembles (covering climate, weather and the water cycle) for dissemination through planetarium facilities. Learning modules on thunderstorms and lightning are currently available in several formats, including web-based modules, conventional texts, video or film presentations, and as static displays in museums. However, planetarium facilities have typically been by-passed in the development of thunderstorm and lightning curriculum materials. The planetarium environment facilitates demonstration of lightning detection from space, for example, through data collected by NASA's Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission, Lightning Imaging Sensor, and Optical Transient Detector. In addition, field campaigns to validate lightning detection on the ground can be shown and described. Key questions in lightning research can be identified. Participation by faculty and students in diverse academic departments (atmospheric science, physics, education, visualization sciences) as well as at premier research institutions (NSSL) will demonstrably enhance the capacity at all those institutions to be actively engaged in transferring research to education for elementary and secondary students.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
