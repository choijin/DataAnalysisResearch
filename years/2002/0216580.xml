<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A grant has been awarded to Dr. Alexander Fernald and co-principal&lt;br/&gt;investigators Dr. Laurie Abbott, Dr. April Ulery, and Dr. Clint Loest at New&lt;br/&gt;Mexico State University to acquire major research instrumentation to analyze&lt;br/&gt;water, soils, and biomass for environmental research, monitoring and&lt;br/&gt;assessment.  The awarded funds will enable purchase of four research&lt;br/&gt;instruments: 1) a  Flow Injection Analysis System with ion chromatograph for analysis of major cations and anions in water, soils, and biomass; 2)a Nitrogen/Carbon&lt;br/&gt;Analyzer for determination of N and C in soils and biomass; 3)a Laser Diffraction Particle Analyzer for measuring particle size distribution of suspended sediment and soils; and 4) an X-Ray Fluorescence Spectrum Analyzer for analysis of metals in liquids, soils, and biosolids.  The instrumentation will support research that has the goal of&lt;br/&gt;providing information to: 1) reduce negative environmental effects of land use&lt;br/&gt;practices, and 2) enhance quality of natural resources in New Mexico and the&lt;br/&gt;arid Southwest.  Land use impacts on water, soil and biomass threaten&lt;br/&gt;sustainable economic use and ecological health of rangeland, forest,&lt;br/&gt;agriculture, and wildlife in New Mexico.  Water quality is a growing concern&lt;br/&gt;with increasing competition for limited water supplies and decreasing&lt;br/&gt;availability of high quality irrigation and drinking water.  Rapidly growing&lt;br/&gt;dairies in New Mexico generate large amounts of animal waste, and pollution&lt;br/&gt;from confined animal production threatens water and soil resources.  Metal&lt;br/&gt;contamination is a problem in areas of New Mexico with naturally high mineral&lt;br/&gt;occurrence and in areas impacted by mining, military, and agricultural&lt;br/&gt;activities. &lt;br/&gt;As a minority-serving land grant institution, the mission of New Mexico State&lt;br/&gt;University is to conduct meaningful research, to educate and train scientists,&lt;br/&gt;and to extend information to the citizens of the state.  The state-of-the-art&lt;br/&gt;instrumentation will provide a leap forward in the ability of university&lt;br/&gt;investigators to conduct needed environmental research and fulfill the mission&lt;br/&gt;to educate.  The instrumentation will initially support the research activities&lt;br/&gt;of four investigators, faculty in three departments, and federal researchers. &lt;br/&gt;It will be used to train graduate and undergraduate students in the use of the&lt;br/&gt;instruments as part of their research.  Obtaining this equipment will increase&lt;br/&gt;NMSU competitiveness for future grant proposals.  The equipment will support&lt;br/&gt;research to provide critical information that will allow agencies, communities,&lt;br/&gt;and individuals to participate in meaningful and sustainable programs that&lt;br/&gt;reduce negative environmental effects of land use practices and that enhance&lt;br/&gt;the quality of water, soil and biomass resources.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
