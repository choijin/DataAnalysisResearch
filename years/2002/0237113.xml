<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;The theory of NP Completeness has shown that several naturally&lt;br/&gt;occurring problems are unlikely to have polynomial time&lt;br/&gt;algorithms. One approach to overcome this fundamental intractability&lt;br/&gt;for optimization problems has been to shift the focus from exact&lt;br/&gt;solutions to obtaining approximate solutions. The study of&lt;br/&gt;approximation algorithms has thus emerged as a rich and exciting field&lt;br/&gt;and recent advances have led to good approximation algorithms for&lt;br/&gt;several fundamental optimization problems. Despite these developments,&lt;br/&gt;several interesting and difficult open problems remain. A primary&lt;br/&gt;focus of this career development plan is studying the approximability&lt;br/&gt;of fundamental problems and attempting to close such gaps in our&lt;br/&gt;understanding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broad research goals of this career development plan are the&lt;br/&gt;following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Developing new tools to devise approximation algorithms &lt;br/&gt;for problems on directed graphs.&lt;br/&gt;2. Developing new techniques for metric approximations and &lt;br/&gt;embeddings as building blocks for approximation.&lt;br/&gt;3. Investigating a systematic way to obtain and exploit&lt;br/&gt;strengthened SDPs as well as the use of strengthened SDPs for &lt;br/&gt;graph partitioning minimization problems and ordering problems.&lt;br/&gt;4. Devise techniques to deal with scheduling problems with&lt;br/&gt;precedence constraints.&lt;br/&gt;5. Extend the machinery of approximation algorithms to new&lt;br/&gt;settings such as information theoretic and algebraic problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research program will involve students at all levels, from&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate projects on understanding the quality of LP and SDP&lt;br/&gt;relaxations through computational experiments, to the mathematical&lt;br/&gt;research suitable for Ph.D. students. The educational component of&lt;br/&gt;this project includes the development of courses geared towards&lt;br/&gt;disseminating new algorithmic ideas outside the theoretical computer&lt;br/&gt;science community; the techniques developed in the latest research&lt;br/&gt;will be distilled into new graduate and undergraduate courses.  Course&lt;br/&gt;materials developed for such new courses will be made freely available&lt;br/&gt;to enable similar courses to be taught elsewhere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
