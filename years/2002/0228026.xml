<AbstractNarration>The atmospheric tides are global scale oscillations in the basic state of the Earths atmosphere (winds, temperature and density) that are forced in the lower-atmosphere and propagate vertically into the upper atmosphere and ionosphere. Over the past decade basic understanding of the migrating atmospheric tides has emerged, largely from an increase in the number of ground-based observatories across the globe making wind and temperature measurements of the mesosphere- and lower-thermosphere (MLT) roughly between 70 and 120km. The continuing increase in the availability of observational data from ground and space based instruments is providing atmospheric scientists with the opportunity to improve their theoretical understanding of the mechanisms that drive atmospheric tides. This is accomplished through a process that includes both numerical models and observational data. The basic approach for this research is to use the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM) that has been under development at the National Center for Atmospheric Research. WACCM is a fully nonlinear, four-dimensional global circulation model of the atmosphere spanning from the surface to an altitude of 140km. Analysis of WACCM results will be compared with the global network of MLT observations, including those from the recently launched TIMED spacecraft, to validate the tidal and planetary wave structure simulated by the model. Once validated, the model will be utilized to estimate the affect of global scale planetary waves on the structure of the atmospheric tides.</AbstractNarration>
