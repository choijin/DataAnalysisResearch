<AbstractNarration>AST 0206016&lt;br/&gt;Lowenthal, J D&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will investigate the evolution of starforming galaxies over cosmological lookback times by conducting deep, detailed studies of distant galaxies in the optical and&lt;br/&gt;near-IR wavebands. The primary scientific goals are to fill in the redshift gap for field&lt;br/&gt;galaxies between redshifts z = 1 and z = 2 (with lookback times of more than half the age of the Universe) and to establish detailed connections between star-forming galaxies in the early Universe and nearby galaxies today, especially by directly constraining the masses of distant systems. The project will build on an ongoing study of luminous, compact, star-forming galaxies at 2 &lt; z &lt; 5. The specific goal is to study Lyman break galaxies in detail, searching especially for clues to their masses, which are essential for placing the Lyman break galaxies in the proper context of galaxy formation and evolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
