    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project concerns the development of an electrochemical-based array nondestructive testing and evaluation (NDE) system for the detection of corrosion at the microscale level. Formation of small flaws of a destructive nature results during corrosion of a number of engineering metals and alloys used in transportation, microelectronics, electrical power production, and hazardous waste containment. The stability of these materials is determined by the extent to which a high integrity passive oxide film forms and is retained during continuous exposure to the ambient environment. Localized corrosion due to breakdown in these oxide films is responsible for limiting the lifetime of components made from these materials. The key to avoid flaw formation in engineering metals and alloys is the detection of early stages of corrosion. The proposed technology will provide spatially resolved information on the corrosion process at the microscale level as well as information on corrosion rates. The fabrication and test of a lab-scale electrochemical array-based corrosion sensor will be carried out during the Phase I project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are large potential commercial applications for this technology in various industries, such as aerospace (defense and commercial), marine and automotive industries, electric utility plants, chemical processing plants, refineries, microelectronics, electrical power production, and hazardous waste containment.</AbstractNarration>
