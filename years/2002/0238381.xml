<AbstractNarration>This project exploits the CORBA middleware standard as a vehicle for&lt;br/&gt;exploring the composition of real-time and fault tolerance for&lt;br/&gt;distributed middleware applications.  Although the initial approach&lt;br/&gt;will apply to CORBA, the results will be applicable to other&lt;br/&gt;middleware, such as Java.  The primary scientific contributions of&lt;br/&gt;this project are the description of the precise trade-offs that occur&lt;br/&gt;when both real-time and fault tolerance support are required for a&lt;br/&gt;middleware application, along with an architecture and strategies that&lt;br/&gt;can be used to resolve these trade-offs. The primary technical&lt;br/&gt;contributions of the project are a new set of practices and algorithms&lt;br/&gt;for building real-time fault-tolerant systems, and tools for&lt;br/&gt;sanitizing non-determinism in middleware applications, with the aim of&lt;br/&gt;meeting both real-time predictability and fault-tolerant consistency&lt;br/&gt;requirements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project furthers our technical understanding of the precise&lt;br/&gt;trade-offs and complex interactions between ``-ilities'' such as&lt;br/&gt;real-time and fault tolerance, thereby helping to reduce the number of&lt;br/&gt;proprietary brittle systems that continue to be built.  The project&lt;br/&gt;has the potential to influence the state of the art and the&lt;br/&gt;state of the practice, enabling future COTS-based mission-critical&lt;br/&gt;applications to be developed with simultaneous real-time and&lt;br/&gt;fault-tolerant support.  Recognizing that applications vary in their&lt;br/&gt;dependability needs, this project is unique in that it provides&lt;br/&gt;mechanisms to mix-and-match the different fault tolerance mechanisms&lt;br/&gt;in a manner that allows for the customization of the system's&lt;br/&gt;perceived dependability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through participation in organizations such as the Object Management&lt;br/&gt;Group, the results of this project will be made available to harden&lt;br/&gt;ongoing and future standards on fault tolerance and real-time for&lt;br/&gt;middleware. Elements of this project will be incorporated into&lt;br/&gt;curricula in order to expose students to the cross-cutting concerns of&lt;br/&gt;both reliability and real-time.  Students who are exposed to not just&lt;br/&gt;one ``-ility'', but to the conflicts and trade-offs between multiple&lt;br/&gt;``-ilities'', will make better and more discriminating software/system&lt;br/&gt;architects who can be entrusted to build the mission-critical systems&lt;br/&gt;of the future.</AbstractNarration>
