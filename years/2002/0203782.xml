<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to develop parallel algorithms and a parallel software system for clustering Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs). ESTs are derived from fragments of reverse transcribed mRNA isolated experimentally and thus directly correspond to protein coding genes. The proposed project is aimed at overcoming the computational limitations of current software  systems such as inability to handle large data sets within  reasonable time and memory resources. This project will provide a strong context for fundamental research in practical parallel  string algorithms, including the development of parallel algorithms for constructing suffix trees and suffix arrays, applications  involving suffix trees and arrays such as containment and  overlap detection. Particular emphasis will be placed on the design of space-efficient algorithms because space-complexity  often determines whether the use of an algorithm is feasible for large data sets. The software will be validated using large EST  data sets from organisms with small and known genomes, which  will be exploited to derive correct clustering though alternate  methods. The algorithms developed will provide the basis for other similar projects including protein repertoire comparisons and testing of biological hypotheses such as exon shuffling and gene duplication. The human EST collection at the National Institute of Health currently has over 3.8 million ESTs and parallel processing is essential for discovering biologically useful information from such large EST collections.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Throughout the project, emphasis will be placed on design of parallel algorithms using realistic models of parallel computation, rigorous proofs of optimality with respect to best known sequential algorithms, careful evaluation of the communication complexity and the constants involved in asymptotic run-time estimates, and development of user-friendly software. Experimental evaluation of the algorithms will be carried out both on conventional tightly-coupled parallel computers and clusters. The project will be carried out by an interdisciplinary team of researchers having the required expertise in parallel algorithm design, building large parallel software systems, bioinformatics and life sciences. To further ensure the success of this project, collaborations have been established with researchers from the University of Bielefeld and the National Institute of Health. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
