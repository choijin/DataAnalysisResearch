<AbstractNarration>Funding is requested for a three year program that will: 1) complete&lt;br/&gt;development of a small-scale, portable solid-state retrodirective wireless&lt;br/&gt;power transmission (WPT) demonstration system; 2) use the solid-state phased&lt;br/&gt;array transmitter and rectenna (rectifier + antenna) developed in task 1 for&lt;br/&gt;ground testing to determine the phase control of the transmitter. This&lt;br/&gt;program will provide a path for the first US non-laboratory demonstration of&lt;br/&gt;beamed power in which the transmitted beam will be controlled by a pilot beam&lt;br/&gt;from the receiving antenna (a retrodirective system). The program will&lt;br/&gt;demonstrate key components of an integrated microwave wireless power&lt;br/&gt;transmission system: a phased array transmitter, rectifying receiving antenna&lt;br/&gt;(rectenna) and the retrodirective control system. The transmitter will&lt;br/&gt;operate at a frequency of 5.8 GHz and will consist of 4 panels, which will&lt;br/&gt;allow beam steering in two dimensions. The array will consist of 640&lt;br/&gt;elements, arranged in 10 subarrays with 64 elements in each subarray.&lt;br/&gt;Microstrip patch antenna will be used for low cost fabrication, lightweight,&lt;br/&gt;planar structure, and good performance. The patch antennas will be located on&lt;br/&gt;one side of the ground plane and the microwave and electronic circuits will&lt;br/&gt;be on the other side. The signals are coupled from the circuits to antenna&lt;br/&gt;elements through equal-phase microstrips. The distributing microstrip&lt;br/&gt;circuits and power dividers are fed by a coaxial line connected to the center&lt;br/&gt;of the subarray. The beam control subsystem will use photonics to distribute&lt;br/&gt;reference phase information. A circular polarized rectenna will be&lt;br/&gt;constructed. Since the power density level at the rectenna array will be&lt;br/&gt;fairly low for the proposed experiment, techniques using low breakdown&lt;br/&gt;voltage diodes or multi-antenna rectenna elements per diode will be&lt;br/&gt;investigated. The ability of the retrodirective phase control system to&lt;br/&gt;maintain tight beam steering can be measured by the use of simple receivers&lt;br/&gt;located around the rectenna. The measured performance will be compared with&lt;br/&gt;theoretical predictions for error sources (phase jitter, phase bias,&lt;br/&gt;mechanical misalignment, and amplitude variations) systematically introduced&lt;br/&gt;into the system. Beam patterns including side lobes and grating lobes will be&lt;br/&gt;measured.&lt;br/&gt;The project will provide a practical demonstration of wireless power&lt;br/&gt;transmission as an enabling technology for space solar power for both&lt;br/&gt;terrestrial and extraterrestrial application. The program will be coordinated&lt;br/&gt;and managed by the Center for Space Power (CSP) at Texas A&amp;M University&lt;br/&gt;(TAMU) and conducted by a team that includes researchers from the Department&lt;br/&gt;of Electrical Engineering and the Johnson Space Center (JSC). NASA support&lt;br/&gt;for this program will include laboratory and test facilities at NASA Johnson&lt;br/&gt;Space Center.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
