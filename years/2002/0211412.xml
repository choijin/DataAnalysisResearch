<AbstractNarration>     The investigators consider a general system of nonlinear&lt;br/&gt;nonlocal hyperbolic equations describing the dynamics of several&lt;br/&gt;interacting populations.  The goal of the project is to develop&lt;br/&gt;theories on the existence-uniqueness, long-time behavior, and&lt;br/&gt;numerical approximation of solutions to the hyperbolic system.  A&lt;br/&gt;combination of analytical and numerical methods is used to&lt;br/&gt;understand the dynamics of the complex proposed model.  To study&lt;br/&gt;existence and uniqueness of solutions to this system, two major&lt;br/&gt;approaches are adopted.  The first approach to study the&lt;br/&gt;well-posedness of solutions is via the finite difference method&lt;br/&gt;used for classical conservation laws.  The second approach to&lt;br/&gt;investigate the well-posedness and long-time behavior of&lt;br/&gt;solutions is based on the monotone approximation and comparison&lt;br/&gt;results that have been successfully established for the&lt;br/&gt;semilinear case by the investigators.  Although similar approaches&lt;br/&gt;have been used in studying other nonlinear partial differential&lt;br/&gt;equation models, their applications to special cases of the&lt;br/&gt;general nonlinear and nonlocal model considered in this project&lt;br/&gt;have only been carried out by the investigators.  In addition, a&lt;br/&gt;numerical methodology is developed for an inverse problem&lt;br/&gt;governed by the proposed nonlinear nonlocal system of equations.&lt;br/&gt;It uses a connection between real data and the model to estimate&lt;br/&gt;unknown parameters.  Meanwhile, a numerical package is developed&lt;br/&gt;for simulating the proposed model.&lt;br/&gt;     Many populations and their interactions with the environment&lt;br/&gt;have been modeled using the structured population approach, where&lt;br/&gt;the structures of interest are induced by internal&lt;br/&gt;characteristics such as age or size.  For example, size-structured&lt;br/&gt;population models with distributed rates have been successfully&lt;br/&gt;used to describe the dynamics of mosquitofish in California rice&lt;br/&gt;fields.  The structured population approach has also been used to&lt;br/&gt;model the dynamics of hierarchically structured populations in&lt;br/&gt;which the differences between individuals have a direct effect on&lt;br/&gt;the availability of resources.  Another application is the&lt;br/&gt;predator-prey interaction between zooplankton and phytoplankton&lt;br/&gt;within the context of algal aggregation.  Generally speaking, in&lt;br/&gt;order to analyze, manage, and control the dynamics of a&lt;br/&gt;population, it is necessary to understand the interactions&lt;br/&gt;between the population evolution and its environment.  In this&lt;br/&gt;project, the investigators study a general structured population&lt;br/&gt;model.  Due to its complexity, a combination of analytical and&lt;br/&gt;numerical methods is developed to investigate the dynamics of&lt;br/&gt;such a population.  In particular, a numerical package to simulate&lt;br/&gt;the proposed model is provided.  Furthermore, certain techniques&lt;br/&gt;are introduced to estimate the growth and mortality for&lt;br/&gt;individuals within the population from field data.  Because of the&lt;br/&gt;generality of the proposed model, the results help to answer&lt;br/&gt;questions about nonlinear phenomena in population dynamics.  In&lt;br/&gt;addition, the resulting numerical method can be used by&lt;br/&gt;population biologists to investigate the dynamical behavior of&lt;br/&gt;general population models.</AbstractNarration>
