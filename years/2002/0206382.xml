<AbstractNarration>The Science Museum of Minnesota would like to create a network of partnerships between the museum and small community-based science organizations (CBSOs).  CBSOs will receive professional development workshops to increase their capacity to produce high quality exhibits and publications and offer effective science programming.  A team from each science organization will participate in a 12-hour skills development workshop to cover such topics as exhibit development, audience research, science communication and program development.  A workshop "tool kit" will capture the essence of the training workshops and be made available to other museums.  Each team will develop a small traveling exhibit and supporting materials.  Annual Science Summit programs will showcase the CBSOs to the general public, museum visitors and students, while a CBSO Roundtable will invite the participants to explore collaborations and programming strategies.  An online database will be created and a complimentary printed resource guide of all local CBSOs will be available to the public.  The model will be tested at two small science centers, the Kirby Science Discovery Center in Sioux Falls, SD, and at the Headwaters Science Center in Bemidji, MN.  It is anticipated that 72 organizations and 450 CBSO staff members will be served by this project, in addition to over 5,000 members of the general public.</AbstractNarration>
