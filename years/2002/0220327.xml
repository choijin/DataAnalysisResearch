<AbstractNarration>The project proposes to formulate methods for representing and analyzing random&lt;br/&gt;heterogeneous materials in three directions. First, general probabilistic models are developed&lt;br/&gt;for the microstructure of cement based composites with carbon fibers. The models&lt;br/&gt;are random fields characterizing the geometrical, mechanical, and electrical properties of the&lt;br/&gt;material constituents. These cement based composites have an interesting microstructure,&lt;br/&gt;and are used in both mechanics and electronics as sensors of mechanical properties. Second,&lt;br/&gt;a computational environment is developed for calculating the evolution in time of the&lt;br/&gt;properties of microstructures subjected to deterministic loads. Finite element procedures&lt;br/&gt;are used to calculate changes in, for example, the stress, strain, damage and electric fields&lt;br/&gt;in cement based composite specimens generated from their probabilistic models. Development&lt;br/&gt;of the finite element code entails advances in numerical solver techniques as well as&lt;br/&gt;formulation of new mathematically sound traction-displacment relationships to model cohesive&lt;br/&gt;fracture. Third, the results of the finite element analyses are used to (i) update&lt;br/&gt;the probabilistic models of the material microstructure so they reflect the current damage&lt;br/&gt;state and (ii) develop macroscopic damage models for cement based composites by using&lt;br/&gt;homogenization procedures.&lt;br/&gt;The evolution of the material state is monitored by a mathematical object, referred&lt;br/&gt;to as digital material (DM), that defines uniquely the state of the microstructure at any&lt;br/&gt;time during loading and can be stored in the computer. The results of the analytical and&lt;br/&gt;numerical developments are validated against experimental tests providing information of&lt;br/&gt;the properties of the fiber matrix interaction and on the dependence of electric conductivity&lt;br/&gt;of macroscopic specimens on their damage state.&lt;br/&gt;The main outcome of the project is a novel methodology for predicting structural behavior&lt;br/&gt;of composite materials and for designing materials with better structural properties&lt;br/&gt;and better capabilities for sensing damage and strain. Other outcomes include new finite&lt;br/&gt;element codes, new mathematical models, and a strong educational outreach program.</AbstractNarration>
