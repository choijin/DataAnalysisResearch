<AbstractNarration>PROPOSAL NO.: 0230588&lt;br/&gt;PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Pickett, Mark&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION NAME: University of Toledo&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: BEST: Bridging Engineering and Science Teachin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BEST: Bridging Engineering and Science Teaching&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to improve the education of Education and Engineering students, while&lt;br/&gt;simultaneously engaging Engineering and Education faculty in a collaboration that employs the best&lt;br/&gt;available pedagogy. The project will develop lower level engineering courses that utilize the strengths of&lt;br/&gt;both faculties. The result of this collaboration will be engineering courses that are more attractive to a&lt;br/&gt;diverse range of students and the development of high school teachers who appreciate engineering design&lt;br/&gt;and encourage their students to explore applied science design issues and careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this planning grant, an inquiry-based pilot course in structural design will be used to explore&lt;br/&gt;the role of an Engineering-Education collaboration in improving engineering education. A second-year&lt;br/&gt;course, ioIntroduction to Structural Designlr, will be planned and taught. It will be accessible for Secondary&lt;br/&gt;Education majors while maintaining the necessary technical content for Engineering students. The course&lt;br/&gt;will provide the rudiments of structural design for Education majors and lower-level Engineering students.&lt;br/&gt;Students completing the course will participate in jointly taught coursework, will learn both technical&lt;br/&gt;content and educational methods, and will be prepared for higher-level coursework within their major. The&lt;br/&gt;collaborators will develop a general methodology for team-teaching of modified engineering content that&lt;br/&gt;can be employed throughout the curriculum in a series of courses to provide content for Education students.&lt;br/&gt;If the first course is successful, a detailed plan for further collaboration including other collaborative&lt;br/&gt;courses, possibly involving local engineering projects, will be developed.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
