<AbstractNarration>Today's industry garment manufacturing employees are seriously deficient in the needed math skills for quality control inspection, costing, data analysis, pattern-making, pattern grading, calculating piece work payments, and many other processes. The educational level of math skills of workers is not sufficient to carry out the tasks. Partly this is due to an immigrant work force and partly due to the misperception that the apparel industry is "fashion" rather than technically oriented. The lack of these skills leads to ineffective work processes because of repeated operations and lack of quality measures. This project develops, applies, and assesses mathematical curriculum modules as applied in manufacturing; specifically apparel manufacturing.  While the development of such curricula is not new, math concepts are  being created for an industrial setting where such a direct application is strongly needed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Teaching Factory allows educators to test theoretical materials and disseminate these materials to students in the apparel production program. This project uses educational resources to solve industrial problems at a core level. The success of the technical assistance, train-the-trainer, supervisory training, and modular training programs are founded in an understanding of and commitment to workplace and workforce development. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The math modules developed are implemented in credit classes (apparel production, pattern making, CAD/CAM), at nearby community college and university classes (fashion merchandising, apparel technology), and in some non-credit classes (introduction to manufacturing, time study, supervisory training) held at the Teaching Factory.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
