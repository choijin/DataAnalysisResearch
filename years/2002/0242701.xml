<AbstractNarration>The Molecular Logic project is designed to improve the ability of all students to understand fundamental biological phenomena in terms of the interactions of atoms and molecules.  The project does this by enhancing biology courses with guided explorations of powerful atomic and molecular computational models.  These models are embedded in eight modules that are linked both to standards and to typical textbooks, and they are easily implemented in diverse educational settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The models are designed to cover basic science concepts using an approach that is accurate, grade-appropriate, and accessible to students with different learning styles.  Exploration of the models requires problem solving and fosters critical thinking.  Collaboration around model-based challenges is used to strengthen student communication skills.  The associated materials provide connections to technology, engineering, social questions and scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Computational models are central to the project.  The models are also available at no cost online as hybrid materials that include text and additional computational resources.  Student assessment is embedded.  Teacher professional development and ongoing support are provided online.  An advisory board of scientists, teachers and researchers helps oversee and guide the project.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
