    <AbstractNarration>The International Symbiosis Society based at Boston University requests support for the&lt;br/&gt;planning and convening of its next scientific research Congress set for August 17 - 23,&lt;br/&gt;2003 at Saint Mary's University, Halifax, Nova Scotia. Five hundred participants are expected, most working in specific symbiotic systems such as mycorrhizae-plant interactions, endophytic fungi and grasses, nitrogen fixing bacteria/cyanobacteria and their hosts, hermatypic corals and dinoflagellates, lichens, insect and rumen gut microfauna, Azolla/Oryza sativa growth enhancement, and orchid ecology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Keynote speakers/leaders for the symposia include David Read, U. of Sussex, UK;&lt;br/&gt;Birgitta Bergman, Stockholm U.; Margaret McFall-Ngai, U. of Hawaii; Angela Douglas,York&lt;br/&gt;U., UK; Jan Sapp, U. of Montreal; Lynn Margulis, U. of Massachusetts; and Ove&lt;br/&gt;Hoegh-Guldberg, Queensland U., Australia, among others. Congress organizers are Society&lt;br/&gt;President Douglas Zook biologist and science educator at Boston University and who is the&lt;br/&gt;P.I., and David Richardson, Dean of Science and lichenologist at Saint Mary's University,&lt;br/&gt;Halifax.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Society is particularly unique in that it by its very nature it builds bridges&lt;br/&gt;among biologists/ecologists who would otherwise remain separated. Therefore, the main&lt;br/&gt;objective of the Congress is to provide a special world forum where symbiologists can&lt;br/&gt;optimally exchange knowledge and ideas. Also, its dialogue and outcomes will contribute to&lt;br/&gt;a greater understanding of global ecology, regional ecosystem function, and cell biology;&lt;br/&gt;encourage involvement in ecology in general and symbiosis in particular by students; and,&lt;br/&gt;actively promote content and curriculum enhancement in symbiosis for both pre-college and&lt;br/&gt;university teachers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A focus theme of the Congress will be global threats to keystone symbionts, such as&lt;br/&gt;bleaching of zooxanthellae, lichen susceptibility to sulfur dioxide and related emissions,&lt;br/&gt;and the demise of larger symbiont-containing foraminifera. This theme further emphasizes&lt;br/&gt;the deep but often ignored role symbiosis plays in earth systems and human society.&lt;br/&gt;Agriculture, forestry, biome establishment, restoration ecology, coral reef existence, and&lt;br/&gt;fundamental understandings of the eukarya cell are all substantiually dependent on&lt;br/&gt;symbiosis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More then fifty per cent of the funds for the Congress will be covered by registrant&lt;br/&gt;fees and some projected private corporate support. The ISS seeks additional support from&lt;br/&gt;the NSF to help defray travel costs for graduate students; to provide travel and related&lt;br/&gt;support for featured speakers; to assist teacher attendance and support a symbiosis&lt;br/&gt;teacher workshop at the Congress; and to cover costs of key publications, such as special&lt;br/&gt;editions of the ISS newsletter, Symbiosis International, which will highlight Congress&lt;br/&gt;announcements, conference schedule booklet, and the Congress abstract book.&lt;br/&gt;Ongoing post-Congress contact will be mainained through a web exchange network on the&lt;br/&gt;ISS web sites (Congress web site is http://people.bu.edu/dzook/), and selected papers from&lt;br/&gt;the Congress will be published during 2004 in a special issue of the ISS affiliated&lt;br/&gt;journal, Symbiosis, published out of Tel Aviv.</AbstractNarration>
