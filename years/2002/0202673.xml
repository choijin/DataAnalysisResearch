<AbstractNarration>0202673&lt;br/&gt;Bixby&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The International Research Fellowship Program enables U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-four months of research abroad.  The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support an eight-month research fellowship to be done over two years by Dr. Rebecca J. Bixby working with Drs. Jose Vargas and Pedro Leon and Dr. Ursula Wydrzycka at Universidad de Costa Rica and Universidad Nacional respectively, in Costa Rica.  Support for this project is provided by the Americas Program of the Office of International Science and Engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of this project are to investigate biodiversity and community structure of attached algae (periphyton) in tropical streams at La Selva Biological Station, located in lowlands on Costa Rica's northern Caribbean slope.  No detailed taxonomic studies of algae have been conducted at La Selva.  This work will build upon ongoing ecological studies of streams at this site (and adjacent environs), funded through NSF's LTREB&lt;br/&gt;Program.  Seasonal, qualitative surveys will focus on microhabitats, sampling substrates such as plants, sediment, and rocks.  Taxonomic studies from collections will result in detailed taxa lists including new species.  Quantitative samples will be taken from colonized tiles incubated for a month in streams along a phosphorus gradient.  These collections will be analyzed for community structure and correlated with solute concentrations.  Results from this comparative study are expected to show shifts in community structure and diversity with varying phosphorus levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Vargas is an aquatic biologist.  Dr. Leon is chair of the Organization of Tropical Studies' Board of Directors and has worked at La Selva.  Dr. Wydrzycka is a botany faculty member working on Costa Rican algae.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
