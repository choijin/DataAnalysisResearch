    <AbstractNarration>The continuation of NSF supported research on the DR of N2+ is proposed. Values for the DR rate coefficients of the lowest three vibrational levels of N2+ , calculated under prior support using theoretical quantum chemical methods, will be improved by including core excited Rydberg states in the calculation of the rate coefficients. For the excited vibrational levels, these will be the first results for the total DR rate coefficients. Additional electronic widths will be calculated in order to compute the rate coefficients for DR of the fourth and fifth vibrational levels. The atomic products of DR can be in excited electronic states. The calculation of the yields of ground and excited state atoms using wave packet methods will be carried out. The yields will be calculated as a function of ion vibrational level and electron and rotational temperatures. Because of a lack of data, vibrational excitation and deexcitation reactions have been ignored in ionospheric models. However, theoretical work indicates that the rate coefficients for vibrational change may be competitive with those for DR. If so, these reactions will be of the greatest importance to aeronomic models. The first theoretical studies of electron impact state to state vibrational change in N2+ will be done. These reactions can proceed by using the same intermediate states as those involved in DR reactions. State to state rate coefficients will be calculated for vibrational change within the ion ground state and for excitation from the ion ground state to two low lying excited electronic states. There are no experimental measurements of these state to state rate coefficients.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All the results developed under this project will be made available on the internet and published in scientific journals.</AbstractNarration>
