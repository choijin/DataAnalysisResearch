<AbstractNarration>This project develops time-domain solvers for wave propagation problems&lt;br/&gt;in two and three dimensions, with fundamentally improved properties,&lt;br/&gt;namely, significantly  reduced sampling requirements and, at the same time,&lt;br/&gt;significantly higher accuracy. Such solvers would allow modeling of linear and, eventually, nonlinear&lt;br/&gt;wave propagation in domains that are thousands of characteristic wavelengths&lt;br/&gt;in size, with interfaces and variable coefficients.&lt;br/&gt;This approach would also provide improved bases for solving&lt;br/&gt;nonlinear advection-diffusion problems.  The solvers are built upon two&lt;br/&gt;new techniques, namely, optimal quadratures to represent bandlimited functions, and a numerical generalization of separation of variables to accelerate applying higher-dimensional operators.  Each&lt;br/&gt;technique contains the potential to significantly advance computational&lt;br/&gt;science across a wide range of applications.  Together they provide a&lt;br/&gt;new paradigm that efficiently organizes the information contained in&lt;br/&gt;operators governing physical phenomena.  This project develops these techniques&lt;br/&gt;further, and develops multiresolution representations for operators and&lt;br/&gt;functions, based on the optimal quadratures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Any computational modeling of natural phenomena requires discretization&lt;br/&gt;of the underlying mathematical equations. This project addresses questions of&lt;br/&gt;optimality and efficiency of such discretizations, and of organization&lt;br/&gt;o information for two important modeling areas, wave propagation and&lt;br/&gt;geophysical fluid dynamics.  This research aims to generate a much wider use of&lt;br/&gt;efficient techniques for representing information in scientific modeling, and to&lt;br/&gt;increase the speed and accuracy of simulations by up to two orders of magnitude,&lt;br/&gt;with foreseeable benefits to such areas as seismology, remote sensing,&lt;br/&gt;acoustics, optics, geophysical fluid dynamics, and quantum chemistry. It would&lt;br/&gt;reduce the computational cost of obtaining high accuracy, which is necessary to&lt;br/&gt;describe phenomena that are highly sensitive to changes in physical&lt;br/&gt;parameters, and that often cause technological bottlenecks.&lt;br/&gt;This Collaborative Research is led by the Department of Applied&lt;br/&gt;Mathematics at the University of Colorado at Boulder, and includes the Department of&lt;br/&gt;Meteorology at the University of Maryland at College Park.  It will fund&lt;br/&gt;one research associate, two visiting scientists from UMD and Ohio&lt;br/&gt;University, and one graduate student in a diverse research group that includes a&lt;br/&gt;research associate, two postdoctoral researchers, a graduate student, and four&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
