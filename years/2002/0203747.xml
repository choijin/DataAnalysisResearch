<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0203747&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Kitty L. Holland&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Holland's proposed work centers on applying the Hrushovski-style&lt;br/&gt;amalgamation technique to produce novel examples of omega-stable&lt;br/&gt;structures.  Together with Baldwin, Holland is engaged in an&lt;br/&gt;attempt to use this technique to produce a bad field.  Holland's&lt;br/&gt;work toward this end has produced algebro-geometric results of&lt;br/&gt;independent interest on the relationship between transcendence&lt;br/&gt;degree and multiplicative group rank in characteristic zero&lt;br/&gt;fields.  Holland proposes to exploit this work to complete the&lt;br/&gt;bad field project with Baldwin and to extend the&lt;br/&gt;algebro-geometric results.  She further proposes to settle&lt;br/&gt;stability questions for certain structures produced by the&lt;br/&gt;technique; to analyze the geometries of structures produced by&lt;br/&gt;the technique and to extend her joint work with Baldwin toward an&lt;br/&gt;abstract model theoretic analysis of the technique and its&lt;br/&gt;products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since its introduction in the early 90s, Hrushovski's&lt;br/&gt;amalgamation technique has been applied with great success to&lt;br/&gt;settle a variety of old existence conjectures central to&lt;br/&gt;algebraic model theory.  Holland's ambition, embodied in this&lt;br/&gt;proposal, is threefold: To continue breaking new ground in&lt;br/&gt;application of the technique, to explore the limitations of the&lt;br/&gt;technique by characterizing common properties of its products,&lt;br/&gt;and to make the technique more widely and efficiently applicable&lt;br/&gt;by extracting common difficulties arising in its implementation&lt;br/&gt;and dealing with them uniformly on an abstract level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Holland's proposed work centers on applying the Hrushovski-style&lt;br/&gt;amalgamation technique to produce novel examples of omega-stable&lt;br/&gt;structures.
