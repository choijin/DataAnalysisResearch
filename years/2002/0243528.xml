    <AbstractNarration>0243528&lt;br/&gt;Bergh&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The submitted proposal is to request funds from the National Science Foundation in &lt;br/&gt;support of organizing the Optoelectronics Industry Development Association's (OIDA) 2002 Annual Forum. The object is to share information between academic researchers and industrialists, thus leading to timely feedback between the participants that will lead to increased industrially related fundamental research. This integrated approach will ensure seamless exchange and optimal fulfillment of the needs of both industry and academia. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NSF, DARPA, and OIDA will jointly sponsor the OIDA annual forum for the purpose of discussing industrial trends and needs, new technology breakthroughs and public policies with an audience consisting of industrialists, government policymakers and academia. This extensive exchange of information will promote a smooth transition of technologies, adaptation of policies to meet the real needs of both industries and academia. In addition, students in training will be given an early vision of their possible careers.</AbstractNarration>
