<AbstractNarration>This project studies the effects of organizational learning through experimentation on firm performance and on the success of the firm's product portfolio. The research methods take a much finer grained view of the relationship between portfolio structure and performance. Builds on two existing knowledge streams in a novel way, the central hypothesis is that portfolios that contain too much innovation may result in organizations that are less successful, i.e., that some organizations may be too innovative and thus suffer problems. By rigorously controlling for external contexts, which have never before been controlled for in portfolio analysis, this research has the potential to uncover significant relationships that have eluded previous researchers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Past research suggests that innovative firms outperform their competitors, measured in terms of market share, profitability, growth and/or market capitalization, but research has not examined how best to balance the product portfolio mix in terms of innovativeness. A portfolio approach to innovation creates both variety and redundancy, which in turn allow flexible responses in the face of uncertainty. While a portfolio approach to innovation sounds good in theory, making it happen in practice is reputedly not simple. This project proposes to study the effects on firm performance of product portfolio innovativeness and the moderating role of external market characteristics. Intelligent failure through experimentation is argued to be the foundation of learning that creates forward momentum in innovation. Experimentation in innovation is a key sense-making and feedback mechanism that drives organizational learning. Though past research has not examined how organizational learning through experimentation drives product portfolio innovativeness and firm performance, a successful product portfolio likely builds progressively (in steps or leaps) from an accumulation of learning resulting from experimentation and the development of new knowledge that transfers to all products in the portfolio. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research program consists of three distinct phases. Phase 1 will involve qualitative research with six industry experts across a variety of industries to ensure the completeness, validity, and generalizability of the conceptual model and measures. Phase 2 will involve an empirical study in conjunction with Theatre Communications Group (TCG). The purpose of the empirical study will be to collect objective and subjective measures for the focal constructs and test the conceptual model. Based on prior research with TCG, participation of more than 120 of the largest professional theatres in the United States is expected. Phase 3 will involve sharing the study results with the six industry experts to inform inferences and explore the generalizability of the results. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
