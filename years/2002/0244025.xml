<AbstractNarration>The Summer Molecular Research Experience for Students Underrepresented in Science will provide an intensive 10-week research experience at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City.  A total of 10 students will be selected to participate.  Students who come from underrepresented backgrounds and from institutions with limited research opportunities are especially well served in this program.  Students will receive a stipend of $3000 for 10 weeks of full time research, as well as room and board at the newly constructed student housing which was used as the Olympic Village during the 2002 Winter Olympics.  Travel expenses to the University of Utah will be covered. Students accepted to the Program will have the opportunity to choose from a wide variety of projects that employ molecular techniques.  A few potential projects are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Paternity tests for birds. Techniques include DNA extraction and microsatellite-based paternity analysis.&lt;br/&gt;Phylogenetics of chemical defenses in tropical trees.  Techniques include High Pressure Liquid Chromatography and testing the toxicity of compounds in bioassays with insects.&lt;br/&gt;Co-speciation of doves, lice and microbes.  Techniques include DNA extraction, PCR, cloning, and DNA sequencing.  &lt;br/&gt;Regulation of cytoskeletal arrays in algae and plants.  Techniques include transcript identification by RT-PCR and protein levels by Western blot. &lt;br/&gt;Detoxification capacities of mammalian herbivores.  Techniques include DNA microarray analysis and microsomal assays.&lt;br/&gt;Systematics of Solanaceae.  Techniques include PCR and sequence analysis.&lt;br/&gt;Molecular  machineries that regulate division and fusion of mitochondria in budding yeast.&lt;br/&gt;Development of the macronucleus from the germline micronucleus of the ciliate, Oxytricha. Use PCR to infer the nature of the rearrangements and sequence modifications that are employed in generating the macronucleus.&lt;br/&gt;Promotion of homologous recombination by the generation of linear &lt;br/&gt;DNA in the nematode, C. elegans.&lt;br/&gt;The role of chemoreceptor clustering in chemotactic signaling by&lt;br/&gt;Escherichia coli.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Upon arrival at the University of Utah students will spend two days becoming acquainted with the campus, their research groups and the surrounding area.  To maintain the cohesiveness of the group, 4 weekly meetings will be scheduled for the duration of the program.  A GRE preparation class and classes to assist students with their graduate school applications will be offered.  At the conclusion of the program students will write a research report and present their research in an oral Bioscience Symposium.  Students will be encouraged to present their research at National meetings.
