<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT:&lt;br/&gt;This proposal deals with various aspects of discrete Schroedinger equations&lt;br/&gt;on the one dimensional lattice with deterministic potentials. So far, in &lt;br/&gt;collaboration with Jean Bourgain and Michael Goldstein, the author has &lt;br/&gt;considered quasi-periodic potentials given by ergodic shifts on tori, &lt;br/&gt;potentials obtained by means of the skew-shift on the two torus, as well as &lt;br/&gt;potentials defined in terms of strongly mixing dynamics, such as the doubling &lt;br/&gt;map on the circle or hyperbolic automorphisms on the two torus. In each of &lt;br/&gt;these cases, positivity of the Lyapunov exponent, regularity  of the &lt;br/&gt;integrated density of states, and Anderson localization were studied. &lt;br/&gt;At this point, we are planning to address several remaining questions, &lt;br/&gt;including the following ones:&lt;br/&gt;1) Is the Lyapunov exponent positive in case of skew-shift potentials &lt;br/&gt;   for small disorder ? &lt;br/&gt;2) Is it possible to obtained detailed information on the nature of the &lt;br/&gt;   eigenfunctions in the quasi-periodic case assuming only positivity of &lt;br/&gt;   the Lyapunov exponent ? In fact, do the non perturbative techniques&lt;br/&gt;   allow the definition of the essential support as described in the &lt;br/&gt;   perturbative regime by Sinai and Froehlich, Spencer, Wittwer ? &lt;br/&gt;  These questions are intimately linked with Y. G. Sinai's recent work on &lt;br/&gt;   "anomalous transport in quasi-periodic media", and would provide better&lt;br/&gt;   and more precise information on the subdiffusive behavior of the random&lt;br/&gt;   walk considered by Sinai. &lt;br/&gt;3) Is it possible to extend the  nonperturbative methods to strips, or the &lt;br/&gt;   two-dimensional plane ?&lt;br/&gt;4) Is the integrated density of states Holder continuous in the case of &lt;br/&gt;   several frequencies or the skew-shift ? &lt;br/&gt;5) What can be said about the statistics  of the level-spacings of the eigen&lt;br/&gt;   values for the case of the skew-shift ?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Historically, the study of random Schroedinger operators started with Phil&lt;br/&gt;Anderson's work in the late 1950's, for which he received the Nobel prize.&lt;br/&gt;Before his work it was believed that small random impurities in a crystal&lt;br/&gt;would not significantly change its conductance. Anderson, however, showed &lt;br/&gt;that this is not the case: Arbitrarily small random impurities occurring&lt;br/&gt;independently at each lattice site turn a conductor into an insulator. Since&lt;br/&gt;his work, which was not mathematically rigorous, the development of a precise&lt;br/&gt;theory of "Anderson localization" has been pursued by many mathematicians. &lt;br/&gt;It turned out that there were connections with deep results from several &lt;br/&gt;areas of mathematics. For example, Fuerstenberg's theorem on products of &lt;br/&gt;random matrices was a crucial tool in the development of the theory. &lt;br/&gt;These works attracted the attention of physicists, particularly experts in &lt;br/&gt;statistical mechanics. To this day, there is an active and fruitful exchange &lt;br/&gt;of ideas between mathematicians and physicists in this subject. In fact, the &lt;br/&gt;interest in random phenomena and methods has intensified quite notably in &lt;br/&gt;physics in recent years, as many important problems posed by statistical &lt;br/&gt;mechanics have proved to be rather deep mathematical challenges whose &lt;br/&gt;solution has lead to significant advances of probabilistic techniques.&lt;br/&gt;It is our hope that the projects set forth in this proposal will further&lt;br/&gt;advance our insight into the models of statistical mechanics as well as &lt;br/&gt;providing useful tools for mathematicians working in ergodic theory, analysis, &lt;br/&gt;and mathematical physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
