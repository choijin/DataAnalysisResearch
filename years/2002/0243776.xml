<AbstractNarration>The Triangle Universities Nuclear Laboratory (TUNL) is a collaboration of&lt;br/&gt;Duke University, North Carolina State University, the University of North&lt;br/&gt;Carolina at Chapel Hill, and other institutions in the North Carolina&lt;br/&gt;Triangle area, which has established a diverse research program in low-energy nuclear&lt;br/&gt;physics. TUNL has a strong reputation for providing hands-on experimental&lt;br/&gt;research experience to graduate and undergraduate students, who are involved&lt;br/&gt;in all aspects of nuclear physics experiments. Research projects are focused&lt;br/&gt;on resolving issues in, for example, few-body physics, nuclear-level&lt;br/&gt;densities, weak interactions and fundamental symmetries, photonuclear&lt;br/&gt;reactions, nuclear astrophysics and radiative-capture reactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The REU summer program provides undergraduate students with a realistic and&lt;br/&gt;active research experience through the completion of a self-contained&lt;br/&gt;10-week project and through the understanding of the project's integral&lt;br/&gt;contribution to the ongoing research program at TUNL. The broad scope of&lt;br/&gt;activities at TUNL, which involve data collection, data analysis and&lt;br/&gt;instrumentation development, offers the variety in project selection needed&lt;br/&gt;to productively involve students who have diverse academic and research&lt;br/&gt;backgrounds, capabilities and interests. To broaden the research experience,&lt;br/&gt;a special lecture series has been incorporated into the program to increase&lt;br/&gt;the students' exposure to current topics in nuclear physics and to share&lt;br/&gt;details about the research resources at TUNL. At the end of the summer&lt;br/&gt;program, students prepare written and oral presentations that help them to&lt;br/&gt;organize an overview of their research projects.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
