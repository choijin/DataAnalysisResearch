<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;The investigator attempts to classify square-integrable tamely ramified &lt;br/&gt;representations of split  reductive p-adic groups G and their inner &lt;br/&gt;forms, by means of homomorphisms from the tame Weil-Deligne group into &lt;br/&gt;the dual group of G. This project is part of the local Langlands &lt;br/&gt;conjecture for such groups. The representations are partitioned into &lt;br/&gt;finite sets, called ``L-packets". The method is a p-adic analogue &lt;br/&gt;of Lusztig's Jordan decomposition for finite reductive groups. &lt;br/&gt;From a functorial point of view, the tame L-packets are bijective &lt;br/&gt;lifts of unipotent L-packets for quasi-split groups and their inner &lt;br/&gt;forms. Properties of the L-packets, such as formal degrees &lt;br/&gt;and Whittaker models, will also be investigated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Symmetry is an effective way to study mathematical and &lt;br/&gt;physical objects. A Group is a collection of symmetries, and &lt;br/&gt;Representation Theory is the study of how these symmetries manifest in &lt;br/&gt;different ways. As a simple example, there is a group of sixty &lt;br/&gt;symmetries consisting of permutations of five objects, and this group &lt;br/&gt;also manifests as the sixty symmetries of an icosohedron, and of the &lt;br/&gt;fullerene molecule. The investigator studies certain infinite groups of &lt;br/&gt;infinite dimensional symmetries. In the past forty years, &lt;br/&gt;mathematicians and physicists have guessed that there may be deep &lt;br/&gt;relations between such symmetries and fundamental, as yet undiscovered, &lt;br/&gt;properties of numbers. The investigator attempts to confirm part of &lt;br/&gt;these conjectures, and make them more explicit. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
