    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT DMS - 0204188.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator will seek analytic realizations of "stringy"&lt;br/&gt;cohomology of singular varieties with trivial canonical bundle. He will study&lt;br/&gt;the implications of such analytic realizations (and their generalizations)&lt;br/&gt;towards providing new explanations of gauge symmetry enhancement mechanisms in&lt;br/&gt;string theory. In collaboration with S. Sethi, the PI will continue his program&lt;br/&gt;to analyze the supersymmetric matrix model quantum mechanics which has been &lt;br/&gt;conjectured to provide a definition of M theory. Graduate student G. Firestone, &lt;br/&gt;will study the L2 index theory for the nonFredholm Dirac operators whose L2&lt;br/&gt;kernels give the ground states for this theory. Sethi and the PI will examine&lt;br/&gt;methods for computing gravitational anomalies of field theories arising from&lt;br/&gt;string theories on singular spaces. S. Paban, S. Sethi, and the PI will examine&lt;br/&gt;the constraints imposed by supersymmetry on deformations of the supersymmetry&lt;br/&gt;algebra associated to an isolated five brane. The PI will investigate the&lt;br/&gt;extension of Witten's spinor technique of proving the positive mass conjecture&lt;br/&gt; by replacing the hypothesis of a smooth spin structure by the assumption of a&lt;br/&gt; spin structure degenerating on a codimension 2 submanifold.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;M theory gives a potential framework for providing a physical theory which&lt;br/&gt;incorporates both gravitation and the quantum physics describing high energy&lt;br/&gt; particles. The precise form of this theory is not yet fully developed. The &lt;br/&gt; measurable consequences are even further from being fully worked out. This &lt;br/&gt; project attempts to determine, for branches of this theory, fundamental &lt;br/&gt; consequences, such as the number of particles of different types, when these&lt;br/&gt; particles combine to make more complex matter, and the size &lt;br/&gt; and shape of these particles and their combinations.&lt;br/&gt;In addition to developing the physical consequences of M and string theory,&lt;br/&gt;such computations can be used to check for potential errors in the underlying &lt;br/&gt;hypotheses of M theory. This project also seeks a better understanding of a&lt;br/&gt;mathematical model for the physical interactions between certain "particles"&lt;br/&gt; known as 5 branes, whose existence is predicted by M theory.</AbstractNarration>
