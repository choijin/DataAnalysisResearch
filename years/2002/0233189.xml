<AbstractNarration>This project examines several areas of research related to  theorem proving techniques for multiple-valued logics (MVL's) and  for proving completeness:    - The most important work may be a new rule of inference, a  resolution-like rule tentatively named Modification, for regular  MVL's.  It appears likely that Modification is more effective  than existing methods of inference for MVL's; it is also likely  that the insights provided by Modification can be adapted to  improve the search behavior of other MVL inference rules.    - Signed logic is an adaptation of classical logic for reasoning  about MVL's.  Several modest implementations have been developed  recently for signed logic. The current project will broaden the  focus to implementations in the general theorem proving setting.  Experiments with logic programming and constraint solving will  also be undertaken.    - Annotated logic corresponds to a naturally arising class of  signed logic and has been applied to reasoning with  inconsistency.  Current systems of annotated logic are  paraconsistent, that is, inconsistency tolerant, with respect to  epistemic inconsistency, but they behave classically with respect  to ontological inconsistency. A mapping from signed logic to  annotated logic has been defined which has the effect of mapping  ontological inconsistency to epistemic inconsistency.  Further  investigation into properties of this mapping in the proposed  project is expected to lead to fruitful insights on the  relationships between the two notions of inconsistencies.    - The Anderson-Bledsoe excess literal proof of the completeness  of resolution was recently generalized to provide simplified  proofs of known results as well as to prove completeness of  connected tableaux and of connected regular tableaux for NNF  formulas and the completeness of linear non-clausal resolution.    The project will examine the application of the technique to  still other methods of proof procedures.</AbstractNarration>
