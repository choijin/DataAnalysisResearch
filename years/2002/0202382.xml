    <AbstractNarration>The principal investigator proposes here to study groups defined by a single relation.&lt;br/&gt;Such groups arise as fundamental groups in algebraic topology, as discrete&lt;br/&gt;groups of transformations in analysis and geometry and in abstract group&lt;br/&gt;theory. The importance of such a study is in its many connections to other&lt;br/&gt;branches of mathematics, as well as to computer science and logic. Progress will shed&lt;br/&gt;light on a number of other subjects. These include the theories of hyperbolic &lt;br/&gt;and automatic groups, computability, genetic and other algorithms and &lt;br/&gt;may lead to a deeper understanding of finitely presented groups as a&lt;br/&gt;whole. This proposal represents a first step in an overall study of one-relator&lt;br/&gt;groups, using the number of steps in a so-called Magnus breakdown, as the&lt;br/&gt;basis for induction. The principal investigator, together with his many colleagues,&lt;br/&gt;will initiate this study by focussing attention on one-relator groups of planarity one.&lt;br/&gt;These are the very special HNN extensions of a free group that arise in the first step of the&lt;br/&gt;Magnus breakdown referred to above. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Groups are mathematical structures which are designed, in part, to capture the&lt;br/&gt;intrinsic nature of symmetry. Consequently groups play an extremely important role&lt;br/&gt;in geometry, in chrystallography, in particle physics, in chemistry and in cryptography&lt;br/&gt;as well as in much of mathematics. Their uses in cryptography are yet to be exploited; &lt;br/&gt;RSA encryption may be viewed as a first step in this direction. Many of the problems of &lt;br/&gt;the physical world can be translated into problems in group theory. On the other hand, many &lt;br/&gt;processes, such as evolution, can be used to unravel the nature of particular groups. Thus&lt;br/&gt;group theory provides a testing ground for a better understanding of these processes.&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator, in the work to be undertaken, will, in particular, use group theory &lt;br/&gt;to attempt to improve on one of the most exciting new aspects of computer&lt;br/&gt;science, so-called genetic algorithms. Such algorithms appear to be a means for designing ever &lt;br/&gt;more intelligent computers.</AbstractNarration>
