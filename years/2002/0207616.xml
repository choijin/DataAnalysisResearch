<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;Through the QUEST program, Central State University (CSU) will enhance STEM access, student retention, curricula, undergraduate research, transition to graduate school and faculty development positively impacting its largely African - American student population. STEM student learning will be improved by the adoption of a hybrid combination of the Learning Communities and the Peer-Led Team-Learning systems. Student and faculty research opportunities and student internship opportunities will significantly increase through arrangements with partner institutions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Program activities will impact more than 1000 on-campus students and 150 pre-college students through bridge programs.  QUEST efforts will result in a 60% increase in freshman STEM enrollment, an increase in freshman retention from 63% to 70%, and STEM graduation rates of at least 54 students per year above current rates, including an additional 22 students per year graduating with GPAs of 3.0 or higher. CSU STEM students in the graduate school pipeline will increase by a factor of 3 above current levels. The number of students engaged in research projects and internships will increase by at least 20% per year.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
