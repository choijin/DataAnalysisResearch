    <AbstractNarration>PROPOSAL NO.: 0230590&lt;br/&gt;PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Brzoska, Michael&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION NAME: Eastern Washington University&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: Software Engineering Technology Program Development&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Department of Engineering Technology and Multimedia Design within the School of Computing and Engineering Sciences at Eastern Washington University plans to develop a new program in the emerging discipline of Software Engineering Technology ( SET). The SET program was conceived largely on the basis of three major factors: industrial demand within the region and state, the small number of qualified&lt;br/&gt;graduates available to enter the workforce, and the increasing pool of potential students. It is Eastern Washington University's goal to develop and offer a timely and high-quality SET program that provides a thorough understanding of theory and design combined with the variety&lt;br/&gt;of practical skills needed today. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal components of the curriculum design to be developed under this grant include:&lt;br/&gt;1. A synthesis of research derived from surveys and site visits to industry and other undergraduate SET programs,&lt;br/&gt;2. Program objectives and outcomes based on the research and internal discussions within the department, school and college,&lt;br/&gt;3. A final list of proposed SET courses including course descriptions based on the research&lt;br/&gt;4. Recommendations for integrating new learning strategies and problem-solving techniques in the curriculum,&lt;br/&gt;5. An identification of potential industry mentors, internships, and industry-originated classroom projects,&lt;br/&gt;6. A final list of laboratory needs including identification of equipment, configurations, and numbers of workstations,&lt;br/&gt;7. A student recruitment and retention plan that focuses on nontraditional students,&lt;br/&gt;8. Increased advisory board membership to include persons with a background in SET and non-technical members who can assist with both curriculum development and student recruitment and retention,&lt;br/&gt;9. A timeline for obtaining final program approval, and&lt;br/&gt;10. A checklist of TAC of ABET requirements.</AbstractNarration>
