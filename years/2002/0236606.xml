<AbstractNarration>0236606&lt;br/&gt;Dietrich&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also know as Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR), Airborne Laser Swath Mapping (ALSM) allows for the measurement of surface topographic features with decimeter-level accuracies.  The development of very high resolution georeferenced digital elevation models (DEMs) acquired using ALSM, are critical for observing a multitude of geomorphic features at scales appropriate to the fundamental processes that govern their topographic expression.   Examples include, fault structures, hill slopes, riverine features, coastal zone morphology, glaciers, volcanic edifices and vegetative canopy structure.  The DEMs developed from these data can be used to model and better understand the dynamics of these landforms.  The technique also has obvious applications in civil engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant provides support for the management and operation of a National Center for Airborne Laser Mapping (NCALM) over a period of two years.  A part of a collaborative effort , the University of Florida (UF; EAR-0236720) and the University of California - Berkeley (UC-B; EAR-0236606) will provide faculty leadership, technical support, and the computational resources and software to make available to the broader geosciences community, research-grade, digital topographic data acquired with ALSM.  NCALM will make available to the broader community, the use of an existing Optech 33 kHz pulse rate ALSM system at UF that can be flown on a UF twin engine Cessna aircraft equipped with GPS equipment and an inertial positioning system.  NCALM will assist researchers in the design, budgeting and conduct of ALSM surveys for specific research projects in order to maximize the scientific utility of the acquired data.   Additional goals include 1) advancing both the technology and the scientific discoveries made possible as a consequence of ALSM; 2) tracking and evaluating other remote sensing technologies that might complement ALSM, and developing methods for multi-sensor data collection and fusion; and 3) providing a training ground for students.  NCALM will also support community involvement in the management of the facility through support of  a steering committee (SC) and annual community workshops.  The SC will provide guidance and review on the following:  1) scheduling and prioritizing projects; 2) cost effective management of the Center; 3) information dissemination; 4) opportunities and necessities for technological upgrades; and 5) contact and coordination with major programs (PBO, CUASHI, Margins, etc.) and agencies (NASA, FEMA, USGS, and other agencies). The NCALM ALSM educational program will include: 1) an annual summer stipend open to a graduate student to provide hands-on experience with ALSM data reduction at UC-B; 2) annual community workshops to introduce students and scientists to the opportunities offered by ALSM; 3) the development of parallel opportunities for both science and engineering research for graduate students at UF; and 4) the implementation of a visiting scientist/student program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
