    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I Project will optimize a newly developed ceramic-metallic (cermet) resistive heating material and prove its feasibility for use in diesel particulate filters. Objectives include optimization of the cermet composition and laminates, characterization of physical properties, and development of multi-layer ceramic tape manufacturing methods for producing multichannel filter monoliths with integral cermet heating elements. The research will optimize the cermet composition based on analysis of life and temperature cycling, heat transfer capabilities, and thermal gradient control. The anticipated result of the project will be a small-scale particulate filter with an integral cermet heating element that provides continuous thermal oxidation of particulates. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new cermet heating material has immediate commercial potential as a heating element that can be integrated into diesel particulate filter structures for the continuous thermal oxidation of particulates (at approximately 600 C). With new emissions controls scheduled to take effect in 2007, there is presently a compelling need for a compact, simple-to-maintain, durable, and effective diesel particulate filter for both new and existing diesel-powered vehicles.</AbstractNarration>
