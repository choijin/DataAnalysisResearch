<AbstractNarration>These research projects address problems in the model theory of&lt;br/&gt;differential fields and the model theory of the field of real&lt;br/&gt;numbers with exponentiation.  The model theory of differential&lt;br/&gt;fields is a fascinating area requiring a sophisticated mixture of&lt;br/&gt;ideas from stability theory, differential algebra and algebraic&lt;br/&gt;geometry. The work of Buium and Hrushovski has shown that these&lt;br/&gt;ideas have important consequences in Diophantine geometry.  In&lt;br/&gt;particular, the principal investigator will study the model&lt;br/&gt;theoretic behavior of solution sets of families of algebraic&lt;br/&gt;differential equations.  This line of research on the model&lt;br/&gt;theory of the field of real numbers with exponentiation is&lt;br/&gt;expected to concentrate on the relationship between global&lt;br/&gt;solutions to differential equations at infinity and formal&lt;br/&gt;solutions in the field of logarithmic-exponential series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Model theory is a branch of logic that explores mathematical&lt;br/&gt;structures such as the real numbers together with their&lt;br/&gt;arithmetic operations and ordering relation, analyzing the degree&lt;br/&gt;to which the basic rules or axioms for a collection of objects&lt;br/&gt;and their operations determine the shape of that collection.  The&lt;br/&gt;methods and results of model theory are cast in terms of&lt;br/&gt;definable sets and functions, where a construction is definable&lt;br/&gt;exactly when it can be expressed by first-order logical formulas&lt;br/&gt;in the language of the structure. Model theoretic methods for the&lt;br/&gt;field of real numbers with exponentiation have been remarkably&lt;br/&gt;successful in proving new results on the geometry of exponential&lt;br/&gt;varieties and sets defined from them. This work has already found&lt;br/&gt;applications in asymptotic analysis, control theory, microlocal&lt;br/&gt;analysis, and neural networks.  The model theory of differential&lt;br/&gt;fields has had significant applications in number theory.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
