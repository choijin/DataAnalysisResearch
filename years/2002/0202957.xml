<AbstractNarration>South Carolina is facing a critical shortage of properly prepared teachers of science and mathematics at the middle school level. The state must recruit more teachers into the profession, these teachers must be properly prepared for the duties they will assume, and well-trained and experienced teachers must be encouraged to remain in the classroom. To be successful in the middle school, science and mathematics teachers must have a strong background in content as well as pedagogy, and they must be familiar with the way students learn in the middle years. In response to these needs, the University of South Carolina College of Science and Mathematics and College of Education in collaboration with selected middle schools in the Columbia, South Carolina Metropolitan area are developing and evaluating a Science and Mathematics Middle School Teacher Training program to provide pre-service middle school teachers of science and mathematics with the content and pedagogy they require to successfully enter and succeed in the teaching profession. The content portion of the program consists of six new courses in science and three new courses in mathematics for pre-service teachers. These courses are taught by content area faculty in association with master middle school teachers and faculty from the College of Education. The objective in each course is to provide the appropriate content while modeling proper pedagogy and assessment strategies. In addition, the project is designing a new professional education course in which the pre-service teachers study and develop ways to describe what goes on in a classroom and how it can influence the interests, learning, and social development of the students. The future teachers observe middle school students and record what the students are doing and how they set about learning the concepts presented to them. The pre-service teachers also have the opportunity to take part in a "rounds" program that allows them to observe and discuss exemplary teaching in the middle school. Finally, the future teachers spend at least six hours each week working with a middle school teacher. These experiences allow the new teachers to enter their classrooms with a broad knowledge of how schools work, how students react to learning, and how best to help students learn while they cope with all of the changes occurring within them and around them. An important part of the project is recruitment of additional candidates for the middle school certification program in university science and mathematics classes and in college transfer programs in Technical Colleges. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
