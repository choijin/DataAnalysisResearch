<AbstractNarration>DMS-0204826&lt;br/&gt;Jason Cantarella and Joseph Fu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will study the geometry of knots which are critical&lt;br/&gt;configurations for "ropelength", which is defined to be the quotient&lt;br/&gt;of their length over the radius of their largest embedded tubular&lt;br/&gt;neighborhood. Since the ropelength functional is not smooth, there is&lt;br/&gt;no classical Euler-Lagrange equation describing the minimizers.  The&lt;br/&gt;primary aim of the projec666t is to provide an analogy to the&lt;br/&gt;Euler-Lagrange equation: a "balance criterion", which shows that a&lt;br/&gt;curve is ropelength critical if and only if the first variation of the&lt;br/&gt;length of the core curve can be balanced by a system of self-contact&lt;br/&gt;forces acting on the surrounding tube. The methods used to prove the&lt;br/&gt;balance criterion (a generalization of certain aspects of tensegrity&lt;br/&gt;theory to a class of "continuous tensegrities", using a version of the&lt;br/&gt;Farkas alternative theorem for linear operators on Banach spaces)&lt;br/&gt;promise rich applications in other areas of mathematics, such as the&lt;br/&gt;study of convex curves, and of "knot energies".&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A natural model for a rope with a circular cross-section is a space&lt;br/&gt;curve surrounded by a non-self-intersecting tube of fixed radius.  If&lt;br/&gt;such a rope is tied in a knot, and the knot is pulled tight, the&lt;br/&gt;resulting curve is a critical configuration for the "ropelength" of&lt;br/&gt;the curve, which is defined to be the quotient of the length of the&lt;br/&gt;curve over the radius of the tube. The project studies the geometry of&lt;br/&gt;ropelength-critical curves using ideas from the theory of frameworks.&lt;br/&gt;This theory studies simple engineering models of structures, and gives&lt;br/&gt;a precise description of how external loads on a structure are&lt;br/&gt;resolved into tensions and compressions of different structural&lt;br/&gt;elements.  The project views the tension in a tight knot as exerting a&lt;br/&gt;force directed towards the inside of each curve of the rope, and aims&lt;br/&gt;to show that such a curve is tight if this force can be resolved into&lt;br/&gt;a system of self-contact forces acting on the surface of the tube.&lt;br/&gt;This "balance criterion" has surprising consequences. Imagine a rope&lt;br/&gt;stretched horizontally, like a clothesline. If another rope is passed&lt;br/&gt;over the line, and pulled down until the pair is tight, the ropes form&lt;br/&gt;four straight segments joined to a central region where the strands&lt;br/&gt;curve around one another. One would expect the ropes to maintain&lt;br/&gt;contact throughout this curved clasp, with the two points on the&lt;br/&gt;inside of each bend touching one another. However, according to the&lt;br/&gt;balance criterion, this cannot happen: there is always a small gap&lt;br/&gt;between the two strands at the center of the turn. This model has&lt;br/&gt;already been used in molecular biology to describe the behavior of DNA&lt;br/&gt;strands; the new geometric information provided by the project will&lt;br/&gt;help to refine and extend many other appications of this model in&lt;br/&gt;physics, biology, and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
