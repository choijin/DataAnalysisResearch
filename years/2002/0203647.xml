<AbstractNarration>Proposal title: Complex differential geometry and rigidity&lt;br/&gt;Proposal number: DMS - 0203647&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;                         Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposer plans to do research in the following three topics in differential&lt;br/&gt;geometry:  1) the geometry of nonpositively curved Riemannian manifolds with &lt;br/&gt;degenerate Ricci tensor;  2) the structure of compact Kaehler manifold with nonpositive &lt;br/&gt;bisectional curvature; 3) metric rigidity/non-rigidity for complex hyperbolic spaces. &lt;br/&gt;For topic 1), the proposer has obtained some results in the real analytic cases, &lt;br/&gt;and he proposes to investigate the smooth cases in this context.  For 2), he  has &lt;br/&gt;studied the class of compact Kaehler manifolds with nonpositive bisectional curvature. &lt;br/&gt;Under some additional non-degenerateness assumption, he was able to obtain a structural &lt;br/&gt;result for such manifolds, which can be viewed as the dual version of classical &lt;br/&gt;Howard-Smyth-Wu splitting theorem. He would like to study the general case, as well as &lt;br/&gt;some other related  questions regarding this type of manifolds. For topic 3), he proposes &lt;br/&gt;to study two metric rigidity questions about  the complex hyper!&lt;br/&gt;bolic space, in dimension two or higher. One is a non-equivariant metric rigidity &lt;br/&gt;question for quarter-pinched metrics, the other is for some special type of CAT(0) &lt;br/&gt;singular metrics.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research lies in the field of differential geometry, which is a branch &lt;br/&gt;of mathematics aimed at understanding the interplay between the global structure and&lt;br/&gt;the curvature (which measures the bending) of a given space. The major models of spaces &lt;br/&gt;in this study are Riemannian manifolds and Kaehler manifolds. This field is of importance&lt;br/&gt;not only to many branches of mathematics, but also to other sciences and engineering such &lt;br/&gt;as physics. A well known example is the use of Riemannian geometry in Einstein's theory of&lt;br/&gt; the general relativity. Another example is that the modern control theory uses almost &lt;br/&gt;exclusively tools developed in differential geometry. Within the field of differential &lt;br/&gt;geometry, the study of nonpositively curved spaces and the rigidity phenomenon often &lt;br/&gt;associated with such spaces has been on the center stage since early 70's, after the &lt;br/&gt;discovery of Mostow and Margulis. It has drawn much attention in 80's and 90's from the &lt;br/&gt;mathematical world. The proposer and others are trying to investigate these topics for &lt;br/&gt;Kaehler manifolds, which are  Riemannian manifolds with a special type of structure. &lt;br/&gt;The recent development in string theory suggests that the universe is the ten dimensional &lt;br/&gt;product space of the usual (four dimensional) space time and a compact six dimensional&lt;br/&gt;cross section which should be a special kind of Kaehler manifold (the so-called Calabi-Yau &lt;br/&gt;spaces). Besides reasons and existing/potential application outside mathematics, Kaehler &lt;br/&gt;geometry has become more of more important within many fields of pure and &lt;br/&gt;applied mathematics.   &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
