<AbstractNarration> This grant provides operating funds for the relativistic heavy-ion &lt;br/&gt;group at the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of &lt;br/&gt;Rochester.  During the year covered by this grant we will complete the &lt;br/&gt;analysis of the data collected in 2001 and 2003 with the PHOBOS detector &lt;br/&gt;at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National &lt;br/&gt;Laboratory (BNL) and consider possible upgrade options for the PHOBOS &lt;br/&gt;detector.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;   PHOBOS is one of the four experiments looking at the extreme energy &lt;br/&gt;densities that are created when nuclei collide at RHIC.  It is believed &lt;br/&gt;that a new state of matter, the so-called quark-gluon plasma (QGP), will &lt;br/&gt;be formed in these collisions.  PHOBOS is looking for this new state of &lt;br/&gt;matter, and its properties will provide important and new information &lt;br/&gt;about the state of the very early universe (a few microseconds after the &lt;br/&gt;Big Bang).  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;   PHOBOS was designed to study as many collisions as possible, in an &lt;br/&gt;unbiased way, and to search for significant differences between p+p, p+A, &lt;br/&gt;and A+A collisions.  The data collected sofar inlcudes studies of Au+Au &lt;br/&gt;collisions in 2001, d+Au in 2003, and p+p in 2001 and 2003.  It is &lt;br/&gt;expected that the QGP will only be formed in the Au+Au collisions, and the &lt;br/&gt;studies of d+Au and p+p are used to subtract the contribution of "normal" &lt;br/&gt;nucleon-nucleon physics from the data collected in Au+Au collisions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;   The time-of-flight array, designed and constructed by the Rochester &lt;br/&gt;group, significantly enhances the physics capabilities of PHOBOS, by &lt;br/&gt;roughly doubling its particle identification capabilities.  For the &lt;br/&gt;2003 run we have increased the flight path of our arrays, allowing use &lt;br/&gt;to identify particles up to momenta of around 4 - 5 GeV/c.  The analysis &lt;br/&gt;of the 2001 data is almost completed, and the analysis of the 2003 data is &lt;br/&gt;just getting started.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
