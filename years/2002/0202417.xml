<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive teacher preparation program at Amarillo College, with emphasis in mathematics and science, and formal articulation with schools of education at Texas universities. The objectives of the project are to: 1) develop the mathematics courses, refine the science curriculum, and update the general education curriculum for elementary education; 2) enhance the Amarillo College Teacher Education project through new Introductory Education courses, and by emphasizing hand on, collaborative learning pedagogy and the use of technology in the classroom; 3) develop and implement partnerships and articulation agreements with Texas Universities Schools of Education, beginning with West Texas A&amp;M and Texas Tech Universities; and 4) increase the number of teachers well-prepared to teach the students of the Texas Panhandle at all pre-college levels, K-12. The objectives are being implemented through the newly formed Teacher Education Department in the Division of Sciences and Engineering. New mathematics and science courses incorporate real-world experiences and labs, and the use of technology in teaching and in science. Technology as a teaching tool is taught through the use of technology including Smart classrooms, interactive TV classrooms, computer lab assignments, and Internet ancillaries. Recruitment efforts are designed to attract women, minorities and those who are considering a career change. Industry partners enrich the teacher preparation program by involving scientists and technicians with instructional course development and onsite labs, hosting field trips, and offering internships. Collaborations with school districts provide mentor teachers for preservice students, field observations of K-8 classrooms, and tutoring opportunities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
