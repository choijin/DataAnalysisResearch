<AbstractNarration>Proposal Number: DMS-0200703&lt;br/&gt;PI: Anthony Quas &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work will focus on the areas of higher-dimensional shifts of&lt;br/&gt;finite type and almost everywhere convergence in ergodic&lt;br/&gt;theory. Higher-dimensional shifts of finite type are symbolic&lt;br/&gt;dynamical systems whose points are arrays of symbols from a finite&lt;br/&gt;alphabet satisfying certain adjacency rules. While there is a&lt;br/&gt;well-developed theory for one-dimensional shifts of finite type, the&lt;br/&gt;general situation for higher-dimensional shifts has been very&lt;br/&gt;unclear. Recently a number of organizing concepts have started to&lt;br/&gt;emerge and it is hoped that these will lead to a satisfactory theory&lt;br/&gt;for at least some reasonable collection of higher-dimensional systems. &lt;br/&gt;Birkhoff's theorem is concerned with the effects of averaging a&lt;br/&gt;sequence of measurements of a system taken at equal time&lt;br/&gt;intervals. The result then states that in the case of a&lt;br/&gt;measure-preserving transformation, for almost every initial condition,&lt;br/&gt;the time averages are convergent. Further, the limit is identified if&lt;br/&gt;the transformation is ergodic. The work will focus on variations to&lt;br/&gt;this scenario where the measurements are taken at varying&lt;br/&gt;intervals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The higher-dimensional shifts of finite type that will be studied are&lt;br/&gt;of relevance in designing efficient data storage schemes. Due to&lt;br/&gt;physical restrictions on storage media, in many cases certain patterns&lt;br/&gt;of binary digits cannot be reliably written and read back from digital&lt;br/&gt;storage media. In these cases, it is necessary to encode the data so&lt;br/&gt;as to ensure that the encoded data does not contain any of the&lt;br/&gt;forbidden patterns of binary digits.  This applies to magnetic tapes, but also to conventional hard disks, where data is stored in a number of tracks, all separated from&lt;br/&gt;one another. It is likely that in order to continue the growth in the&lt;br/&gt;amount of data that can be stored on a single device, it will be&lt;br/&gt;desirable or maybe even physically necessary to consider&lt;br/&gt;two-dimensional storage schemes. Efficient methods for doing this&lt;br/&gt;will depend on a good understanding of the properties of&lt;br/&gt;higher-dimensional shifts of finite type. The almost everywhere &lt;br/&gt;convergence results lie at the intersection of a&lt;br/&gt;number of diverse areas of mathematics: probability, dynamical&lt;br/&gt;systems, ergodic theory, number theory and harmonic analysis. It is&lt;br/&gt;hoped that progress made in this area will have knock-on effects in &lt;br/&gt;the other disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
