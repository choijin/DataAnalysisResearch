<AbstractNarration>Geoffrey Coates, Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology,  Cornell University, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program for his continued work on biodegradable and low environmental impact polymers. Coates will use metal-based catalysts to prepare polymers and copolymers with precise architectural control, imparting superior properties and allowing important applications. More specifically, beta-diiminate zinc complexes will be developed as catalysts for epoxide/carbon dioxide copolymerization and lactone polymerization. Chiral catalysts based on hybrid imine/oxazoline ligands will be developed, potentially leading to optically active, tactic polycarbonates. The detailed mechanistic pathways of these reactions will also be studied, which should increase the rate of discovery of improved catalysts for these polymerizations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The environmental impact of industrially important plastics can be minimized by using renewable feedstocks and preparing biodegradable polymers. New catalysts and new reactions will be used to contribute to sustainable development. Students will be trained in catalyst synthesis, polymer synthesis and polymer characterization. Public understanding of science and particularly plastics will be enhanced through chemical demonstrations and mass media.</AbstractNarration>
