<AbstractNarration>0234032&lt;br/&gt;Kojima&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a three-year collaborative research project between Professor Haruo Kojima at Rutgers University in New Brunswick and Professor Hidehiko Ishimoto at the Institute of Solid State Physics (ISSP) of the University of Tokyo in Japan.  They will be undertaking research on spin fluid flow dynamics in polarized superfluid.  A novel mechanical spin density detector technique has been developed for probing the nature of spin transport and relaxation effects.  The technique will be applied to study the unusual spin transport and diffusion across two material states with different magnetic properties of their model system.  Earlier experiments and analysis indicated that the presence of "interface" between the magnetic superfluid and either another superfluid or normal fluid exhibits very different mechanisms of spin relaxation.  It is proposed to provide a direct test on the importance of the interface by measuring the spin relaxation in an arrangement which eliminates the interface altogether.  The new spin filter experiment will increase spin polarization to much greater degree than possible in the past.  A fluid state with large non-equilibrium polarization will be created and its dynamics will be studied.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The project brings together the efforts of two laboratories that have complementary expertise and research capabilities.  The U.S. researchers provide expertise in the spin fluid flow dynamics experiments and the Japanese researchers provide expertise in ultra low temperature with a high magnetic field.  Studies on spin dependent transport are important in advancing towards spintronics devices.  The studies also have advantages in simpler structures because of the ease of changing material conditions and longer time scale involved.  This would also contribute towards a better understanding of spintronics.  The project advances international human resources through the participation of a number of graduate students who will gain experience in the state of art technology in ultra low temperature physics and materials physics.    Through the exchange of ideas and technology, this project will broaden our base of basic knowledge and promote international understanding and cooperation.  Results of the research will be disseminated at scientific meetings and in scientific journals.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
