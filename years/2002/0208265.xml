    <AbstractNarration>The Wilberforce University Science, Technology, and Engineering Preeminent Undergraduate (STEP-UP) Program addresses the underrepresentation of minorities in Science, Technology Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) by &lt;br/&gt;enhancing minority access, retention, graduation and successful transition to graduate study in STEM fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program starts with a Pre-College Summer Institute addressing deficiencies in mathematical reasoning, problem solving, critical reading, verbal reasoning, technical writing and vocabulary building. During the freshman year, all STEM majors will be housed on the same floors of the men's and women's dormitories to foster a sense of community and shared goals as well as to enhance performance rates. Freshmen will enroll in a series of seminars focussing on careers in STEM and the importance of graduate school. During the summer between the freshmen and sophomore years, undergraduates will participate in an intensive Summer Program focusing on STEM content, study skills and problem solving. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A series of activities will be put in place to ensure that undergraduates successfully matriculate through the STEM curricula and prepare for graduate school. These include a peer tutoring-mentor program in all gatekeeper courses including a mandatory two-hour drill session for each course each week, Summer research opportunities in collaboration with Florida A&amp;M University, and a GRE-Preparation Course. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Science and Engineering Graduate School Fair will allow juniors and seniors to examine various graduate programs and to network with faculty at other universities. In addition, the biology program will be revised and restructured. A course in experimental biology will be developed with a focus on emerging techniques required in the biotechnology area.</AbstractNarration>
