<AbstractNarration>The San Diego Society of Natural History (SDSNH) will design, fabricate and install a 9,000 square foot permanent exhibition exploring the fundamental scientific concepts of paleontology, geology, biology and ecology as they pertain to prehistoric southern California and the peninsula of Baja California.  Playing the role of paleontologist, visitors will be invited to ponder a mystery, explore the setting, examine the evidence, and use scientific tools to discover answers.  Carefully crafted settings will support exploration that engages learners of all ages at levels for both novice and experienced learners.  Visitors will discover how natural patterns reveal natural processes, and examine the relationship between past, present and future.  Focused activities will enable visitors to exercise their skills of observation and critical thinking, with exhibits that promote learning in a family context.  The exhibits and activities focus on the Museum's collections and research, and are grounded in comprehensive visitor research supporting exhibit development.  The exhibition and related science education materials will demonstrate how these fundamental concepts can be investigated in a regional setting.  Visitors will extend their learning experience beyond the museum through a content-rich interactive website, a popular book on regional geology and paleontology, and related public programs and fossil displays at regional nature centers near the actual discovery sites.  Exhibition planning, program evaluation and visitor research will be widely disseminated as contributions to the literature on best practices for interpretation of prehistoric life and landscapes</AbstractNarration>
