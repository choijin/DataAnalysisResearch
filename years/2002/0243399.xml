    <AbstractNarration>This award provides partial support for the 2003 Annual Conference of the National Society of Black Physicists (NSBP) and Black Physics Students, which will be held at Spellman College, Atlanta, GA on February 12-15, 2003. This will be the 17th Annual Conference, bringing together students and professionals for both concurrent and parallel sessions. The NSBP seeks to increase the diversity of the United State community of researchers and educators in physics and related fields by providing student participants with the motivation and practical skills to further their education and assimilation into the scientific and technical professions. The Annual Conference is attended by approximately 250 students, and is supported by a combination of gifts from foundations, national laboratories, industry, federal grants, and support from the host institution. This award will provide direct support for the attendance of approximately 50 undergraduate or graduate students, post-doctoral associates, or junior physics faculty. Past meetings have demonstrated a strong synergy in bringing together students and career physics professionals. This is a natural format leading to new contacts, networks and mentoring opportunities for student attendees. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides partial support for the 2003 Annual Conference of the National Society of Black Physicists (NSBP) and Black Physics Students, which will be held at Spellman College, Atlanta, GA on February 12-15, 2003. This award will provide direct support for the attendance of approximately 50 undergraduate or graduate students, post-doctoral associates, or junior physics faculty.
