    <AbstractNarration>0204037&lt;br/&gt;Khapalov &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the modeling of controlled distributed parameter systems "additive" &lt;br/&gt;boundary and internal locally distributed controls are typically used. &lt;br/&gt;(Examples of such controls can be a source in a heat/mass-transfer process &lt;br/&gt;or a piezoceramic actuator placed on a beam.) In terms of applications it &lt;br/&gt;appears that such controls can adequately model only those controlled &lt;br/&gt;processes that do not change their principal physical characteristics due to &lt;br/&gt;the control actions. They rather describe the effect of various externally &lt;br/&gt;added "alien" sources and/or forces on the process at hand. This &lt;br/&gt;limitation, however, excludes a vast array of new and not quite new &lt;br/&gt;technologies, such as, for example, "smart materials" and numerous &lt;br/&gt;biomedical, chemical and nuclear chain reactions, which are able to &lt;br/&gt;change their principal parameters under certain purposefully induced &lt;br/&gt;conditions ("catalysts").&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intent of this proposal is to address the just-outlined issues in the &lt;br/&gt;context of global controllability of semilinear partial differential equations &lt;br/&gt;(PDEs) through the introduction and study of multiplicative (or "bilinear") &lt;br/&gt;controls. These controls enter the system equations as coefficients. &lt;br/&gt;Accordingly they can change at least some of the principal parameters of &lt;br/&gt;the process at hand, such as, for example, the natural frequency response &lt;br/&gt;of a beam or the rate of a chemical reaction. (In the former case this can be &lt;br/&gt;caused, e.g., by the embedded "smart" alloys and, in the latter case, by &lt;br/&gt;various catalysts and/or by the speed at which the reaction ingredients are &lt;br/&gt;mechanically mixed.) The focus of this proposal is on the development of &lt;br/&gt;a new methodology for the study of global controllability of the semilinear &lt;br/&gt;reaction-diffusion-convection equation and of the wave and beam &lt;br/&gt;equations in the framework of bilinear controls. We are particularly &lt;br/&gt;interested in the effect such multiplicative controls may have on the issue &lt;br/&gt;of controllability of highly nonlinear PDEs, in which case the classical &lt;br/&gt;additive controls often appear to be inadequate.</AbstractNarration>
