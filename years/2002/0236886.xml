<AbstractNarration>A full understanding of axon development requires knowing the contributions made by each structural component of the axonal cytoskeleton, since the cytoskeleton is what most directly controls axonal morphology. The most abundant of these components is the neurofilaments, which are the intermediate filaments of neurons.  Because neurofilament composition changes with each successive phase of axonal outgrowth, it must somehow influence the evolving structure and growth dynamics of developing axons; but the precise role of these changes is poorly understood.  This project studies how such changes in neurofilament composition influence both the dynamics of axon outgrowth and the structure of the cytoskeleton by perturbing the molecular composition of neurofilaments in developing spinal cord neurons of frog embryos.  It focuses on two specific transitions in neurofilament composition: first, axon initiation and early outgrowth, which are marked by expression of a single neurofilament protein, peripherin; and second, rapid axon elongation, which is marked by expression of two additional neurofilament proteins, NF-M and XNIF.  Previous studies from this lab showed that loss of NF-M and XNIF from developing axons inhibits them from elongating efficiently.  The specific objectives of this project are to determine: 1) the involvement of peripherin in axonal outgrowth; and 2) the further involvement of XNIF and NF-M in promoting axon elongation. The broader impact of this work on society is that a better understanding of the basic mechanisms underlying axonal outgrowth may help work aimed at improving the capacity of neurons to repair injury and resist disease.  In addition, frog embryos provide an ideal model system for these studies as experimental manipulations can be learned quickly, permits direct access to the earliest stages of neural development, and is less expensive than working with mammals.  This is an effective system for training students at all levels in the application of cell and molecular biology techniques to important problems in early neural development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
