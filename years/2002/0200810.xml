    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT DMS - 0200810.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One motivation for this project comes from F theory/heterotic string&lt;br/&gt;duality. In this duality, given the data of an elliptically fibered&lt;br/&gt;Calabi-Yau manifold, a principal bundle over it with the appropriate&lt;br/&gt;structure group and connection, and a B-field, which is roughly like a&lt;br/&gt;holomorphic 2-form, one expects to find a new Calabi-Yau manifold fibered in&lt;br/&gt;elliptic K3 surfaces over the same base. A second motivation is to&lt;br/&gt;understand some of the mathematical issues raised by the first question, in&lt;br/&gt;a purely mathematical framework. These issues lead to a rich set of&lt;br/&gt;questions concerning two or more commuting elements in compact Lie groups,&lt;br/&gt;conjugacy classes in semisimple algebraic groups or complex Lie algebras,&lt;br/&gt;the moduli space of semistable principal bundles over elliptic curves, and&lt;br/&gt;the geometry of del Pezzo surfaces and K3 surfaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is concerned with the study of certain geometric structures&lt;br/&gt;arising in mathematics and physics. One goal of this study is a mathematical&lt;br/&gt;understanding of the relation between two physical theories of elementary&lt;br/&gt;particles arising from string theory. The relationship is best expressed&lt;br/&gt;mathematically by relationships between several geometric structures. These&lt;br/&gt;relationships, and various generalizations, are also very interesting from a&lt;br/&gt;mathematical point of view, because they are connected with the possible&lt;br/&gt;symmetries of spaces in any number of dimensions and with geometric&lt;br/&gt;structures connected with these symmetries.</AbstractNarration>
