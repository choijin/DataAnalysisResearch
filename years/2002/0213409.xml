<AbstractNarration>Various fallacies in thinking interfere with judgment about&lt;br/&gt;matters of tax.  In particular, people may oppose or&lt;br/&gt;inconsistently support optimizing reforms --- or favor reforms&lt;br/&gt;that are less than optimal --- because of three clusters of&lt;br/&gt;cognitive biases.  One, the status-quo effect, leads people to&lt;br/&gt;resist beneficial change: they are apt to weigh perceived losses&lt;br/&gt;more than foregone gains.  Two, manipulation of the point of&lt;br/&gt;comparison affects how people perceive the advantages and&lt;br/&gt;disadvantages of reform proposals. Three, people underestimate or&lt;br/&gt;ignore various "unseen" elements of fiscal policy, such as&lt;br/&gt;imputed income and the incentive effects or opportunity costs of&lt;br/&gt;various tax and transfer programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We shall explore these effects in a series of experiments, some&lt;br/&gt;conducted on the World Wide Web and others conducted with other&lt;br/&gt;samples.  We shall examine these effects in a wide range of&lt;br/&gt;realistic tax reform proposals, e.g., those concerned with taxes&lt;br/&gt;on married couples, hidden taxes, payroll taxes, consumption&lt;br/&gt;taxes, taxes on imputed income, pollution taxes, and taxes that&lt;br/&gt;substitute for private expenditures (such as those that pay for&lt;br/&gt;health care).  Finally, we shall attempt to "debias" the effects&lt;br/&gt;of interest, and explore the transfer of training from one domain&lt;br/&gt;to another (in part by using samples of people who have already&lt;br/&gt;been trained in the economic theory of taxes).</AbstractNarration>
