<AbstractNarration>This project proposes to continue the efforts of the Student Meeting Activities Subcommittee of the Power Engineering Education Committee (PEEC) of the IEEE Power Engineering Society (PES) to promote student interest and participation in the power engineering field by sponsoring 90-100 electrical engineering students to attend the IEEE-PES annual Summer Meeting to be held in Chicago, Illinois July 21-25, 2002. The goal of this project is to provide an opportunity for students to be exposed to the most recent developments in design, operation, construction, and research in the power engineering field, to share ideas amongst themselves, and to interact with practicing engineers. This is a particularly critical time for power engineering as the industry undergoes significant change due to the restructuring of the traditional utility structure. It is crucial to recruit the nation's best and brightest engineering students into this evolving field. The career opportunities for students interested in power engineering are many and varied; opportunities exist within utilities, vendors, manufacturers, and consulting firms.</AbstractNarration>
