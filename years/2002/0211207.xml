<AbstractNarration>A sophomore-level course will be designed that introduces computer engineering&lt;br/&gt;fundamentals to pre-service science and math teachers in a highly interactive, hands-on&lt;br/&gt;environment, using active, cooperative learning methods. In cooperation with existing&lt;br/&gt;efforts, it will also be adapted to appeal to in-service teachers seeking a Masters degree in&lt;br/&gt;science or math education. It will illustrate how to use microprocessor based, mini-data&lt;br/&gt;acquisition systems, and robotics to create projects demonstrating physics and math&lt;br/&gt;concepts satisfying the Maine Learning Results and other national education standards.&lt;br/&gt;These materials will be distributed over the web.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A unique aspect of this effort will be the recruitment and engagement of honors-level&lt;br/&gt;first-year Electrical and Computer Engineering and pre-service College of Education&lt;br/&gt;students to help develop curricular content that will interest middle and high school&lt;br/&gt;students. In-service teachers will be included in the development of pedagogy that&lt;br/&gt;efficiently conveys the engineering material to future science and math teachers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will introduce the engineering application of science and math, as well as&lt;br/&gt;providing a bridge between such informal science innovations as First Robotics, First&lt;br/&gt;Lego League, Bot Ball, etc. and the classroom environment. The major benefit, however,&lt;br/&gt;to the engineering establishment will be the application of and emphasis on engineering&lt;br/&gt;concepts to the science/math K-12 infrastructure. Through this course, pre-service and&lt;br/&gt;in-service teachers will be equipped with the tools to illustrate engineering principles and&lt;br/&gt;how they relate to concepts normally taught in conventional science and math courses.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
