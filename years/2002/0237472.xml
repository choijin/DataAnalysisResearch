    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes to develop an Ultra-Violet (UV) water remediation process using a novel Surface Discharge Pulsed UV lamp (SD lamp) to treat organic contaminants. The objective of the Phase II research is to extend Phase I accomplishments and to develop a prototype Surface Discharge UV water treatment system for subsequent commercialization. For UV water treatment, the SD lamp offers advantages in terms of inherent UV efficiency, spectrum, high intensity and the absence of concerns linked to the use of mercury. Prior Phase I studies have shown that the effectiveness of SD lamps is greater than that of commercial mercury lamps by more than what would be expected based on UV efficiency alone. The proposed NSF Phase II Project will examine the reasons for this high effectiveness and to use this information in order to develop a Phase II prototype SD UV water remediation&lt;br/&gt;system. This Phase II work will be carried out in conjunction with a major UV water treatment company.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial application of this project will be in the area of water treatment. The Surface Discharge UV lamp is expected to replace mercury lamps currently used in most UV water treatment systems.</AbstractNarration>
