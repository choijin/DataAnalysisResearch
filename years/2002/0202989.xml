<AbstractNarration>The investigator proposes to study arithmetic questions arising in the &lt;br/&gt;theory of automorphic forms and linear algebraic groups, especially in &lt;br/&gt;the context of the Langlands program. As an example, it is well-known that &lt;br/&gt;a wealth of arithmetic information is contained in the Fourier &lt;br/&gt;coefficients of a classical modular form on the upper half plane. &lt;br/&gt;The investigator has an ongoing project (with B. Gross and G. Savin) &lt;br/&gt;to develope a theory of Fourier coefficients for certain modular forms on &lt;br/&gt;the exceptional group G2 and to extract arithmetic information from these &lt;br/&gt;coefficients. The investigator is also  &lt;br/&gt;interested in constructing and classifying arithmetically interesting &lt;br/&gt;cusp forms on reductive groups, and relating them to certain &lt;br/&gt;influential conjectures of Arthur. He intends to exploit the exceptional &lt;br/&gt;theta correspondence for the construction of some of these cusp forms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theory of automorphic forms is one of the main themes of modern &lt;br/&gt;mathematical research. Besides being a beautiful subject in its own &lt;br/&gt;right, it is intimately connected with other important areas of &lt;br/&gt;mathematics such as number theory (the study of &lt;br/&gt;properties of numbers, with applications to cryptography)&lt;br/&gt;and representation theory (the study of symmetries, with applications to &lt;br/&gt;physics). Often, it has surprising applications to concrete problems, such &lt;br/&gt;as the construction of Ramanujan graphs which are of great interest&lt;br/&gt;in communication and network theory. Particularly important and elusive in &lt;br/&gt;the theory of automrophic forms are certain primitive objects known as &lt;br/&gt;cusp forms. The investigator hopes to further our understanding of &lt;br/&gt;these basic objects by giving explicit constructions of some of them.</AbstractNarration>
