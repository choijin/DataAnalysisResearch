<AbstractNarration>This project will explore the chemistry of unusual organosulfur compounds of natural origin.  Initially, new organosulfur compounds from a variety of plants in the allium (garlic and onion) genus from Africa, South America and the Middle East will be isolated, identified and characterized.  Synthesis and study of the organic reaction chemistry of these new organosulfur compounds will then be investigated.  Thermal decomposition of the natural products will also be studied since this study will be relevant to the fate of the plant constituents upon cooking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this Minority Research Planning Grant award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. Rabi A. Musah of the Department of Chemistry at the State University of New York at Albany.  Dr. Musah will work on the isolation, identification, and characterization of new organosulfur compounds from a variety of plants in the allium (garlic and onion) genus from Africa, South America and the Middle East.  The synthesis and study of the organic reaction chemistry of these new organosulfur compounds will then be investigated.  Thermal decomposition of the natural products will also be studied since this study will be relevant to the fate of the plant constituents upon cooking.  Other plants within the allium genus are known to contain compounds with a host of biomedical science applications so there is a high probability that new compounds with biological activities will be discovered as a result of this work.  Students trained during the course of this work will gain skills needed by the speciality chemicals and pharmaceutical industries.</AbstractNarration>
