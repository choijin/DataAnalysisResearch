<AbstractNarration>Theoretical Morphology and Spatial Analysis of Trace Fossils&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Roy E. Plotnick&lt;br/&gt;University of Illinois at Chicago&lt;br/&gt;EAR-0207194&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trace fossils represent the preserved interactions of trace making organisms with their environment.  The exact forms of traces result from complex interactions among the organism's morphology, the behavior being carried out, the organism's perception of the environment, and the heterogeneity of the environment. The study of trace fossils thus allows us to study the evolution of animal movement in 'deep time'. Existing mathematical models for the biological formation of traces have tended to focus on a limited repertoire of behaviors, such as grazing.  They do not include realistic patterns of environmental heterogeneity, differences in perception, or multiple behavioral responses.  In addition, there have been almost no attempts to model three-dimensional traces, or traces that branch or anastomose.  New models for grazing and crawling traces will be built based on current research by ecologists into animal perception and movement patterns and their relationship to environmental heterogeneity.  These models will explore the interactions of alternative spatial patterns of environmental heterogeneity with different perceptions and behavioral responses to it.  They will also incorporate recent concepts in the study of artificial life.  The new models could suggest how behavioral patterns for a given trace-making organism might change as a function of environmental differences, such as resource distribution.  This could be a useful tool for determining such patterns of spatial heterogeneity in ancient environments.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
