<AbstractNarration>PROJECT SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HEMISPHERE: Developing a National High School Magnetometer Array.&lt;br/&gt;We propose to offer schools across the country the opportunity to measure and experiment&lt;br/&gt;with Earth's natural environment, to contribute data to the nation's space weather&lt;br/&gt;program, and to have effective teaching tools to educate young scientists about the space&lt;br/&gt;environment. We have developed a relatively inexpensive, robust, sensitive magnetometer in&lt;br/&gt;kit form that can be purchased and distributed to schools, assembled by students, then set&lt;br/&gt;up and used to take research-quality data. Teachers will be trained in their operation and&lt;br/&gt;how to use them in classroom activities that demonstrate "space-weather." The data will be&lt;br/&gt;transmitted through a Web-based database, so that students can compare their local&lt;br/&gt;readings with those of students at other sites around the continent and can be used by&lt;br/&gt;university and other researchers to study geomagnetic Ultra-Low Frequency (ULF) waves.&lt;br/&gt;Low- to mid- latitude magnetic pulsations provide important information about the solar&lt;br/&gt;wind-magnetosphere interaction and the dynamic coupling of the magnetosphere and&lt;br/&gt;ionosphere. The magnetic variations observable at low to mid latitudes include: Pc 3-4&lt;br/&gt;pulsations (periods of 10-45 s), which are thought to have their source in the upstream&lt;br/&gt;bow shock and or magnetosheath; and Pi 2 bursts (damped pulsations with 40-150-s periods)&lt;br/&gt;which are associated with substorm expansion onsets. This proposal seeks funding to train&lt;br/&gt;Master High School science teachers in the use of induction coil magnetometers, provide&lt;br/&gt;the basic space science content needed for the understanding of magnetic pulsation data in&lt;br/&gt;space physics research, and develop mentoring relationships between space physicists and&lt;br/&gt;local high school science teachers and their students. These relationships will allow the&lt;br/&gt;magnetometer data to be fully utilized both scientifically as well as educationally.&lt;br/&gt;Specifically we plan to develop the documentation for the magnetometer, training material&lt;br/&gt;for testing the instrument, and educational material for using the instrument in the&lt;br/&gt;classroom. This material will be the basis for a one-week teacher workshop at UCLA&lt;br/&gt;bringing together six geographically diverse science teachers that have already gone&lt;br/&gt;through a space weather workshop at NOAA Space Environment Center in order to train them&lt;br/&gt;as Master Teachers in the use and implementation of the magnetometer. This project&lt;br/&gt;directly impacts pre-college education by providing High Schools with real-life space&lt;br/&gt;physics instrumentation and ULF data for analysis.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
