<AbstractNarration>Numerical simulations are replacing traditional experiments in gaining  insights into complex physical phenomena. Given recent advances in computer hardware and numerical methods,  it is now possible to simulate  physical phenomena at very fine temporal and spatial resolutions. As a result, the the amount of data generated is overwhelming. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scientists are interested in analyzing and visualizing the data produced by such simulations to better understand the process that is being simulated. Analyzing such large scale data is  hard. Not only the methods used are computationally expense, current programming tools make  the analysis difficult to specify and modify. Thus, there is a dire need for a systematic approach, along with  supporting  algorithms  and methodologies for flexible  parallel implementations,  to achieve scalable and interactive analysis  on large scientific datasets. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project,  we propose the construction of such a scalable toolkit, namely the Computational Analysis Toolkit (CAT). This toolkit proposes to exploit ongoing work in feature analysis, scalable data mining and parallel programing environments. The crux of the approach is  feature-mining; a process where by regions  are delineated through various stages of detection, verification, &lt;br/&gt;de-noising, and  tracking of points of interest.  Additionally, we propose the use of some key data mining mining algorithms for achieving enhanced and robust implementations of  feature-mining  algorithms. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is our objective that the CAT toolkit should not only allow for the  detection of features but also provide for a means to control the analysis in an interactive setting.  For example,  demographic and lifetime analysis of certain critical features as determined by the user/scientist may be an important way of understanding the underlying process being simulated. These critical features,  once tagged via a suitable interface, can be profiled and a concise  representation this profile can then be presented to the user as needed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We believe that for long-term use of a tool for feature and data mining, it is  important  that a) the  algorithms are parallelized on a  variety of platforms, b) the parallel implementations  are  easy  to maintain and modify, and c) APIs are available for users to rapidly create scalable implementations of new mining algorithms. We are proposing to achieve these goals by using and extending a parallelization framework developed locally. This framework, referred to as FRamework for Rapid Implementations of Datamining Engines (FREERIDE),  offers high-level APIs and runtime techniques to enable parallelization of algorithms  for data mining and related tasks.   It allows parallelization on both distributed memory and shared memory configurations, and further  supports efficient processing of disk-resident datasets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal,  besides providing a useful toolkit,  is likely  engender   the use of methodologies for large data exploration.    Our efforts are likely to contribute to literature in scalable  data and feature mining algorithms, and feature profile summarization.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
