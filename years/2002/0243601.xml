<AbstractNarration>   The investigator will try to generalize the well-known Kronecker's&lt;br/&gt;first limit formula to `holomorphic' Eisenstein series with characters&lt;br/&gt;and study the tangent line of the Eisenstein series. He will then apply&lt;br/&gt;the results to study the central derivative of automorphic L-functions.&lt;br/&gt;In the second project, He, Kudla, and Rapoport will continue Kudla's &lt;br/&gt;fundamental work on the the central derivative of incoherent Eisenstein &lt;br/&gt;series. In particular, they will prove that the central derivative of&lt;br/&gt;certain incoherent Eisenstein series is the generating function of zero&lt;br/&gt;cycles on an arithmetic Shimura surface. He is also working with M. Stoll&lt;br/&gt;on the arithmetic nature of a very nice genus two curve in relation with&lt;br/&gt;the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture. Finally, he is studying the&lt;br/&gt;exterior cube automorphic L-series of GU(3, 3) in relation with the &lt;br/&gt;associated Shimura variety. &lt;br/&gt;  Number theory has been one of the most amazing subjects to study for &lt;br/&gt;more than two thousand years and will continue to be so. Even more so &lt;br/&gt;is its surprising and beautiful applications to communications and&lt;br/&gt;cryptography discovered during last 20 years. Automorphic forms and &lt;br/&gt;Eisenstein series the investigator is working on is at the heart of&lt;br/&gt;the modern number theory. Its advances would not only further our&lt;br/&gt;understanding of the deep and beautiful subject of number theory but &lt;br/&gt;also find its way to improve our daily life in the e-world.</AbstractNarration>
