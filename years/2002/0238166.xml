<AbstractNarration>Efforts to create low cost,high performance communication systems in the future will be chal-&lt;br/&gt;lenged by the high cost of developing new interface circuits that are suited to their needs.These&lt;br/&gt;interface circuits serve as the intermediary between real world signals,which are analog in nature,&lt;br/&gt;and the digital processing engines at the core of the system.Current interface circuits are primarily&lt;br/&gt;analog in their implementation,which makes their performance highly sensitive to manufacturing&lt;br/&gt;variations in the process they are fabricated in,and to noise generated by digital circuits that&lt;br/&gt;operate on the same chip.The impact of this sensitivity is that interface circuits must be custom&lt;br/&gt;designed for the process they are implemented in,cannot be easily integrated with their adjoining&lt;br/&gt;digital processor,and are often very restricted in their ability to serve a wide variety of applica-&lt;br/&gt;tions.The resulting lack of portability of these circuits leads to high development costs since they&lt;br/&gt;generally must be redesigned from scratch for new systems.&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the proposed research is to develop new interface circuit architectures that can be&lt;br/&gt;leveraged over a wide variety of fabrication processes and applications,and thereby dramatically&lt;br/&gt;reduce the cost of their implementation in future communication applications.This goal will be&lt;br/&gt;achieved by replacing a signi .cant portion of the analog circuitry in the interface with digital&lt;br/&gt;circuits that realize the required functionality through signal processing techniques that will be&lt;br/&gt;developed as part of this e .ort.This implementation philosophy will lead to dramatically di .erent&lt;br/&gt;interface architectures than in use today,and will provide new insights into the tradeo .s between&lt;br/&gt;using analog versus digital circuitry for given function and performance requirements.&lt;br/&gt;New simulation models and software tools will be developed to facilitate the process of exploring&lt;br/&gt;new system architectures and their accompanying circuits.The simulation modeling e .ort will&lt;br/&gt;be focused on obtaining accurate behavioral level descriptions of analog components in digital&lt;br/&gt;circuit simulators,which will allow straightforward evaluation of the impact of di .erent signal&lt;br/&gt;processing algorithms on the overall system performance.The software development e .ort will be&lt;br/&gt;directed toward better integrating system level and transistor level simulation tools,and providing&lt;br/&gt;estimation of the impact of extrinsic factors such as substrate noise.&lt;br/&gt;A new educational course will be developed at MIT that passes on the knowledge and tools ac-&lt;br/&gt;quired in this research program.The class will teach high speed circuit techniques for both analog&lt;br/&gt;and digital components.System level concepts will be explored through a combination of mathe-&lt;br/&gt;matical analysis and interactive numerical simulation using the custom models and software tools.&lt;br/&gt;It will examine the impact of circuit limitations on system performance,and explore ways of iter-&lt;br/&gt;ating between circuit and system designs to achieve the best overall system performance.Through&lt;br/&gt;MIT 's OpenCourseWare initiative,the course materials and software will be made available to&lt;br/&gt;other universities as well as industry.Dissemination of the course through the OpenCourseWare&lt;br/&gt;program will allow students and industry designers from a variety of ethnic,economic,and geo-&lt;br/&gt;graphic backgrounds to have access to state of the art techniques and tools for interface circuit&lt;br/&gt;design.</AbstractNarration>
