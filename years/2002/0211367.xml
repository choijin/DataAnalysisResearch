<AbstractNarration>Cosner&lt;br/&gt;0211367&lt;br/&gt;     The investigators derive and analyze mathematical models&lt;br/&gt;that describe how spatial aspects of the environment and the ways&lt;br/&gt;that organisms utilize space and disperse through it influence&lt;br/&gt;the dynamics of populations and the structure of ecological&lt;br/&gt;communities.  The underlying motivation for the project is to gain&lt;br/&gt;a better understanding of how spatial effects can threaten or&lt;br/&gt;maintain biodiversity or affect interactions between important&lt;br/&gt;types of organisms such as crops, pests, and biological control&lt;br/&gt;agents.  The project is focused primarily on edge-mediated&lt;br/&gt;effects in habitat fragments and on the effects of nonrandom&lt;br/&gt;dispersal.  The main goal is to gain insight into the ways that&lt;br/&gt;edge-mediated effects and dispersal behavior influence the&lt;br/&gt;persistence or extinction of species.  Understanding edge-mediated&lt;br/&gt;effects is important because one of the most significant ways in&lt;br/&gt;which humans alter natural environments is by fragmenting&lt;br/&gt;habitats and thus creating edges.  The investigators study many&lt;br/&gt;spatial effects, including edge-mediated effects, via&lt;br/&gt;reaction-diffusion models.  However, reaction-diffusion models&lt;br/&gt;assume random dispersal, and the dispersal patterns of some&lt;br/&gt;organisms are affected by behavioral responses to the presence of&lt;br/&gt;prey, predators, or conspecifics.  Reaction-diffusion equations&lt;br/&gt;cannot capture those effects, so the investigators model them&lt;br/&gt;with more general forms of quasilinear parabolic partial&lt;br/&gt;differential equations.  The investigators use methods and&lt;br/&gt;results from the theory of partial differential equations,&lt;br/&gt;dynamical systems, and nonlinear functional analysis to develop&lt;br/&gt;the mathematical framework needed to analyze the models.&lt;br/&gt;     The investigators study mathematical models for the ways&lt;br/&gt;that plant and animal populations are affected by the size and&lt;br/&gt;spatial structure of the environment they inhabit and by the way&lt;br/&gt;they move or spread through the environment.  The goal of the&lt;br/&gt;project is to gain a better theoretical understanding of how&lt;br/&gt;spatial effects influence the persistence or extinction of&lt;br/&gt;populations.  The underlying motivation is to provide insights&lt;br/&gt;into the impact of spatial effects on biodiversity and on&lt;br/&gt;economically important organisms such as crops and pests.  The&lt;br/&gt;potential practical benefits of the project are improvements in&lt;br/&gt;decision making in areas such as land management, conservation,&lt;br/&gt;and urban planning.  Much of the project is focused on the&lt;br/&gt;effects of habitat edges, because one of the main effects of&lt;br/&gt;human activity on the environment is to divide it into fragments&lt;br/&gt;and create edges, for example by building roads.  Different&lt;br/&gt;organisms respond to edges in different ways; for example, a new&lt;br/&gt;road may isolate a population of one species of animals that&lt;br/&gt;refuse to cross it but may add to the mortality of another&lt;br/&gt;species of animals that do attempt to cross.  When population&lt;br/&gt;interactions such as predation by one species upon another are&lt;br/&gt;combined with spatial effects, the results can be complex and&lt;br/&gt;sometimes counterintuitive.  To understand them the investigators&lt;br/&gt;derive mathematical equations that incorporate spatial effects&lt;br/&gt;and population interactions and analyze those equations to&lt;br/&gt;determine when they predict persistence of populations versus&lt;br/&gt;when they predict extinction.  To conduct the analysis the&lt;br/&gt;investigators use and develop various mathematical methods.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
