<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Kalton&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this proposal, the aim  is to study a number  of problems&lt;br/&gt;related to Banach space  theory and its applications.   Part&lt;br/&gt;of the project  deals with the  theory of extensions  of one&lt;br/&gt;Banach space by another.  For example it is planned to study&lt;br/&gt;the problem  of classifying  those Banach  spaces such  that&lt;br/&gt;every minimal  extension is  trivial.   This problem  can be&lt;br/&gt;reformulated as a  problem in approximation  theory.  It  is&lt;br/&gt;also  planned  to  study  applications  to  problems  in the&lt;br/&gt;nonlinear theory  of Banach  spaces, related  to problems of&lt;br/&gt;existence  of  uniform  homeomorphisms  between  two  Banach&lt;br/&gt;spaces or between their unit balls.  In a somewhat different&lt;br/&gt;direction  the  proposer  plans  to  continue  his   ongoing&lt;br/&gt;research on  Rademacher-bounded families  of operators  with&lt;br/&gt;applications to sectorial operators and semigroups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theory of extensions can be considered in the  following&lt;br/&gt;terms.  Suppose we are given a centrally symmetric solid  in&lt;br/&gt;three or more dimensions and we are allowed only to  compute&lt;br/&gt;its  cross-section  by  a  slice  in some directions and the&lt;br/&gt;shadow cast  by the  body in  the perpendicular  directions.&lt;br/&gt;This gives us some information about the solid, but does not&lt;br/&gt;permit  complete  reconstruction.    The  idea  of  studying&lt;br/&gt;extensions is to obtain more complete information about  the&lt;br/&gt;body under certain additional conditions.  Many questions of&lt;br/&gt;importance  in   mathematical  analysis   and  applications,&lt;br/&gt;although  not  formally  expressed  in  this  way,  can   be&lt;br/&gt;visualized in terms of extensions.  Sectorial operators  are&lt;br/&gt;of importance  in the  basic theory  of partial differential&lt;br/&gt;equations  of  evolution  type;  such  equations  are   very&lt;br/&gt;important in physical  applications.  Typically  a sectorial&lt;br/&gt;operator is a differential operator acting on some  suitable&lt;br/&gt;space  of  functions.    By  understanding the properties of&lt;br/&gt;sectorial  operators  and  the  semigroups they generate one&lt;br/&gt;gains a better understanding of the behavior of solutions of&lt;br/&gt;certain partial differential equations.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
