<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)Phase I Project proposes to develop a microarray-based biosensor for on-site, real-time identification and enumeration of multiple environmental microorganisms from aqueous and/or aerosol samples with high sensitivity and specificity. The operation of the biosensor will be based on a recently developed novel technology involving  grating-coupled surface plasmon resonance (GCSPR). The proposed biosensor system, with the capability for continuous on-line monitoring, would have numerous applications where rapid assessment of a contaminated environment would be needed. The specific objectives of the Phase I project are (a) to engineer the manner in which aerosol and aqueous samples will be delivered to the GC-SPR biosensor flow cell, and (b) to assess and optimize the performance of the biosensor in the detection of a prototype microbial target. In the follow-on Phase II project, specific target pathogens will be selected and specific chips will be constructed to detect these pathogens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial applications of this project are expected to be in a large number of locations. They include (1) hospitals, where nosocomial infections may arise; (2) office buildings, where accidental contamination with mold spores, Legionella and other pathogens may create health hazards; (3) natural bodies of water or commercial water supplies, where Cryptosporidium, coliform bacteria and several other waterborne pathogens are of great concern ; and (4) the food industry, where there is a need for sensitive methods for on-line and real-time detection of pathogens. Finally, the proposed technology will provide for rapid, on-site detection of biological agents, such as spores of Bacillus anthracis, that may be intentionally introduced into the environment.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
