<AbstractNarration>Proposal ID DMS-0208301&lt;br/&gt;International Conference in&lt;br/&gt;Reliability and Survival Analysis 2003&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(PI: Edsel Pena, Ph.D.; Co-PIs: James Lynch, Ph.D., William Padgett, Ph. D.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Department of Statistics, and its Center for Reliability and Quality Sciences, at the University of South Carolina in Columbia will organize the International Conference on Reliability and Survival Analysis 2003 (ICRSA2003) to be held on the University's historic campus from May 21-24, 2003. The objectives of this conference are to bring together senior and established researchers and young and promising researchers from around the world who are working in the theoretical and applied aspects of reliability, survival analysis, and related topics in order to share recent advances and current research, as well as future research trends, in these areas. Through this conference, it is expected that interaction and/or collaborative work among reliability and survival analysis researchers will be fostered, which will enhance and accelerate developments in both areas. As it currently exists, the reliability and survival analysis disciplines have developed somewhat separately, but there is much to be gained by recognizing similarities between them since both deal with the stochastic modeling and statistical analysis of failure-time data, usually in the presence of incomplete information. This conference, which will be the first since 1998 to be held in the United States focused simultaneously on reliability and survival analysis, will enable many researchers in the United States to participate, especially new researchers and graduate students, as the cost and accessibility for participation is more viable.  Plenary talks and invited talks will be given by leading researchers in reliability and survival analysis, and contributed talks and poster sessions will be solicited from advanced graduate students and new researchers, especially from under-represented groups. The funding provided by the National Science Foundation will enable partial financial support of the plenary speakers, new researchers, and graduate students. New researchers and graduate students from under-represented groups will be particularly encouraged to seek funding from this NSF support.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
