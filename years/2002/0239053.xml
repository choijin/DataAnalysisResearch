<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;        Mixture models, which can be viewed also as clustering&lt;br/&gt;        techniques, have become widely used statistical tools in the&lt;br/&gt;        analysis of heterogeneous data, aiding researchers in&lt;br/&gt;        interpreting existing data or in classifying new data. This&lt;br/&gt;        project extends the current interests of the PI in mixture&lt;br/&gt;        models to new directions while integrating them into&lt;br/&gt;        education. It is well known that under the normal mixture&lt;br/&gt;        model with unequal variance, the likelihood is unbounded and&lt;br/&gt;        hence the global maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) does not&lt;br/&gt;        exist. High-dimensional data analysis is becoming increasingly&lt;br/&gt;        important in many applied fields, including bioinformatics,&lt;br/&gt;        astronomy and imaging. Moreover, finding the nonparametric MLE&lt;br/&gt;        is widely regarded as computationally intensive, with the&lt;br/&gt;        particular difficulty being locating the mass points. To&lt;br/&gt;        address these issues this project will (1) establish&lt;br/&gt;        spacings-based inferential tools and asymptotic theory for the&lt;br/&gt;        normal mixtures with unequal variances to overcome the&lt;br/&gt;        limitations of the likelihood approach; (2) generalize these&lt;br/&gt;        methods to multivariate normal mixture model; (3) develop&lt;br/&gt;        theory and algorithms for multivariate mixtures via the&lt;br/&gt;        penalized dual method; (4) develop methods for solving&lt;br/&gt;        nonparametric mixture problems; (5) extend the multivariate&lt;br/&gt;        mixture methods to identify features in spatial patterns and&lt;br/&gt;        in turn develop efficient pattern recognition algorithms for&lt;br/&gt;        use in hyperspectral image classification, mammography and&lt;br/&gt;        minefield detection; and (6) integrate research and education&lt;br/&gt;        to advance discovery and understanding of mixtures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        This project will: (1) promote discovery and understanding of&lt;br/&gt;        the mixture models for modeling univariate and multivariate&lt;br/&gt;        heterogeneous data; (2) broaden and initiate new applications&lt;br/&gt;        to advance mixture models to new frontiers; (3) promote&lt;br/&gt;        collaborative learning and foster critical thinking through&lt;br/&gt;        student involvement in the PI's research projects; (4) build a&lt;br/&gt;        firm foundation for the PI in contributing to a&lt;br/&gt;        well-integrated research and education program in the theory,&lt;br/&gt;        computation and application of mixture models and related&lt;br/&gt;        areas; (5) impart education that will train a new generation&lt;br/&gt;        of scientists and engineers capable of developing mixture&lt;br/&gt;        models tools to solve important problems arising from new&lt;br/&gt;        frontiers of biology, engineering and medicine; (6) result in&lt;br/&gt;        offering an interdisciplinary course in mixture models and&lt;br/&gt;        applications to graduate students, enabling and promoting&lt;br/&gt;        interactions between statistics and allied fields; (7) enhance&lt;br/&gt;        multidisciplinary research experience for students through the&lt;br/&gt;        PI's collaborations and partnerships with the U.S. Navy and&lt;br/&gt;        international scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
