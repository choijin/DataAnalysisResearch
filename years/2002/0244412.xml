<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS 0244412&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Sheldon Katz&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;String theory has had a spectacular impact on many areas of&lt;br/&gt;modern mathematics, including algebraic geometry, differential&lt;br/&gt;geometry, topology, representation theory, analysis and&lt;br/&gt;combinatorial geometry.  In particular, string dualities suggest&lt;br/&gt;unexpected relations between these diverse areas, many of which&lt;br/&gt;have been proven mathematically.  Recent advances in matrix model&lt;br/&gt;techniques suggest further relations in mathematics.  It can now&lt;br/&gt;be expected that number theory will become related as well.  It&lt;br/&gt;is proposed to investigate unifying themes in duality symmetries&lt;br/&gt;in search of a deeper understanding of these symmetries.  It is&lt;br/&gt;also proposed to work on a range of mathematical problems which&lt;br/&gt;these dualities inspire.  Particular dualities include mirror&lt;br/&gt;symmetry, originally elucidated in the context of Gromov-Witten&lt;br/&gt;theory, and S-dualities, which are duality symmetries of&lt;br/&gt;supersymmetric gauge theories and string theories.  More recently&lt;br/&gt;both have been related to Matrix integrals.  In the case of&lt;br/&gt;supersymmetric gauge theories this gives a relation between&lt;br/&gt;perturbative Feynman diagrams on the one hand and certain&lt;br/&gt;computations on moduli spaces of instantons on the other, which&lt;br/&gt;the PIs propose to elucidate further.  In the particular case of&lt;br/&gt;Gromov-Witten theory, connections have been found with knot&lt;br/&gt;theory.  This leads to a complete computation of the&lt;br/&gt;corresponding invariants for non-compact toric Calabi-Yau&lt;br/&gt;threefolds. The PIs propose to extend these ideas to the compact&lt;br/&gt;case.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs will be exploiting existing connections and forging new&lt;br/&gt;ones between physics and mathematics to address a wide range of&lt;br/&gt;cutting-edge open problems in both fields.  These ideas are&lt;br/&gt;expected to create new links between diverse areas of&lt;br/&gt;mathematics, as certain ideas in physics are equivalent to&lt;br/&gt;important unsolved problems in mathematics.  The techniques&lt;br/&gt;introduced into mathematics are expected to have a revolutionary&lt;br/&gt;influence on core areas of mathematics as related techniques have&lt;br/&gt;in the past.  This project occurs at the same time as an ongoing&lt;br/&gt;effort by the string theory community and will help set future&lt;br/&gt;directions in that field.  String theory seeks to unify the force&lt;br/&gt;of gravity with the electromagnetic and nuclear forces; this is&lt;br/&gt;the problem that eluded Einstein.  It is anticipated that&lt;br/&gt;numerous diverse areas of mathematics will become related to each&lt;br/&gt;other in unexpected ways and that this will have profound&lt;br/&gt;consequences for mathematics and physics.  Due to the broad scope&lt;br/&gt;of the project, a multi-disciplinary and multi-institutional&lt;br/&gt;approach is indicated.  The PIs will be bringing together their&lt;br/&gt;networks of collaborators, postdocs, and graduate students and&lt;br/&gt;directing an intense collaborative effort in these areas.  An&lt;br/&gt;interdisciplinary math/physics curriculum will be created to&lt;br/&gt;train future leaders in areas at the interface of mathematics and&lt;br/&gt;physics.  The PIs will expand their use of existing internet&lt;br/&gt;videoconferencing technologies for collaborative purposes, and&lt;br/&gt;will organize workshops on the topics of this project. This is a&lt;br/&gt;joint award of the Division of Mathematical Sciences programs in&lt;br/&gt;Geometric Analysis and Algebra, Number Theory, &amp; Combinatorics, and&lt;br/&gt;the Physics Division program in Mathematical Physics.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
