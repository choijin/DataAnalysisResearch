<AbstractNarration>      The principal investigator intends primarily to pursue the goal of &lt;br/&gt;attacking some of the fundamental problems of the Langlands program by &lt;br/&gt;means of analytic methods. He is most interested in the case of base &lt;br/&gt;change for holomorphic forms on GL(2) where a non-soluble base change is &lt;br/&gt;involved, but the proposed methods should work much more generally. &lt;br/&gt;At present the intention is to permit the use of the Riemann Hypothesis &lt;br/&gt;(in an appropriate setting) to achieve this goal. A second goal of the &lt;br/&gt;proposal is to study some of the fundamental analytic questions on &lt;br/&gt;L-functions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;      This proposal is ultimately concerned with finding methods to solve &lt;br/&gt;equations. Since the nineteenth century it has been known that certain &lt;br/&gt;equations have formulas (like the quadratic equation and the cubic &lt;br/&gt;equation) but that most do not. The cases that interest me are the &lt;br/&gt;equations with ordinary integer coefficients. It has become apparent in &lt;br/&gt;the last fifty years that there should be a completely different way of &lt;br/&gt;studying these general equations by using methods from analysis &lt;br/&gt;(i.e. derived from calculus) rather than by using methods from algebra. &lt;br/&gt;The idea is to describe and prove many properties of the solutions (which &lt;br/&gt;still exist even though there may be no formulas for them). &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
