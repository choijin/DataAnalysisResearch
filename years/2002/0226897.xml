<AbstractNarration>A major obstacle in developing scientific literacy is the misconceptions that people have and which they will retain unless the misconceptions are identified and challenged methodically. A powerful approach for the identification of and challenge to misconceptions is the 5E teaching cycle (engage, explore, explain, elaborate and evaluate).  Although this approach has been applied somewhat in K-12 education, it has seldom been used at the college level, especially for large enrollment courses. The objective of this project is to identify and address misconceptions about ecology and evolution using the 5E teaching cycle in large enrollment courses.  The project is focusing on developing pre- and post-assessments that identify misconceptions for each unit of the courses, by applying results and techniques of published studies about misconceptions.  Assessments are being tested at other institutions.  In addition, 5E teaching cycles are being developed that explicitly challenge the misconceptions.  Excellent materials for engaging students and appropriate instructional technology for the 5E phases are already available, but what is needed is assembly of these into effective 5E cycles and linked units.  The 5E cycles will be developed and tested. The aim is that: 1) students develop a better conceptual understanding of ecology and evolution, 2) students have a more positive attitude about science, 3) students have a more positive experience in large enrollment courses, and 4) future teachers learn how to implement the 5E teaching cycle.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
