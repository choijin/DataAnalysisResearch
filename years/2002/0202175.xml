<AbstractNarration>"Biodiversity of the Russian Far East" is a long-term international effort&lt;br/&gt;to document the diversity of plants and animals that occupy the landmasses&lt;br/&gt;that surround and enclose the Sea of Okhotsk.  This region is one of the&lt;br/&gt;most biologically diverse yet poorly known areas within the northern hemisphere.  At the same time, compared to most other high-latitude regions of&lt;br/&gt;comparable size around the world, its biota is relatively undisturbed.&lt;br/&gt;For political reasons, but also because of its remoteness and severe&lt;br/&gt;climate, all but a few Russian biologists have ignored this region.&lt;br/&gt;Information about the plants and animals of Okhotskia is largely unknown&lt;br/&gt;outside of Russian and what little is available is published in Russian&lt;br/&gt;and thus relatively inaccessible.  Each summer since 1994, three-dozen&lt;br/&gt;scientists, along with their students, from the University of Washington,&lt;br/&gt;the Far East Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, and the Sapporo&lt;br/&gt;and Hakodate campuses of Hokkaido University, Japan, spend eight weeks&lt;br/&gt;exploring remote islands and continental shorelines, utilizing land-based&lt;br/&gt;field stations or ocean-going Russian research vessels.  While our primary&lt;br/&gt;center of focus has been the island biotas of the Kuril Archipelago, our&lt;br/&gt;destination over the next two years will be Sakhalin Island.  Our goals&lt;br/&gt;are to record the detailed species-level diversity of life in aquatic and&lt;br/&gt;terrestrial habitats of the Russian Far East as a prologue to&lt;br/&gt;investigations of biological patterns and processes, and as a basis for&lt;br/&gt;the development of conservation strategies for this part of the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Biological materials from lichens to liverworts, from spiders to frogs are&lt;br/&gt;being collected, curated, and made available to specialists around the&lt;br/&gt;world.  Dozens of species new to science are being named, described, and&lt;br/&gt;classified, and numerous scientific and popular articles are being&lt;br/&gt;published.  In the area of conservation, our work is providing an&lt;br/&gt;important foundation of information that will promote long-term&lt;br/&gt;environmental protection of these unique biotas.  Finally, our&lt;br/&gt;biodiversity studies in the Russian Far East contribute significantly to&lt;br/&gt;education and to the development of human resources in science at the&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate, graduate, and post-graduate levels.  Since 1994, the&lt;br/&gt;project has provided financial support and direct involvement in field and&lt;br/&gt;laboratory research for dozens of students.  With major responsibility for&lt;br/&gt;collecting, identification, and curation, as well as data collection,&lt;br/&gt;analysis, and interpretation, students share authorship on scientific&lt;br/&gt;publications.  International collaborative interaction between students&lt;br/&gt;and scientists of diverse interest and training provides unique&lt;br/&gt;opportunities to address important new questions ranging from comparative&lt;br/&gt;biology to conservation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
