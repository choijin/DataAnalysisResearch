<AbstractNarration>In June of 2003 the World Archaeological Congress (WAC) will hold its first full international Congress in North America in Washington D.C. WAC 5 will bring together hundreds of scholars, Indigenous Peoples, and others genuinely interested in the past to promote the exchange of the results of archaeological research; professional training and public education for disadvantaged nations, groups, Indigenous groups and First Nations peoples; and the conservation of archaeological sites. The Congress is expected to attract about 1100 people who will meet together for five days, attending approximately 800 presentations from as many as 70 different countries.  The National Science Foundation will support attendance at the congress by 5 Third World scholars and Indigenous People.  WAC 5 is being held in partnership with the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History, and National Museum of the American Indian and in collaboration with the Getty Conservation Institute.  Supporters of WAC 5 include: US National Park Service, Archeology and Ethnography Program, US Dept of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service, Flinders University, South Australia, American University, Library of Congress, Society for American Archaeology, and the US Bureau of Land Management.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Congress will focus on three major issues of international importance to archaeology:&lt;br/&gt;1. programmatic/policy issues concerning future directions in the practice of global archaeology.&lt;br/&gt;2. practical/ technical knowledge to increase self-reliance and responsibility in protecting sites, artifacts and intellectual property.&lt;br/&gt;3. theoretical frontiers and research results with relevance across national boundaries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WAC 5 will contribute to advancing knowledge and understanding in archaeology and it will have broader impacts on the world.  WAC congresses have been unique in their ability to bring together international researchers for the sharing of research results, the forging of theoretical advances, and the development of archaeological methods.  They have facilitated international cooperation on issues of heritage management, the conservation of archaeological sites, and on relations between archaeologists and indigenous peoples.  WAC 5 will continue this tradition by bringing together archaeologists and Indigenous People from around the world in a structured program to advance knowledge and understanding in archaeology.  The Congress will also include public programs, workshops on the curation and conservation of archaeological materials, and symposiums on heritage management designed to promote teaching, training, and learning and to develop international infrastructure for networks and partnerships on these themes. WAC 5 will help broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in archaeology.  The governance structure of WAC gives Third World Scholars and Indigenous people a prominent role in the organization. Third World Scholars and Indigenous people have made up a third to a half of the participants in previous congresses. WAC 5 can only achieve these goals with the participation of many people from underdeveloped countries and Indigenous People who cannot afford the high travel costs to Washington D.C. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
