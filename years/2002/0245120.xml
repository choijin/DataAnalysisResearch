<AbstractNarration>The goal of the project is to study the geometry and topology of certain special &lt;br/&gt;moduli spaces arising in complex algebraic geometry.  Here, "special" means that &lt;br/&gt;they may be described as quotients of Hermitian symmetric spaces by discrete &lt;br/&gt;groups.  (There are surprisingly many examples of these spaces.)  The first &lt;br/&gt;specific goal is to understand the topology of a large family of these spaces &lt;br/&gt;that includes the moduli spaces of polarized smooth K3 surfaces and several other &lt;br/&gt;examples arising in singularity theory.  By "understand the topology of" we mean &lt;br/&gt;that we beleive these spaces have contractible universal covers, and we want to &lt;br/&gt;prove this.  The idea is to use tools from the theory of negatively-curved metric &lt;br/&gt;spaces that generalize the idea of a negatively-curved Riemannian manifold.  The &lt;br/&gt;second specific goal is to complete a joint project with J. Carlson and D. Toledo, &lt;br/&gt;to prove that the moduli space of cubic hypersurfaces in 4-dimensional projective &lt;br/&gt;space is isomorphic to a quotient of the complex 10-ball by a certain discrete &lt;br/&gt;group.  The third specific goal is to close the last open aspect of Hilbert's &lt;br/&gt;14th problem, by showing that there is a representation of the 2-dimensional &lt;br/&gt;additive group for which the ring of invariants is not finitely generated. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project addresses concrete problems in algebraic geometry concerning the &lt;br/&gt;classification of various objects like curves and surfaces.  Algebraic geometry &lt;br/&gt;as a subject deals with curves and surfaces that can be defined by means of &lt;br/&gt;equations, and also with higher-dimensional versions of these curves and surfaces.  &lt;br/&gt;An example giving the flavor of the classification problem is that a circle is &lt;br/&gt;essentially the same as an ellipse, because one of them can be got from the other &lt;br/&gt;by stretching the plane in one direction.  An ellipse is also essentially the same &lt;br/&gt;as a parabola, because you can imagine keeping one end of the ellipse fixed and &lt;br/&gt;pushing the other off to infinity.  You can go even further and push the end off &lt;br/&gt;past infinity, so that it reappears on the other side of the plane, and you see a &lt;br/&gt;hyperbola.  An algebraic geometer expresses these ideas by saying that any two &lt;br/&gt;conics are "projectively equivalent".  What these shapes all have in common is &lt;br/&gt;that they are defined by simple equations--two variables, and only terms of degree &lt;br/&gt;two or less.  A major part of modern algebraic geometry is studying similar &lt;br/&gt;questions but with the number of variables increased, or the complexity of the &lt;br/&gt;equations increased to allow higher-degree polynomials.  For example, it turns &lt;br/&gt;out that not all curves in the plane that are defined by degree three equations &lt;br/&gt;are projectively equivalent.  The ways in which these curves can differ from each &lt;br/&gt;other is very important for many fields of mathematics and even physics.  This &lt;br/&gt;example was understood in the 19th century, but similar problems remain open.  &lt;br/&gt;One purpose of the current proposal is to gain an understanding of how the &lt;br/&gt;projective equivalence classes of the degree-three "surfaces" in four-dimensional &lt;br/&gt;space can vary.  We believe that this may be described in a beautiful and &lt;br/&gt;surprising way using the unit sphere in 10-dimensional complex space.  This result &lt;br/&gt;would be similar to a classical result for degree three curves in the plane.  We &lt;br/&gt;want to prove that our intuition is right.  Another problem to address is that of &lt;br/&gt;finishing a part of Hilbert's 14th problem, one of the celebrated problems posed &lt;br/&gt;by David Hilbert at the beginning of the 20th century.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
