<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;PI: Brian C. Hall, University of Notre Dame&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0200649&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI's research concerns the quantization of certain&lt;br/&gt;special classical systems, those whose classical configuration&lt;br/&gt;space is a compact symmetric space, such as a sphere. The&lt;br/&gt;simplest physical example of such a system is (the rotational&lt;br/&gt;degrees of freedom of) a rigid body, whose configuration space is&lt;br/&gt;the rotation group SO(3). The phase space of any such system,&lt;br/&gt;namely, the cotangent bundle of the compact symmetric space, has&lt;br/&gt;a natural complex structure that makes the phase space into a&lt;br/&gt;Kahler manifold. Thus the quantization of such a system can be&lt;br/&gt;done in two ways, one using the usual position Hilbert space and&lt;br/&gt;the other using a Hilbert space of holomorphic functions. The&lt;br/&gt;latter space generalizes the classical Segal-Bargmann space. The&lt;br/&gt;two possible quantum Hilbert spaces are related by a unitary&lt;br/&gt;transform, the generalized Segal-Bargmann transform, developed by&lt;br/&gt;the PI and M. Stenzel. The unitarity of this transform can be&lt;br/&gt;re-formulated as a resolution of the identity for the associated&lt;br/&gt;"coherent states," as shown in detail by the PI and J. Mitchell.&lt;br/&gt;These results have been applied to the quantization of&lt;br/&gt;two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory and to the classical limit of&lt;br/&gt;Thiemann's quantum gravity theory. The PI is continuing to&lt;br/&gt;investigate several aspects of the theory, including the&lt;br/&gt;semiclassical localization properties of the coherent states,&lt;br/&gt;properties of the associated quantization schemes (generalized&lt;br/&gt;Wick, anti-Wick, and Weyl quantizations), and the relationship of&lt;br/&gt;the theory to geometric quantization. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broadly speaking the PI's research is in the boundary&lt;br/&gt;region between classical and quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics&lt;br/&gt;is the theory that governs the world at the atomic scale.&lt;br/&gt;Although classical (Newtonian) mechanics works well for&lt;br/&gt;macroscopic phenomena, it cannot account for the structure of&lt;br/&gt;atoms and molecules--at this level the quantum theory takes over.&lt;br/&gt;For the two theories to be consistent with one another the&lt;br/&gt;predictions of quantum mechanics must pass smoothly into those of&lt;br/&gt;classical mechanics as the scale passes from microscopic to&lt;br/&gt;macroscopic. On the other hand, the mathematical structure of the&lt;br/&gt;two theories is very different, so it is challenging to&lt;br/&gt;understand how this quantum-to-classical transition takes place.&lt;br/&gt;The PI's research concerns a reformulation of quantum mechanics&lt;br/&gt;which is equivalent to the usual one but which brings the&lt;br/&gt;description of quantum mechanics closer to that of classical&lt;br/&gt;mechanics. Specifically, the PI's work takes one standard&lt;br/&gt;reformulation of quantum mechanics, the Segal-Bargmann transform,&lt;br/&gt;and extends it to apply to systems with more complicated degrees&lt;br/&gt;of freedom, such as rotations. This work has been applied in a&lt;br/&gt;simplified model of the strong interaction in particle physics&lt;br/&gt;and in an ambitious program of T. Thiemann and collaborators to&lt;br/&gt;develop a quantum theory of gravity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
