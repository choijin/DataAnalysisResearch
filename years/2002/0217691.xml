<AbstractNarration>The University of Texas System Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of Texas System Alliance for Minority Participation (UT-System&lt;br/&gt;AMP) brings together all nine academic components of The University of Texas System&lt;br/&gt;and ten regional community college partners in an effort to increase the number of under-&lt;br/&gt;represented minority students and students from other under-served populations enrolling &lt;br/&gt;in and graduating from baccalaureate programs in science, mathematics, engineering, and &lt;br/&gt;technology and entering graduate programs in SMET fields at UT-System universities.&lt;br/&gt;The activities of the UT-System AMP are supported by partnerships with industry and&lt;br/&gt;government agencies, particularly national laboratories. The educational institutions in &lt;br/&gt;the Alliance serve a rapidly growing region, where by the decade's end minorities will &lt;br/&gt;comprise a majority of the population. Prominent among the institutions are those in the&lt;br/&gt;U.S.-Mexico Border regions serving large numbers of Hispanic students and those in &lt;br/&gt;metropolitan areas serving mainly commuter students,including many minorities. The&lt;br/&gt;UT-System places a high degree of importance, system-wide, on improving retention&lt;br/&gt;among undergraduates and providing enhanced opportunities for these undergraduates &lt;br/&gt;to enter graduate programs in SMET. This proposal also emphasizes the system-wide&lt;br/&gt;sharing of resources to attain these goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Phase III, the University of Texas System Alliance for Minority Participation is &lt;br/&gt;committed to achieving the following objectives: 1) The UT-System LSAMP universities &lt;br/&gt;will enroll a minimum of 200 under-represented minority and other under-served student &lt;br/&gt;in their STEM doctoral programs by the fall of 2008, an increase of about 100% over the &lt;br/&gt;fall 2000 baseline and 2) The UT-System AMP universities will continue to work towards&lt;br/&gt;the Phase II goal of graduating a minimum of 1,374 under-represented minority and other &lt;br/&gt;under-served students with B.S. degrees in SMET. It is estimated that we will achieve this&lt;br/&gt;goal by 2006. When achieved, this will represent a 244% increase over 1991-1992 baseline.&lt;br/&gt;LSAMP program activities will focus on three major areas: (1) retention of students who&lt;br/&gt;are STEM majors through the development of strategies at all partner institutions to &lt;br/&gt;address retention of second year students in SMET; (2) mentoring and career development&lt;br/&gt;opportunities for STEM majors interested in pursuing an advanced degree. Activities will&lt;br/&gt;include the development of GRE workshops and career development/mentoring activities at&lt;br/&gt;each partner institution; and (3) a summer research academy where rising junior and senior &lt;br/&gt;students will have the opportunity to work in a research laboratory at one of the five&lt;br/&gt;doctoral-granting institutions in the alliance. Students will receive stipend support, &lt;br/&gt;mentoring and training. The UT-System LSAMP has permanently changing the nature of&lt;br/&gt;SMET higher education in Texas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through the UT-System LSAMP, the participating universities have raised the &lt;br/&gt;visibility and increased the awareness of the chancellor, presidents and chief academic &lt;br/&gt;officers about SMET program outcomes and the status of under-represented minority&lt;br/&gt;students. Providing leadership to the UT-System Alliance for Minority Participation will &lt;br/&gt;be a Governing Board, chaired by Ed Sharpe, Executive Vice Chancellor of The University &lt;br/&gt;of Texas System, which includes presidents, vice-presidents, or provostsof UT-System &lt;br/&gt;member institutions and participating community colleges as well as a selected number &lt;br/&gt;of experts from industry and the national R&amp;D community. Meeting annually, the Governing&lt;br/&gt;Board will continue to provide general oversight of the UT-System AMP. The Academic&lt;br/&gt;Leadership Council (ALC), composed of deans, chairs and distinguished faculty are involved&lt;br/&gt;in the implementation of AMP activities at their institution. The ALC meets twice &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
