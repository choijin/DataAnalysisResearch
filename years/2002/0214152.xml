<AbstractNarration>   The Society for Behavioral Neuroendocrinology (SBN) is fairly young (founded 1995), &lt;br/&gt;and expects attendance of around 300 at this sixth Annual Meeting.  The SBN, in its &lt;br/&gt;meetings and its journal (Hormones &amp; Behavior) uniquely emphasizes multidisciplinary &lt;br/&gt;integration of cellular and molecular concepts into a functional framework involving the &lt;br/&gt;brain, behavior, development, evolution and the ecology of social behavior.  This &lt;br/&gt;concentration linking hormones to many areas of behavior, including both field and &lt;br/&gt;laboratory approaches, makes this focal meeting different from other meetings in the &lt;br/&gt;field.  The conference organizers are highly regarded and experienced, the topics are &lt;br/&gt;timely, and in addition to scientific talks there are particular sessions planned for &lt;br/&gt;students and trainees on 'survival skills', 'meet-the-professor' lunches, 'alternative &lt;br/&gt;careers' and poster sessions with awards expanded to include undergraduate work.   &lt;br/&gt;Dissemination of the conference findings will be through a special supplemental issue of &lt;br/&gt;Hormones &amp; Behavior.  The SBN meetings strongly emphasize bringing in students &lt;br/&gt;(graduate and undergraduate, representing 1/3 of the total membership) and postdocs &lt;br/&gt;for interdisciplinary interactions with established investigators.&lt;br/&gt;   The potential impact of this conference is high in the fields of neuroendocrinology and &lt;br/&gt;behavioral neuroscience, because of the focused discussions shaping future work, the &lt;br/&gt;potential to develop new cross-disciplinary collaborations, and the likely interactions and &lt;br/&gt;introductions essential to career development of young investigators. Funding from NSF &lt;br/&gt;is important to help students, postdocs, and young researchers attend, and for some &lt;br/&gt;career development workshop speakers who are not currently society members.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
