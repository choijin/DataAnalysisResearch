<AbstractNarration>This proof-of-concept project develops a full course as well as independent topic modules to introduce assistive technology design and evaluation into an undergraduate computer science curriculum from a human-computer interaction perspective, (topic modules could be used within the content of a traditional HCI course.) including a model laboratory. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This course provides CS students with an introduction to disabilities issues, computerized aids to compensate for physical disabilities and for providing accessibility to computer technology and electronic information (e.g., through the Internet). Curriculum materials include lecture notes on specific topics (e.g. devices for the visually impaired), descriptions of hardware and software related to the topics, and suggestions for assignments and projects. These modules are being used in the senior-level course CSCI 425 - Human-Computer Interaction, and then within a new course devoted to assistive technology topics. Students are strongly encouraged to participate in service learning projects and in collaborative projects with students in other courses such as Nursing 424 - Health Promotion and Rehabilitation Nursing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An outcome of the inclusion of assistive technology within a computer science&lt;br/&gt;curriculum is the attraction of more women to the field by providing an application area that is more socially oriented. In addition, students with disabilities are encouraged to study computer science by seeing how the field directly applies to them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project includes issues of faculty development through the use of workshops and the integration of assistive technology into the education of computer science majors.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
