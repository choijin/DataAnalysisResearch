<AbstractNarration>In modern computer systems, computation is distributed over many host machines. Mutually untrusted machines and users coexist, and software is built using plug-and-play components downloaded from remote hosts. Multiple users share resources so it is critical to ensure, e.g., that private information is not compromised.  Languages like Java and C# are designed to provide such security by enforcing encapsulation boundaries that restrict interdependencies and information flows between program components.  Such boundaries are undercut, however, by ubiquitous pointer aliasing which can be maliciously exploited to leak sensitive information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project studies ways to confine pointers to their intended scopes.  The focus is on the interplay between static analysis and dynamic access control to achieve confinement.  The technical goal is to find confinement regimes that can be used to assure secure information flow in systems implemented using dynamic binding, multithreading, inheritance, class-based encapsulation, and access control.  Analyses and transformations to minimize run-time performance costs for confinement and access control are also investigated.  This work will lead to better programming methods and tools for development of web-based services and other distributed applications that require a high level of assurance.  The work will contribute to technology for implementing programming languages and for checking for security flaws in application programs.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
