    <AbstractNarration>The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project focuses on the development of &lt;br/&gt;novel lithium based cathode materials for high discharge rate applications. Significant attempts have been made in the past decade to commercialize lithium manganospinels but have met with limited success due to poor cycle life and low rate dischargeability. Proprietary synthesis technologies have been developed to stabilize defective lithium manganospinels, which in thin film form, exhibit high capacity (&gt; 230 mAH/g), long cycle life(&gt; 700 cycle) and high discharge rates (&gt; 25C). These materials have been fabricated using a special Vapor Phase Activated Oxygen (VPAO) method. This project proposes to explore the feasibility of the VPAO method to synthesize bulk electrodes for high discharge rate applications. Two methods will be explored using the VPAO techniques: (i) direct scale-up of the thin film technology to thick films and (ii) synthesis of defective manganospinel powders by gas phase nucleation process. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Li-based batteries are presently used in low power applications. Success of the proposed research will allow lithium batteries to capture the market for high-powered applications such as power tools and electric vehicles, as well as the portable batteries market.</AbstractNarration>
