<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Berg will undertake researches in condensed matter chemistry, namely fast time scale dynamics of supercooled and high viscosity liquids. New non-linear spectroscopies are to be developed and existing methods to be extended. Heterogeneity and non-exponential decays in high viscosity liquids and other complex materials are to be investigated, and rotation and solvation measurements are to be made and internal diffusive transitions invetigated. A Fifth Order Rotational Spectroscopy (FORS) is to be developed. A new viscoelastic (VE) theory is to be developed, one that includes both inertial and diffusive dynamics in a unified formalism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project deals with important issues in the behavior of fluids, such as the relationship between the dynamics of single molecules and that of the collective behavior of fluids. Existing theories have been partially successful in accounting for the dynamical properties of fluids and the present work addresses fundamental issues that have in the past been treated only slightly. New experimental techniques, coupled with theory will be developed. This research will be conducted with the aid of graduate and undergraduate students, and postdoctoral research associates. They will gain valuable experience through their involvement in contemporary forefront research in physical chemistry. These experiences will of great advantage in their further studies, or employment in industry, government laboratories, or academia. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
