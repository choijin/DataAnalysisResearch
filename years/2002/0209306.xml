    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT DMS - 0209306.&lt;br/&gt;PI: Gueo Grantcharov&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project aims to study three problems of the Hermitian geometry of the&lt;br/&gt;compact non-Kaehler complex manifolds: The geometry of Hermitian manifolds admitting&lt;br/&gt;totally non-degenerate torus action, Hermitian structures on Riemannian manifolds&lt;br/&gt;admitting many compatible complex structures and geometry of hypercomplex manifolds&lt;br/&gt;and connections with totally antisymmetric torsion. The methods of investigation&lt;br/&gt;include: Kodaira-Spencer-Kuranishi deformation theory, Lichnerowicz formulas for &lt;br/&gt;Dirac operators and vanishing theorems, twistor correspondence, Kaehler orbifolds, &lt;br/&gt;nilpotent Lie groups, moment maps for various spaces with geometric structures, &lt;br/&gt;harmonic maps and others. If the project is successful, it is expected a new examples &lt;br/&gt;of Einstein Hermitian manifolds to be obtained, the existence problem of HKT structure &lt;br/&gt;on arbitrary hypercomplex manifold to be solved (negatively) and some characterization &lt;br/&gt;or rigidity type results for manifolds with many complex structures to be found.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The role of the abstract spaces constructed from the complex numbers in the&lt;br/&gt;theoretical foundations of quantum mechanics is significant. It increases in the&lt;br/&gt;development of quantum mechanic to the theory of quantum fields. A more recent&lt;br/&gt;investigations in the theoretical physics are directed toward a unification of the&lt;br/&gt;quantum mechanics and general relativity. This, yet hypothetical theory, is called &lt;br/&gt;string theory and for a long time the Kaehler geometry of the complex spaces has served as its mathematical&lt;br/&gt;foundation. In mathematics little is known about the structure of&lt;br/&gt;a general non-Kaehler complex spaces. However, in the fast-growing development&lt;br/&gt;of the string theory an abstract models based on the non-Kaehler geometry appeared&lt;br/&gt;in the last years. Such spaces have also additional geometrical properties&lt;br/&gt;which makes the study of their mathematical structure more tractable. The&lt;br/&gt;investigation on the project will contribute to the understanding of some of the &lt;br/&gt;mathematical problems related to these physical models.</AbstractNarration>
