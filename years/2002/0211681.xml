<AbstractNarration>This grant supports the 2002 Physical Metallurgy Gordon Research Conference (GRC), to be held July 21-26, 2002, at Holderness School in Plymouth, NH. The primary goal of this conference is to bring together new and established researchers to generate an understanding of the most important emerging research directions related to the role of interfaces in physical metallurgy. Like most Gordon Conferences, the Physical Metallurgy GRC assembles a 80 - 100 scientists and engineers for five days in a casual setting that is isolated from outside distractions with ample time for discussion and interaction. The conference will consist of eight sessions with two or three speakers per session. One session is reserved for late-breaking topics and posters. The speakers and chairs represent a diverse group of experts from leading institutions around the world. All of the NSF funds are used to pay for registration and travel expenses for graduate students and post-doctoral researchers to attend the conference. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The last few years have seen an explosion of new experimental and simulation techniques that provide novel atomic-scale resolution descriptions of interfaces, quantification of microstructure, and observation of interfacial phenomena heretofore unknown. Perhaps most exciting are recent developments that have led to materials processing to achieve desired distributions of interfaces and to exploit unique interfacial characteristics to synthesize materials designed to match particular property profiles. The 2002 Physical Metallurgy GRC examines the latest advances in this multidisciplinary field within the context of selected research presentations and ample open discussion.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
