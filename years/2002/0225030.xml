    <AbstractNarration>WAMC Northeast Public Radio (WAMC) will produce, air, and distribute a series of segments on its radio programs 51% and The Best of Our Knowledge that will draw material from projects funded by the NSF Program for Gender Equity in STEM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The show 51% is dedicated to coverage of issues affecting women. The Best of Our Knowledge is devoted to coverage of issues and topics related to education, educational policy, innovation, and research. The program segments will place a national spotlight on gender equity in STEM, specifically in the areas of high school, undergraduate, teacher and faculty development, and educational technologies. They will be delivered in multiple media formats: radio, CD, tape, and the web.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WAMC's long-term goal is to play a pivotal role in the national effort to broaden the participation of women and girls in STEM education and workforce. In the shorter-term, WAMC's goals are: 1) to significantly expand education and awareness of targeted audiences and the general public about research and strategies to improve education policies and practices; and, 2) to enhance the image of the STEM professions and their practitioners so that the image is positive and inclusive of women.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results of the project will be: a set of quality radio programs for multiple uses, targeted nationwide distribution, new segments within WAMC's regular programming, and new collaborations between a media organization and women' groups, major science and education institutions engaging in research and demonstration projects, high schools, government agencies, trade associations, and private foundations.</AbstractNarration>
