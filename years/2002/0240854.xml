    <AbstractNarration>0240854&lt;br/&gt;Bronzino&lt;br/&gt;Important advances in "Cardiovascular Technologies" occurred during the past decade; implantable defibrillators, new stent designs for angioplasty, and heart assist devices including new artificial heart designs. Additionally, there have been breakthroughs in "tissue engineering" that are expected to revolutionize the treatment of cardiovascular disease. This area of technology is important with the Symposium and the associated Technology Fair being designed to provide practicing professionals and students interested in bioscience and engineering an opportunity to become familiar with some of the latest developments in the field. The topics to be covered include: "Advances in the Design of the Artificial Heart, the ABIOCOR Artificial Heart Program", "Frontiers of Organ and Tissue Replacement", "Cardiovascular Tissue Engineering", "Fetal Cardiology", "Advances in Interventional Cardiology", and "Electrical Mapping of the Heart". &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary objectives of this Symposium and the Associated Technology Fair are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Present insights into the new research and development efforts underway on developing new cardiovascular technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Present examples of successful academic/industrial collaborations in these areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Provide the opportunity for researchers and entrepreneurs to present innovative approaches and products related to the entire field of biomedical engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As illustrated by the topics to be covered, the intellectual merit of the Symposium is high and will have significant impact on the bioscience and biomedical engineering community in the region. Through the publication of the Proceedings a beneficial impact on students and professionals will extend to the national level. The associated Technology Fair provides an opportunity for both students and professionals to discuss the process of innovation with those currently engaged in the technology development process.</AbstractNarration>
