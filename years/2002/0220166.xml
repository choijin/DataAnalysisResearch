<AbstractNarration>Proposal Number: 0220166&lt;br/&gt;      Title: ITR/SY Features, Components, and Legacy Systems&lt;br/&gt;      PI: George T. Heineman, Computer Science Department, WPI&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;      A legacy system is any software system that is in use and must evolve&lt;br/&gt;      to meet changing conditions. These systems must be re-engineered&lt;br/&gt;      because over time, the ability to evolve the system decreases with&lt;br/&gt;      each successive maintenance. The proposed research combines the&lt;br/&gt;      concepts of features and software components in a novel way to&lt;br/&gt;      extract feature-based software components from a legacy&lt;br/&gt;      system. First, the features of the target legacy system are elicited&lt;br/&gt;      and using existing code profiling tools, the code associated with&lt;br/&gt;      these features is identified. This task is made possible by the&lt;br/&gt;      regression test suite that many legacy systems already have to ensure&lt;br/&gt;      proper functioning as the system is upgraded.  Second, software&lt;br/&gt;      components are refactored from the legacy system. In short, the data&lt;br/&gt;      generated by execution traces is analyzed for evolution purposes.&lt;br/&gt;      The research will provides a viable long-term strategy for an&lt;br/&gt;      organization to incrementally modernize its software code base. A&lt;br/&gt;      reengineering methodology will be defined and applied. A&lt;br/&gt;      corresponding cost/savings model will be developed based upon&lt;br/&gt;      preliminary success with the legacy system for a financial&lt;br/&gt;      company. The methodology will be packaged and disseminated to ensure&lt;br/&gt;      other organizations with legacy systems can easily benefit from the&lt;br/&gt;      results of this research.</AbstractNarration>
