<AbstractNarration>PROPOSAL NO.: 0230709&lt;br/&gt;PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Cecil, Joe&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION NAME: New Mexico State University&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: Development of an IT intensive Manufacturing Engineering Curriculum&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;With the phenomenal explosion of e-businesses and the continuing adoption of the &lt;br/&gt;Virtual Enterprise  (VE) model in manufacturing, there is a substantial interest in &lt;br/&gt;American industry in the availability of engineering students who possesses skills to &lt;br/&gt;succeed in this new  Information Technology (IT) intensive manufacturing work &lt;br/&gt;environment.  In this context, there is a need for our educational institutions to develop &lt;br/&gt;innovative curriculum, which will enable our students to .hit the ground running. when &lt;br/&gt;they begin working in their respective organizations upon graduation.  Our manufacturing &lt;br/&gt;industry needs a new type of engineer, who must not only possess a strong background in &lt;br/&gt;manufacturing  (and  manufacturing  systems)  but  also  be  skilled  at  using  emerging &lt;br/&gt;technologies such as Virtual Reality, the  Internet and other tools to accomplish a wide &lt;br/&gt;range  of  activities  in  the  context  of  virtual  manufacturing  enterprises.    &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project will develop comprehensive plans for the design and development of a new manufacturing engineering curriculum, which addresses the changing manufacturing landscape.  Such an information technology based manufacturing  curriculum will benefit graduating students and industrial organizations (who hire them) by providing a workforce, which possesses skills and knowledge that are necessary to succeed in today's evolving  global economy.  Other  activities proposed include the incorporation of virtual reality technology to enhance student learning for under-represented minorities including students with physical challenges.  The project team includes New Mexico State university and other academic and industry partners. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
