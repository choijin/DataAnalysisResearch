<AbstractNarration>CMS-0234136&lt;br/&gt;PI:  Peter Smeallie&lt;br/&gt;Institution: American Rock Mechanics Association Foundation&lt;br/&gt;Title: "Geo-Engineering and Rock Mechanics Research at the Proposed U.S. National Underground Science Laboratory"&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The establishment of a National Underground Science Laboratory (NUSL) is currently under &lt;br/&gt;consideration.  A workshop will be conducted by the University of Maryland on September&lt;br/&gt;19-21, 2002, to identify research areas of value to the nation that could be conducted at the NUSL.  The American Rock Mechanics Association Foundation (ARMA/F) proposes to develop&lt;br/&gt;for presentation a research agenda for geo-engineering and rock mechanics for consideration at the NUSL workshop and eventually to be undertaken at the proposed NUSL facility itself. ARMA/F will identify topics and will select up to four broad areas for preparation of white papers.  Captains will be identified for each area and four to five team members.  The captain will lead the team in writing a white paper (10-15 pages) on the subject that will detail the nature of the research, how such work could take advantage of the underground laboratory, and what the benefits of the results would be.  The four papers will be submitted to ARMA/F by August 15th and examined by a  team assembled by ARMA/F to include experts from the various fields called out in the papers.  One day prior to the NUSL workshop, ARMA/F will host a day-long pre-workshop meeting, inviting the captains and the teams to view all the presentations, and make improvements and modifications to the presentations consistent with the allotted time and speakers for the subject at the NUSL workshop.  The final result will be presented at the main workshop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will advance the field of geo-engineering and rock mechanics by identifying&lt;br/&gt;for consideration needed research to be undertaken at the NUSL. This work will give &lt;br/&gt;unprecedented opportunities for educators, students, and researchers to obtain field  experiences and to carry out complex projects under field conditions. Results of research carried out at the NUSL could potentially have direct impacts on national security through a better understanding of how rock behaves and civil infrastructure systems through advances in tunneling and excavation technologies.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
