<AbstractNarration>This conference is designed to assist key university and college leaders, those with responsibility for institution-wide undergraduate education, in adopting tested strategies to implement programs of change in STEM curriculum and pedagogy on their campuses. The focus is on ways to implement change and demonstrate its effectiveness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program acquaints participants with a sense of what some of the exciting new pedagogies and technologies are and how to infuse these innovations into the curriculum. Presenters for the workshop detail the ways in which these innovations can be applied to several fields and then demonstrate how they use them in their own teaching. They discuss what worked and what failed in the process of implementation. Attendees will leave with both general ideas and the specifics of a particular application. Opportunities for interaction with industrial education leaders is included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The expected outcome is to have a group of leaders who can return to their campuses energized and with a better understanding of how to implement these changes within the curriculum.</AbstractNarration>
