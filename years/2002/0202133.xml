    <AbstractNarration>This project is adapting "Revitalizing Classroom Teaching and Learning: A Beginning for Two-Year College Mathematics" from Greenville Technical College in South Carolina. It partners with local industry to incorporate problem-solving and real industry-based application into mathematics curriculum at three levels of education: high school, two-year college, and four- year college/university.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using the pedagogical approach developed in the Greenville project, this project is accomplishing four objectives:&lt;br/&gt;1. Revitalizing the mathematics curriculum with work-based experiences, incorporating technology as both a teaching and a learning tool, and fostering an interactive learning environment.&lt;br/&gt;2. Building a strong connection among high school, community college, four-year college/university and industry by integrating mathematics content and industry-based applications by spiraling through the three levels of education; understanding the similarities and differences in mathematics vocabulary from the academic to the work setting; and improving communication and articulation among the three academic levels and industry.&lt;br/&gt;3. Providing faculty professional development opportunities to support collaborative learning methodology, student engagement in learning and use of appropriate technology. &lt;br/&gt;4. Developing "The Process Guidelines" to revitalize curriculum, using from faculty journals. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project accomplishes these objectives by:&lt;br/&gt;1. Developing a replicable and self-sustaining infrastructure that builds collaboration between education and industry; highlighted by interaction through shadowing, site visits, classroom visits, and externships;&lt;br/&gt;2. Offering professional development activities to increase teamwork use of technology in the classroom, and knowledge of alternative teaching techniques that target different student learning styles;&lt;br/&gt;3. Class piloting, refining and implementing of new teaching methods, work-based problems, and student interaction within the classroom; and&lt;br/&gt;4. Synthesizing and generalizing faculty journals into a clear manual, "The Process Guidelines".</AbstractNarration>
