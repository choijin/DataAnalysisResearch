    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will test the viability of a desktop computer-based basin simulator that is networked to distribute database management, simulation, and visualization. The basin simulator has been in development since the mid-1980's and presently exists as a research tool. The focus of this project is to bring recent developments in operating systems, programming languages, desktop computers, and client/server database management systems into the program to make it accessible to industry and academia. The software will be a computationally intensive, networked program. Off-the-shelf technology and hardware will allow the cost of the program development and maintenance to be competitive in the market.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Success of this project will further advance geological sciences to include more fundamental physical and chemical concepts, and to promote multi-disciplinary industry and academic collaborations for developing even more advanced basin simulators.</AbstractNarration>
