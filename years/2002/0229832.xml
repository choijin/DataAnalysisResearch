    <AbstractNarration>EAR-0229832&lt;br/&gt;Felix Waldhauser&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;High-resolution hypocenter locations are most crucial in estimating seismic&lt;br/&gt;hazard, inferring Earth structure, studying tectonics, and to the fundamental&lt;br/&gt;understanding of the occurrence and physics of earthquakes. Several recent&lt;br/&gt;studies, of which this is a continuation, have demonstrated the substantial&lt;br/&gt;improvement in earthquake locations by applying a recently developed&lt;br/&gt;double-difference (DD) earthquake relocation algorithm to thousands of shallow&lt;br/&gt;earthquakes recorded at local distances. This project focuses on &lt;br/&gt;adapting the DD method to relocate, on a massive scale (several tens of thousands of &lt;br/&gt;events) and over large distances (thousands of km), earthquakes recorded at regional and&lt;br/&gt;teleseismic distances. The investigators will test and evaluate the &lt;br/&gt;performance of the new tools using globally recorded events for which ground truth is known, and&lt;br/&gt;compare the results with results derived from commonly used location &lt;br/&gt;techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They will also apply the DD method to the 'groomed' ISC bulletin to &lt;br/&gt;relocate large numbers of earthquakes in subduction zones with the aim to image the internal&lt;br/&gt;structure of seismicity associated with descending slabs. The focus will&lt;br/&gt;initially be on the Andean subduction zone with the aim to define in detail the&lt;br/&gt;morphology of the slab and its correlation with patterns of microseismicity and&lt;br/&gt;the rupture areas of damaging earthquakes. they will also relocate other areas&lt;br/&gt;with dense seismicity to search for characteristic seismicity patterns in time&lt;br/&gt;and space which may provide new insights into the occurrence and physics of&lt;br/&gt;Wadati Benioff earthquakes.</AbstractNarration>
