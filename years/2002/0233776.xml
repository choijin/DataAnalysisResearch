<AbstractNarration>An adjustment of the original statement of work outlined in the proposal is being made to reflect the reduced level of support. While the overall technical approach remains the same, the number of materials systems that will be investigated and their subsequent analysis will be scaled back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We will reduce the number of conjugated polymers that will be investigated for our proposed devices. Year I will focus almost exclusively on the understanding and use of P3OT. This may be expanded in years 2 and 3 as dictated by our scaled-back theoretical modeling efforts. We will focus our modeling work towards the understanding of the important mechanisms in nanotube/quantum dot/P3OT films and the identification and analysis of other conjugated polymers that could be investigated in years 2 and 3. These theoretical modeling efforts will be completed in year 1.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We will restrict our quantum dot system synthesis efforts to those that we have previously identified suitable for this type of an application. Specifically, we will only concentrate on the incorporation of the CdSe and CuLnS2 into polymeric materials designed for thin film photovoltaic devices. The synthesis efforts and fundamental studies regarding these quantum dots will be completed by the end of year 2. We will concentrate our efforts in year 3 on fabricating and testing devices using the materials generated during first two years of the program. By reducing the number and variety of quantum dot systems and polymeric hosts investigated, we will no longer have any sub contracts in the third year of the program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The derivatization attempts using thiols, amides, esters etc. to enhance covalent interaction with quantum dots will still be investigated but to a lesser degree. In addition, other nanotube purification studies using chromatographic techniques (i.e., gel permeation and reverse phase chromatography) will be eliminated. We will also forgo any study of ultransonically induced quantum dot/carbon nantoube interactions. Finally, the femtosecond laser spectroscopy studies designed to probe the energetics and the dynamics of ultrafast electronic transitions in colloidal semiconductor nanoparticles and nanotubes in solutions and from solid-state surfaces will no longer be within our scope of work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the notable exceptions outlined above, we will perform all other tasks outlined in the original proposal. The reduction in the number of materials investigated and extent of their analysis significantly reduces the man-hours required for this program. In addition, the materials and supplies costs are reduced by 1/3 each year accordingly, and the travel costs are also reduced proportionally. These changes will make it possible for us to still make a substantive contribution to the JJETSSP program within the revised budget we have submitted.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
