<AbstractNarration>DMS-0245387&lt;br/&gt;Skinner, Christopher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal investigates connections between L-functions and&lt;br/&gt;Galois representations. More precisely, the investigator connects&lt;br/&gt;special values of L-functions of varieties or motives to the orders of&lt;br/&gt;associated Selmer groups. In joint work with E. Urban the investigator&lt;br/&gt;showed that if the L-function of a modular form of weight 1 vanishes to&lt;br/&gt;odd order at its central critical point then the rank of the corresponding&lt;br/&gt;Selmer group is infinite. The investigator is exploring extensions to&lt;br/&gt;representations of higher dimension and to pursuing a ``mod p''&lt;br/&gt;version of this result relating the p-adic order of the L-value (if&lt;br/&gt;finite) to that of its Selmer group. Additionally, the investigator is&lt;br/&gt;completing work in collaboration with M. Harris and J.-S. Li that&lt;br/&gt;constructs p-adic anti-cyclotomic L-function for automorphic&lt;br/&gt;representations on unitary groups U(n) and which makes progress towards&lt;br/&gt;anti-cyclotomic ``main conjectures'' for these groups. Doing so involves&lt;br/&gt;relating these L-functions to congruences between endoscopic and stable&lt;br/&gt;automorphic forms on U(n). The investigator is also pursuing an approach&lt;br/&gt;to the ``main conjecture'' for modular forms on GL(2) by studying the&lt;br/&gt;arithmetic of certain Eisenstein series on U(2,2).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Number theory is often divided into two branches: analytic and algebraic.&lt;br/&gt;The investigator is studying the connection between many seemingly&lt;br/&gt;unrelated objects from these two branches. The primary focus of the first&lt;br/&gt;branch is the study of L-functions - complex functions built of&lt;br/&gt;number-theoretically interesting data (such as the Riemann zeta function&lt;br/&gt;which is built out of the prime numbers). The other branch focuses on&lt;br/&gt;algebraic objects such as class groups. But it is now expected that these&lt;br/&gt;are not unrelated: values of certain L-functions at special points&lt;br/&gt;(generally integers) should be the orders - the sizes - of certain of the&lt;br/&gt;algebraic objects. Such connections are generally very signifigant.&lt;br/&gt;One instance was a crucial ingredient in Andrew Wiles' proof of Fermat's&lt;br/&gt;Last Theorem, for example. Drawing from the theory of automorphic forms,&lt;br/&gt;the investigator's work establishes new instances of these conjectures.&lt;br/&gt;This work is motivated by the fact that special values of L-functions&lt;br/&gt;appear in the fourier coefficients of modular forms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
