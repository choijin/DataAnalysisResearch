    <AbstractNarration>We propose a program of calculations of heavy-quark hadron cross sections which are&lt;br/&gt;of great importance in the identification of a quark gluon plasma (QGP) in heavy-ion colli-&lt;br/&gt;sions. This program will involve the calculation of reaction cross sections of various hadrons&lt;br/&gt;which have been proposed as QGP diagnostic probes, such as heavy quarkonia, hyper-&lt;br/&gt;ons, and antihyperons. Most of these cross sections are not accessible experimentally at&lt;br/&gt;present, and as such can only be estimated using theoretical models. The central compo-&lt;br/&gt;nent of this proposal consists of calculations of these cross sections using the well-established&lt;br/&gt;constituent-interchange model, assuming standard quark model forces and a scattering for-&lt;br/&gt;malism developed previously by two of us (Barnes and Swanson). This approach is known to&lt;br/&gt;give reasonable agreement with existing experimental low-energy scattering data for a wide&lt;br/&gt;range of analogous hadron-hadron scattering processes. Additional research topics which&lt;br/&gt;will be addressed are the generalization of the approach to multichannel and relativistic&lt;br/&gt;regimes, the incorporation of qq pair production amplitudes, a comparison of microscopic&lt;br/&gt;and effective Lagrangian descriptions, and the development of a T-matrix formalism that will&lt;br/&gt;allow direct application to bound state problems. The cross sections obtained here should&lt;br/&gt;be useful as estimates of the various hadronic contributions to the proposed experimental&lt;br/&gt;signals for the quark-gluon plasma. These hadronic contributions must be understood and&lt;br/&gt;incorporated in simulations of heavy-ion collisions before QGP formation can be established&lt;br/&gt;through various signatures; for this reason a third component of our program is a close&lt;br/&gt;collaboration with researchers involved in Monte-Carlo simulations of RHIC experiments,&lt;br/&gt;so that the experimental implications of these hadronic contributions for RHIC can be as-&lt;br/&gt;sesssed. This will be facilitated by the presence of a large RHIC experimental group from&lt;br/&gt;PHENIX at ORNL and University of Tennessee.</AbstractNarration>
