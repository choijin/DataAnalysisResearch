<AbstractNarration>The proposed program of research is in the area of theoretical physics with an emphasis on&lt;br/&gt;many-body problem in nuclear structure physics, fusion reactions below the Coulomb barrier,&lt;br/&gt;reactions involving heavy-ions, multifragmentation and phase transitions in nuclei, solar and&lt;br/&gt;supernova neutrinos, nucleosynthesis and other neutrino astrophysics. Theoretical research in&lt;br/&gt;these areas is chosen to have a close coupling with the ongoing experimental programs in the&lt;br/&gt;United States and abroad.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit of the Proposed Work: Successful completion of the proposed projects&lt;br/&gt;will lead to i) A better understanding of nuclear equation of state for applications in nuclear&lt;br/&gt;reactions and nuclear astrophysics; ii) Understanding dependence of nuclear reactions on the&lt;br/&gt;isospin of the reacting partners through the recently developed techniques of isoscaling; iii) A&lt;br/&gt;better understanding of the neutrino masses and mixings; iv) Understanding neutrino propagation&lt;br/&gt;through dense media and in strong gravitational fields; v) A better understanding of various&lt;br/&gt;aspects of core-collapse supernovae; vi) A better understanding of the origin of elements, especially&lt;br/&gt;those produced in rapid neutron capture; vii) A better understanding of fusion in astrophysical&lt;br/&gt;environments, and viii) A better understanding of pairing and elaboration of its role in nuclear&lt;br/&gt;many-body problem.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts Resulting from the Proposed Activity: Proposed research contributes to the&lt;br/&gt;support of national priorities in nuclear science such as the proposed National Underground Science&lt;br/&gt;Laboratory and Rare Ion Accelerator. The proposed research involves collaboration between&lt;br/&gt;University of Wisconsin-Madison and Michigan State University, University of California at San&lt;br/&gt;Diego, and University of Washington as well as international collaborations between University of&lt;br/&gt;Wisconsin-Madison researchers and those from Brazil, China, France, Italy, Japan, and Turkey.&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigators participate in multidisciplinary research activities that connect particle,&lt;br/&gt;nuclear, condensed-matter physics and astrophysics. Both principal investigators are involved&lt;br/&gt;in exposing physics to broader audiences. Balantekin plans to continue playing a major role in&lt;br/&gt;developing National Underground Science Laboratory. In addition to enhancing research and education&lt;br/&gt;infrastructure of the Nation in underground science, this proposed laboratory will provide&lt;br/&gt;outreach to the visitors in general and regional Native American colleges in particular.</AbstractNarration>
