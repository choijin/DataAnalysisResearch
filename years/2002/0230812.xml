<AbstractNarration>A casual observer of the current trend in computing devices today will see an increasing tendency towards more mobile and compact computing devices, even in not so obvious places such as the family car.  Unlike in the past, these devices tend to perform specialized tasks and are limited in functionality, but posses a great deal of potential if used together as a single unit.  The starting premise of this proposal is that future communication environments will be characterized by multi-device, deeply networked physical spaces, and that users want access anywhere, anytime.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this proposal is to develop a platform where different technologies may be integrated and bridged across to add value to services provided to users.  The goal is to develop a network-based middleware MuDRA (Multi Device Rendezvous Architecture) which will empower the network infrastructure to enable multi-device, multi-modal communication for mobile users.  The approach is to adopt a multi-device user scenario, where multiple devices may be used simultaneously for content delivery and communication.  The solution will work with open standards, making the work interoperable with other third party services and approaches as they are developed.  The proposal is an evolutionary development of existing technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of the work will have a broad impact on a number of fields including Ubiquitous Computing, Wearable Computers, Computer Aided Collaborative Work, and so forth.  The results of the work will also be available for use in other application scenarios such as distance education and delivery of content to people with disabilities.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
