    <AbstractNarration>In the future, communications systems are expected to be characterized as&lt;br/&gt;ubiquitous, pervasive, very mobile, and highly distributed, among other at-&lt;br/&gt;tributes. In contrast to current systems, such as cellular systems or the&lt;br/&gt;current Internet, the reliance on central network components will be much&lt;br/&gt;reduced and ad hoc methods for forming networks will become more preva-&lt;br/&gt;lent. Additionally, the number of connected devices, including both sensors&lt;br/&gt;and actuators as well as processors, will increase dramatically and many&lt;br/&gt;network devices will operate autonomously. Massive quantities of data of&lt;br/&gt;various highly structured formats will need to be accessed and distributed&lt;br/&gt;across these networks. Wireless and wireline systems will interconnect with&lt;br/&gt;optical fiber and free space communications media.&lt;br/&gt;This workshop is intended to bring together a distinguished group of&lt;br/&gt;research scientists/educators and industry and government experts to discuss&lt;br/&gt;and identify critical research in communications to support this vision. The&lt;br/&gt;workshop will provide an opportunity to interact with experts from related&lt;br/&gt;fields, primarily computer science, working on different aspects of future&lt;br/&gt;communication systems. A list of invitees for this workshop is provided in&lt;br/&gt;the appendix.&lt;br/&gt;The workshop aims to identify research challenges and opportunities as-&lt;br/&gt;sociated with the emerging vision for future communications systems. We&lt;br/&gt;expect a report to come out of the workshop reflecting the themes discussed.</AbstractNarration>
