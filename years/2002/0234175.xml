<AbstractNarration>0234175 &lt;br/&gt;Semancik&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description:  This project supports a US-Egypt Workshop on Research in Genomics and Genetic Engineering to be held in Alexandria, Egypt, in February 2003.  The U.S. organizers are Dr. Joseph Semancik, Department of Plant Pathology, the University of California at Riverside and Dr. Ahmed Hadidi, Lead Molecular Virologist and Research Plant Pathologist Emeritus, United States Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service.  The Egyptian organizers are Dr. Sirag Lashin, Director, Mubarak City for Scientific Research and Technology Applications, Alexandria, Egypt and Dr. Hasan Moawad, National Research Center, Cairo, Egypt.  The proposed workshop will bring together US and Egyptian scientists to discuss current progress in genetic engineering and genomics.  Three days of the workshop will be dedicated to talks on current research in genetic engineering and genomics of plants, humans and microbes.  The fourth day will be reserved for planning potential collaborations between U.S. and Egyptian scientists. Published documents will include a book of abstracts and also workshop proceedings. The long-term goal of the workshop is to establish permanent collaborative arrangements between Egyptian and US scientists. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scope:  Genomics and genetic engineering are both rapidly advancing areas of research.  The workshop would contribute to maintaining international research communication.  This project enables US and Egyptian scientists to participate in a workshop to discuss an area scientific importance to scientists and officials in both countries and to identify potential collaborative research where the two sides can complement each other's capabilities. This project is being partially supported under the US-Egypt Joint Fund Program, which provides grants to scientists and engineers in both countries to carry out these joint scientific activities.  Additional funding is provided by the Plant Genomics Research Program, Directorate of Biological Sciences.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
