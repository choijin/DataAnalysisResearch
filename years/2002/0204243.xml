<AbstractNarration>New classes of materials are processed as liquid mixtures of "designer" macromolecules either in  viscous solvents or in flexible polymer solutions.  These  macromolecules range from small &lt;br/&gt; molecular weight, rod-like liquid crystals to  nano-clay platelets,  targeting a diverse family of high-performance materials and devices.  The molecules are well  approximated as  &lt;br/&gt; ellipsoids,  precisely falling  within  the class of   macromolecular  fluids accessible &lt;br/&gt; by emerging theory,  computation,   and   experiment.  Furthermore,  rigid-unit, &lt;br/&gt;monodisperse molecules suspended in viscous solvent are fundamental  model systems. &lt;br/&gt; Mathematically, they represent the leading edge of theory; physically, they are the &lt;br/&gt;foundation from which many micro-fluidic systems can now be ideally modeled, and &lt;br/&gt;eventually understood.      Conductivity or barrier  properties, while  governing &lt;br/&gt;material  end-use, are passive during processing.  Rather, the fundamental issue for&lt;br/&gt; design and control is the emergence  of  structures during   processing at length &lt;br/&gt;scales (up to microns) far removed from individual molecules, called&lt;br/&gt; mesostructures, which empirically  dominate ultimate performance features. &lt;br/&gt; Examples include sequestered island arrays of liquid crystals and distinguished &lt;br/&gt; patterns that arise in rod-like and disc-like  nano-composites.  The onset, &lt;br/&gt;development, and saturation of mesostructures in prototypical flows of rigid-unit &lt;br/&gt;macromolecular fluids is the primary focus of the workl.  The work identifies &lt;br/&gt;open mathematical, numerical, and experimental issues, and constructs collective &lt;br/&gt;strategies toward their resolution, combining experimental, theoretical and computational&lt;br/&gt; expertise.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New class of materials are processed as liquid mixtures of "designer macromolecules"&lt;br/&gt;either in viscous solvents or in polymer melts and solutions, in which the designer&lt;br/&gt;macromolecules are of simple geometry in a few to several hundred nanometers (1 nanometer is&lt;br/&gt;equal to 1 billionth of 1 meter). The material properties are dominated by the emergence of the mesostructure at the micron level (1 micron is 1 millionth of 1 meter) during the material processing. &lt;br/&gt;The PI, teamed up with a group of leading experimentalists in the field of complex&lt;br/&gt;fluids, identifies the open mathematical, numerical and experimental issues and constructs&lt;br/&gt;collective strategies toward their resolution combining experimental, theoretical and computational&lt;br/&gt;expertise.</AbstractNarration>
