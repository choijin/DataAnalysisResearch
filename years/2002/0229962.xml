<AbstractNarration>Van Keken, Hauri&lt;br/&gt;EAR-0229962, 0229755&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators are interested in the role that the generation and recycling&lt;br/&gt;of oceanic crust plays in the formation of geochemical heterogeneity.&lt;br/&gt;The formation of oceanic crust is a fundamental differentiation process that&lt;br/&gt;causes distinct variations in trace element and bulk composition. The related&lt;br/&gt;variations in density and rheology have important consequences for mantle&lt;br/&gt;dynamics and mantle mixing. Our main hypothesis is that the formation and&lt;br/&gt;recycling of oceanic crust can explain a vast proportion of the geochemical&lt;br/&gt;observations. The central goal of this project is to study the role that&lt;br/&gt;compositional density plays in preserving geochemical heterogeneity.&lt;br/&gt;As part of the investigators' hypothesis testing approach they will &lt;br/&gt;address following questions:&lt;br/&gt;   1) How does the recycling of oceanic crust affect mantle chemistry?&lt;br/&gt;   2) What are the relationships between noble gas and lithophile &lt;br/&gt;isotope ratios?&lt;br/&gt;   3) Is it possible that the large-scale differentiation during Earth's&lt;br/&gt;formation accounts for the presently observed heterogeneity?&lt;br/&gt;     The team will use a combination of geodynamical and geochemical modeling to&lt;br/&gt;answer these questions. This provides an excellent tool to test conceptual&lt;br/&gt;ideas by quantifying the effects of mantle mixing, fractionation,&lt;br/&gt;differentiation, and degassing. The approach is based on previously established&lt;br/&gt;collaboration between Van Keken, Ballentine and Hauri. Previous models will be&lt;br/&gt;improved by the modeling of oceanic crust formation, incorporation of&lt;br/&gt;lithophile isotopes, and significantly higher spatial and temporal resolution.&lt;br/&gt;Van Keken and a graduate student will be responsible for the model improvements&lt;br/&gt;and dynamical computations, while Hauri and Ballentine will guide the &lt;br/&gt;hypothesis&lt;br/&gt;testing approach and aid the geochemical modeling. The collaborative &lt;br/&gt;aspects are&lt;br/&gt;an essential component of this proposal.&lt;br/&gt;     This project will lead to a better understanding of the processes that are&lt;br/&gt;responsible for the thermal and chemical evolution of our planet. It will aid&lt;br/&gt;in the development of essential dynamical modeling tools and provide&lt;br/&gt;cross-disciplinary integration, international collaboration, and education&lt;br/&gt;of students in quantitative geophysics and geochemistry.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
