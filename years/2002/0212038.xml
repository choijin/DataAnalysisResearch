<AbstractNarration>The goal of the proposed Project ACCESS is to increase the number of associate's and Bachelor's degrees in Engineering granted to residents of South Central Texas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The following activities will be implemented in order to achieve the project's goal and outcomes: 1)  Establishing dual credit engineering courses in at least five area high schools; 2) Training faculty at community college in distance education and/or infusion of state-of-the-art technology into engineering curricula; 3) Supplementing community college curriculum with state-of-the-art engineering education materials and software; 4) Converting at least 75% of San Antonio College Engineering Courses and Engineering Math will be converted into Internet format; 5) developing a new engineering course, "Engineering Mathematics," for San Antonio College Engineering and Dual Credit students; 6) SAC will obtain new articulation agreements for 2 + 2 transfers with at least two additional 4-year Engineering programs in the South and Central Texas area; and 7) other Alamo Community College District and area engineering faculty will be made aware of the availability of new curricula. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;San Antonio College will work closely with the University of Texas at San Antonio, Texas A &amp; M, South West Texas University and other schools to articulate seamless engineering courses of study for "2 + 2 + 2" (high school/community college/university) students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The expected outcomes of this project are the following: 1) at least 40 high school students, half minority, will be enrolled in dual credit Engineering or pre-Engineering courses with San Antonio College each year; 2) at least 30 students each semester will be enrolled in one or more Web-based Engineering course; 3) the number of minority Engineering majors at San Antonio College who transfer to Engineering programs at four-year institutions  will be increased by at least 200%; and 4) the numbers of minority students graduating from San Antonio College with an Associate's Degree in Engineering will be increased by at least 200%. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
