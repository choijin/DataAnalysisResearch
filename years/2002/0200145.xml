<AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Microbial Biology for FY2002.  The fellowship supports training and research on the basic biology of protozoan, microalgal, fungal, archaeal, bacterial and viral species that are not generally considered to be model organisms. Further, it provides opportunities for a recent doctoral recipients to obtain additional training in microbial biology, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of established scientists, and to broaden his/her scientific horizons beyond the research experiences during the undergraduate and graduate training. These fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including foreign locations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research and training plan is entitled "Molecular characterization of microbial respiratory arsenate reduction: diversity and environmental expression of metalloid reductase genes." Microbial respiratory arsenate reduction can significantly alter the mobility and toxicity of arsenic in the environment.  Little is known about the molecular mechanisms for arsenic respiration.  The research goals of this research are to identify genes involved in arsenate respiration in a variety of species, including Sulfurospirillum and Shewanella strains, and measure arsenate respiratory activity in contaminated sites.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
