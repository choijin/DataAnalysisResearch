<AbstractNarration>Bamboo grasses are an important component of understory vegetation in subtropical and temperate forests in both Asia and the Americas and in many cases they completely dominate the lower layers of the forest. These bamboo grasses have important economic and conservation value since they play a key role in the functioning of the entire forest ecosystem and provide food and shelter to numerous native populations. Most species flower only once in their life cycle, which can last up to 120 years, and then die. When bamboo grasses flower, the flowering is highly synchronous, such that there are massive 'waves' of flowering and immediate death of the grasses, affecting large patches of forest vegetation simultaneously. These infrequent and ephemeral events have consequences in many ways for both plants and animals in the affected forests, but because these events are so rare, little is known of the consequences on forest regeneration and maintenance of native biodiversity. In late 2001, forests in southern South America started to experience massive flowering of the bamboo grasses occurring over a vast area ranging in latitude from 25 to 45 degrees S, in both subtropical forests and temperate forests. This is an opportunity to explore the importance of this large-scale and infrequent phenomenon on the maintenance of native biodiversity and forest regeneration, as well as effects on carbon and nitrogen stocks in these forests. Observations are planned in several areas along a latitudinal gradient in South America where massive flowering is occurring, with the aim of identifying how resource availability of water, light and nutrients change as a result of this phenomenon and how these changes influence the regeneration, flowering, and physiology of native species. The simultaneous change of different variables with potentially contrasting effects make it difficult to fully understand the consequences of bamboo flowering. A field experiment, where we will manipulate light and nutrient availability, will allow us to disentangle the different mechanisms resulting from this major and infrequent event. A greater understanding of the mechanisms and consequences of this infrequent flowering in bamboo and its effect on native plant processes can contribute to our ability to make informed decisions for the maintenance of native plants and animal life in native ecosystems around the world.</AbstractNarration>
