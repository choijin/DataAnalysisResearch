<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for a Summer School on Applications of Advanced mathematical and Computational Methods to Atmospheric and Oceanic Problems (MCAO 2003), which will be held at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) at Boulder, Colorado, during the time period of July 14 to 26, 2003.  This interdisciplinary summer school will bring together specialists of atmosphere and ocean sciences, and applied mathematicians interested in such problems.  The purpose of this school is to provide to graduate students and young researchers of one field the basic elements of the other fields, as well as some more advanced openings into current research.  It is also hoped in this way to initialize or further develop the communication and interactions between specialists of different fields speaking different languages, conducting different methodologies but interested sometimes in the same problems.  Many of the proposed lecturers have participated in earlier conferences on mathematical problems in atmosphere and ocean sciences, and they have already invested into interactions between mathematics, computing and geosciences.  Most of the requested funding will be devoted to support the students and the lecturers.</AbstractNarration>
