    <AbstractNarration>The investigator and his collaborators will investigate certain&lt;br/&gt;"arithmetic fundamental groups," that is to say the Galois group of&lt;br/&gt;a global field (finite extension of the rational numbers or the function&lt;br/&gt;field of a curve over a finite field) with a specified (finite) set of&lt;br/&gt;branch points. They will study, in particular, extensions in which the&lt;br/&gt;filtration of the Galois group by higher ramification groups has fixed&lt;br/&gt;bounded length, especially in connection with a conjecture of Fontaine and&lt;br/&gt;Mazur. The proposed activity includes a computational component which&lt;br/&gt;seeks to construct infinite fundamental groups with extremal properties. &lt;br/&gt;Such explicit constructions give a good qualitative understanding of the&lt;br/&gt;asymptotic behavior of discriminant with respect to the degree (number&lt;br/&gt;fields) and genus with respect to the number of points (curves over finite&lt;br/&gt;fields). The latter has applications to the efficiency of certain codes&lt;br/&gt;made from number fields and function fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a proposal in number theory, the oldest branch of mathematics&lt;br/&gt;where the fundamental question is that of solving polynomial equations.&lt;br/&gt;Knowledge regarding solutions of polynomial equations is of fundamental&lt;br/&gt;importance in cryptology and coding theory, the science of secure and&lt;br/&gt;efficient transmission of data. Solutions of polynomial equations in one&lt;br/&gt;unkown are equipped with a kind of algebraic symmetry and the study of&lt;br/&gt;these symmetries is called "Galois theory." These symmetries are encoded&lt;br/&gt;in a mathematical object called the Absolute Galois Group, which contains&lt;br/&gt;such a wealth of information about equations in not just one but any&lt;br/&gt;number of variables that it is sometimes known as the "Holy Grail of&lt;br/&gt;Number Theory." This proposal is a theoretical and computational&lt;br/&gt;investigation of certain aspects of the Absolute Galois Group.</AbstractNarration>
