<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to increase the numbers and percentages of area high school graduates that enroll as full-time students in pursuit of associate degrees with majors in Computer Science, Engineering Technology, and Mathematics (CSEM). The project seeks to (1) address the need for greater access and retention of students in the college's technical programs, (2) attract more women into the non-traditional computer science and engineering technology fields, and (3) provide opportunities for a rich pool of academically talented students who lack financial resources to complete their studies on a full-time basis, thereby speeding student progress in completing an associate degree or in transferring to a four-year institution. Priority is given to eligible first-generation and low-income students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An environment is being created that encourages academic and personal growth for CSEM Scholar. In addition to financial support, the program includes an array of intensive student support and career services, including comprehensive assessment of academic deficiencies; individual and computerized tutoring; study skills and standardized test preparation workshops; academic, personal, and career advising; and faculty, student, and industry mentors. A major component is the active recruitment of high school students enrolled in computer science and engineering related courses in the 42 school districts participating in the Weatherford College Tech Prep Consortium, with a special focus on recruiting female students. The project strengthens the transfer bridge between the college and the University of Texas at Arlington (UTA) and increases the incentives for students to pursue higher education through the newly implemented Texas TWO-STEP (Technology Workforce Opportunities through Seamless Transitions and Educational Partnerships) Project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over time, the combined efforts of these students provided can make a large impact on communities in high-poverty areas like those in the Weatherford College service area. This program increases the number for women choosing high-demand career fields. As graduates, they are role models to underrepresented students and women as they join national and international firms across the nation.</AbstractNarration>
