<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to construct an integrated accessible microscopical&lt;br/&gt;workstation that will allow students with disabilities to independently perform common&lt;br/&gt;biological laboratory techniques, thereby enabling individuals to actively participate in&lt;br/&gt;scientific experimentation and the opportunity to pursue a career in the SMET fields.&lt;br/&gt;This multi-purpose workstation is to be used primarily by persons with mobility&lt;br/&gt;impairments. All aspects of the integrated workstation will be operated from a central&lt;br/&gt;computer interface, which will be used to automatically control and monitor external&lt;br/&gt;peripheral devices so that biological experiments can be performed. Using a computer&lt;br/&gt;as the user interface and central control of the accessible laboratory workstation is&lt;br/&gt;ideal, because the personal computer can accommodate various disabilities using&lt;br/&gt;different pointing devices and accessibility software utilities. Total keystroke control of&lt;br/&gt;the integrated workstation will be emphasized.&lt;br/&gt;The intent of this proposal is to develop an accessible laboratory workstation that will&lt;br/&gt;allow students and investigators with mobility impairments to perform the majority of&lt;br/&gt;microscopical and histological laboratory procedures, most notably in the biological&lt;br/&gt;sciences, with minimal assistance and setup. The integrated microscopy workstation&lt;br/&gt;will use software to control all features of operation, including an automated&lt;br/&gt;microscope, motorized stage, bulk slide autoloader, and digital video camera. The&lt;br/&gt;workstation will allow a student with a disability to independently load up to fifty&lt;br/&gt;individual slides, focus, change objectives, filter wheels, illuminator and condensor, and&lt;br/&gt;position the microscopy specimen translationally in X and Y directions and rotationally&lt;br/&gt;using theta control - all controlled through a computer that will also capture images of&lt;br/&gt;the histological tissues to be managed and analyzed for anatomical studies. Thus, the&lt;br/&gt;only assistance the student with a disability requires is for someone to load the slides.&lt;br/&gt;All other phases of microscopy and image analysis can be performed without further&lt;br/&gt;assistance.&lt;br/&gt;The accessible microscopy workstation will be evaluated both in a classroom setting&lt;br/&gt;that performs typical undergraduate and post-graduate biological experimentation and&lt;br/&gt;in research laboratory setting that performs sophisticated laboratory procedures. Ten&lt;br/&gt;high school and college students with a range of mobility impairments will be assessed&lt;br/&gt;in the first year by their ability to use a computer and their specific ergonomics relating&lt;br/&gt;to the construction of the accessible workstation. In the second year the students will&lt;br/&gt;be tested on their ability to use the workstation to accomplish a variety of laboratory&lt;br/&gt;procedures. Educators will also be queried as to their capability of incorporating the&lt;br/&gt;workstation into the classroom environment.&lt;br/&gt;University and local high school educators and Special Education specialists and&lt;br/&gt;statewide organizations, like the Council of Volunteers/Organizations for Hoosiers with&lt;br/&gt;Disabilities (COVOH) and Assisting Technology through Awareness in Indiana&lt;br/&gt;(ATTAIN), which advocate the use of assistive technologies for persons with disabilities,&lt;br/&gt;will be utilized to disseminate findings and promote the use of the integrated microscopy&lt;br/&gt;workstation.</AbstractNarration>
