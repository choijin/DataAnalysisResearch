<AbstractNarration>This dissertation research by a cultural anthropologist will investigate development in two working class neighborhoods of Philadelphia. Focusing on the most stigmatized and "deviant" population - substance using and/or mentally ill adults - the research will examine how community members and development specialists understand deviance, as individuals who are at risk and under stress, and who present risk and act as stressors to the community. The research will study how deviance is understood by "Community-Based Organizations" (CBOs) and medical and social service providers to mentally ill and substance using adults, as well as by local institutions and community members. The research builds on three years of preliminary research with local CBOs and residents. Current research focuses on service provision to recipients in order to assess how they, their communities, and community organizations are targeted for development in ways that construct them as "deviant," and how these actors interpret the label of deviance to acquire resources.&lt;br/&gt;The research advances understanding by exploring the effects of economic processes such as structural adjustment, privatization, and market-based development. It also examines the effects of the medicalization of social life beyond the realm of biomedicine. The project analyzes social and medical services provided to recipients within the larger context of what - and who - should be included in "community development." Identifying the various models of "community" and "development" - that are used to understand poverty and substance use - can point out factors that may hinder community development, service provision, and grassroots struggle.&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this project lies in its practical applications for community development and service provision. The new knowledge to be created will be useful to community development planners, as well as community members and organizations. The project will also contribute to the training of a young social scientist. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
