<AbstractNarration>Project Abstract: &lt;br/&gt;This research aims to establish scientific principles and extend technologies for using Mixed Reality (MR) ? visualization blending real and virtual elements ? to support decision-making and control through the life cycle phases of constructed facility projects.  Challenges in establishing MR as a viable technology in the architecture, engineering, and construction (A/E/C) industry will be addressed through real-time virtual model generation, measurement of spatial cognition benefits, information visualization, and the definition of functionalities for individual and collaborative human-computer interactions. This research is guided by the promise of Mixed Reality to provide intuitive and liberal interactions with design models and related project data in a more ubiquitous computing environment for the construction enterprise.&lt;br/&gt;Two particular research foci are 1. the creation of efficient and intuitive design and planning environments that utilize MR technology for enhancing design comprehension and supporting collaborations; and 2. the creation of interface systems and interaction techniques that support the acquisition and communication of job site planning, execution, and inspection knowledge through direct access to graphically displayed, spatially referenced digital design data.  &lt;br/&gt;The core research is complemented by education activities encompassing both the creation of virtual visualization course modules and outreach and mentoring activities to expand the pipeline of African American students pursuing graduate degrees in civil engineering.  Recruiting and mentoring of students will be aided by a network of linkages with existing university outreach programs, an existing industry-university consortium, and parallel department-level initiatives to increase the numbers of women and students from Predominantly Undergraduate Institutions in engineering.&lt;br/&gt;The research plan aims to advance knowledge in the A/E/C industry with regard to human-machine interfaces and computer-mediated human-to-human interactions, particularly by addressing human factors.  This research will advance discovery in the construction discipline by applying a greater range of interdisciplinary expertise to meet challenges in creating, modifying, communicating, and comprehending constructed facility designs.  By further broadening the application of computing, the research serves to transform what is generally regarded as the predominantly "low-tech" nature of the A/E/C industry.  Enhancements can be achieved for both construction work processes and construction education.  The integrated education plan will develop a model for improving the network of relationships between minority and majority institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
