    <AbstractNarration>High-speed circuits are highly pipelined, use latches as opposed to flip-flops, and practice extensive time borrowing to reduce overheads of pipelining. Since speed is a critical objective, high quality delay testing, such as path delay testing, is imperative for such circuits. Use of latches and extensive time borrowing have two important consequences that give rise to new problems in delay testing. First, since the paths in one block interact with the paths in the blocks in its fan in and fan out, it becomes necessary to test for delay faults multi-block paths, i.e., paths that traverse multiple blocks of a circuit. The number of such paths is often astronomical. Second, due to time borrowing, values at a latch output are not applied at any fixed time, but at some time within a range. Since the exact time when values are applied at the outputs of a latch vary from vector to vector and from one fabricated copy of a chip to another, it is impossible to design design-for-testability (DFT) circuitry that mimics the timing of events during the normal mode of operation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two types of test application schemes are proposed that can be implemented using scan designs that do not try to mimic the timing of events during the circuit's normal operation but apply values and capture responses at specific clock edges. It is then proven that it is indeed possible to use such scan to precisely test, for path delay faults, latch based circuits that use time borrowing. Techniques to use above DFT technique to efficiently test such high-speed circuits will be developed. This will include development of a technique to generate optimal test plans as well as tools that can generate the types of tests and perform detailed design of DFT circuitry required by the proposed approach. The proposed research will provide the first systematic approach for achieving, at reasonable costs, efficient testing for path delay faults in high speed circuits while providing provably high test quality. The tools developed will be leveraged and extended for instructional purposes.</AbstractNarration>
