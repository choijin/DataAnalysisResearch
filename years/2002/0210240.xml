<AbstractNarration>This project was received in response to Nanoscale Science and Engineering initiative, NSF 01-157, category NER. This project is to develop a nanofabrication technique based on near-field optics to manipulate, modify and process matter at the nanoscale. This approach exploits the interaction of matter with the evanescent electromagnetic field of a laser exiting from a sub-wavelength aperture probe placed in close proximity (at a distance an order of magnitude smaller than the laser wavelength) to a substrate. This approach integrates techniques of microfabrication and MEMS, sub-wavelength photonics and near-field optics to produce structures in the sub-100 nm regime. The research consists of five tasks: 1) Near-field optics modeling and analysis, 2) Design and fabrication of the near-field optical probe, 3) Development of a high precision positioning stage for the optical probe, 4) Nanoscale laser materials processing and characterization, and 5) Fundamental studies on nanoscale transport phenomena and light-matter interaction. Together, these tasks will establish the scientific and technical basis for a near-field nano-optical laser processing technique.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will have the following impact on nanoscale science:  1) A scientific foundation for understanding the fundamental physical mechanisms governing transport phenomena in near-field nanoscale laser-matter interaction. 2) A scientific basis for systematic design of apparatus for near-field nano-optical laser materials processing. When successfully completed, this research will result in the following impact on nanotechnology: 1) New techniques for very rapid fabrication of two-dimensional and three-dimensional nanostructures. Applications include massively parallel maskless nano-lithography, massively parallel ultrahigh density magneto-optic phase change data storage, maskless nanoscale patterning of optical and photonic bandgap structures, polymeric and biological materials, and nanoscale laser-assisted chemical vapor deposition. 2) New techniques for massively parallel in-situ material characterization, process monitoring and manipulation at the nanometer length Applications include massively parallel nanoscale temperature measurement, flow control and valving in massively parallel micro- and nano-fluidics, and manipulation of biological molecules in vivo. Several industrial interactions are anticipated as a result of successful technological developments from this research. This project will train undergraduate and graduate students in the exciting fields of MEMS/microfabrication, photonics and near-field optics. Research results will be disseminated in national and international conferences and journal publications. Scientific fundamentals of near-field laser-matter interactions will be incorporated into an existing graduate course in Laser Materials Processing.</AbstractNarration>
