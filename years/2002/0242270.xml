<AbstractNarration>The focus of this research is the use of photochemical methods for the synthesis of organic compounds in the crystalline state.  Photodecarbonylation of aliphatic ketones to produce biradicals and the decomposition of diazo compounds is expected to lead to facile entry to cyclic compounds and singlet carbenes that are useful synthetic intermediates.  Mechanistic studies of the reaction pathways will shed light on radical dimerization and hydrogen abstraction processes in the solid state.  Dr. Garcia-Baribay's educational efforts focus on the training of graduate, undergraduate and post-doctoral chemists, many who come from non-traditional and disadvantaged backgrounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this renewal award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research and educational efforts of Dr. Miguel A. Garcia-Garibay in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at UCLA.  Professor Garcia-Garibay will focus his work on the development of chemical processes that can be performed in the solid state with light as a reagent. These processes will allow the synthesis of complex organic compounds without the use of solvents or heavy metals that can pollute the environment.  The resulting "green chemistry" is expected to be of use by pharmaceutical companies.  The educational activities of the award will enhance opportunities for women and Hispanic students at UCLA.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
