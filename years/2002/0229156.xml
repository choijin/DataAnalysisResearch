<AbstractNarration>We are developing  open-ended computer simulations of protein laboratory&lt;br/&gt;procedures for case-based learning in international biology curricula. We are distributing&lt;br/&gt;these simulations freely via Internet download so that they are available to university and&lt;br/&gt;high school students worldwide. Existing protein software applications lack the ability to&lt;br/&gt;produce realistic, easily understandable output for procedures such as enzyme&lt;br/&gt;immunoassays, hemagglutination inhibition, immunofluorescence, protein&lt;br/&gt;electrophoresis, and western blotting. Such procedures are especially useful for the&lt;br/&gt;analysis of cases involving infectious diseases of humans and domestic animals including&lt;br/&gt;anthrax, foot-and-mouth disease, influenza, HIV infection, hantavirus, encephalitis, Lyme&lt;br/&gt;disease, genital herpes, hepatitis, brucellosis and rinderpest, among many others. They&lt;br/&gt;provide a vehicle for making topics in molecular biology more interesting and relevant to&lt;br/&gt;students, particularly female non-science majors. Protein simulations complement&lt;br/&gt;DNA simulations we have previously developed and freely distributed for the analysis of cases&lt;br/&gt;based primarily on human genetic diseases. The proposed simulations have wide&lt;br/&gt;applicability because they can be adapted to any protein-based case scenario. Students&lt;br/&gt;can participate in Internet "poster sessions" via an online integrated web editor /&lt;br/&gt;conferencing system we developed with prior NSF support.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pre-service science teachers are being used as research assistants for assessment, and results&lt;br/&gt;are being widely disseminated via presentations, workshops, and publications including the&lt;br/&gt;BioQUEST Library. The BioQUEST Curriculum Consortium strongly supports this&lt;br/&gt;proposal and is assisting in the evaluation and dissemination of project results.</AbstractNarration>
