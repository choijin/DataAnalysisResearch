<AbstractNarration>The intellectual merit of this CAREER program is based on the design and realization of innovative sensors to improve measurement of the three-dimensional distribution of water vapor in the atmosphere. Knowledge of the temporal and spatial distribution of water vapor is fundamental for short-range prediction of precipitation and severe weather. The paucity of current observations of wind, temperature and humidity in pre-storm environments limits the improvement of forecast skill for these events.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will address these needs through the fabrication, validation and application of a four-sensor demonstration network of miniaturized water vapor profiling radiometers. This novel sensor design is enabled by microwave monolithic integrated circuit (MMIC) technology made widely available by the wireless communications industry. Compared to conventional waveguide-based designs, MMIC technology allows these sensors to be smaller, lighter and more robust. New sensor technologies will enable larger networks of water vapor radiometers to perform higher-resolution observations. The demonstration network will be used to validate remote water vapor measurements using both radiometers and SuomiNet GPS receivers, through comparison with in-situ observations, including radiosondes launched by the National Weather Service. The automated pointing of the network's sensors will enable direct comparison of GPS slant water vapor with radiometric profiles along the same slant paths.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The educational portion of this project will introduce applications in atmospheric science to significant numbers of undergraduate electrical engineering students. Novel methods of instruction will be introduced to encourage students to find the relationships between curriculum content and "real-world" applications and to participate in peer-to-peer learning. Promising undergraduate students will be involved in design and fabrication of remote sensors in the laboratory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the program include the availability of miniaturized atmospheric sensors to be deployed in larger networks, enhancing observation of the atmospheric state in order to improve weather prediction and climate monitoring, clearly providing benefits to society. The research program will foster collaborations among universities, industry and government. The research goals of this program lead naturally to collaboration with small U.S. businesses that produce radiometers for research. Other broader impacts include the PI's continuing mentoring of students from underrepresented groups as part of an NSF-sponsored summer program.</AbstractNarration>
