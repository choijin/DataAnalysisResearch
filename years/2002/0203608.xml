<AbstractNarration>This individual investigator award will support an experimental project that focuses on quasi-two-dimensional (2D), nanostructured films near their superconductor to nonsuperconductor quantum phase transitions (QPTs).  Nanostructured proximity effect arrays, consisting of nanoscale superconducting grains embedded in a metal film and nanoscale wire arrays of superconducting films will be tuned through their superconductor to non-superconductor transitions and probed with electron magnetotransport and tunneling measurements at dilution refrigerator temperatures.  The physics behind the QPTs in the nano-arrays, while similar to the well-known superconductor to insulator transitions is expected to sharply contrast with them.   Because of the nanoscale dimensions, the phase and amplitude degrees of freedom in the superconducting order parameter, rather than just the phase, will vary strongly through these transitions.  These experiments have the potential to reveal new classes of QPTs, and to provide physical insight into the origin of pseudogaps, and unconventional metallic phases in 2D correlated electron systems, such as the underdoped high temperature superconductors.  While being immersed in important current problems in condensed matter physics, the students involved in this research will develop expertise in nanotechnology, scanning probe microscopies and low temperature techniques that will make them potentially attractive to industry and prepare them to be future leaders in science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ability to produce and obtain images of electronic materials with features as small as a few billionths of a meter (a few nanometers) leads to new opportunities in technology and fundamental science.  In technology, as more speed and power is demanded from our computers the dimensions of the electronics necessarily rapidly shrink toward the nanodimensions.  On a fundamental side, new properties can emerge in seemingly familiar materials such as the metal copper when its dimensions are reduced to the nanometer scale.  How small can a piece of copper be and still maintain the properties which are commonly associated with a metal?   This individual investigator award supports a project that focuses on how the properties of superconducting materials (i.e. materials which lose all of their electrical resistance when cooled close to the absolute zero of temperature) change when some of their dimensions are pared down to the few nanometer scale.  Measurements on two types of structures, nanostructured proximity effect arrays and nanoscale superconducting wire arrays, will test recent theories that suggest that the superconductors go through a dramatic change, becoming more like a metallic state of matter, when their dimensions become small enough.  This metal state is predicted to have exotic properties that are similar to those of the technologically relevant high temperature superconductor materials. Thus, these nanostructured superconductors will serve as a model system that can lend new insight into other more complex materials.  In addition, they will be used to address the simple and fundamental question of how finely structured can a superconductor be and still maintain its superconducting properties?  While being immersed in important current problems in condensed matter physics, the students involved in this research will develop expertise in nanotechnology, scanning probe microscopies and low temperature techniques that will make them potentially attractive to industry and prepare them to be future leaders in science.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
