<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;Proposal #:  0229441&lt;br/&gt;PI:  Wicklein&lt;br/&gt;Inst:  U of GA Res Fdn Inc&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary focus of this one-year project is to design and develop a model summer engineering education institute focusing on integration of engineering content with mathematics, science, and technology education that could motivate academically qualified high school seniors to seriously consider engineering majors in college.  Another objective is The institute model builds teams of educators at various levels - teacher educators from mathematics, science and technology education; engineering educators; in-service teachers; pre-service teachers; undergraduate engineering students; and secondary students - to stimulate the inclusion of significant engineering related instructional content within the public school curriculum.   The teams will participate in a variety of classroom and laboratory-based experiences along with field trips and motivational speakers that focus on engineering concepts to illustrate real-world applications of mathematics, science, and technology.  Faculty in engineering and education and teachers continue to develop engineering enhanced instructional materials and strategies to be tested in public schools and the university in the months following the institute. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
