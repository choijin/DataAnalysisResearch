<AbstractNarration>The REU program in Tropical Ecology and Evolution, University of Puerto Rico, is based at El Verde Field Station, in the tropical rainforest of Puerto Rico.  The program goal is to provide research experiences for undergraduates by immersing them in an active research environment, providing guidance from established scientists while they develop an independent research project, providing educational activities designed to equip students with the necessary tools to conduct scientific research, and, in many cases, providing them the opportunity to study and conduct research in an ecosystem and culture not easily accessible at their home institution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Undergraduate students will spend most of their ten-week internship developing a research project in coordination with a faculty mentor.  We have enrolled a group of active mentors with expertise in areas of plant (e.g., plant population biology, community dynamics, and forest ecology), arthropod (aquatic and terrestrial), and soil ecology, as well as evolution (e.g., plant reproductive ecology, population genetics).  Every year, students will have a wide variety of potential areas of study to choose from depending on their area of interest.  Students will also participate of seminars and workshops on scientific data analysis, data presentation, and techniques to study different groups of tropical organisms and ecosystems (e.g., forest, soil, streams).  An ethical component will focus on common issues likely to be encountered by students during their careers as well as discussions on the role of scientists in modern society.  We consider critical to stress to the students the impact that scientists could have in our society if they take active roles.  This combination of activities will provide students with the tools needed to conduct scientific research in any area of science, with emphasis on Tropical Ecology and Evolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The REU site in Tropical Ecology and Evolution at the University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras, will enroll eight undergraduate students every year.  Students will be selected based on their academic qualifications (e.g., GPA, letters of recommendation) and interest in pursuing graduate studies.  We will give emphasis to students from institutions where research programs are not easily accessible (e.g., teaching colleges) and to minorities.  Students will participate in the program for 10 weeks during summer break, spending most of their time in the field conducting scientific research.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For additional information contact Alonso Ramirez (aramirez@sunites.upr.clu.edu; Telephone: 787-764-0000, ext. 7781) or visit the program's web site at http://sunites.upr.clu.edu/REU/index.htm&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
