    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a novel functional &lt;br/&gt;nanostructure for detection/identification of biological warfare agents (BWA). A new class of &lt;br/&gt;fluorescence-amplified nano-assembly (FLAN) is proposed for real-time, selective, and ultra-&lt;br/&gt;sensitive BWAs and toxins assays. The basic concept of this technology is to mimic the cell &lt;br/&gt;membrane under certain organisms and toxins initially attack. Living cells quickly recognize and &lt;br/&gt;selectively respond towards invasion. The FLAN using three key elements for target detection: 1) &lt;br/&gt;molecular recognition, 2) fluorescence transduction, and 3) fluorescence amplification, to &lt;br/&gt;provide simple and direct fluorescent assay. The molecular receptors recognize the BWA; &lt;br/&gt;the binding causes a change in the local ternary structure, and which leads to an amplified &lt;br/&gt;fluorescent structure that can be quantified optically. The synthetic nanostructures exhibit &lt;br/&gt;bioactivities and high stability. The BWA-FLAN receptor binding is a rapid one-step reaction; it &lt;br/&gt;does not require complicate separation and washing steps, labeled fluorophore, or visualization &lt;br/&gt;reagents. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the Phase I project, the investigator will design and synthesize functional nanostructures with BWA-&lt;br/&gt;specific receptors, develop FLAN molecular assembly, develop fluorescence sensing system, &lt;br/&gt;characterize, test, and evaluate its technical merits. Highly selective and sensitive molecular &lt;br/&gt;recognition is important throughout biology, biotechnology, and clinical diagnostics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Homeland and civilian defense applications include medical diagnostic of pathogens and diseases &lt;br/&gt;as well as non-medical contamination avoidance sensors for biological terrorism agents. The &lt;br/&gt;proposed nanostructure-based assays could be easily adapted to targets of interest to the medical &lt;br/&gt;community, environmental and agricultural testing, and food industry and used in conjunction &lt;br/&gt;with the portable reader for diagnostics in clinical or hospital setting.</AbstractNarration>
