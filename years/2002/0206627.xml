<AbstractNarration>0206627&lt;br/&gt;Xiao&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant will support a two-day symposium on "New Trends in &lt;br/&gt;Nonlinear Dynamics and Control, and Their Applications," to be &lt;br/&gt;held at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California &lt;br/&gt;from September 19-20, 2002. The conference will focus on new &lt;br/&gt;and innovative developments in nonlinear dynamics and its &lt;br/&gt;applications, such as nonlinear observer design, cooperative &lt;br/&gt;control, flow control, and bifurcation control. The symposium will &lt;br/&gt;include several invited 50-minute talks and a series of shorter &lt;br/&gt;contributed presentations of approximately 20 minutes each. The &lt;br/&gt;organizers plan to publish proceedings of this meeting in book &lt;br/&gt;form. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rapid pace of change in technology constantly presents new &lt;br/&gt;challenges and new opportunities to researchers in systems and &lt;br/&gt;control, especially those in nonlinear control. Advances in &lt;br/&gt;materials science, active actuators and sensors, and fluid &lt;br/&gt;mechanics challenge the community to develop controllers for &lt;br/&gt;complex nonlinear systems of both finite and infinite dimensions. &lt;br/&gt;Models of nonlinear systems that are especially interesting to &lt;br/&gt;researchers in nonlinear control include fluid dynamics, flow &lt;br/&gt;control, smart materials, and chemical reactions. The nonlinearity &lt;br/&gt;of these complex systems leads not just to instability but also to &lt;br/&gt;periodic solutions, bifurcations, and chaos. Recent research shows &lt;br/&gt;promise for controlling such systems to achieve stability or &lt;br/&gt;instability.  Cooperative control is another research topic of &lt;br/&gt;nonlinear systems that is attracting increasing attention. Recent &lt;br/&gt;advances in computing and communications make it possible to &lt;br/&gt;operate a large number of autonomous or semi-autonomous agents &lt;br/&gt;simultaneously in a cooperative manner. Such systems involve &lt;br/&gt;nonlinearities that are far more complicated than those exhibited &lt;br/&gt;by a single system. Problems involving cooperative control of &lt;br/&gt;multiple nonlinear systems are found to have numerous &lt;br/&gt;applications. Several of the presentations and discussions during &lt;br/&gt;the symposium will address issues related to cooperative control &lt;br/&gt;and its applications (e.g., control of a satellite constellation, &lt;br/&gt;multiple munitions). The symposium will provide an opportunity &lt;br/&gt;for both well-established and young researchers to exchange ideas &lt;br/&gt;on new developments and directions for future research. These &lt;br/&gt;new challenges require a review of major developments in &lt;br/&gt;nonlinear control theory from the past and to discuss new research &lt;br/&gt;trends to meet the ever-increasing needs of industrial applications. &lt;br/&gt;Major topics to be addressed in the symposium include new &lt;br/&gt;developments in the theory of nonlinear systems and control such &lt;br/&gt;as nonlinear observers, bifurcations and control, and turbulence &lt;br/&gt;and control.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
