<AbstractNarration>CSTB would convene an expert committee to conduct a comprehensive assessment of telecommunications research and development.  The study would develop a picture of telecommunications research in the United States, including areas that are and are not  being  emphasized,  the  interplay  between  telecommunications  and  neighboring fields  such  as  computer  science  and  electrical  engineering,  and  the  relationships between  pre-competitive  research  and  standards-setting  efforts.    The  study  would examine changes in the level of support, research focus, and research time horizon at the major U.S. industrial labs as well as more broadly across the industry, including startups.    The study would  also  examine  telecommunications  research  within universities,  considering  how  much  is  done,  where,  and  under what  conditions. It would  assess  the  implications  of  these  changes  for  the  U.S.  telecommunications industry--recognizing  that that industry itself is  changing and considering possible future trajectories for the industry--and compare the U.S. research model to research initiatives being undertaken in other countries (especially Europe and Japan) and bythe European Union.  Looking across industry and academia, it would consider future research directions, the interplay between telecommunications and computer science, and assess whether new institutional arrangements or programs are needed.   &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The project would culminate in a consensus report recommending ways to strengthen the U.S. research base, sustain education and training of future telecommunications researchers, and enhance the competitiveness of the U.S. telecommunications sector. The  report  would  be  distributed  to  key  decision-makers  in  government,  industry, academia; as well as congressional staff and the general public.  The report would be made available on the Web as well as in hard copy.  The completed report would be briefed to interested parties in government, industry, and academia. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the project and its broader impacts both would flow from its focusing  attention  on  an  area  of  critical  national  (and  international)  importance. Historically,  telecommunications  R&amp;D  has  been  the  province  of  private  industry(with comparatively little effort in academia), notably the former Ma Bell and other companies  that were  leaders  in  different  telecommunications  segments--actors  that have  suffered  with  recent  economic  conditions.    Intellectually,   the  project  would explore and characterize telecommunications as a field and a focus for different kinds of research.  It will address what it would take to grow a more significant academic research capability.  In addition to stimulating research, boosting academic interest and activity, the project will have broader impacts by helping to sustain and enhance an  arena  that  is  important  to  national  security,  economic  competitiveness,  and  the larger base of information technology capability and use of which telecommunications is  a  vital part.  The technical opportunities it will discuss will be linked to benefits among the public and large and specific segments as users of different kinds of telecommunications capabilities. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
