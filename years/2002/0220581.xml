<AbstractNarration>This is a continuation of the current CSEMS scholarship program for 30 mathematics and computer science majors at Augsburg College in Minneapolis, MN. Our program targets underrepresented groups and non-traditional age students. The program includes a mentoring seminar to be held one evening per month, internship and career placement at major Twin Cities companies, and the opportunity to work on research projects with faculty members.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A selection process has been designed for entry into the program with specific criteria which applicants must satisfy. Yearly renewal of the scholarship is required of each recipient. The recruitment plan includes working with the Fond du Lac Tribal and Community College to bring in more Native American students and visits to inner city high schools located near the Augsburg campus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Support structures incorporate and augment existing campus programs. The program has been designed to be not only a scholarship award but a concerted effort to keep these students from falling through the cracks. The emphasis is on mentoring from faculty, fellow students, and industry and community representatives with ties to the college.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
