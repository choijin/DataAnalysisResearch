<AbstractNarration>This CAREER project aims to expand the fundamental scope of crystalline colloidal array de-rived photonic band gap materials, and extend photonic crystal research into functional polymeric composites. The project takes an interdisciplinary experimental approach including polymer synthesis, materials science, polymer physics, and applied fabrication. In addition, theoretical calculations are coupled with experimental activities to guide material modifications and relate their effects on observed optical properties of PBG composites. Five complementary objectives are being pursued in parallel: (1) development of materials and methods for the stabilization of self-assembled colloidal arrays and minimization of lattice imperfections; (2) development of materials and methods for the enhancement of the optical performance of PBG composites, coupled with added photonic functionalities; (4) development of PBG composites which exhibit thermo- and electromechanically actuated band stop tuning; and (5) development of PBG com-posites which exhibit intrinsic array-based chemical sensing characteristics. The overall research goal is to enable interdependent control of the primary structure of PBG composites and observed optical and mechanical properties. Resulting technological implications will be investigated to highlight multifunctional characteristics of these materials. &lt;br/&gt;%%% &lt;br/&gt;The project addresses fundamental materials science research issues having technological relevance. An important feature of the project is the strong emphasis on education, and the integration of research and education. The research objectives are being approached by integrating education into the research process through student involvement at various levels: (1) development of graduate-level courses focused on the fundamentals of polymer science; (2) active mentoring of graduate and undergraduate students through direct participation of senior personnel in labora-tory research; and (3) the development of a summer research exposure program for high school students. The development of graduate-level courses focusing on the atomistic simulation of polymers and polymer physics will foster the creation of a College-wide interdisciplinary polymer science curriculum. To that end, these courses will be offered in both the School of Materials Science &amp; Engineering and the Center for Advanced Engineering Fibers and Films (CAEFF), an NSF Engineering Research Center. The addition of these courses to the polymer science curriculum will assist students in developing a firm foundation in polymer science and, specifically, assist those graduate students involved in the proposed research to successfully carry out the research objectives. To assist with regional educational opportunities in South Carolina, a summer research exposure program has been developed, labeled the School-to-University Research Ex-posure (SURE). This program integrates lectures on material science to junior and senior high school level students with invitations to perform research at Clemson University for one month in the summer on PBG composites. An important goal of the SURE program is to identify those students in a wide socioeconomic spectrum that may be technically inclined, with a specific focus on minorities and adolescents from rural areas, and encourage them to pursue a technical field of study.&lt;br/&gt;*** &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
