    <AbstractNarration>The investigator studies systems with multiple interacting&lt;br/&gt;components that together create rhythms. The systems come from&lt;br/&gt;neural, chemical, and gene regulatory contexts. There are two&lt;br/&gt;main themes. The first is reduction of dimensions, investigating&lt;br/&gt;the circumstances under which large-dimensional models behave&lt;br/&gt;like much lower-dimensional differential equations or maps. Some&lt;br/&gt;of that work uses geometric singular perturbation theory to&lt;br/&gt;investigate how systems with multiple degrees of freedom&lt;br/&gt;"condense" to essentially lower-dimensional systems, at least&lt;br/&gt;locally in phase space. Another set of issues related to&lt;br/&gt;reduction of dimension concerns fast partial synchronization.&lt;br/&gt;The second theme concerns how interaction of many components in a&lt;br/&gt;system can lead to the suppression of activity in some of the&lt;br/&gt;components. Two examples of this to be studied come from a&lt;br/&gt;chemical pattern formation and neural systems, each with some&lt;br/&gt;type of global inhibitory feedback.&lt;br/&gt; Systems with many separate but interacting components arise&lt;br/&gt;in a large variety of applications, including biotechnology,&lt;br/&gt;chemical engineering, and neurobiology. In general, such systems&lt;br/&gt;have a large number of degrees of freedom, and are usually&lt;br/&gt;investigated by numerical simulation. However, simulations alone&lt;br/&gt;do not provide a deep understanding of why the systems behave the&lt;br/&gt;way they do, or how they can be manipulated. Reductions of&lt;br/&gt;equations to smaller systems can be very useful. But without a&lt;br/&gt;principled way to do the reductions, one does not know how much&lt;br/&gt;of the behavior of the large system is lost. This project&lt;br/&gt;concerns methods to find such principled reductions, using&lt;br/&gt;mathematical tools that enable one to investigate circumstances&lt;br/&gt;under which parts of the dynamics behave like that of systems&lt;br/&gt;with a much smaller number of degrees of freedom. Other tools to&lt;br/&gt;be used allow one to understand how only some subset of the&lt;br/&gt;components can be involved at a given time, even though all&lt;br/&gt;components are coupled. The methods are applied to problems from&lt;br/&gt;neural, chemical and gene regulation systems. The project also&lt;br/&gt;provides interdisciplinary training opportunities for students&lt;br/&gt;and postdocs.</AbstractNarration>
