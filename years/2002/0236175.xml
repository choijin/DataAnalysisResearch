<AbstractNarration>This workshop will bring together key people to discuss opportunities for enhancing, via organized computational efforts, the research infrastructure in Algebra, Number Theory, and Combinatorics.  The list of anticipated participants includes researchers who use computational tools in their research, researchers who have developed computational tools for use in research, and researchers not currently making significant use of computational tools.  An effort is being made to include women and other researchers from groups under-represented in mathematics. The outcome of the workshop will be a document that will contain general principles, strategies, and long-range goals intended to be useful for the program officers in ANTC as they decide on future proposal that contain computational aspects.  It is hoped that this document will also stimulate further discussion and action within the research community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some of the main issues that will be addressed at this workshop are:&lt;br/&gt;1. What kind of problems do we want to solve?&lt;br/&gt;2. What tools do we need?&lt;br/&gt;3. Knowing what tools we need, how to we make them available and how do we implement them?&lt;br/&gt;4. How can we simplify the process of making data available to anyone who would like to use it?&lt;br/&gt;The workshop is intended as a brainstorming session to systematically organize the communities' efforts regarding these issues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
