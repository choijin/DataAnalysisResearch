<AbstractNarration>0211214&lt;br/&gt;Farrah&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description:  This award is to support a collaborative project between Dr. Samuel Farrah, Professor in the Department of Microbiology and Cell Science and in the Engineering Research Center for Particle Science and Technology (ERC/PS&amp;T) at the University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida and Dr. Nagui Abdel-Khalek, Central Metallurgical Research and Development Institute, Helwan, Cairo, Egypt.  The two scientists plan to investigate mechanisms involved in the application of biologically active species to achieve better solid/solid and solid/liquid separations, with the specific aim of separation of phosphate from its associated carbonates during flotation process and the dewatering of slimes of extremely fine particles.  The final objective is to develop a predictive methodology that can be used to optimize the process by determining the performance of various bacteria, their adsorption behaviors on the mineral surfaces, and the surface properties of the bacteria and the minerals.  The tasks of the project include microbial sample collection, growing and characterization of microorganisms, fundamental study of the adsorption of microorganisms onto apatite and dolomite minerals and clay sample, flotation of phosphate samples of different composition from the U.S. and from Egypt, and economic evaluation of the processes.  The two teams will share responsibilities in these tasks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scope:  This project aims to advance new processes for solid-liquid separation and also for solid-solid separation, particularly for those minerals of similar surface properties such as separation of apatite from dolomite and/or calcite. Flotation of dolomitic phosphates in both countries is not yet commercialized.  The United States and Egypt are both major producers of phosphate, which generates huge amounts of slime as waste from different industries.  Advancing new technologies that depend on surface modification of minerals through application of microorganisms during flotation or flocculation of fine and ultrafine particles will enhance their separation with high selectivity, with reduced adverse environmental impacts.  The ERC/PS&amp;T and the CMRDI have the necessary facilities and resources to conduct this research. The results of this study are expected to benefit both countries, especially if the developed processes are be applied to other materials.  This project is being supported under the US-Egypt Joint Fund Program, which provides grants to scientists and engineers in both countries to carry out these cooperative activities.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
