    <AbstractNarration>The recent successful launch of the Thermosphere, Ionosphere, Mesosphere, Energetics and Dynamics (TIMED) satellite presents a unique opportunity to obtain global measurements of the mesosphere that can be coordinated with ground-based instrumentation to further our understanding of the dynamics of this important region. This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) project requests support for ground-based Medium Frequency (MF) radar measurements using the Imaging Doppler Interferometry (IDI) technique as implemented on the dynasonde operating at the Utah State University Bear Lake Observatory. Because the IDI technique is viewed by many within the aeronomy community as being controversial, this study will also carry out a detailed analysis of coordinated meteor wind measurements, as well as undertaking a correlation analysis using similar measurements acquired with an MF radar being operated at the Platteville site in Colorado.</AbstractNarration>
