<AbstractNarration>This project will investigate the roles of affective imagery and cultural&lt;br/&gt;worldviews in risk perception, decision-making and behavior, using global&lt;br/&gt;climate change as a case study. Past research has focused on the role of&lt;br/&gt;cognitive factors like knowledge, mental models and general environmental&lt;br/&gt;beliefs in risk perceptions of climate change. Recent research, however, has&lt;br/&gt;also begun to focus on the role of affective factors. This project will&lt;br/&gt;develop and test affective image analysis as an innovative method to study&lt;br/&gt;public risk perceptions along both cognitive and affective dimensions.&lt;br/&gt;Additionally, cultural theorists argue that cultural worldviews are also&lt;br/&gt;important factors and need to be included as explanatory variables. This&lt;br/&gt;project will operationalize and test the predictions of cultural theory.&lt;br/&gt;Finally, many researchers assume that risk perceptions and behaviors&lt;br/&gt;correlate, yet little focused research has been done. This research will&lt;br/&gt;test this assumption, using climate change as a case study.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project also addresses several applied questions: Does the American&lt;br/&gt;public perceive global climate change as a serious risk? What specifically&lt;br/&gt;do they fear about it? Do these risk perceptions translate into personal&lt;br/&gt;actions and/or support for mitigation policies?  This research will&lt;br/&gt;contribute to the continuing discussion on global climate change, as&lt;br/&gt;scientists and policymakers attempt to find scientifically appropriate and&lt;br/&gt;publicly acceptable solutions to this global problem.</AbstractNarration>
