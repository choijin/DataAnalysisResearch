<AbstractNarration>This research is about using the "provable-security approach" in the design and analysis of high-level cryptographic protocols.  The aim is to gain assurance for practical cryptographic schemes by finding the right definitions, and then using modern techniques (reductions and their concrete-security analysis) to analyze selected schemes.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specific problems to be investigated include: (1) Storing a user's private information on an untrusted server.  Here one wants to store user data in such a way that the user can recover it by presenting a password, but an adversary must invest an amount of interaction proportional to the guessing-complexity of the password.  (2) The authenticated-encryption scheme in SSH.  Though the method used by SSH is not, in general, correct, the situation for SSH itself is far from clear.  (3) Delegation of authority to a secondary signature key by a primary one.  A well-known approach in security practice, the problem that this solution aims to solve is without any provable-security treatment.  (4) Relating the "prescriptive" approach to formalizing authenticated key exchange and the simulation-based approach.  (5) Moving to an enriched model of computation, an envelope model, to investigate authenticated key exchange. (6) A systematic investigation of the "game walking" approach to analyzing cryptographic scenarios. Here two adversarial views are compared by writing out a sequence of pseudocode "games" each of which may set some Boolean flag. One bounds the difference in adversarial views by bounding the probability that the flag gets set. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
