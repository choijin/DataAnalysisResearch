<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT DMS - 0203219.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professors Boyer and Galicki propose to investigate several &lt;br/&gt;projects in geometry and topology. The objective of all the  &lt;br/&gt;projects is to study fundamental questions in Riemannian &lt;br/&gt;Geometry with two main focal points:  Contact Geometry of&lt;br/&gt;orbifold bundles over Fano varieties and the existence of some&lt;br/&gt;special (i.e., Einstein, positive Ricci curvature) metrics on such spaces. &lt;br/&gt;The questions and problems proposed here are deeply rooted in the&lt;br/&gt;principal investigators' earlier work which exploited a fundamental &lt;br/&gt;relationship between contact geometry of Sasakian-Einstein spaces and &lt;br/&gt;two kinds of Kaehler geometry, namely Q-factorial Fano varieties with &lt;br/&gt;Kaehler-Einstein orbifold metrics with positive scalar curvature, and &lt;br/&gt;Calabi-Yau manifolds with their Kaehler Ricci-flat metrics. &lt;br/&gt;The most recent work of the principal investigators has led to an &lt;br/&gt;important breakthrough in the study of such structures when,&lt;br/&gt;using recent results of Demailly and Kollar, the principal investigators&lt;br/&gt;were able to construct new examples of compact Einstein manifolds in dimension &lt;br/&gt;5 as well as many positive Einstein metrics on families of rational&lt;br/&gt;homology 7-spheres. The techniques used by the principal investigators borrow from&lt;br/&gt;several different fields; the algebraic geometry of Mori theory and intersection&lt;br/&gt;theory, the analysis of the Calabi Conjecture, and finally the&lt;br/&gt;classical differential topology of links of isolated hypersurface&lt;br/&gt;singularities. These methods can be extended much further and in&lt;br/&gt;various directions. An example that stands out in this respect is the &lt;br/&gt;question of the existence of Einstein metrics on exotic spheres, which is &lt;br/&gt;one of the main objectives of this proposal. More generally the principal investigators &lt;br/&gt;want to  address several classification problems concerning compact Sasakian-Einstein &lt;br/&gt;manifolds in dimensions 5 and 7. These two dimensions are important for two separate &lt;br/&gt;reasons. In view of earlier work higher dimensional examples can be constructed using &lt;br/&gt;the join construction. At the same time these two odd dimensions appear to play special &lt;br/&gt;role in Superstring Theory. In the context of recent developements in&lt;br/&gt;String and M-Theory the principal investigators also propose to&lt;br/&gt;investigate some related problems concerning  self-dual Einstein metrics in &lt;br/&gt;dimension 4 and exceptional holonomy metrics in dimension 7 and 8.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is intended to further the understanding of the mathematics&lt;br/&gt;of certain important types of geometry. While this endeavor is not&lt;br/&gt;directly motivated by advances in technology, the history of mathematics&lt;br/&gt;adequately demonstrates that today's pure mathematics often becomes&lt;br/&gt;tomorrow's applied mathematics. Indeed the mathematics being considered in&lt;br/&gt;this project is currently being used in the field of Elementary Particle&lt;br/&gt;Physics, more specifically, in the attempts at understanding a unified&lt;br/&gt;description of the fundamental forces of the universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
