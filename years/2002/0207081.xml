<AbstractNarration>Hanson&lt;br/&gt;0207081&lt;br/&gt;     The principal investigator and his colleagues develop&lt;br/&gt;computational stochastic dynamic programming methods to find&lt;br/&gt;approximations to optimally control the expected objective value&lt;br/&gt;for a wide variety of applications.  These applications include&lt;br/&gt;the optimal treatment of cancer by chemotherapy drugs, the&lt;br/&gt;optimal financial investment portfolio and parameter estimation,&lt;br/&gt;optimal control of stochastic manufacturing systems, and the&lt;br/&gt;optimal remediation of ground water pollution.  The wide scope of&lt;br/&gt;testbed applications helps to increase the robustness of their&lt;br/&gt;advanced numerical methods by having to treat a variety of models&lt;br/&gt;and boundary conditions.  Another characteristic of many of these&lt;br/&gt;applications is that the most severe changes happen as jumps of&lt;br/&gt;the system and many models utilize stochastic jump-diffusion&lt;br/&gt;processes.  The computation of optimal approximations in jump&lt;br/&gt;environments is a unique feature of the models, where increased&lt;br/&gt;realism of the models more than compensates for the added burden&lt;br/&gt;of increased computational complexity over diffusions.  The&lt;br/&gt;investigator is writing an applied book with a colleague on&lt;br/&gt;stochastic processes and control emphasizing jump-diffusion&lt;br/&gt;models to give broader impact to their more general results.  The&lt;br/&gt;mathematical level is intermediate so that it is accessible and&lt;br/&gt;useful to those who actually work with real applications in&lt;br/&gt;science, engineering, and finance.&lt;br/&gt;     The principal investigator and colleagues study models of&lt;br/&gt;systems in uncertain environments and seek optimal computational&lt;br/&gt;approximations to get the best performance from these systems.&lt;br/&gt;Many of the applications are national challenges.  One&lt;br/&gt;application is the optimal management of cancer chemotherapy when&lt;br/&gt;cancer cells develop resistance to a cancer drug combination.&lt;br/&gt;The impact of finding optimal cancer treatment schedules would be&lt;br/&gt;significant because cancer is a leading cause of death.  Another&lt;br/&gt;application is computational solutions for optimal investor&lt;br/&gt;portfolio and consumption problems in a market with crashes in&lt;br/&gt;value; the benefit is a better understanding of our nation's and&lt;br/&gt;the world's financial systems.  A third application is the&lt;br/&gt;optimal scheduling of manufacturing systems subject to uncertain&lt;br/&gt;failures, repairs, and other disruptions.  Here improved&lt;br/&gt;efficiencies are important for the national economic well-being.&lt;br/&gt;A fourth application is the optimal remediation of pollution in&lt;br/&gt;ground water, with important environmental consequences.  Students&lt;br/&gt;are involved in these projects, providing them with significant&lt;br/&gt;experience in interdisciplinary research.  Finally, the&lt;br/&gt;investigators are writing an intermediate level applied book on&lt;br/&gt;the optimal control of systems in uncertain environments with&lt;br/&gt;large changes, integrating their results over a wide variety of&lt;br/&gt;applications.  The aim is to bring these ideas in a more&lt;br/&gt;accessible form to scientists and engineers.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
