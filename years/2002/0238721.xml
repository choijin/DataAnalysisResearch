<AbstractNarration>0238721   Morrison   Dr. Morrison's career goal is to promote best practices in engineering, science and education by integrating novel air pollution research with undergraduate coursework.  His goals are achieved by:  applying best education practices to increase and improve student learning given limited in-class contact time,  integrating research and course work through projects that introduce college, high school and non-traditional students to high-level experimental research while allowing students to generate publishable data, and  probing the physics and chemistry of indoor air pollution, a poorly studied area of air quality research.&lt;br/&gt;Building on efforts to bring research to high school students, the PI is continuing to actively apply improved teaching practices. Specifically, Dr. Morrison has been selected to participate in the competitive "New Faculty Teaching Scholars" program of the University of Missouri system. This program seeks to improve student learning by challenging new teachers to incorporate the most successful teaching techniques in the classroom and coursework. &lt;br/&gt;Dr. Morrison has been active in indoor air pollution research for nearly eight years and, more recently, in developing new techniques for environmental analysis.   In indoor environments, ozone reacts with surfaces, liberating volatile oxidized products into indoor air that are odorous, irritating and may reduce personal comfort and productivity, and even contribute to "Sick Building Syndrome". &lt;br/&gt;This project is well suited to the goal of acquainting students with research while improving our understanding of indoor pollution and exposure. &lt;br/&gt;Broader impact: Project results will influence product decision-making of manufacturers, while making recommendations to consumers regarding product usage, and providing public health officials with a database of emissions measurements and exposure estimates for use in recommending policy.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
