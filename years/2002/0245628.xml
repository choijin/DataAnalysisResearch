<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0245628&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Andrei Gabrielov&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator proposes to investigate the&lt;br/&gt;topological complexity of definable sets in o-minimal structures&lt;br/&gt;on the real numbers, in particular, of the real semialgebraic and&lt;br/&gt;sub-Pfaffian sets.  This research will be based on the new tools&lt;br/&gt;for computing homology of such sets: a spectral sequence&lt;br/&gt;associated with a surjective map, and the relative closure&lt;br/&gt;operation on one-parametric families.  The results will be&lt;br/&gt;applied to the problems of quantitative o-minimality: the&lt;br/&gt;complexity of topological, geometric and algebraic operations on&lt;br/&gt;definable sets in o-minimal extensions of the real numbers.  The&lt;br/&gt;results of the proposed research will advance quantitative and&lt;br/&gt;algorithmic aspects of the o-minimal theory.  As a broader&lt;br/&gt;impact, these results will provide a theoretical basis for&lt;br/&gt;computer algorithms for operations on sparse polynomials,&lt;br/&gt;exponential and trigonometric functions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objects defined by systems of algebraic equations and&lt;br/&gt;inequalities (semi-algebraic sets) appear in many areas of&lt;br/&gt;mathematics and its applications, such as control theory,&lt;br/&gt;robotics, and computer-aided design.  Understanding the&lt;br/&gt;complexity of operations on such objects is crucial for&lt;br/&gt;developing efficient computer algorithms. In many practically&lt;br/&gt;important cases, polynomials in the definition of a&lt;br/&gt;semi-algebraic set are sparse, i.e., have few non-zero&lt;br/&gt;coefficients. Sparsity is not preserved by many natural&lt;br/&gt;operations, such as projection to a subspace or closure.  The&lt;br/&gt;results of the proposed research would allow one to evaluate the&lt;br/&gt;complexity of operations on semi-algebraic sets in terms of the&lt;br/&gt;complexity of some auxiliary sets, retaining sparsity of the&lt;br/&gt;original polynomials. This may drastically improve upper bounds&lt;br/&gt;on the complexity of such operations, leading to more efficient,&lt;br/&gt;faster computer algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
