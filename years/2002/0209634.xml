<AbstractNarration>0209634&lt;br/&gt;Benfey&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of the workshop on "Genomics approaches to cis-element/TF interactions", to be held in Arlington Virginia on January 16-17, 2002,  is to bring together scientists working on computational approaches with those who have taken more traditional approaches to the identification of cis-element/transcription factor interactions.  In the last twenty years, investigators have discovered regulatory sequences by studying the DNA binding characteristics of single proteins, or the cis elements that control the expression patterns of single genes.  This has led to the identification of binding sites for around 100 transcription factors.  These studies have greatly increased our knowledge of the nature of regulatory sequences, however, the analysis of recently completed genome sequences suggest that there are upwards of a thousand transcription factors in most eukaryotic organisms.  Thus, it is probable that whole families of DNA-binding proteins exist that have not yet been discovered.  This workshop will focus on advances being made in combining computational approaches with genome-wide sampling techniques to identify functional regulatory sequences. The goal is to exchange information on existing methodologies, with the hope that cross-disciplinary collaborations will be established and the seeds of new approaches will be sown.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
