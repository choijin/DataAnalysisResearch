<AbstractNarration>Modeling MHD (magneto-hydrodynamic) turbulence has become increasingly&lt;br/&gt;important both in terrestrial and engineering applications, such as&lt;br/&gt;fusion devices and plasma propulsion, as well as in space and&lt;br/&gt;astrophysical environments such as the solar wind and astrophysical&lt;br/&gt;jets.  The magneto-hydrodynamic nature of the plasma fluid imposes&lt;br/&gt;constraints on the numerical procedures involved.  Likewise, modeling in&lt;br/&gt;the turbulent regime -- for turbulence is ubiquitous -- also imposes&lt;br/&gt;constraints and challenges on the numerical procedures employed.  The&lt;br/&gt;numerical approach and demands of computation time and accuracy&lt;br/&gt;translate into algorithmic (or software) advances which can avail the&lt;br/&gt;hardware --  itself advancing rapidly.  In this project these advances&lt;br/&gt;entail: Adaptively refined grids, where fine resolution only in regions&lt;br/&gt;of interest reduces overall CPU requirements; MHD shock capturing&lt;br/&gt;methods, which improve accuracy of the calculation; parallel computing&lt;br/&gt;techniques, which take advantage of the availability of multiple&lt;br/&gt;processors and memory and cache hierarchy; and sub-grid models, which&lt;br/&gt;allow coarser grids than otherwise for turbulent regimes.  The analysis&lt;br/&gt;of the resulting large multi-block multi-processor data requires&lt;br/&gt;advanced data visualization tools to examine the physics, the raison&lt;br/&gt;d'etre for the calculations.  The project will develop a computational&lt;br/&gt;environment, consisting of a 3D MHD simulation code with adaptive grid&lt;br/&gt;refinement capabilities, complex  time-dependent boundary conditions and&lt;br/&gt;optimized to run under MPI on various parallel computers, and a&lt;br/&gt;visualization system that can handle multi-block multi-processor MHD AMR&lt;br/&gt;data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this end-to-end modeling and discovery process, information&lt;br/&gt;technology (IT) plays a critical role.  From software engineering&lt;br/&gt;principles that result in robust codes, and smarter data structures that&lt;br/&gt;are required for AMR, to single-node optimization and better&lt;br/&gt;communication strategies on parallel architectures, to visualization&lt;br/&gt;tool development and implementation, IT makes possible knowledge&lt;br/&gt;discovery through simulation in a more efficient and orderly fashion.&lt;br/&gt;The requirements for MHD turbulence modeling being so considerable, this&lt;br/&gt;efficiency of IT translates into enabling the science or technology.&lt;br/&gt;I.e. without the application of these IT principles, physically&lt;br/&gt;important and interesting regimes would not be analyzed.  The results of&lt;br/&gt;this project will significantly enhance the modeling capabilities of&lt;br/&gt;diverse flows and will specifically be applied to the problem of&lt;br/&gt;heliospheric magnetic field configuration and solar wind turbulence.  3D&lt;br/&gt;MHD simulations of the heliospheric fields and flows that include&lt;br/&gt;rotation, shear, waves, turbulence, current sheets, pressure-balanced&lt;br/&gt;structures, and interaction regions, which thus represent most of the&lt;br/&gt;major physical effects of importance, will be performed.  The effort will&lt;br/&gt;enable future studies on particle propagation and magnetic field&lt;br/&gt;configuration for "space weather" effects on Earth.  The project will&lt;br/&gt;directly train a post-doctoral scholar and a graduate student in&lt;br/&gt;relevant physics and computational mathematics; project results will be&lt;br/&gt;communicated to the community via conference and journal publications&lt;br/&gt;and the web, and through classes taught by the PI.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
