<AbstractNarration>This RUI program focuses on the development and study of a new time resolved photon correlation spectroscopy technique that will permit the investigation of particle dynamics in systems that are beyond the concentration range that can be successfully probed using traditional photon correlation methods.  A better understanding of such systems will represent a significant advancement of basic knowledge in many fields as well as offering the very realistic expectation of significant technological application.  The systems of fundamental importance that will be investigated in the research include the behavior of colloidal particles in confined geometry, ferro-magnetic particles forming a one-dimensional quasi-crystal under the influence of an external magnetic field, and the change in the dynamical behavior of colloidal particles during crystallization.  In broader terms, this work will enhance the existing research program at Gustavus Adolphus College and will produce significant benefits for the participants, the College, and the broader scientific community.</AbstractNarration>
