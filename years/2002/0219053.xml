    <AbstractNarration>The aim is to provide a better mathematical framework and&lt;br/&gt;alternative design methodologies for coarse quantization of signals in&lt;br/&gt;a highly oversampled setting. The central themes is "sigma-delta&lt;br/&gt;quantization" in analog-to-digital conversion of audio signals and its&lt;br/&gt;counterpart "error-diffusion" in digital halftoning of images. In both&lt;br/&gt;cases, a given target analog signal is represented by a judiciously&lt;br/&gt;chosen one-bit (or few-bit) sequence which approximates the signal in a&lt;br/&gt;suitable low-pass subspace. A wide range of different schemes exist for&lt;br/&gt;this purpose, each corresponding to a different implementation and&lt;br/&gt;approximation order. As our primary mathematical objective, we expect&lt;br/&gt;to better understand the law of error decay of the existing schemes as&lt;br/&gt;well as to improve on these by new designs. On the algorithmic side, we&lt;br/&gt;aim to extend this analysis to settings with computational and other&lt;br/&gt;implementational constraints.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fact that digital signals and data sets can be processed, stored&lt;br/&gt;and retrieved with great precision and speed places high demands of&lt;br/&gt;accuracy on the conversion process from and to the analog world.&lt;br/&gt;However, the devices used in the translation process (such as in the&lt;br/&gt;case of analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog conversion circuits in&lt;br/&gt;audio applications, and printers in image reproduction) are of&lt;br/&gt;necessity analog devices, which have physical limitations that, at&lt;br/&gt;first sight, conflict with those accuracy demands. To cope with this&lt;br/&gt;problem, engineers have empirically developed special signal processing&lt;br/&gt;techniques leading to alternative signal and number representations&lt;br/&gt;that are quite different from standard decimal or binary&lt;br/&gt;representations. Typical techniques take advantage of the highly&lt;br/&gt;accurate performance of the analog devices in sampling very densely in&lt;br/&gt;time or space to compensate for the lack of amplitude precision of&lt;br/&gt;those devices. Interestingly, while these empirical schemes have proved&lt;br/&gt;efficient and have been used in consumer products for a long time, the&lt;br/&gt;corresponding framework of signal processing has little mathematical&lt;br/&gt;support. We aim to study these schemes in more detail, with the&lt;br/&gt;goals of improving the mathematical theory as well as proposing&lt;br/&gt;variants that outperform those used presently, and to identify a wider&lt;br/&gt;range of applications.</AbstractNarration>
