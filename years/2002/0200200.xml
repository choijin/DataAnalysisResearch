    <AbstractNarration>This project deals with questions in commutative algebra. While the&lt;br/&gt;questions address a variety of topics, there is an underlying&lt;br/&gt;common thread that unifies them all: the theory of integral closure.&lt;br/&gt;The PI, together with her collaborators, first plans to develop&lt;br/&gt;methods that produce the integral closure of an ideal. In joint work&lt;br/&gt;with Bernd Ulrich the proposer has established that linkage is a&lt;br/&gt;method for capturing integral elements over a complete intersection. Now&lt;br/&gt;the investigator wants to extend this same procedure to Gorenstein&lt;br/&gt;linkage and residual intersections. Second, the PI intends to clarify the&lt;br/&gt;connection between the core of an ideal and the adjoint of Lipman (or the&lt;br/&gt;multiplier ideal of Ein and Lazarsfeld), find an explicit formula for&lt;br/&gt;the core, and compute the core of monomial ideals (a question posed&lt;br/&gt;by Eisenbud and Sturmfels). The investigator intends to use linkage&lt;br/&gt;theory, residual intersection theory and Groebner basis theory.&lt;br/&gt;Third, the investigator would like to study the special fiber ring. This&lt;br/&gt;object is very important from a geometric point of view because it&lt;br/&gt;encodes algebraic information on the special fiber of the blowup. The &lt;br/&gt;focus here is on finding conditions that force the fiber to be unmixed or&lt;br/&gt;even Cohen-Macaulay. Last, the PI plans to study the Hilbert function of &lt;br/&gt;zero-dimensional normal ideals (an ideal is normal if all its powers are &lt;br/&gt;integrally closed). One of the proposer's goals is to show that all the &lt;br/&gt;Hilbert coefficients of such ideals are non-negative, while another goal &lt;br/&gt;is to characterize the vanishing of the Hilbert coefficients in terms of&lt;br/&gt;the Cohen-Macaulayness of the associated graded ring of the ideal&lt;br/&gt;itself or of one of its powers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research is concerned with problems in commutative&lt;br/&gt;algebra. On a basic level commutative algebra is about techniques&lt;br/&gt;for solving systems of polynomial equations. Commutative algebra&lt;br/&gt;had a revolutionary growth in the past fifty years as it provided&lt;br/&gt;the tools for understanding many problems in pure and applied&lt;br/&gt;mathematics. In many applied problems, polynomial equations and&lt;br/&gt;hence commutative algebra play a crucial role. Applied areas where&lt;br/&gt;commutative algebra results have been used in the past include&lt;br/&gt;operations research, computer science, robotics, control theory, coding&lt;br/&gt;theory and cryptography to mention a few.</AbstractNarration>
