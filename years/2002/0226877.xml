<AbstractNarration>The North Carolina Partnership for Improving Mathematics and Science (NC-PIMS) is a joint effort between 4-partner institutions of the University of North Carolina General Administration (East Carolina University, Fayetteville State University, University of North Carolina-Pembroke and the University of North Carolina Wilmington) and the University of North Carolina Mathematics and Science Education Network (UNC-MSEN) which has centers at three university hubs.  School district partners number 17 in proximity to those hubs.  An additional partner is the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction.  The partner districts have a student population in excess of 200,000 (with over 40% classified as minority) and share the common characteristics of being rural and poor relative to state averages.  To help the school districts increase student learning of science and mathematics while simultaneously decreasing current achievement gaps, NC-PIMS has three foci:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. To develop Policies and District Leadership that support mathematics and science instruction.  Efforts include: (a) establishment of a State Advisory Board to align policies and improve communication between districts and state agencies; (b) establishment of District Leadership Teams to help integrate the project within district reform efforts; and (c) STEM professionals who will assist teachers in enhancing the depth of content in instruction.&lt;br/&gt;2. To provide Teacher Professional Development and Support.  Activities include: (a) hiring full-time Facilitators who will deliver professional development and provide direct support to teachers; (b) education of building-level Lead Teachers (designated elementary teachers and department chairs of middle and high schools) who will become model teachers and provide inservice for peers; and (c) creation and delivery of eleven professional development courses in science and mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;3. Implementation of Student Engagement activities that encourage students to remain engaged in science and mathematics learning.  Examples include: (a) out-of-school student activities to generate motivation in preK-8; and (b) information sessions for parents to assist them in supporting children's learning.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
