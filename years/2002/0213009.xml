    <AbstractNarration>The foci of this research are twofold. First, a structurally new class of air stable, recyclable, efficient and selective chiral Ru catalysts for asymmetric olefin metathesis will be developed. The new chiral Ru complexes will allow for specific steric and electronic modifications that can shed light on the general mechanism of Ru-catalyzed olefin metathesis. Further, the corresponding glass-supported chiral catalysts will be prepared and examined as easily used and highly recyclable chiral catalysts that can directly afford libraries of a range of functionalizable organic molecules of high chemical and optical purity. Second, a wide range of Ru-catalyzed olefin metathesis reactions will be developed to afford optically enriched organic molecules that are not accessible via Mo-catalyzed reactions nor by other available enzymatic or non-enzymatic catalytic methods. The methodology will be demonstrated by the total synthesis of the natural product (+)-africanol.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this renewal award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. Amir H. Hoveyda of the Department of Chemistry at Boston College. Professor Hoveyda will focus his work on the development of new Ru-based chiral catalysts for various olefin metathesis processes and he will develop a wide range of Ru-catalyzed olefin metathesis reactions that will afford optically enriched or pure organic molecules. The work has broader implications for the pharmaceutical and agricultural industries and the project is an excellent venue for the training of graduate students and postdoctorals.</AbstractNarration>
