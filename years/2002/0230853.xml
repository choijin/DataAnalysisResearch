<AbstractNarration>Mayo&lt;br/&gt;OIA-0230853&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will provide funds for the Government University Industry Research Roundtable to support activities of the Federal Demonstration Partnership (FDP), an ongoing cooperative initiative among university research administrators, faculty and federal agency representatives.  FDP, which currently consists of representatives from 65 academic institutions and approximately 12 federal agencies, offers a forum for members to improve the national research enterprise by its efforts to streamline and standardize research administration policies and procedures. During the current phase, FDP addressed and influenced the research establishment by providing guidance for several activities such as: developing data standards and implementing core principles for electronic research administration, demonstrating the feasibility of electronic data interchange via award documentation, and revising grant terms and agreements that correspond with the Office of Management and Budget Circulars.  The organization is poised to expand in October by nearly 50% as it enters Phase IV of its existence, and will improve the relationship between federal agencies and the research community, ensuring the efficiency and integrity of STEM administration. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
