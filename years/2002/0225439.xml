<AbstractNarration>Recent advances in nanometer scale science and technology offer novel approaches for the development of ultra-miniature low-power sensor nodes for distributed wireless sensor networks in applications such as environmental monitoring, civil infrastructure monitoring, condition-based maintenance, security and surveillance. The reduced dimensions and masses of nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) are of great interest for highly-sensitive force- and mass-sensing. We propose a novel technology based on assembly of nanostructured nanomechanical sensors rather than their direct machining from the substrate material. Nanomechanical sensing structures will be produced using "bottom-up" synthesis, then surface assembled and integrated with foundry-fabricated monolithic circuits through electrofluidic assembly, allowing on-chip integration of nanomechanical sensors with transduction, readout, processing, and communications circuitry. This approach also offers flexibility and scalability, enabling the assembly of a larger range of functional structures. Leveraging our core competencies in NEMS device development and analog/RF/microwave IC design, we will develop a micropower nanosensor-based microsystem containing nanosensor assembly/integration sites, sensor-specific transduction, and read-out electronics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These research activities are complemented with related education/outreach goals. These include the groundwork for Summer Microelectronics Workshops that will provide cleanroom research experiences to local high-school teachers. This pilot program offers the promise for substantial impact in K-12 science and mathematics education. The combination of these pedagogical and research activities will enable a complete academic program that bridges the gap between "bottom-up" nanotechnology and microsystems. More specifically, the proposed integration of electrofluidic assembly of nanosensors with prefabricated functional circuits represents realistic possibilities for the development of Integrative Nanosystems that can "sense, think, or communicate".&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
