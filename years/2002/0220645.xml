<AbstractNarration>Oregon Institute of Technology (OIT) draws the majority of its students from a large, sparsely populated, rural region of South Central Oregon. This region has a significant number of underrepresented, low-income populations who are currently not in a position to participate in career opportunities in engineering and information technology. This region also suffers from shortage of students trained for jobs in engineering and information technology sectors. The primary goal of this project is to provide scholarships to low-income computer science, computer technology, engineering and engineering technology, and mathematics students in the region. The project targets underrepresented groups, first-generation students, and persons with disabilities. The project awards thirty students per year scholarships worth $3,100. It contains several new programs, which help to ensure its success. All CSEMS students are required to participate in a new Learning Community program in their first quarter in the project. As part of the Learning Community, they are required to take a newly developed CSEMS seminar. Furthermore, an intensive September Bridge program orients new participants to the college and the program.</AbstractNarration>
