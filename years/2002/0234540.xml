<AbstractNarration>DMS-0234540&lt;br/&gt;Yair N. Minsky&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposer is co-organizing a workshop at the Newton Institute in&lt;br/&gt;Cambridge, UK, on the subject of ``Spaces of Kleinian groups and&lt;br/&gt;hyperbolic 3-manifolds'', for the summer of 2003.  The 4-week&lt;br/&gt;workshop, including a 1-week conference, will bring together&lt;br/&gt;researchers active on a number of foundational topics in the field:&lt;br/&gt;relationships between the analytic, combinatorial and geometric&lt;br/&gt;structure of hyperbolic 3-manifolds; topology of deformation spaces&lt;br/&gt;and the arrangement of their components; classification of hyperbolic&lt;br/&gt;3-manifolds by asymptotic invariants; complex projective structures;&lt;br/&gt;convex hull boundaries; cone manifolds, orbifolds and knot groups; the&lt;br/&gt;combinatorial structure of Teichmuller spaces, mapping class groups,&lt;br/&gt;and spaces of curves on surfaces.  Recent years have seen substantial&lt;br/&gt;progress on longstanding foundational conjectures such as the&lt;br/&gt;Bers/Sullivan/Thurston Density Conjecture, Ahlfors' Measure&lt;br/&gt;Conjecture, Thurston's Ending Lamination Conjecture and Marden's&lt;br/&gt;Tameness Conjecture.  The time is therefore ripe for a conference on&lt;br/&gt;these topics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the study of low-dimensional geometry, topology and dynamics, there&lt;br/&gt;is a remarkable depth of interconnection between fields of&lt;br/&gt;mathematics. Henri Poincare, who studied both celestial dynamics and&lt;br/&gt;complex analysis (among many other things), observed in the 19th&lt;br/&gt;century that the standard round sphere, the setting of classical&lt;br/&gt;analysis and geometry, functioned also as a "horizon at infinity" for&lt;br/&gt;an exotic non-Euclidean geometry that we now call Hyperbolic&lt;br/&gt;Space. Dynamical properties of transformations of the sphere translate&lt;br/&gt;to geometric properties of rigid motions of this space, and give rise&lt;br/&gt;to families of symmetric tilings whose structure we can study by&lt;br/&gt;geometric and topological methods.  The properties of these tilings,&lt;br/&gt;and the way in which they change when the tilings are varied through&lt;br/&gt;families (or "parameter spaces"), are still linked to some of the&lt;br/&gt;motivating questions about physical systems of which Poincare was&lt;br/&gt;aware a hundred years ago. Issues such as classification of systems,&lt;br/&gt;mapping out regions of stability and instability, deformation and&lt;br/&gt;bifurcation of families of systems, and probabilistic properties such&lt;br/&gt;as ergodicity, all have significance in both pure and applied&lt;br/&gt;mathematics. In the setting of hyperbolic geometry, recent years have&lt;br/&gt;seen significant progress on these issues, with both theoretical&lt;br/&gt;advances and computational approaches playing a role. This conference&lt;br/&gt;will bring together leading researchers in this area and promising&lt;br/&gt;young mathematicians, to disseminate recent advances and continue work&lt;br/&gt;on open problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
