<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0244361&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Peter J. Kahn&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The topology/geometry group in the Department of Mathematics at&lt;br/&gt;Cornell University requests funding to continue support for three&lt;br/&gt;years for the Cornell Topology Festival, which this group has&lt;br/&gt;hosted each year since 1963. The Festival provides a significant&lt;br/&gt;arena for the dissemination and development of important, new&lt;br/&gt;results from a wide array of areas within the realms of&lt;br/&gt;algebraic, differential, and geometric topology, and allied&lt;br/&gt;subjects.  While it is planned to continue the broad,&lt;br/&gt;interdisciplinary flavor and collaboration-friendly format that&lt;br/&gt;have characterized the Festival over the years, it is also&lt;br/&gt;proposed to extend the Festival by a day to accommodate specific&lt;br/&gt;annual areas of emphasis. In this way the Festival can be&lt;br/&gt;responsive to the dominant trends of this era: namely, the&lt;br/&gt;simultaneous flourishing of both subspecializations and&lt;br/&gt;cross-disciplinary activity. An active outreach program, which&lt;br/&gt;includes some travel support, will be initiated to broaden&lt;br/&gt;participation in the Festival. For our initial conference under&lt;br/&gt;this grant (May 1-4, 2003), we will have as area of emphasis the&lt;br/&gt;very active field of geometric group theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Topology Festival was conceived and initiated in the 1960's&lt;br/&gt;both as an annual celebration of the burgeoning field of topology&lt;br/&gt;and as an annual conference/workshop for topologists in the&lt;br/&gt;northeastern United States.  While topology has deep roots in&lt;br/&gt;early European mathematical investigations of space and geometry,&lt;br/&gt;it is in the mid-twentieth century that topology came of age,&lt;br/&gt;with American mathematicians providing a large array of seminal&lt;br/&gt;discoveries. American topology has been a key element in&lt;br/&gt;America's world leadership in mathematics.  Topology is a broad&lt;br/&gt;subject, which overlaps with areas of `discrete' mathematics&lt;br/&gt;(e.g., algebra, combinatorics), as well as with `continuous' or&lt;br/&gt;`smooth' mathematics (e.g., differential geometry, dynamical&lt;br/&gt;systems, mathematical physics).  Indeed, a large part of&lt;br/&gt;contemporary mathematics has been profoundly affected by&lt;br/&gt;topological results and methods. As a foundational subject, the&lt;br/&gt;applications of topology are very widespread. A few examples are:&lt;br/&gt;genetics (the study of knotting of DNA molecules), neuroscience&lt;br/&gt;and robotics (dynamical systems modeling), computer science ( in&lt;br/&gt;geometric modeling and simulation), mathematical economics (in&lt;br/&gt;smooth equilibrium theory), physics (the theory of gauge fields),&lt;br/&gt;and neighboring fields in mathematics (e.g., geometric group&lt;br/&gt;theory).  Although many of the basic questions that powered early&lt;br/&gt;efforts in topology have been answered, new problems are&lt;br/&gt;constantly being generated as science moves forward, and&lt;br/&gt;important classical problems remain.  An example of the latter is&lt;br/&gt;the Poincare Conjecture, which has been the subject of several&lt;br/&gt;notable talks at past Topology Festivals and remains one of the&lt;br/&gt;premier unsolved problems of mathematics today---one of the Clay&lt;br/&gt;Institute's seven `millenium problems'--- and the focus of&lt;br/&gt;intense research. The topologists and geometers at Cornell are&lt;br/&gt;proud of the useful role that the Topology Festival has played&lt;br/&gt;and will continue to play in the contemporary development of this&lt;br/&gt;dynamic area of mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
