    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a process technology for composite ordered films based on liquid crystal (LC) materials that will have a significant impact on the performance of LC optical devices, both passive and active. These devices include ultrafast optical signal processing and high-density optical storage, just to name a few. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The process technology is simple in concept. A blend of cross-linkable liquid crystals and non-reactive liquid crystals is formulated, and then prepared into a film using usual techniques. The non-reactive components are then removed from the film to create a nano-structured, mesogenic "mold" that retains some of the LC-like ordering. If desired, additional components can be added into the mold, creating a device with tailored mechanical, chemical, and optical properties. The technology can thus be used to overcome inherent shortcomings of LC materials and improve the performance, durability, and applicability of many LC optical devices. In the proposed program, the goal is to fabricate low-cost, high-efficiency, reflective broadband UV polarizing films. This technology makes it possible to realize such films even though all currently available LC materials exhibit substantial absorption over the UV spectral range. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This process technology for composite ordered films will have immediate commercial applications in a wide range of optical devices, both active and passive, as it will dramatically improve performance. The improvements may include better temperature resistance, wider wavelength range, reduced chemical sensitivity, or any combinations of these. The first application to be produced with this process, UV polarizing films, has a wide range of uses: chiral drug development, optical components, liquid crystal displays, and even skin protection. Anticipated revenues for UV polarizing films could reach $4.5 million in its first year alone.</AbstractNarration>
