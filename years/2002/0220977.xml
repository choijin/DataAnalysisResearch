    <AbstractNarration>This Advanced Training Institute in Social Psychology will offer workshops for training social psychologists in the use the Social Relations Model (SRM), which is used to study individual, dyadic, and group phenomena. The SRM is a methodological tool for the study of social behavior that holds great promise for new understanding of phenomena that have interested social psychologists (e.g., interpersonal and inter-group processes) and as a heuristic device that directs attention to new phenomena (e.g., dyadic uniqueness in behavior). Although the SRM has been used in over 110 published studies, the technical details of the model and the software used for estimation are not well known by social psychologists. The training institute will provide a venue where social psychologists can quickly learn the essentials of social relations modeling from a team of expert investigators and instructors. Participants will receive training in the theoretical, statistical, and practical application of the model in a broad array of research contexts, and will have the opportunity to analyze their own data or data provided from the SRM data archive at the University of Connecticut. This unique combination of outstanding facilities, a highly experienced training staff, and access to the SRM data archive on-site offers great potential for dissemination of the SRM methodology to social psychologists.</AbstractNarration>
