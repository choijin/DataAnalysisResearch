<AbstractNarration>The project is proposed by a partnership between SUNY-Brockport, Rochester City School District (RCSD) third largest in New York state with the lowest achievement scores and Brighton Central School District (BCSD) with similar gaps among underrepresented groups yet with one of the highest overall achievement rates in the state.  Additional partners are the Shodor Foundation and The Krell Institute.  &lt;br/&gt;The primary goal for the partnership is to improve student outcomes in mathematics and science in grades 7-12 by creating a multi agency approach for the recruitment and professional development of mathematics and science teachers. &lt;br/&gt;A Computational Mathematics Science and Technology (CMST) approach to learning science is employed in which students and teacher are engaged in fieldwork, laboratory experiments, mathematical modeling, computer simulation and visualization.  CMST employs math models to describe physical phenomena therefore bringing a new perspective about the usefulness of math as a tool in real life.  The method is designed to make science and mathematics concepts more easily comprehensible.  A Challenge program incorporating CMST is providing tools and motivation for 200, grades 7-12 students, under the supervision of participating teachers.  The approach in addition to teaching science concepts is designed to promote teamwork, collaboration and new strategies for problem solving.  &lt;br/&gt;A component of the comprehensive professional development program for mathematics and science teachers is a four-week summer institute each year serving a total of 240 teachers. In addition there is a master's degree program for 30 teachers.  Preservice education programs at SUNY Brockport are being revised and new courses are to be introduced to assure an improvement in the quality quantity and diversity of the new teacher workforce.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
