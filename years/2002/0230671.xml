<AbstractNarration>PROPOSAL NO.: 0230671&lt;br/&gt;PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Craig, Kevin&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION NAME: Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: Renewal of Core Engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The thesis of this grant to Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute is that before a person becomes a mechanical engineer, an electrical engineer, or an engineer in any specialized area, one must first "become an engineer!" To identify the physics, mathematics, science, and engineering topics that constitute a "fundamental body of knowledge" applicable to the education of all engineering students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of this project are:&lt;br/&gt; To structure these topics into a set of courses which are pedagogically sound.&lt;br/&gt;To develop an extended course description for each course containing learning objectives and assessment methods of student learning and course effectiveness.&lt;br/&gt; To develop methods to assure student learning levels of competency and retention of knowledge.&lt;br/&gt;To develop a system of assessment which is competency-based and requires students to demonstrate mastery of unit objectives as defined in the extended course description.&lt;br/&gt; To introduce and develop appropriate use of computing tools throughout the Core&lt;br/&gt;Engineering Program.&lt;br/&gt; To create an atmosphere of professionalism in student work and study habits and prepare students for licensure as professional engineers and entry into the engineering profession.&lt;br/&gt;To create a document describing the plan for implementation of the above goals.&lt;br/&gt; To plan and begin to implement the Core Engineering organizational structure.&lt;br/&gt; To construct a faculty development plan that prepares them to teach the integrated Core Engineering program.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
