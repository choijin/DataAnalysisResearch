    <AbstractNarration>Sesame Workshop, in collaboration with the Adler Planetarium &amp; Astronomy Museum and the Beijing Planetarium, is planning a planetarium show and complementary materials for preschool-age children and their families, teachers and other caregivers. The planetarium show will be designed for use in the United States and China and will have the following goals:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-- promoting positive attitudes among young children towards science;&lt;br/&gt;-- providing age-appropriate information about astronomy in an engaging, entertaining format; and&lt;br/&gt;-- fostering am understanding of one another among children in the two countries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the planning phase, there will be three face-to-face meetings among the principals: at the Beijing Planetarium, at Sesame Workshop in New York, and at the Adler Planetarium in Chicago. The purpose of these meetings will be to determine:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-- What is the appropriate educational content for the show and complementary materials and what does research with children say about it?&lt;br/&gt;-- How does this type of project best reach preschool audiences?&lt;br/&gt;-- Is there a need or opportunity for producing alternative language or dialect versions of either the English or Mandarin versions of the show and complementary materials? &lt;br/&gt;-- What issues or problems affect the design of the show and complementary materials?&lt;br/&gt;-- What are the implementation issues?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Particular attention will be given to exploring how the project might include cross-cultural information in the show and complementary materials, and how the cross-over characters (Da Naio appearing in the English version; Big Bird in the Mandarin version) might be included in the design.</AbstractNarration>
