    <AbstractNarration>The PI proposes to carry out systematic investigations for obtaining precursors to the enigmatic occurrence of the Equatorial Spread-F (ESF) using daytime thermospheric optical emission measurements from the South American longitude using high-resolution optical spectrographs built at Boston University. ESF refers to the presence of irregularities in the nighttime equatorial ionosphere. Unlike substorms and geomagnetic storms, ESF is a form of space weather not controlled exclusively by the Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF). ESF irregularities have a severe impact on radio communications and navigational systems at a wide range of frequencies that adversely affect commercial and defense applications. The development of these irregularities is highly unpredictable. Even during the 'ESF' season when various onset parameters are nearly identical, ESF occurs on one night and is completely absent on the other. Scientifically, this is a missing element in our understanding of plasma instabilities at low latitudes. Hence, it is very important to study and attempt to predict ESF and its adverse effects.</AbstractNarration>
