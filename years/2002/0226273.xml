<AbstractNarration>This collections project addresses one of the most difficult problems in teaching computer vision, developing good assignments.   The PI is gathering the best materials from several institutions into a comprehensive digital library collection for computer vision education.  This resource contains links to assignments at a variety of institutions and hosts a set of vetted assignments, complete with data sets and solutions. In addition, it contains educational resources such as lecture notes, links to other computer vision courses, and reviews of textbooks, software, and hardware.  The PI is accomplishing this objective by collecting materials from computer vision educators, developing new materials, and organizing and building a comprehensive web site to serve them.   An initial version of the site is available at palantir.swarthmore.edu/extra/cved.   He plans to engage computer vision educators directly in the collection and review process through a small collection development workshop.  The PI plans to use several processes to ensure that the collected material is high quality, including a formal review mechanism and less formal approaches where workshop participants and course instructors prepare and post reviews on his website.   Dissemination activities include major efforts to involve a large number of potential users in the development of the collection and to promote the site through conference papers and presentations, through direct contact with potential users, and by cross-linking the web site with course instructors' websites.  The PI's institution has agreed to maintain the equipment and the website beyond the ending date of the project.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
