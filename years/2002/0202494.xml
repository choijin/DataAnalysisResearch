<AbstractNarration>Proposal Number: DMS-0202494&lt;br/&gt;PI: Ricardo Perez-Marco&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research will be conducted on several projects on the theory&lt;br/&gt;of Dynamical Systems, and more specifically, in Holomorphic&lt;br/&gt;Dynamics and Small Divisor theory. Using heuristic ideas from&lt;br/&gt;Holomorphic Dynamics it is proposed to investigate an effective&lt;br/&gt;selection of polynomials as iterators in Pollard rho method of &lt;br/&gt;factorization. Factorization algorithms are a central topic&lt;br/&gt;in Cryptography. Numerical explorations show that there is&lt;br/&gt;room for improvement in this field. In Holomorphic Dynamics&lt;br/&gt;and Small Divisors, it is proposed to extend the  general&lt;br/&gt;theory of dynamics on Hedgehogs. The focus of the proposed&lt;br/&gt;research is on weak forms of stability when arithmetic&lt;br/&gt;conditions, typical of Small Divisors, fail. It is proposed to &lt;br/&gt;investigate Siegel disks and their boundary, and to attack&lt;br/&gt;the hard problem of classifying invariant annular continua.&lt;br/&gt;It is anticipated that the techniques of tube-log Riemann&lt;br/&gt;surfaces should play an important role. Another project&lt;br/&gt;consists in extending geometric techniques to higher&lt;br/&gt;dimensional Small Divisors problems. In particular, a new&lt;br/&gt;geometric construction of invariant tori is envisioned. In&lt;br/&gt;the theory of Renormalization in Holomorphic  Dynamics it&lt;br/&gt;is proposed to develop the new theory of renormalization.&lt;br/&gt;This involves a better understanding of Degenerate&lt;br/&gt;Quasi-Conformal theory (i.e. for non bounded Beltrami&lt;br/&gt;coefficients). A last topic in Complex Analysis on which&lt;br/&gt;research is proposed is the theory of Borel Monogenic &lt;br/&gt;functions. We project to develop a theory that is flexible&lt;br/&gt;enough to apply to problems in Small Divisors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dynamical Systems is a branch of Mathematics with ancient&lt;br/&gt;roots linked to Celestial Mechanics. It was founded as a&lt;br/&gt;distinct branch of Mathematics more than a century ago by&lt;br/&gt;H. Poincare. It is a rich field with multiple interactions&lt;br/&gt;with other parts of Mathematics and Science. The main goal&lt;br/&gt;is the study of the long time behavior of evolution processes.&lt;br/&gt;Some of the most important problems come from fields as&lt;br/&gt;Biology, Physical Sciences and Chemistry. One of the central &lt;br/&gt;questions is the Problem of Stability. For example, is the&lt;br/&gt;Solar System stable  according to Newton laws ? K.A.M. theory&lt;br/&gt;(also called  Small Divisor theory) is one of the major&lt;br/&gt;branches in Dynamical Systems. It was founded in the second&lt;br/&gt;half of the XXth century and had an important impact in&lt;br/&gt;Dynamical Systems and related fields. It is the very first&lt;br/&gt;theory that provides stability results in non-linear&lt;br/&gt;conservative problems. It continues its expansion to fields&lt;br/&gt;as diverse as Partial Differential Equations, the theory &lt;br/&gt;of foliations, Holomorphic Dynamics, etc. In the proposed&lt;br/&gt;projects some of the most difficult open questions in KAM&lt;br/&gt;theory will be explored. What happens when stability fails?&lt;br/&gt;Can we still recover some traces of stability that may be&lt;br/&gt;useful in the applications?  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
