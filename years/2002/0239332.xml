<AbstractNarration>O239332&lt;br/&gt;Noeckel&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project aims to leverage methods from the theory of mesoscopic  &lt;br/&gt;systems, quantum chaos and nonlinear dynamics to advance research in  &lt;br/&gt;microphotonics.  Microcavities as building blocks of integrated optical devices form &lt;br/&gt;the central application of the proposed research: their spectral, emission and coupling &lt;br/&gt;characteristics will be studied with a combination of numerical modeling and&lt;br/&gt; approximation methods. Pure numerics encounters resource limitations in large, &lt;br/&gt;coupled and fully three-dimensional systems, making approximation schemes&lt;br/&gt; crucial for speedy, goal-oriented design. Among the most widely known such &lt;br/&gt;schemes is paraxial optics, which however breaks down in the resonator &lt;br/&gt;configurations of greatest interest for photonic integration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The lack of reliable analytical treatments in this regime is the  &lt;br/&gt;central theoretical motivation for the proposed research.  &lt;br/&gt;Non-paraxiality in microcavities translates into chaotic ray dynamics  &lt;br/&gt;when considering the short-wavelength or large-size limit; hence,  &lt;br/&gt;approximations relying on large size-parameters bring insights from  &lt;br/&gt;nonlinear dynamics to bear on micro-optic design. This parallels  &lt;br/&gt;developments in mesoscopic electronic physics where similar  &lt;br/&gt;approximations arise in systems whose size falls into the transition  &lt;br/&gt;region between quantum and classical mechanics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based on this connection, a new course to be developed within the  &lt;br/&gt;Applied Physics Master's program will aim at a unified presentation of  &lt;br/&gt;photonics and quantum mechanics, utilizing web-based teaching  &lt;br/&gt;technology. The latter will be tied to web-based dissemination of the  &lt;br/&gt;numerical and analytical techniques developed in the proposed research,  &lt;br/&gt;in order to strengthen the student's exposure to issues with broad  &lt;br/&gt;interest in optics, nanoscience and nonlinear dynamics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
