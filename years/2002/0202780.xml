<AbstractNarration>        The major challenge in technological applications of magnetic arrays for&lt;br/&gt;         storage is to control the magnetic switching precisely. To achieve this one&lt;br/&gt;         needs to have reproducible remanent state and, second, the switching&lt;br/&gt;         process itself must be simple and reproducible. Only in very few cases with&lt;br/&gt;         well-defined anisotropies does the reversal take place via a coherent&lt;br/&gt;         rotation of the magnetization. More common, however, is that the reversal&lt;br/&gt;         occurs via the domain formation at the ends of the element. For arbitrary&lt;br/&gt;         shape nano-scale elongated elements, in general, it has been impossible to&lt;br/&gt;         reliably calculate the field at which domain first forms from basic&lt;br/&gt;         principles.&lt;br/&gt;         &lt;br/&gt;         If the memory element is ring instead of elongated, the magnetization flux&lt;br/&gt;         forms a closure in the circular mode and the problems associated with the&lt;br/&gt;         ends of the linear elements are eliminated. The ring elements exhibit two&lt;br/&gt;         different highly stable 'onion" states in addition to the vortex states.&lt;br/&gt;         Two possible onion states, forward or reverse magnetized, can be realized&lt;br/&gt;         at remanence and can be used for magnetic storage.&lt;br/&gt;         &lt;br/&gt;         On the other hand, it has been suggested that the inverse structure,&lt;br/&gt;         nonmagnetic antidots (same as negative dots) in magnetic media, could be a&lt;br/&gt;         potential system f or magnetic recording with areal densities approaching&lt;br/&gt;         750 Gb/in2. The PI proposes the systematic experimental study of periodic&lt;br/&gt;         antidot arrays to compare with theoretical predictions presently available.&lt;br/&gt;         The investigation of the changes in the magnetic properties induced by the&lt;br/&gt;         antidotes, different remanent states for antidotes of various shapes,&lt;br/&gt;         influence of magnetocrystalline anisotropy, film thickness and possible&lt;br/&gt;         application for high-density storage will be performed and the exploration&lt;br/&gt;         of the high-density limits will be studied.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
