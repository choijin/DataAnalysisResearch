<AbstractNarration>Over the next ten years, demand for electric power in the USA is expected to increase by about 20% while under the current plans the electric transmission capacity will increase only by 4%. In addition, the policy of open access to transmission systems that helped create the competitive electricity markets, also led to a huge increase in the number of energy transactions over the grid. This, together with a shortage of generation in some areas, require optimal usage of existing infrastructure and the addition of FACTS devices and intelligent controllers. A power system is a dynamic nonlinear time-varying multivariable complex process. Any optimization strategies must therefore be carried out in real time and adapt to continuously changing conditions. Recent developments in optimization techniques, intelligent controllers, power electronics and digital hardware offer possible solutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Power system engineers are aware of the problems and challenges of having some form of global optimization of the planning and control of the power system. Control engineers on the other hand have developed algorithms for solving control problems. Power electronics experts have knowledge of how to design and control high power FACTS devices when Inserted into power systems. This proposal is for holding a workshop to bring these groups together and to focus on discussions leading to fundamental technical solutions to the optimal control of the electric power network in view of the current energy crisis and to avoid the crisis in the future. Thirty persons from both academia and industry, will meet for three days. The program will consist of seven sessions, each of which will address salient issues. The outcome will be a report which summarizes the discussions, identifies challenges, strengths and weaknesses, and proposes a way forward to address the weaknesses. This should lead to more interdisciplinary research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
