<AbstractNarration> A grant has been awarded to the University of Oklahoma under the direction of B. Hoagland to develop a database of plant specimens for the state of Oklahoma that will be accessible via the worldwide web.  The approximately 250,000 species   housed in herbaria at state research institutions are a valuable resource for state scientists, personnel at state and federal agencies, and the public at large.  These specimens also represent an important North American resource for many groups of plants.  At the present time, the information contained in these specimens can be accessed only by visiting state herbaria or by requesting information from curators.  In order to make this information widely and quickly available to researchers and the public, a comprehensive, web accessible, Oklahoma Vascular Plants database is to be developed.  Specific objectives of the undertaking are: (1) to database all Oklahoma plant specimens; (2) to develop web-based access to their information; (3) to georeference all specimens; and (4) to bar code all specimens.&lt;br/&gt; Databasing of the plant specimens will be conducted by trained undergraduate and graduate students supervised by the projects principal investigators.  Databasing will build upon an existing database of 80,000+ specimens.  Web access tools will be developed so that researchers at all Oklahoma colleges and universities can input specimen records into the database in the future.  These web tools also will allow individuals to search the database for information on particular species, map the county distributions of species, and  develop  plant species lists for any  county.  After the plant specimens have been entered into the database, a computer program will be used to assign latitude and longitude coordinates to them, a process known as georeferencing.  This will facilitate the mapping of species' distributions using Geographic Information Systems (GIS).  Finally, bar code labels will be affixed to each specimen as it is being databased as an aid in management of the herbarium specimens. &lt;br/&gt; The significance of the Oklahoma Vascular Plants database is rapid access to information.  When completed, the database and website will facilitate the acquisition and dissemination of information regarding Oklahoma plants not only to workers in the state, but to those throughout the United States and the world.  Increased access to plant specimen data by government, educational, and non-government organizations will; (1) guide activities of the Oklahoma Biological Survey; (2) help track the status of rare, threatened, and endangered plants; (3) allow the incorporation of plant collection data into GIS databases; and (4) facilitate rapid accumulation and dissemination of biodiversity information.  Furthermore, the database will have direct use by the general public.  Landowners will be able to access the website and acquire information about the species known to be present in their counties.  The project also will enhance Oklahoma's science and education infrastructure by providing training in biological databasing and data sharing via: (1) work experiences for students and researchers; (2) collaboration among state scientists; and (3) training workshops for state researchers. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
