<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this proof-of-concept project is to develop a software virtual laboratory tool that is based on emerging learning theories and effective pedagogy. The tool may be of use by engineering students in engineering disciplines to enhance their understanding of engineering concepts, analysis methods, and problem solving procedures that are used in material science and engineering courses and laboratories. All of the normal laboratory operations and functions such as following procedures, using equipment, following safety rules, making measurements, and performing analysis of data are performed in a virtual laboratory environment. The software development approach is focused on the NSF theme of integrating technology into education using existing software technology, digital video and still photography techniques, simulation, and a logical and structured approach to the presentation of materials laboratory tasks and objectives. A decision tree approach is incorporated at various levels of the virtual experiments to allow the user to make decisions (correct or incorrect), observe the results of the decision, and perform the experiment in an iterative process. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The software tool to serves as a virtual experience that may be used in conjunction with a lecture course that does not have a laboratory element, or as a preparation tool for an existing laboratory course. The main objective of the virtual experience is to facilitate a self-paced discovery environment in which the user can verify physical concepts and learn laboratory procedures through both correct and incorrect decisions and answers. From previous work the investigators have developed one virtual experiment on metallography techniques that requires a memory space of approximately 200 Megabytes. In this project, four additional virtual experiments will be developed based on important concepts in materials science and engineering. (The storage requirements for these experiments should also be about 200 Megabytes each.) The software tool will be evaluated for its effectiveness in meeting learning objectives for a diverse group of students including women and members of underrepresented groups at Texas Tech University, Tuskegee University, and Drexel University.  The software is to be disseminated in national and international markets, as an educational supplement accompanying a materials science textbook through McGraw-Hill publishing company.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
