<AbstractNarration>The US/Japan Workshop on Urban Earthquake Hazard Reduction will be held March 23 - 26, 2003 in Maui, Hawaii. It is being convened jointly by the Earthquake Engineering Research Institute and the Japan Institute of Social Safety Science (ISSS) and will focus on the complexity of urban disasters and their manifestations for emergency response, sheltering, loss of utilities, their economic and social impacts, and the recovery process.  Reflecting the complexity and interrelationship of factors in urban disasters, the participation is uniquely multidisciplinary, reflecting the diversity of knowledge and skills necessary to urban disaster preparedness, mitigation, response, relief and recovery.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Previous workshops dealing with urban earthquake hazard reduction have reinforced the development of a strong bond between the research and professional communities in the United States and Japan and have encouraged collaborative relationships between US and Japan. This collaborative research has enriched the US science and engineering communities by introducing new perspectives and methods into research activities, ultimately providing new tools to professional engineers, architects, planners, and emergency managers.  It is anticipated that this workshop will further contribute to advances in research and practice and to our ability to better prepare for and respond to future earthquakes and other extreme events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
