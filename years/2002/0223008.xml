<AbstractNarration>Photocatalytic oxidation (PCO) surface processes will be investigated using transient reaction analysis, temperature-programmed desorption/oxidation, co-adsorbed reactant studies, and isotope labeling.  Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy will be linked to these transient reaction methods to monitor surface species during PCO while a mass spectrometer (MS) will quantitatively determine products in the reactor effluent.  Both in situ DRIFTS and transmission  techniques will be explored.  The research will focus on the determination of the role of acid sites during PCO, examination of the activity of various sites on titania, investigation of the role of water during PCO, and quantification of the effect of rate promoters and mixture effects using co-adsorbed reactants.  The research will provide a better fundamental understanding of the nature of active sites and adsorption on photocatalysts.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will increase the applicability of PCO for the removal of volatile organic chemicals frequently found in wastewater streams.  Impact on the basic understanding of photocatalyst deactivation is anticipated.  Educational aspects of the broader impacts include the involvement of both graduates and undergraduates in research activities.  Undergraduates will participate in the project through independent research courses, EPSCoR Advanced Undergraduate Research Awards, and a recently awarded NSF-REU grant.   Because enrollment of Native Americans is high at the University of North Dakota, the project will strongly increase opportunities for under-represented groups in the field of engineering.  Women undergraduates and graduate students have also worked on preliminary aspects of the research.   The project will also increase opportunities to K-12 students through participation in the NSF EPSCoR Outward Bound program, which provides opportunities for high school seniors to participate in research activities at the University of North Dakota.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
