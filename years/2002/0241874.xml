    <AbstractNarration>This project supports three summer conferences on political methodology. The conferences constitute the 20th thru 22nd such meetings, which have been sponsored by NSF and university host institutions since 1986. Each meeting brings together approximately 100 faculty and graduate students. There are several aims of the conferences. First, they provide a forum for state of the art political methodology by allowing scholars to present the newest methods in the field for discussion and debate. Second, they provide a forum where scholars in the field can debate and agree on best practices in different areas, which can then be disseminated to the field. Third, they enhance graduate training by exposing them to the state of the art in a fast-moving field, rather than leaving them believing that what they have read in older articles is the best available technology for dealing with estimation and specification issues in political science. Fourth, they allow junior faculty to receive state of the art training and advice on specific research problems. Fifth, they provide mentors ship opportunities and networks for new scholars, whether they are graduate students or junior faculty. The conferences are regarded widely as the best mechanisms for advancing methodology in political science.</AbstractNarration>
