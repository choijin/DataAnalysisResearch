    <AbstractNarration>The investigator proposes to study the renormalization of period integrals &lt;br/&gt;on GL(n). More specifically, this project concerns the development of a &lt;br/&gt;theory of truncation of GL(n) Eisenstein series, thereby leading to a &lt;br/&gt;definition of renormalized torus integrals. Such results in turn make it &lt;br/&gt;possible to compute the polar divisor of the integrals and therefore to &lt;br/&gt;find unexpected functional equations of renormalized period integrals of &lt;br/&gt;Eisenstein series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a project in Number Theory, one of the oldest branches of &lt;br/&gt;mathematics. The foundations of Number Theory lie in the study of the &lt;br/&gt;positive integers. Some basic objects that have emerged in Number Theory &lt;br/&gt;are automorphic forms, objects that possess surprising symmetries. This &lt;br/&gt;project studies certain integrals of particular automorphic forms called &lt;br/&gt;Eisenstein series. These integrals, if interpreted in the usual way, are &lt;br/&gt;infinite, so part of the proposed research deals with reinterpreting these &lt;br/&gt;integrals, using renormalization to give them a definite meaning. This has &lt;br/&gt;already been carried out by the investigator in a special case, which gave &lt;br/&gt;rise to a relationship with another renormalized integral that was &lt;br/&gt;developed in a different fashion. More striking, however, was the &lt;br/&gt;occurrence of an unexpected symmetry in four dimensions. The aim of this &lt;br/&gt;project is to extend this technique of renormalization to the most general &lt;br/&gt;case, and to look for generalizations of this unexpected phenomenon.</AbstractNarration>
