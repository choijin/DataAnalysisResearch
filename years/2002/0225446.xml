<AbstractNarration>The vision of this proposed work is to create more versatile  information systems by using autonomous and distributed sensor networks:  hundreds of small sensors, equipped with limited memory and actuation capabilities will autonomously organize themselves and move  to track a source and convey information about its location to  a human user, and to the rest of the team. Such distributed active  sensor networks are pervasive computing systems,  well-suited for tasks in extreme environments,  especially when the environmental model and the task specifications  are uncertain and the system has to adapt to it. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To create active sensor networks capable of such applications, a  fundamental goal of this research is to develop a science base for distributed sensor network control and information gathering and coordination.&lt;br/&gt;This is a considerable challenge, which we propose to meet by the  synergistic integration of the following directions of work:  (1) new ideas for  communication in sensor networks; (2) new ideas for developing adaptive  active control and coordination in sensor networks; (3) new ideas for  information gathering and aggregation in sensor networks; and (4) experiments  grounded on realistic scenarios that measure empirically the performance  and scalability of the proposed communication and control algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More specifically, the central challenges for this proposed work are  focused on developing, implementing and evaluating a suite of scalable  network protocols that (1) guarantee message delivery; (2) are  fault tolerant; (3) maximize the network lifetime; and (4) are adaptive to  the environment and to the task.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
