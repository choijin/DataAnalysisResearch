    <AbstractNarration>One of the main barriers to progress in creating synergy between discoveries in cognitive/brain sciences and innovation in educational practice has been a lack of well orchestrated exchanges between communities of researchers and practitioners who can enact change. For the past two years, the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and more specifically its Centre for Educational Research Innovation (CERI), with a financial and substantive support from NSF, have been actively engaged in a programme which has endeavoured towards translating the findings from brain research into the formation of public educational policy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thus far, relevant and targeted neuroscientific findings have emerged from the project. Research in reading has begun to demonstrate that comprehension of written documents can be improved with new teaching strategies. Mathematical skills, linked to both linguistic competence and visuo-spatial representations, can be addressed more efficiently. Neuroplasticity is more prevalent than previously recognised: this has a tremendous importance for educational policies on lifelong learning, especially in adults. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is now in its second phase (July 2002 - June 2005), with the focus on forming innovative networks that seek synergistic points of contact between current domains of research in cognitive and brain science on the one hand, and education practice and policy on the other. That might be particularly relevant to the creation accessible theories of expertise and development of foundational educational abilities, and might help address recurring educational problems and difficulties. In order to meet the challenges of the second phase, the project will undertake a three-dimensional approach: firstly, it aims to be problem focused (grounded on particular educational challenges that may be considered foundational in education), secondly, trans-disciplinary (involving a wide collection of researchers from different disciplines), and thirdly to maintain an international scope (involving researchers from over 20 different countries). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three separate networks of leading scientists have been formed. They are to work on inter-related topics. The &lt;br/&gt;two first will address the fundamental abilities in comprehending written materials and numerical information. The major activities of these networks will be centred around three global goals: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Synthesis of existing and emerging findings from cognitive and brain science that represent consensus knowledge about brain mechanisms of foundational skills in literacy and numeracy. &lt;br/&gt;- Dissemination of information to a wide audience of educational policy makers, curriculum designers, &lt;br/&gt;educational researchers, educators, and other brain and cognitive researchers. This effort will result in several publications, an open website and open web forum. &lt;br/&gt;- Innovation, in providing a forum for educators to challenge cognitive neuroscientists to tackle questions of direct educational relevance and providing a forum for policy-makers to challenge cognitive neuroscientists and educators to advise on questions of educational investments at national and local levels. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project also aims to actively pursue data sources from research to synthesise existing and emerging findings from cognitive and brain science, and to dispel popular misunderstandings of the brain and its relationship to learning and teaching. There will be a strong emphasis on broad dissemination and communication of the research findings by way of establishing collaborative focus groups and forums for educators and policy-makers whereby they may challenge cognitive neuroscientists and exchange questions of educational relevance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will capitalise on OECD/CERI.s proven track record in record in (a) convening meetings of leading international experts (which are to be held throughout the duration of the project); (b) communicating findings to senior policy-makers; (c) disseminating best practices; (d) informing decision making; and (e) translating complex research findings into practical application. The rich and complex research findings will be translated into practical application, in order to build more specific curricula based upon brain research that will be accepted by educational policy-makers as well as practitioners and end-users.</AbstractNarration>
