    <AbstractNarration>Science on Patrol (SOP), a demonstration project of the Institute for Schools of the &lt;br/&gt;Future and the Police Athletic League in collaboration with the Manhattan Robbery Squad,&lt;br/&gt;the Crime Scene Unit, the Arson and Explosion Squad and other units of the New York City&lt;br/&gt;Police Department Detective Division, selected New York City public schools, community&lt;br/&gt;outreach organizations, science professionals and database and Web designers, is designed&lt;br/&gt;to promote interest and achievement in science by providing youngsters compelling &lt;br/&gt;problems ('crimes') they can solve by applying the scientific processes and skills&lt;br/&gt;actually used by crime scene investigators to solve crimes. This approach capitalizes on &lt;br/&gt;the interest in high profile crimes treated in the popular press, movies and current&lt;br/&gt;television programs. The informal science project is aimed squarely at raising the level of&lt;br/&gt;participation and achievement in science for adolescent females and other members of &lt;br/&gt;underrepresented minority groups by achieving thee goals:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. using research-based strategies to attract and retain underrepresented minorities, particularly&lt;br/&gt; females, in informal science programs;&lt;br/&gt;2. increasing their interest and achievement in science knowledge and skills; and&lt;br/&gt;3. raising their awareness and interest in science-based careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will roll out through an existing structure, PAL centers in the Bronx in Year&lt;br/&gt;One, in PAL centers throughout New York City in Year Two and in PAL centers across &lt;br/&gt;the country in Year Three. Interdisciplinary teams comprising PAL center instructors,&lt;br/&gt;educators, police detectives, instructional designers, and scientists will work &lt;br/&gt;collaboratively to: (1) develop, field test and revise a minimum of 12 crime scenarios&lt;br/&gt;for the youngsters to solve; (2) develop additional course materials, including a&lt;br/&gt;Facilitator's Guide, the Science on Patrol website, a Student Activities Kits which&lt;br/&gt;include case folders for each of the 'crimes', and a manual for mentors and/or volunteers;&lt;br/&gt;(3) increase the participants' capacity to apply science knowledge and processes to solve &lt;br/&gt;real world problems; and, (4) build the capacity of faculty to implement compelling and &lt;br/&gt;challenging problems in environments that are gender-neutral, promote collaboration, &lt;br/&gt;encourage problem-solving and reflect both research and best practice for increasing &lt;br/&gt;participation and achievement in science-based areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Decades of research on the root causes and outcomes of the under representation of &lt;br/&gt;females in mathematics, science and technology have amply demonstrated that the culture&lt;br/&gt;and context of K-16 schooling clearly lies at the heart of the issue. Yet the literature&lt;br/&gt;shows the very factors that constrain participation and achievement of females and other&lt;br/&gt;underrepresented minorities in higher levels of mathematics and science are alterable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Science on Patrol is an innovative project that links science knowledge and skills with &lt;br/&gt;the real world applications of forensic specialists in a highly motivating course of study&lt;br/&gt;for middle and high school students. The key element, however, is the comprehensive use &lt;br/&gt;of research-based findings to shape learning environments specifically designed to attract &lt;br/&gt;and retain females and other underrepresentedminorities to advanced study of science and&lt;br/&gt;science-related careers. Science on Patrol does not single out specific research-based&lt;br/&gt;factors that promote success for female and other underrepresented minorities.&lt;br/&gt;Instead, it integrates all in an integrated and coherent manner to create learning &lt;br/&gt;environments that are friendly to the target population. Information about the culture&lt;br/&gt;and context of these learning environments will be disseminated broadly and serve as a &lt;br/&gt;model for other informal science efforts and for school-based K-16 classrooms.</AbstractNarration>
