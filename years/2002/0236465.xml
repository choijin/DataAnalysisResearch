<AbstractNarration>The objective of this Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) is to explore feasibility to design, fabricate and test a nano mechanical machining (mechanism) system-on-a-chip (tool, tool holder and their actuation), a dynamic scanning probe machining tool, with intention of performing operations such as drilling, milling, deburring, etc. This novel system-on-a-chip (SOAC) will be adaptable to scanning probe microscope (SPM) operation platform. Another unique feature of this innovation is that it will allow rotational motion to the nano tool tip, unlike mechanisms demonstrated by others, to realize new boundaries of traditional macro mechanical machine in nano paradigm. In this exploratory phase, this mechanism will be fabricated using well-established micro electro mechanical system (MEMS) platform through silicon multilayer fabrication. This project covers the research and education theme on "Manufacturing processes at Nanoscale".&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the most important areas which will impact all sections of nano technology, is the design and development of "tools" for nano fabrication, machining and manufacturing. The tools for nano machining can be classified in various ways, but predominantly one can classify them as (1) tools for wet versus dry process, (2) natural versus intentional organization, and (3) bottom-up or top-down fabrication. In the proposed project, we intend to pursue dry processing for intentional organization in top-down fabrication approach.  Based upon today's direction of the field the findings will immediately impact semiconductor, optical, bio, pharmaceutical, etc. applications. This project will involve ethnic as well as gender minority undergraduate and graduate students in leading research projects through programs such as Carver Project, REU, etc. The PI would continue the proactive involvement through this project for bigger and better success by retaining and training minority students for higher education in this exciting and emerging area. Further, through the education task the PI will provide training to student on the project, introduce a new interdisciplinary class on Nanomanufacturing Processes at graduate level, and reach out through lab tours and creating an informative website "Nanotechnology for Dummies" for non-technical community and high school students. Moreover, nano science and engineering, particularly "nano manufacturing" is one of the major areas of emphasis for the state of Arkansas. The fields of biotechnology, electronics along with the traditional manufacturing are the major growing sectors in the state. On this background, the proposed subject area of research is of urgent academic and technological importance to many small hi-tech industries. The success of this seed project will enable PI to further establish a complete research and education program in the field of nanomanufacturing.</AbstractNarration>
