<AbstractNarration>This IMR award supports an instrument development of an electrostatic force based Single Electron Scanning Tunneling Microscope.  In previous work, single electron tunneling events from a special scanning probe tip have been clearly detected by electrostatic force.  However, no surface imaging with the single electrons has yet been achieved.  This research program focuses upon developing the methods needed to image individual, electrically isolated electron states at or near surfaces with atomic scale spatial resolution.  The methodology will include understanding the mechanical behavior of oscillating atomic force microscope (AFM) cantilevers under large force gradients, exploring the effects of charge transfer and voltage dependence, optimizing and developing a force detection system for the single electron measurements and developing a method for height control while imaging with single electrons.  The ability to image and characterize electrically isolated, localized, electronic states near surfaces (undetectable with the standard Scanning Tunneling Microscope) is a fundamental, new capability.  The approach is to provide a detailed understanding of the atomic scale electronic properties of electrically insulating materials and isolated nanometer scale systems.&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;This IMR award supports an instrument development of an electrostatic force based Single Electron Scanning Tunneling Microscope.
