    <AbstractNarration>This study proposes to conduct rigorous research on the strategic use of classroom talk for teaching mathematics to middle grade non-English speaking students. They will seek to learn whether discourse-intensive mathematics instruction between teachers and students, and between students and students, is effective in a three-year micro-analytic study of student learning in four discourse-intensive versions of connected Mathematics. Paper and pencil tests of the concepts in the lessons will be collected, students will be videotaped in clinical interviews, and a detailed analysis of the videotapes will be conducted. The same teachers will deliver the teaching modules in two different formats to matched classes of 7th grade students. The student population will be mostly non-English speaking students of low-income backgrounds. Teachers will receive training in the methods. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The panel considered this proposal to be an outstanding proposal because it was based on a previous study by the author of the proposal, cites other relevant research, and has a strong group of advisors.</AbstractNarration>
