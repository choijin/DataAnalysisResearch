    <AbstractNarration>The research addresses problems in two topics: scheduling of random&lt;br/&gt;processes and quantum information theory. Scheduling problems arise in&lt;br/&gt;many areas of computer science. The investigator studies the possibility&lt;br/&gt;of scheduling two random sequences of activities in a way that prevents&lt;br/&gt;certain conflicts between them. The methods applied also advance the state&lt;br/&gt;of the art in percolation theory (a fundamental area of probability theory&lt;br/&gt;and statistical physics). Quantum information theory extends the questions&lt;br/&gt;concerning conditions and methods for reliable transmission of information&lt;br/&gt;to the setting of quantum mechanics. It has applications in cryptography,&lt;br/&gt;and also relates to the promising area of quantum computing. The theory of&lt;br/&gt;description complexity has been useful in clarifying concepts of classical&lt;br/&gt;information theory. The research extends description complexity theory in&lt;br/&gt;order to help study the much more complex questions of quantum information&lt;br/&gt;theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the scheduling problem, given are the sample paths of two or more random&lt;br/&gt;processes (like queues) and some condition telling when these processes&lt;br/&gt;``collide''. The task is to introduce delays into each of the processes in&lt;br/&gt;a way that avoids collisions. Reformulation introduces a dependent&lt;br/&gt;percolation model with novel convergence properties that aroused much&lt;br/&gt;interest. The principal tool of the solution is renormalization, greatly&lt;br/&gt;refined. The achieved results are qualitative, leaving much quantitative&lt;br/&gt;work to be done. In the application of description complexity to quantum&lt;br/&gt;information theory, a universal semicomputable density matrix (``universal&lt;br/&gt;probability'') is taken as a starting point, and complexity (an operator)&lt;br/&gt;is defined as its negative logarithm. A number of properties of Kolmogorov&lt;br/&gt;complexity and von Neumann entropy extend naturally to the new domain, and&lt;br/&gt;the quantity reflects appropriately some of the peculiarities of quantum&lt;br/&gt;information (no cloning). The approach taken unifies other approaches made&lt;br/&gt;by several researchers in this direction.</AbstractNarration>
