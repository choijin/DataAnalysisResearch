<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I will develop a new class of nano-engineered  multilayers  for reactive joining of materials that  enables  one  to  control  the  stability  and  ignition  energy  of  the corresponding reactive foils.  Two general approaches will be explored in this project. The first approach is based on vapor depositing a periodic quad-layer structure, in which two nanoscale layers, alternating  between  elements  with  high  heats  of  mixing  (Al  and  Ni),  are  separated  by thinner, barrier layers comprised of a relatively inert material (Cu) that interacts weakly with the other two.  Control over foil stability, ignition requirements and reaction properties can then be achieved by varying the nanoscale thickness (0.5nm to 5.0nm) of the inert (Cu) barrier layers.  The second approach is based on the development of composite structures, which combine nanolayered reactive foils (50-150 micron thick) with micron scale braze and solder layers.  In this approach, one takes advantage of the thermal mass of the braze and solder layers in order to enhance the stability of the reactive foil. In the project, the team   will  (1)  demonstrate  the  feasibility  of  this  new  class  of  nano-engineered multilayers,  (2)  characterize  their  stability  and  ignition  requirements,  and  (3)  develop  and validate  predictive  computational  models  that  complement  experimental  observations  and amplify their scope.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Commercially, successful development of these novel nanostructed materials will lead to significant improvement in  reactive joining technology.  Letters of support from potential customers  and  suppliers  demonstrate  interest  in  the  development  of  stable  reactive  multilayer foils and their use in joining applications.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
