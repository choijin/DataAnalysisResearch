<AbstractNarration>SES-0217287&lt;br/&gt;PI (s): Linda Molm&lt;br/&gt;University of Arizona&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research is part of a long-term project investigating how different forms of social exchange affect major exchange outcomes.  In previous work the PI established that negotiated exchange-in which actors jointly bargain over the terms of strictly binding agreements, and reciprocal exchanges-in which actors individually give benefits to each other without negotiation, have very different effects on behavioral and affective outcomes.  Reciprocal exchanges produce weaker power use, greater feelings of trust and affective commitment, and stronger perceptions of fairness than equivalent negotiated exchanges.  The goal of this research is to test the independent effects of three causal mechanisms proposed to account for these differences: (1) the risk and uncertainty of exchange, (2) the relative salience of the competitive or cooperative aspects of exchange, and (3) the value of voluntary reciprocity. The research focuses on affective outcomes (feelings of trust, commitment, fairness, and solidarity), and extends the analysis to a third form of exchange, generalized (or indirect) exchange, that entails even greater differences in risk, salience of competition, and reciprocity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Five laboratory experiments test predictions related to these goals.  Experiments will be conducted to test the effects of risk and uncertainty on trust and commitment by manipulating whether negotiated agreements are binding or non-binding and whether actors can communicate their intentions in reciprocal exchanges.   Another experiment will test the effect of increasing the salience of competition on perceptions of fairness in reciprocal exchange, by allowing actors to choose not only which partner to reward, but also how much benefit to give. Finally experiments will test the value that actors place on frequency and predictability of reciprocity, relative to the magnitude of benefits received and compare indirect (generalized) exchange with the two forms of direct exchange (negotiated and reciprocal).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will contribute to expanding the scope of contemporary theory and research on social exchange to include the full range of exchange forms that characterize social life.  Findings will also help explain why these forms of exchange have such different effects on the development of trust and affective ties&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
