<AbstractNarration>Generation and manipulation of quantum entanglement of light fields are key techniques in the development of practical schemes for quantum information processing (QIP). In this project, the investigators will explore the all-optical route towards generation and control of the wave-packet mode properties of single photons, photon pairs, and multi-photon entangled states. To achieve this they will use the rapidly-advancing techniques of optical frequency conversion in second-order nonlinear optical crystals having controlled periodic structure for the purpose of phase matching. Such nonlinear photonic crystals can have tailor-made properties, giving the flexibility to design the wave-packet mode properties needed. And index wave-guiding structures can be introduced to control the transverse properties of the spatial modes. Furthermore, recently the method of one-dimensional quasi-phase matching has been generalized to the case of two-dimensional nonlinear photonic crystals. The combination of custom-designed periodicity (1- or 2-D) and waveguiding has the potential to lead to an unprecedented level of optical quantum-state control. </AbstractNarration>
