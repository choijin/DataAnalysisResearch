    <AbstractNarration>This collaborative research project will integrate experimental and modeling approaches to establish and understand the relationships between processing conditions, coating microstructure and coating properties thermal spray processing. Multi-institution, multidisciplinary collaborative research will expand the application of thermally sprayed polymer/ceramic composite coatings by incorporating nanoscopic to microscopic scales of reinforcement. The high velocity oxy-fuel [HVOF] thermal spray process will be used to deposit mixed, layered and functionally gradient matrix composite coatings. Thermally sprayed nanoscale silica reinforced Nylon 11 and polycarbonate matrix composites have previously exhibited significant improvements in scratch and wear resistance, modulus and barrier properties. Multiple scales of ceramic reinforcement should produce further improvements in properties, bridging the nano-to-conventional material interfaces, and providing fundamental understanding of the effect of the reinforcement size scale on matrix structure and composite properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three graduate students will be cross-trained through research tasks in thermal spray processing, microstructural and mechanical characterization and transport phenomena modeling. Integration of the computational model of particle melting, impact, deformation and solidification with experimental process and microstructural characterization will guide development and optimization of the HVOF spraying process.&lt;br/&gt;This research should stimulate new and improved applications nylon 11/silica composite materials as protective coatings, and for thermally sprayed composite protective coatings in general. Industry interest in thermally sprayed coatings is growing, as indicated, for example, by participation in technical programming on thermally sprayed polymers. Thermal spray technology is well established for metals, ceramics and cermets. The current project should support future commercialization of sprayed polymer/ceramic composites by characterizing the fundamental process/structure/ property relationships of these materials.</AbstractNarration>
