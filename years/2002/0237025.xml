    <AbstractNarration>Using Epulopiscium as a model, this project will address a fundamental problem faced&lt;br/&gt;by all large cells; that is, how a large cell overcomes constraints imposed on it by the&lt;br/&gt;diffusion coefficients of bioactive molecules. With cigar-shaped cells reaching 600 microns by&lt;br/&gt;80 microns, Epulopiscium spp. are the largest heterotrophic bacteria described to date. The&lt;br/&gt;presence of repetitive DNA located at the periphery of the cytoplasm may be a&lt;br/&gt;significant adaptation to maintain large cell size and high metabolic activity in&lt;br/&gt;Epulopiscium. This research project will further characterize this adaptation and its&lt;br/&gt;impact on biomolecule production and distribution. These results will provide important&lt;br/&gt;insights into the fundamental cellular issue of getting molecules (energy and nutrients) to&lt;br/&gt;distinct locations within a cell in a timely fashion. The project provides significant&lt;br/&gt;educational and training opportunities for graduate, undergraduate and high school&lt;br/&gt;students interested in the sciences. Although Epulopiscium is exceptional in the&lt;br/&gt;bacterial world it is an exciting model for conveying basic concepts of the bacterial cell.&lt;br/&gt;The fact that Epulopiscium spp. are so large, but not pathogenic, makes them good&lt;br/&gt;representatives of the microbial world, not only for biology students but for the general&lt;br/&gt;public as well. To facilitate information flow, a website featuring Epulopiscium biology&lt;br/&gt;will be developed. It will use Epulopiscium as a central model to introduce topics&lt;br/&gt;ranging from nanobiotechnology to the diversity of low G+C Gram positive bacteria&lt;br/&gt;(including information about pathogens like Bacillus anthracis).</AbstractNarration>
