<AbstractNarration>The aim of this International Symposium is to provide a forum for discussion of developments, in the GIS (Geographical Information Systems), CMMS (Computer Maintenance Management Systems), and IT (Information Technology) areas in the application of an intelligent assessment, renewal and management of underground municipal infrastructure. Research in this area is characterized by international and interdisciplinary cooperation. The proposed international forum by bringing together researchers from universities, municipal managers, and industry representatives, provides a major step towards a holistic approach to municipal infrastructure management.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research activities will help in advancing knowledge and understanding in the fields of assessment, monitoring &amp; intelligent management of underground municipal infrastructure.  The development of highly automated GIS systems capable of searching, organizing, preserving, and interacting with large quantities of condition &amp; maintenance data will provide a cost-effective tool for municipalities faced with shrinking budgets, growing problems and increasing regulations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop is being organized in three phases. Phase I is the Trenchless Technology Research Colloquium, hosted by the Infrastructure Engineering and Management Research Center, School of Engineering, The University of Birmingham, Edgbaston, Birmingham, UK. Phase II consists of field trips to visit the municipalities of Helsinki, Finland, and St. Petersburg, Russia. Phase III consists of presenting research findings and contributing to panel discussions at the 2002 International NoDig Conference, Copenhagen, Denmark.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Research Report containing the documentation of the research process, case studies, results of the data collection and analysis efforts, will be compiled by University of Birmingham, UK. Electronic copies will be made available through the Trenchless Technology Research Colloquium web site hosted by Trenchless Technology Center (TTC), Louisiana Tech University, Ruston, Louisiana (http://www.latech.edu/tech/engr/ttc/).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
