    <AbstractNarration>Experimental and Analytical Evaluation of Dynamic Fracture in Graded Multifunctional Material&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A comprehensive investigation of the dynamic mechanical response and failure of graded multifunctional materials under different loading conditions is proposed. Procedures for preparing a variety of both transparent and opaque graded materials will be established. Stress and deformation fields near dynamically loaded stationary and propagating cracks tips will be measured in real-time using optical techniques and high-speed photography. Appropriate stress fields for analyzing the experimental data will be developed, and a unified failure criterion for dynamic crack initiation and propagation in these materials will be established. This study will significantly advance knowledge on the dynamic response and failure characteristics of graded multifunctional materials, and will be of immense value to industries and defense agencies. This research will involve graduate and undergraduate students resulting in senior projects, theses and dissertations. The students will receive valuable exposure to the challenges of material synthesis and various experimental techniques used for mechanical and fracture characterization of novel materials.</AbstractNarration>
