<AbstractNarration>0226848&lt;br/&gt;Ghazi&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support the 3rd annual International Conference/Workshop on High Resolution Sector Field ICPMS to be held at the Department of Geology, Georgia State University, Atlanta, GA on October 2-5, 2002.  This international conference is a continuation of the previous two successful meetings that were held in Norfolk, Virginia, (2000), and in Vienna, Austria (2001).  There are now more than 300 single collector and nearly 100 multicollector high resolution ICP mass spectrometers around the world.  We request funding to organize this meeting to bring together all the scientists around the world who work in the field of high resolution ICP mass spectrometry and accessory instrumentation (e.g., laser ablation, HPLC, CE, Microdrill techniques).  This conference is intended to be a forum for the exchange of ideas and the presentation of work completed or in progress, for comment and discussion among international research groups working in the same field, as well as with research colleagues from the manufacturers to discuss future goals and improvements with the instrumentation. The conference will feature newest development in the field of high resolution plasma mass spectrometry, and we encourage participation of users from all kinds of applications.  We specially encourage the participation of graduate students and post-docs.  We will summarize the outcomes from this conference in the form of a report documenting directions and priorities in ICPMS and HR-ICPMS based-research.  We anticipate that this report will comment on the development of useful and appropriate instrument-based topics which can be included in undergraduate and graduate geosciences curricula.&lt;br/&gt;*** &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
