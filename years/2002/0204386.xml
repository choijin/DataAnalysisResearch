<AbstractNarration>DMS-0204386&lt;br/&gt;Daniel Ruberman, Jerome Levine, and Kiyoshi Igusa &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The topology group at Brandeis University proposes research on knot &lt;br/&gt;theory and 3-manifolds, gauge-theory and 4-manifolds, and on higher &lt;br/&gt;Reidemeister torsion of families of manifolds.  Jerome Levine plans &lt;br/&gt;to continue his study of finite type invariants of 3-manifolds. In &lt;br/&gt;particular, he plans to investigate a graphical interpretation of a &lt;br/&gt;new surgery-theoretic theory proposed in a recent paper. He also will &lt;br/&gt;investigate various questions concerning boundary link invariants &lt;br/&gt;such as the signature-type invariant and the relationship between the &lt;br/&gt;Farber invariant and non-commutative Reidemeister torsion.   Daniel &lt;br/&gt;Ruberman's research uses gauge theory to investigate the geometry and &lt;br/&gt;topology of 4-dimensional manifolds.  He will extend his program of &lt;br/&gt;using Seiberg-Witten theory and Yang-Mills theory to explore families &lt;br/&gt;of diffeomorphisms of 4-manifolds and  positive scalar curvature &lt;br/&gt;metrics on a 4-manifold.  Further work explores whether finiteness &lt;br/&gt;theorems of Riemannian geometry hold in dimension 4.  Seiberg-Witten &lt;br/&gt;and Donaldson theory will also be used to investigate a simple but &lt;br/&gt;important class of non-simply-connected 4-manifolds.  Kiyoshi Igusa's &lt;br/&gt;work extends his study of higher Franz-Reidemeister torsion to the &lt;br/&gt;complex case and to various new spaces of graphs.   He will use this &lt;br/&gt;to interpret the Miller-Morita-Mumford classes in terms of the higher &lt;br/&gt;Franz-Reidemeister (FR) torsion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our research encompasses a number of themes in geometry and topology. &lt;br/&gt;One of these is the interplay between topology and algebra, and &lt;br/&gt;another is the interplay between topology and theoretical physics. &lt;br/&gt;To study spaces or other topological objects such as knots, we encode &lt;br/&gt;some aspects of the space into familiar algebraic objects such as &lt;br/&gt;matrices or polynomials.   Some of the algebra used to study &lt;br/&gt;3-dimensional objects is connected with ideas developed by physicists &lt;br/&gt;to understand quantum field theory, especially the Feynmann integral. &lt;br/&gt;Investigating this interplay contributes to our understanding of the &lt;br/&gt;3-dimensional world in which we live.   Part of our work is concerned &lt;br/&gt;with the evolution of spaces--the study of the way in which they &lt;br/&gt;change as some parameter is varied.  Some of the research in this &lt;br/&gt;direction develops algebraic tools which apply in the case when there &lt;br/&gt;are many independent parameters.   Another component studies the &lt;br/&gt;evolution of 4-dimensional spaces and geometries, using techniques &lt;br/&gt;arising in gauge theory, a fundamental geometrical tool in &lt;br/&gt;theoretical physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
