<AbstractNarration>The PI's propose to conduct research on theoretical&lt;br/&gt;heavy ion physics. The emphasis of this proposal is reaction dynamics over a&lt;br/&gt;range of beam energies, from intermediate ( &gt; 10 AMeV) to ultra-relativistic&lt;br/&gt;(100 AGeV). Particular attention is paid to theory that is relevant to exper-&lt;br/&gt;iments at the NSCL, GSI, CERN-SPS, and RHIC. The co-PIs have a long&lt;br/&gt;tradition of collaborating with experimental groups in the US and abroad,&lt;br/&gt;and they will continue to do so.&lt;br/&gt;Thematically, themain emphasis lies on the investigation of correlations&lt;br/&gt;between emitted particles, as well as phase transitions in heavy ion reactions&lt;br/&gt;at different energy regimes. An important component of this proposal is the&lt;br/&gt;theoretical support for the future Rare Isotope Accelerator (RIA) program&lt;br/&gt;and its connection to nuclear astrophysics. Since the RIA construction was&lt;br/&gt;identifed as the highest priority in theNSAC long-range plan, it is impera-&lt;br/&gt;tive to deepen the theoretical underpinning for this feld.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed topics are of present interest to the investigators in light&lt;br/&gt;of the present experimental situation. A traditional strength of the investi-&lt;br/&gt;gators is the ability to adapt their research directions to new experimental&lt;br/&gt;fndings, and it can be predicted that this will continue during the proposed&lt;br/&gt;grant period.&lt;br/&gt;Almost all of the funds proposed will be spent for salaries for two gradu-&lt;br/&gt;ate students and one post-doctoral associate. In year one, there is a request&lt;br/&gt;for some computer support. This is justifed, because almost all proposed&lt;br/&gt;research makes extensive use of numerical work.</AbstractNarration>
