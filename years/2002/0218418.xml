    <AbstractNarration>Research shows that U.S. Latinas, particularly recent immigrants, are more likely to be diagnosed with and die from cervical cancer than are white women. Qualitative studies suggest that Latinas face numeorus barriers in attaining health services, but there are no systematic quantitative studies that account for preventive behaviors. The work combines acculturation theories and the social psychology of belief and behavior relationships as conceptual frames in a stage model. This study uses constructs from two stage models to investgate the complex relationships among numerous individual variables - perceived vulnerability, subjective norms, self-efficacy, attitudes toward cervical cancer, knowledge, acculturation, and cultural factors - and precautionary behaviors. The work involves focus groups, scale validation exercises, and then a systematic survey designed to account for health-seeking practices among Latinas in North Carolina. The research will identify factors within the cultural ethos of Latinas that have the effect of increasing their risk of cervical cancer and lessening their propensity to seek cancer screening.</AbstractNarration>
