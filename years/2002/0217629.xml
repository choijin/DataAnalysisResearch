<AbstractNarration>Tennessee Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (TLSAMP)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If America is to prosper in the new millennium, we must build a domestic science,&lt;br/&gt;mathematics, engineering, and technology (SMET) workforce that uses the talent of all&lt;br/&gt;segments of our population. America's prosperity is fueled by the nation's technical&lt;br/&gt;enterprise. As evidenced by the tragic episode of September 11, our country must build&lt;br/&gt;on the diversity within this country so that an increasingly large share of the work force&lt;br/&gt;will consist of women and underrepresented minorities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many national programs have been identified to enhance the quantity and quality of&lt;br/&gt;underrepresented minorities in science and engineering. This proposal describes a&lt;br/&gt;program designed to improve the quantity and quality of underrepresented scientists and&lt;br/&gt;engineers graduating each year with a bachelor's degree. The partners in the proposed&lt;br/&gt;alliance are all from the state of Tennessee. The existing knowledge base relative to&lt;br/&gt;minority participation in science and engineering will be the foundation of our efforts.&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to build on this foundation and to expand the available options to enrich&lt;br/&gt;programs at partner institutions and beyond.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tennessee State University, LeMoyne-Owen College, Middle Tennessee State&lt;br/&gt;University, University of Memphis, University of Tennessee at Knoxville, and Vanderbilt&lt;br/&gt;University will partner to form the Tennessee Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority&lt;br/&gt;Participation (TLSAMP). The ultimate success of this collaboration rests in the fact that&lt;br/&gt;if there is any student's need, there is an institution within the alliance with the&lt;br/&gt;characteristics, experience, and/or resources to meet the needs of the student. The&lt;br/&gt;alliance can draw on the strengths and experiences of each of the individual members.&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the TLSAMP is to increase the number of the underrepresented SMET&lt;br/&gt;students by at least 75% at the end of the five-year period. The objectives to support the&lt;br/&gt;goal of the alliance are: 1) to recruit underrepresented students to pursue science or&lt;br/&gt;engineering as a career, 2) to improve the quality of the learning environment for&lt;br/&gt;underrepresented science and engineering students at all schools, and 3) to ensure that a&lt;br/&gt;larger number of undergraduate students are prepared to enter graduate programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Alliance will emphasize collaborative learning approaches, mentoring activities via&lt;br/&gt;faculty, staff, and upper level students, and hands-on research and internship experiences.&lt;br/&gt;Using this approach, three project areas have been chosen as critical focal points for&lt;br/&gt;achieving the qualitative and quantitative goals of the project. These project areas utilize&lt;br/&gt;strategies with demonstrable effectiveness in the retention of underrepresented students in&lt;br/&gt;science and engineering. All project areas will involve faculty, staff, or students during&lt;br/&gt;the design phase as well as the continuous quality improvement phase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, assessment will be built into each project area as a result of the&lt;br/&gt;formulation of specific, measurable quantitative and qualitative objectives. These&lt;br/&gt;objectives will be reviewed and revised on an ongoing basis. An Advisory Committee&lt;br/&gt;composed of the Vice Presidents and Deans from the six schools will oversee all aspects&lt;br/&gt;of the grant project.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
