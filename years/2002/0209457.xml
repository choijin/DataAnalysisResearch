<AbstractNarration>Todd&lt;br/&gt;0209457&lt;br/&gt;     In this project, the investigator and his students study&lt;br/&gt;improved interior-point algorithms for convex, especially&lt;br/&gt;second-order and semidefinite, programming problems.  In&lt;br/&gt;particular, they investigate finding more accurate solutions to&lt;br/&gt;large-scale problems of this kind, interpreting the output of&lt;br/&gt;infeasible-interior-point methods as searching for infeasibility&lt;br/&gt;certificates when applied to infeasible problems, using ideas of&lt;br/&gt;Riemannian geomentry to develop new interior-point methods for&lt;br/&gt;possibly infeasible problems, and studying new barrier functions&lt;br/&gt;to be used in highly asymmetric problems, where usual primal-only&lt;br/&gt;or primal-dual methods would be inefficient.  All these ideas are&lt;br/&gt;tested out by implementing them in the software package SDPT3,&lt;br/&gt;developed by the investigator and two of his collaborators, which&lt;br/&gt;is a competitive primal-dual code available over the internet (e.g., at&lt;br/&gt;http://www.math.cmu.edu/~reha/sdpt3.html) and within the NEOS &lt;br/&gt;system (http://www-neos.mcs.anl.gov/neos/server-solvers.html)&lt;br/&gt;for distributed computing.&lt;br/&gt;     Interior-point algorithms are a new and exciting&lt;br/&gt;computational method for solving large-scale resource allocation&lt;br/&gt;and other optimization problems.  For example, they have been&lt;br/&gt;used to develop better designs for truss structures, such as&lt;br/&gt;bridges, that are better able to resist a wide range of external&lt;br/&gt;loads.  Another application is the design of antenna arrays to&lt;br/&gt;highlight the receptivity in certain directions while muting that&lt;br/&gt;in all other directions.  In finance, they are used to develop&lt;br/&gt;"optimal portfolios" to balance an acceptable rate of return with&lt;br/&gt;low volatility (unfortunately, these methods are only as good as&lt;br/&gt;the data they employ, and past history often does not give a good&lt;br/&gt;indication of future performance).  In this and other contexts,&lt;br/&gt;the idea of robust optimization, to find solutions to problems&lt;br/&gt;that satisfy all constraints even when the data are perturbed a&lt;br/&gt;little, and that give good performance measures even when the&lt;br/&gt;data are slightly changed, is very attractive, and this class of&lt;br/&gt;methods is successful in treating some problems of this kind&lt;br/&gt;also.  A last application mentioned here is currently being&lt;br/&gt;studied by the investigator and a statistics colleague: trying to&lt;br/&gt;find a good way to classify new data into one of two classes&lt;br/&gt;(e.g., with or without a cancerous tumour) on the basis of some&lt;br/&gt;training data (with known classification).  This problem is of&lt;br/&gt;interest in data mining and biomedical fields.  In all these&lt;br/&gt;problems, there is a desire to solve larger and larger instances&lt;br/&gt;(involving tens of thousands of variables and constraints) more&lt;br/&gt;and more accurately.  The investigator and his collaborators&lt;br/&gt;study theoretically and practically ways to improve existing&lt;br/&gt;algorithms to extend their capabilities in these directions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
