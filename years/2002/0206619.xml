<AbstractNarration>A fundamental question in population and conservation biology is the rate at which wildlife populations exchange individuals. In this study, the genetics of both a vertebrate host and an infecting virus will be used to infer movement of cougars among populations in the northern Rocky Mountains. Because viruses evolve a million times faster than do higher organisms, changes in host populations, such as population subdivision, should become manifest in the genetics of a virus long before they lead to genetic changes in the host. Estimates of host movement based on virus genetics will be compared to estimates derived from a more traditional host genetic marker, microsatellites. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The use of a fast-evolving infectious organism as a genetic marker of animal movements offers an innovative perspective on population dynamics that can complement existing population genetics approaches. In addition, the proposed research is significant because it will increase our understanding of how infectious organisms like viruses are distributed and maintained on a landscape scale. Furthermore, the research proposed fosters productive collaborations with hunters, government agencies, and academics. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
