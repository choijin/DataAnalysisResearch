<AbstractNarration>This project is examining students ability to transfer knowledge and skills within the engineering curriculum. It is focused on how much knowledge is transferred from Calculus, Differential Equations, and Physics to subsequent engineering courses. We are developing a series of diagnostic exams that measure the degree of transfer of basic skills and concepts from these areas into Engineering Dynamics, and Fields and Waves. These two courses were chosen because of their wide application in engineering and because of their extensive use of concepts from these earlier courses. We are also exploring the strength of relationship between high grades and a student's ability to transfer knowledge from Calculus, Differential Equations, and Physics. We are evaluating classroom practices that strengthen transfer of skills. Among the products of this project is the "Transfer Environment and Student Readiness Instrument" being developed at RPI's Anderson Center for Innovation in Undergraduate Education. This instrument assesses a range of environmental and affective variables known to correlate with improved transfer capability. It is meant to help students evaluate their own perception about their courses as being integrated or disconnected and fragmented. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
