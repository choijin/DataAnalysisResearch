    <AbstractNarration>Novel statistical strategies are being developed and implemented for the analysis of data from the Laser Interferometric Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). Interesting astrophysical phenomena should be observed: coalescing binary systems, black hole formation, supernovae, pulsars and perhaps even the Big Bang itself. New computing techniques will be used for estimating parameters and generating statistics. These methods have been successfully demonstrated in complex problems in economics and other sciences. These novel techniques will be brought to LIGO and its data. Gravity wave astronomy is entering the exciting phase of discovery and raising many statistical methodological issues. This project will contribute to significant research at the frontiers of physics and statistics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will have many broader impacts. Carleton College is a leader in producing future scientists. This project will provide research opportunities to motivated students with interests in physics and statistics. This project will provide important educational opportunities for the training of the next generation of scientists. The computational statistical methods developed by the PI and collaborators have had significant influence in other fields. The initial gravity wave results have found applications with cosmic microwave background analysis, and noisy chaotic systems. Carleton faculty, including the PI, are also active in scientific outreach. High school students &lt;br/&gt;and teachers are regularly exposed to the wonder and significance of LIGO's research, and this outreach creates much excitement for science and physics.</AbstractNarration>
