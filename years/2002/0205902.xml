<AbstractNarration>AST 0205902&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI Wood&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The set of interacting binary star systems called cataclysmic variables serves as a marvelous laboratory to study how astrophysical accretion processes work. In that group of binaries are a number of broad categories of objects, each category further divided into classes of objects of different outburst and quiescence behaviors. Significant amounts of  observational effort has been expended in an attempt to understand the underlying accretion physics in these systems  Now once seemingly intractable computational problems are accessible via better algorithms and desktop supercomputing with 3-dimensional hydrodynamic codes, and progress has been made.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will advance efforts to model a particular, and for a long-while puzzling, phenomenon observed in SU Ursa Majoris-type systems: so-called superhumps observed during especially bright outbursts. The PI has successfully modeled approximate  superhump behavior using his smoothed particle hydrodynamic code in a fully 3-dimensional mode.  The superhumps in light curves  are true instabilities of  tilted accretion disks. This project will expand the work by adding disk viscosity due to magnetic fields and creating a grid of light curves and modeled disks that will be delivered to the astronomy community as an atlas.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
