    <AbstractNarration>This research addresses an important set of questions arising&lt;br/&gt;in optimization of industrial systems for network design,&lt;br/&gt;data classification, facility location, and scheduling.&lt;br/&gt;A fundamental problem arising in all these areas is called&lt;br/&gt;set covering. Set covering problems range from easy to very&lt;br/&gt;difficult and it is the more difficult ones that form the focus&lt;br/&gt;of this research. The problems studied are approached through&lt;br/&gt;rigorous and mathematical methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research studies several approaches to the design of&lt;br/&gt;algorithms for set covering problems arising in the areas of&lt;br/&gt;network design, facility location and data classification, mostly&lt;br/&gt;based on mathematical programming techniques. The focus&lt;br/&gt;is on the study of complexity and approximability of set covering&lt;br/&gt;and its extensions in network design and classification, including the&lt;br/&gt;design of general algorithmic techniques and the analysis of&lt;br/&gt;mathematical programming formulations and relaxations. A special&lt;br/&gt;emphasis is made on set covering problems defined on directed&lt;br/&gt;graphs, which is an area where very few results are available in&lt;br/&gt;the literature.</AbstractNarration>
