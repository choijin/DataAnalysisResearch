<AbstractNarration>0221207&lt;br/&gt;Lewenstein&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a total of 37 participants from the United States, South and East Asia, and the Americas in a US-Africa Workshop on "Achieving Public Understanding of Science in Developing Countries," scheduled for December 5-9, 2002, in Cape Town, South Africa.  There will be a total of approximately 60 participants, which will also include attendees from Europe and Australia.  A special effort has been made to include participants from developing countries throughout the world. The co-organizers are Professor Bruce Lewenstein, with the Department of Communication at Cornell University, and Ms. Marina Joubert, with the Department of Science Communication at the Foundation for Education, Science, and Technology (FEST), Pretoria South Africa.  The workshop participants will explore issues on the public understanding of science, and build networks and collaborations that can lead to innovative projects and research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The meeting will bring together knowledgeable practitioners of public communication of science and technology, scholars, and scientists.  They reflect a great diversity of expertise, with some coming from the electronic or print media fields, while others are experienced in presenting research to the public. The meeting will explore two cross-cutting issues: 1) the difference between public understanding of science and public understanding of research, and 2) the differences between a traditional deficit model of science communication and newer contextual, lay knowledge/expertise, and participation models of science communication.  Prior to the workshop each participant will produce an "op-ed piece" about the challenges and opportunities for achieving public understanding of science in developing countries.  These position statements will be circulated to all participants in preparation for discussion during the meeting.  As an outcome of the workshop a guide will be produced for use in the development of a "Southern African Science Communication Network."  Results will be disseminated through professional journals and via a web site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project supports the participation of two junior investigators from the United States, and one from Nigeria.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Office of International Science and Engineering, the Directorate for Education and Human Resources, and the Division of Social and Economic Sciences jointly support this award.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
