<AbstractNarration>This project is strengthening the completion and graduation rate of students who are non-traditional majors in engineering and technology. Students are being selected on academic merit and financial need criteria. The purpose of the program is to close the financial assistance gap, increase time on task, and support graduation for the associate degree for selected scholars within two years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A broadly representative Scholarship Committee is being formed; composed of faculty, administrative staff including the Director of Financial Aid, and industrial partners. Applications require a personal statement of educational and career goals and at least one letter of recommendation. This program aims to sustain award recipients to completion by providing intensive supportive services including small classes and a learning community approach, goal-based developmental advising, a college success seminar, a new student orientation, and internships. Other support services include tutoring and writing centers. The scholarship program enables the college to provide supplementary support for tutoring and monthly scholar seminars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Industrial partners provide mentoring and cooperative education opportunities. The Department of Engineering and Engineering Technology offers an associate degree in both career and transfer programs and is currently implementing an NSF Advanced Technological Education project, which establishes a new automated manufacturing curriculum and laboratory (also referred to as computer-integrated manufacturing or CIM program). This program is recruiting and enrolling two cohorts of non-traditional students for engineering and technology. Program scholars in this project are being drawn from this ATE project as well as from other engineering programs at the college.</AbstractNarration>
