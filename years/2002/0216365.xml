<AbstractNarration>The engineering department at The College of New Jersey seeks to build a foundation for research and learning through the acquisition of state-of-the-art technologies. Addition of a Digital Particle Image Velocimetry system will greatly diversify and enhance the current infrastructure of resources available to faculty and students. Digital Particle Image Velocimetry has become a standard in flow diagnostic techniques in industry and research sectors. The primary attractiveness of this technique lies in the ability to quantify planar or three-dimensional velocity fields with incredible accuracy, resolution, and speed. The heart of the system consists of a dual head pulsed Nd:YAG laser, high resolution CCD digital acquisition package, and a software interface that controls all acquisition and data processing functions. Two main activities will be generated at the College upon acquisition of the DPIV system: development of a research program capable of addressing issues faced by industry and society related to turbulence-driven phenomena and an educational improvement plan consisting of the enhancement of undergraduate laboratories and fluid mechanics courses and increased involvement of undergraduates in research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specific thrust areas to be targeted by the research program will initially focus on noise generation due to turbulent flow and the quantification of turbulent multiphase flows. Issues addressed by the multiphase flow studies will include bubble interactions with turbulence and particle dispersion problems of interest to industry. Using DPIV, individual terms of the governing turbulent transport equations can be directly calculated so that the dominant source terms can be identified. In addition, particle motions and distributions can be directly observed. These capabilities can ultimately lead to validation of complex numerical models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Incorporation of a DPIV system into undergraduate laboratories and fluid mechanics courses will allow students to gain deeper physical insight into a host of fluid phenomena. Integration of theory and design is one of the cornerstones of the well- balanced engineering education received by students at the College. The quality of several student senior design projects will be greatly enhanced through access to a flow diagnostic tool such as DPIV for evaluating prototypes and testing innovative concepts.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
