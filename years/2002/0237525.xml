    <AbstractNarration>Achieve, Inc. plans to work with a group of Mathematics Achievement Partnership (MAP) states to plan a set of challenging mathematics activities that includes a new mathematics assessment, professional development, and curriculum selection. The strategic plans that are created will allow each state to assess the degree of alignment between existing states standards and tests, and MAP standards and assessment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Achieve, Inc. has been actively working with states over the past several years to help states transition to more challenging mathematics curricula and assessment. Through other funding sources, Achieve, Inc. is creating a extbook guide, professional development models and a website library of mathematics lessons. It is anticipated that an assessment will be produced as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are fourteen states that have been associated with the MAP effort. This planning effort will provide a small number of MAP states with an opportunity to actively plan for a transition from current standards and assessment to a more ambitious and internationally benchmarker endeavor.</AbstractNarration>
