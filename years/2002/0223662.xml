    <AbstractNarration>Retinal Neurobiology and Visual Processing&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2002 FASEB Summer Research Conference&lt;br/&gt;July 6th to 11th, Saxtons River, Vermont&lt;br/&gt;Stephen Massey, Chair, and Marla Feller, Vice Chair&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the sixth in a series of biannual conferences devoted specifically to the structure and function of the retina. The presentations will cover many facets of retinal biology including: the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying retinal development; the basis of neural signaling; the identification of neural circuits by which the retina processes visual input; the code by which retinal output is conveyed to the brain; and the resulting abilities and limitations of visual behavior. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This five-day conference will attract approximately 180 participants from around the world. Thirty-five internationally recognized experts have agreed to present their work in formal talks, which are organized in nine thematic sessions, chaired by leaders in each field. Furthermore, emphasis has been placed on the contributions of younger scientists in an early career stage. In addition, there will be two informal workshops on new technology. Finally, all participants are invited to display their latest results during two poster sessions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference format is designed to foster direct scientific exchange among participants. Students and post-docs, particularly from under-represented minority groups, are strongly encouraged to attend. Many young scientists find new positions from contacts made at this meeting. There is ample time for discussion at the end of each presentation, during workshops and poster sessions and there is further free time for informal exchange at meals, which are communal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because this conference attracts most of the field's senior investigators, it has been highly successful in disseminating results, and has significantly affected the course of retinal research. Furthermore, because the retina is at the forefront of neural circuit analysis and development, this conference will have far-reaching effects on the neuroscience community at large. Women are well represented and we have made a successful effort to attract under-represented minorities to the conference. However, we are particularly proud of our success in featuring young speakers and providing travel support for students to attend this meeting.</AbstractNarration>
