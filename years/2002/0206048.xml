<AbstractNarration>AST-0206048&lt;br/&gt;Crotts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Supernova 1987A, the closest SN seen in nearly four centuries, and the most intensely&lt;br/&gt;studied ever, is rapidly turning into a SN remnant as the ejecta from the explosion now&lt;br/&gt;strikes the circumstellar envelope shed by the star over the last million years. We propose&lt;br/&gt;to observe this process using a combination of optical, IR and UV programs, plus further&lt;br/&gt;space-based studies (supported by NASA). These will allow us to map the structure of&lt;br/&gt;the envelope, both in its unperturbed state and as it is destroyed by the ejecta. This&lt;br/&gt;will allow the first complete study of SN remnant formation evolution ever undertaken.&lt;br/&gt;Our previous observations of the 3-D structure, velocities, density and composition will&lt;br/&gt;establish the nature of the pre-explosion nebula and the mass loss processes that created it,&lt;br/&gt;while the excitation of this nebula by the X and EUV flux created in the collision will allow&lt;br/&gt;us to re-analyze it once more. In addition to these unprecedented studies of a SN remnant,&lt;br/&gt;will continue to use light echoes from the SN explosion to explore the interstellar&lt;br/&gt;medium in the 30 Doradus star-formation region, to study the echo of the UV pulse from&lt;br/&gt;SN shock breakout through the progenitor star's surface, and to accurately determine the&lt;br/&gt;distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud { a fundamental rung on the extragalactic distance&lt;br/&gt;ladder.&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>
