<AbstractNarration>The Transition to Teaching Partnership (T3 ) is a collaborative effort among the Cincinnati Public Schools, the Mt Healthy Schools, University of Cincinnati College of Education, Procter and Gamble, the Cincinnati Business Committee, and multiple community agencies. Its purpose is to recruit, prepare, and retain effective mathematics and science teachers committed to teaching in urban schools. Using Ohio's Alternative Educator Licensure process, recent college graduates and adults changing careers are receiving the education, support, and mentoring required for a successful transition from other activities to teaching math or science in grades 7 through 12. T3 is based on the University of Cincinnati's "Cincinnati Initiative for Teacher Education," a nationally recognized, award winning teacher preparation program and Cincinnati Public School's award winning "Peer Evaluation and Assistance Program." T3 combines the best practices of both programs in providing 24 recruited pre-service teachers with content preparation, pedagogical knowledge and skills, and follow-on support and development as new teachers.&lt;br/&gt;Recruitment for participation in the program is taking place in the local communities in which the schools exist and through partnerships with downsizing corporations. Grass-roots organizations have been included as partners to address the needs of community members. T3 is collaborating with these groups to identify and recruit qualified individuals. T3 also is working with the human resources departments of companies to make classroom teaching a viable option for their laid off chemists, mathematicians, biologists, and others. There is particular emphasis on attracting minority teacher candidates. Special features of the retention component of the project include financial planning, personal and family counseling, and contingency funding for unanticipated life events. Recruited candidates are enrolled in university courses required to meet the Ohio Alternative Educator License requirement and other refresher content courses. Candidates are required to become Cincinnati Youth Collaborative mentors and form one-on-one relationships with Cincinnati or Mt Healthy public school students. This feature of T3 is assisting teacher candidates in building rapport based on knowledge and trust with their students. It also serves as a "reality check" to ensure that candidates have an accurate understanding of urban youth and the difficulties they face. &lt;br/&gt;Teaching experiences begin in summer school sessions. Teacher candidates teach in those schools where they are scheduled to become full-time teachers in the fall (in accordance with Ohio's Alternative Educator License). Cincinnati and Mt. Healthy have a large cadre of experienced teachers who have been trained to mentor and support new teacher candidates. These teacher-mentors are leading teams of 3 to 4 teacher candidates with support from university faculty. Teacher candidates continue working with a mentor teacher until they earn a professional teaching license. Coursework completed in T3 also counts toward a master in education degree, a feature that enables continued university participation in the professional development of program participants. This program has the potential to become a model for the State of Ohio and the nation. The evaluation strategy has a dual purpose, one focused locally on the project and one focused on the effectiveness of this approach for wider dissemination. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
