    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a process to significantly lower (up to 74%) the cost of forging dies, improve die life, and at the same time lower the cost of forgings. The project method involves the use of a near-net-shape manufacturing process, called the RCC process. This process, once optimized for die applications, will be replacing several high energy, expensive steps in the existing methods. The process allows localized control of surface chemistry, which can lead to better metal flow and die cavity filling, improved resistance to wear and heat checking. The process combines the shape capability of investment casting with structural uniformity of full-density powder metallurgy, and strength of forgings. The process has been used successfully to manufacture several complex shaped superalloy, titanium alloy, and stainless steel prototype parts. &lt;br/&gt; The potential commercial application will be a new die making process. It is projected that an annual cost savings could be as much as $1.2 billion if successful.</AbstractNarration>
