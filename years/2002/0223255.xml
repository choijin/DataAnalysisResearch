<AbstractNarration>Discussions about infrastructure security and survivability require system-wide comparisons and interdisciplinary approaches.  Our consideration of survivability focuses on large-scale economic implications of attacks or vulnerabilities on major infrastructure sectors as defined by the Department of Commerce.  We explore the critical connections between core service infrastructure sectors (e.g., telecommunications, electricity, and pipelines) using a total supply chain analysis model originally developed to estimate environmental and energy effects of production in the U.S.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We propose to use publicly available data from the Department of Commerce's Bureau of Economic Analysis to show the actual economic dependencies between critical infrastructures and the service economy in general.  The input-output tables of the U.S. economy detail the economic purchases that result between all 500 domestic economic sectors.  Specifically, these tables show how much output is generated by each of the sectors, and the amounts of product other sectors purchase from each sector.  For example, the model can show not only which sectors use electricity but also how much dollar value of electricity is used to produce goods or services in that sector.  These data are real and tangible representations of how dependent service sector businesses are to other businesses within the infrastructure sector and the economy in general.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of course, the sectors of most interest to us when discussing vulnerabilities are sectors involved with critical infrastructure such as the information sector.  Analysis of this kind can lead to new approaches to resource allocation for investments to assure infrastructure capabilities.  To this end, we will contribute to the national dialogue on pending threats and risks as a result of targeted infrastructure attacks by providing a quantitative assessment tool that shows the potential connection and failure points present in the economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
