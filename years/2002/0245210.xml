<AbstractNarration>The PI will investigate several aspects of the&lt;br/&gt;localization-delocalization transition in Anderson-type random&lt;br/&gt;Schr\"odinger operators. One goal is the development of new&lt;br/&gt;methods to characterize energy regimes with localized wave&lt;br/&gt;functions. The main focus will be on the fractional moment&lt;br/&gt;(or Aizenman-Molchanov) method, which has recently been shown to&lt;br/&gt;apply to continuum disordered systems. The PI and his&lt;br/&gt;collaborators will further increase the applicability of this&lt;br/&gt;method and use it to study several open problems such as the&lt;br/&gt;localization properties of continuum surface models and the&lt;br/&gt;Anderson model on continuum strips. Another objective is to study&lt;br/&gt;mathematical mechanisms which show existence of&lt;br/&gt;extended states in disordered media. For example, this will be&lt;br/&gt;studied through one-dimensional random polymers, where an extended&lt;br/&gt;state at a single energy can lead to significant electron&lt;br/&gt;transport. The PI and collaborators will also develop perturbation&lt;br/&gt;theoretic methods to study the high energy spectrum of&lt;br/&gt;multi-dimensional Schr\"odinger operators with quasi-periodic&lt;br/&gt;potentials, and, in particular, establish the existence of&lt;br/&gt;extended states for this model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Anderson model is used to describe the conductivity properties&lt;br/&gt;of disordered media. This includes crystals with imbedded or&lt;br/&gt;substitutional impurities, alloys, amorphous media, the effects of&lt;br/&gt;lattice fluctuations at high temperature, and quasi crystals. The&lt;br/&gt;central goal is to understand the effects of disorder on electron&lt;br/&gt;transport and therefore to distinguish between conductors and&lt;br/&gt;insulators. The phenomena which are observed are not restricted to&lt;br/&gt;quantum mechanical waves, but extend to the propagation of&lt;br/&gt;acoustic, electro-magnetic and elastic waves in disordered media.&lt;br/&gt;Applications in engineering include the study of random&lt;br/&gt;imperfections in quantum wave guides, photonic crystals, and&lt;br/&gt;anomalous transport in quasi crystals. The PI's research is aimed&lt;br/&gt;at finding mathematically rigorous justifications of the Anderson&lt;br/&gt;transition, stipulating that disordered media can undergo a phase&lt;br/&gt;transition from insulator to conductor at sufficiently high&lt;br/&gt;energy.</AbstractNarration>
