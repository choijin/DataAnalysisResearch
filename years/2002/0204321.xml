<AbstractNarration>Effective processes are of fundamental importance to manufacturing,&lt;br/&gt;government, engineering, and management.  In all of these areas greater&lt;br/&gt;understanding and control of key processes can lead to improved&lt;br/&gt;effectiveness.   For the past 15 years, it has also been recognized that&lt;br/&gt;processes are fundamental to software development, and that effective&lt;br/&gt;control of processes can lead to similar benefits, such as improved&lt;br/&gt;understanding, coordination, efficiency, and automation.  It has been hoped&lt;br/&gt;that this would lead to reductions in software development cost,&lt;br/&gt;improvements in software product quality, and reductions in software&lt;br/&gt;development time.  Our hypothesis is that progress towards these goals can&lt;br/&gt;be speeded by establishing a scientific basis upon which to build the&lt;br/&gt;process technologies that will support more effective software production.&lt;br/&gt;This research project will lead to the development of needed improvements&lt;br/&gt;to the Little-JIL process definition language, and the Juliette&lt;br/&gt;interpreter.   These improvements will be validated by programming  and&lt;br/&gt;running multiuser, iterative software design processes that are effective&lt;br/&gt;in integrating the activities of humans and computer automation.  These&lt;br/&gt;processes should be of considerable value in themselves.  Their&lt;br/&gt;development, moreover, will sharpen and validate the Little-JIL process&lt;br/&gt;language, resulting in clearer understandings of the underlying&lt;br/&gt;requirements for effective process definition languages.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
