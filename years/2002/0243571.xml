<AbstractNarration>In this RUI (Research in Undergraduate Institutions) renewal proposal, the PI&lt;br/&gt;proposes to undertake two new projects, i.e., (1) development and application of a&lt;br/&gt;transport theory with Bose-Einstein statistics for ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions&lt;br/&gt;at Brookhaven's Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC) and (2) investigations of nov-&lt;br/&gt;el properties of dense neutron-rich matter with energetic radioactive beams. The large&lt;br/&gt;number of pions produced and thus the high value of pion phase-space density reached&lt;br/&gt;in heavy-ion collisions at RHIC requires a proper inclusion of the Bose-Einstein s-&lt;br/&gt;tatistics (multi-boson symmetrization) in the reaction dynamics. The Bose-Einstein&lt;br/&gt;statistics is currently neglected in essentially all dynamical models for RHIC. The&lt;br/&gt;focus of the PI's work on the first project is to include the Bose-Einstein statistics&lt;br/&gt;in both the hadronization and the subsequent dynamical evolution of hadrons, most&lt;br/&gt;importantly pions, within a multi-phase transport model. The transport theory with&lt;br/&gt;Bose-Einstein statistics will be a useful tool for predicting reliably and interpreting&lt;br/&gt;critically nuclear collision data at RHIC, especially the single-particle spectra, multi-&lt;br/&gt;particle correlation functions and the collective ow of pions. It might also beuseful&lt;br/&gt;for solving the Hanbury Brown/Twiss (HBT) puzzle found in experiments at RHIC.&lt;br/&gt;The ultimate goals of the second project are to determine accurately the isospin&lt;br/&gt;dependence of the nuclear equation of state (EOS) and to investigate novel properties&lt;br/&gt;of dense neutron-rich matter that was not in reach in terrestrial laboratories before.&lt;br/&gt;These are important issues identified in the most recent U.S. long-range plan (LRP)&lt;br/&gt;for nuclear physics and foundamental properties that govern many aspects of neutron&lt;br/&gt;stars. To extract crucial information about the isospin-dependence of the nuclear&lt;br/&gt;EOS, the PI proposes to investigate several experimental observables in nuclear reac-&lt;br/&gt;tions induced by energetic neutron-rich nuclei at existing radioactive beam facilities&lt;br/&gt;and the future Rare Isotope Accelerator, identified as the top priority for new con-&lt;br/&gt;struction in the U.S. LRP for nuclear physics. Moreover, several novel properties&lt;br/&gt;of dense neutron-rich matter will be explored. These include the isospin separation&lt;br/&gt;instability, the unique &lt;br/&gt;0&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
