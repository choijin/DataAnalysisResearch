<AbstractNarration> &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt;The  anaerobic  oxidation  of  methane  is  a  microbially-mediated  process  by  which  the &lt;br/&gt;reduction of sulfate is coupled to the oxidation of methane.  This process is prevalent on a &lt;br/&gt;global scale and is estimated to consume between 12 and 50% the net modern &lt;br/&gt;atmospheric methane flux (70 to 300 Tg per  year).  The microbes responsible for this &lt;br/&gt;process are important as methane is a potent greenhouse gas in the atmosphere, and their &lt;br/&gt;metabolism  prevents  large  quantities  of  methane  in  the  Earth  from  reaching  the &lt;br/&gt;atmosphere.  Despite the importance of this process, the responsible organisms have &lt;br/&gt;never been cultured in the laboratory.  Recent studies conducted in our lab indicate that &lt;br/&gt;sustained growth of these organisms is possible  in the laboratory  given the appropriate &lt;br/&gt;conditions, especially elevated pressures of methane (50 to 150  atmospheres).   We &lt;br/&gt;therefore propose to  continue growth of these  enrichment  cultures, to  characterize the &lt;br/&gt;microbial community composition and physiology of the enrichments, and to isolate the &lt;br/&gt;methane oxidizers.  Specifically, we propose to:  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;1)  Characterize changes in microbial community structure as well as in methane and &lt;br/&gt;sulfate metabolism during growth of successive enrichment cultures, &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;2) Characterize growth of the CH4-oxidizing archaea in the enrichment cultures &lt;br/&gt;including species-specific analyses of growth rates, carbon conversion efficiencies, &lt;br/&gt;growth morphologies, and the impact of methane partial pressure,   &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;3)  Quantify isotope fractionation factors (for  13C  and  2H) associated with methane &lt;br/&gt;oxidation and lipid biosynthesis, and &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;4)  Isolate the responsible organisms using modified roll tubes at elevated (100 &lt;br/&gt;atmosphere) methane levels. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts &lt;br/&gt;In addition to the studies proposed above, this work will also lead to development of new &lt;br/&gt;methods for culturing strictly anaerobic bacteria and archaea at low temperatures with &lt;br/&gt;high gas pressures.  These methods promise to enhance infrastructure for microbiological &lt;br/&gt;research. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The proposed studies  also promise to  enhance our understanding of anaerobic methane &lt;br/&gt;oxidation and to lay a foundation for future studies.  The ability to grow the responsible &lt;br/&gt;organisms in the laboratory will allow for a variety of biochemical, genetic, physiological &lt;br/&gt;and molecular studies of this environmentally important process.  Key questions that may &lt;br/&gt;be addressed in future studies include: 1) how is the stable methane molecule activated in &lt;br/&gt;the  absence  of  oxygen?,  2)  can  this  chemistry  be  applied  to  methane  cracking  in  an &lt;br/&gt;industrial setting?, 3) what is the evolutionary history of anaerobic methane oxidation and &lt;br/&gt;how does it relate to the evolution of Earth.s climate system?, and 4) is the physiology of &lt;br/&gt;the isolate consistent with environmental observations of anaerobic methane oxidation?  &lt;br/&gt;Understanding the physiology of these organisms and isolating them in the laboratory are &lt;br/&gt;the first steps in answering these and other important questions.</AbstractNarration>
