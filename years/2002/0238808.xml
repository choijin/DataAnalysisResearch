<AbstractNarration>This CAREER award to Professor Paul Edmiston of the College of Wooster, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry  Program, focuses on the development of molecularly imprinted optical sensors to selectively detect gas and solution phase high-explosives. Professor Edmiston and his undergraduate students will use a hybrid covalent/non-covalent molecular imprinting strategy to prepare binding sites in porous sol-gel materials. Binding by analytes such as trinitrotoluene (TNT) to these materials will be detected by a change in fluorescence or absorbance of solvatochromic optical probes directly attached to sites adjacent to the imprinted binding pockets.  These imprinted sol-gel materials will be deposited as thin films on integrated optical waveguides to provide fast response times without a loss in sensitivity.  Imprinted sol-gels will also be used to construct solid-phase microextraction devices for field sampling applications that will be compatible with existing HPLC and GC/MS technologies.  The forensic science aspect of the research will be a central feature of educational and outreach activities to non-science major undergraduates and pre-college students.  New laboratory experiences for non-science majors will be developed that allow these students to be involved in the process of scientific research. College of Wooster chemistry students will be integral to outreach activities targeting inner-city Cleveland and rural high school students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The long term goal of this project is develop simple, inexpensive, but highly sensitive sensing technologies to quickly detect explosives such as TNT.  The presence of explosives will be observed by optical means.  The obvious forensic applications of the project will be used as a focal point to expose non-science majors to chemical research.  In combination with these activities, an outreach program for high school students (already in its beginning stages) will be expanded that allows undergraduate chemistry majors to interact with the participants by demonstrating modern analytical techniques used in forensics and chemical research.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
