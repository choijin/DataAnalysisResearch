    <AbstractNarration>Fang-Hua Lin, NYU Courant Institute. DMS-0201443&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The first part of this proposal is to study the dynamics and the&lt;br/&gt;stability of topological singularities in several concrete cases including&lt;br/&gt;:magnetic vortices in the Landau-Lefschitz equations(Schrodinger and wave&lt;br/&gt;maps coupled with magnetic fields),vortices and vortex rings in the trapped&lt;br/&gt;dilute Bose-Einstein condensates(certain nonlinear Schrodinger systems&lt;br/&gt;coupled with potentials).The second part of the proposal is concerned with&lt;br/&gt;topological singularities of Sobolev mappings.We shall examine the effects&lt;br/&gt;of singularities on the denisity of smooth maps,the topology of mapping&lt;br/&gt;spaces,the regularity and singularity of various energy minimizers.Of&lt;br/&gt;particular interest is the global structures of singular sets and asymptotic &lt;br/&gt;behavior of energy minimizers near such topological singularities.&lt;br/&gt; Many interesting natural phenomena contain some sort singular behavior&lt;br/&gt;and they are often manifiested through energy concentrations.Singularities&lt;br/&gt;of solutions of partial differential equations which describe these&lt;br/&gt;phenomena are,therefore,an important part of facets.We propose here to&lt;br/&gt;establish a rigourous mathematical theory concerning probabilly a most&lt;br/&gt;important class of such singularities ,topological singularity.Topological&lt;br/&gt;singularities arise in many physical problems and have been an important&lt;br/&gt;subject of much study over past many years.Among known examples are&lt;br/&gt;magnetic bubbles in a fereomagnetic(or anti-ferromagnetic)continuum,vortices &lt;br/&gt;in Bose-Einstein condensates and superconductivity,topological defects in&lt;br/&gt;liquid crystals,as well as skyrminors,monopoles and instantons which are&lt;br/&gt;particle like solutions in generic models of high energy physics.These&lt;br/&gt;singularities not only carry definite topological informations but also&lt;br/&gt;quantified amount of energies.Because of this they are often more&lt;br/&gt;observable and stable energitically and dynamically.Thus a rigourous&lt;br/&gt;mathematical theory for such singularity would be not only mathematically&lt;br/&gt;challenging and interesting but also of fundamental importance in sciences.</AbstractNarration>
