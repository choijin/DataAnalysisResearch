    <AbstractNarration>This project focuses on the study of cold season, subtropical surface cyclones, known as the Kona lows, that occur in the northern Pacific and Atlantic Ocean basins. The Kona lows are responsible for much destructive weather in the Hawaiian Islands. These cyclone systems originate from extratropical upper level shortwaves and then develop and propagate to the lower troposphere in sub-tropical regions. The research will include: 1) building the climatology of the Kona lows and the evolution of their associated large-scale environment, and constructing the composite structure of the Kona lows using the ECMWF reanalysis; 2) studying single cases selected either as a trapped occluded cyclone or an example of cyclogenesis in the tradewind easterlies beneath a strengthening upper tropospheric disturbance. The diagnostics for these cases will employ output from simulations using a mesoscale model; and 3) investigating the energetics of both the composite and the single cases. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will provide insight into the dynamics and thermodynamics of cyclones that bear both extra-tropical and subtropical characteristics. The research will provide good opportunities for graduate studies and thesis topics.</AbstractNarration>
