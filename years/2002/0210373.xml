<AbstractNarration>Mark Oskin&lt;br/&gt;University of Washington&lt;br/&gt;0210373&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quantum computers seem the subject of science fiction, but their tremendous&lt;br/&gt;computational potential is closer than we may think.  Despite significant&lt;br/&gt;practical difficulties, small quantum devices of 5 to 7 bits have been built&lt;br/&gt;in the laboratory.  Silicon technologies promise even greater scalability.&lt;br/&gt;To use these technologies effectively, and help guide quantum device&lt;br/&gt;research, computer architects need to start designing and reasoning about&lt;br/&gt;quantum processors now.  However, two major hurdles stand in the way.&lt;br/&gt;First, compactly describable rules that characterize silicon-based quantum&lt;br/&gt;computing technologies are not known.  Second, there does not exist an&lt;br/&gt;infrastructure to design, test, and evaluate architectural alternatives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant addresses both of these&lt;br/&gt;items.  First, we will formalize the design rules of a widely discussed&lt;br/&gt;and likely quantum device technology.  Second, we have already begun to&lt;br/&gt;develop architectural abstractions for this technology that can be composed&lt;br/&gt;together to form general-purpose quantum information processors.  Third,&lt;br/&gt;using these abstractions we will develop an automated computer aided&lt;br/&gt;design tool that takes a description of a quantum computing architecture and&lt;br/&gt;compiles it to a device library of quantum cells.  Finally, we will&lt;br/&gt;develop a simulator that quickly estimates the cost-performance of quantum&lt;br/&gt;systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These research goals, once accomplished, will serve as foundational&lt;br/&gt;resources for the development of quantum computer architectures.  In&lt;br/&gt;addition, by reasoning about architectures we can begin to find the limits&lt;br/&gt;of current quantum device proposals.  These limits can be turned into&lt;br/&gt;research goals, items that further quantum device research needs to&lt;br/&gt;overcome.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
