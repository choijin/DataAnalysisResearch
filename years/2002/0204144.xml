<AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological Informatics for fiscal year 2002.  The fellowship supports research and training at the postdoctoral level at the intersection of biology and the informational, computational, mathematical, and statistical sciences. The goal of the fellowship is to provide training to a young scientist in preparation for a career in biological informatics in which research and education will be integrated. There is an increasing need for training in biological informatics at all occupational levels, and it is expected that Fellows trained through these fellowships will play important roles in training the future workforce.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The title of the research and training plan is "Investigation of factors influencing large-scale ecological &lt;br/&gt;and evolutionary patterns among Caribbean Anolis lizards."  The research investigates macroecological patterns of body size, abundance, and character displacement in Caribbean Anolis lizards from a phylogenetic perspective.  It integrates phylogenetic information on approximately 140 species, morphological data from &lt;br/&gt;specimens in museum collections from nearly 7,000 study sites, and landscape data from Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to examine factors influencing the diversification of these lizards.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
