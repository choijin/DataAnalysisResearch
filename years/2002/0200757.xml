<AbstractNarration>This award supports the research of Michaela Vancliff to work in&lt;br/&gt;non-commutative algebra, with special emphasis on problems arising &lt;br/&gt;from the theory of regular algebras and non-commutative algebraic &lt;br/&gt;geometry. Vancliff's main objective is to add to the body of knowledge&lt;br/&gt;on regular algebras and to further the existing geometric techniques.&lt;br/&gt;In particular, she is interested in the graded-module category of such&lt;br/&gt;an algebra viewed as a geometric space, with certain graded modules &lt;br/&gt;playing the role of geometric objects. The linear geometric modules &lt;br/&gt;(point modules, line modules, etc) are parametrized by so-called &lt;br/&gt;linear schemes. Vancliff plans to study how the structure and role of&lt;br/&gt;higher-dimensional linear schemes generalize the structure and role of&lt;br/&gt;point schemes. She is also interested in connections between this type&lt;br/&gt;of geometric analysis and that of various Poisson-geometric &lt;br/&gt;structures. Some of these activities entail the development of &lt;br/&gt;fundamental computational algorithms, and their implementation using &lt;br/&gt;a computer-algebra package, in order to enable explicit computation of&lt;br/&gt;linear schemes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Systems of polynomial-style equations and their solutions play a &lt;br/&gt;critical role in almost every scientific field, such as statistical &lt;br/&gt;mechanics, elementary-particle physics, quantum mechanics, robotics, &lt;br/&gt;crystallography, networking, etc. The solutions are often results that&lt;br/&gt;cannot be found by experimentation nor other methods, and often they &lt;br/&gt;are not numbers but are functions (e.g., differential operators or &lt;br/&gt;matrices), and so, in general, they do not commute. The business of &lt;br/&gt;seeking methods that find all solutions to any system of &lt;br/&gt;polynomial-style equations in non-commuting variables is called &lt;br/&gt;non-commutative algebra. The main idea to find the solutions is as &lt;br/&gt;follows. One associates to such a system of equations an abstract &lt;br/&gt;object called an algebra, which encodes all the properties of the &lt;br/&gt;system. To the algebra is associated abstract objects called modules,&lt;br/&gt;and these encode all the properties of the solutions. Hence, in order&lt;br/&gt;to find all the solutions, one should find and understand all the &lt;br/&gt;modules for the associated algebra.  In many of the applications, the&lt;br/&gt;algebras that arise in this way tend to share certain properties; they&lt;br/&gt;are called regular algebras and are the main focus of Vancliff's&lt;br/&gt;projects. One of the goals of non-commutative algebraic geometry, the&lt;br/&gt;subfield in which Vancliff works, is to use geometric techniques to &lt;br/&gt;find some of the modules (point modules, line modules, etc) of the &lt;br/&gt;regular algebra, and then to use those modules to find the modules &lt;br/&gt;giving the solutions to the original system of equations. Vancliff's &lt;br/&gt;underlying goal is to improve on these geometric techniques and to &lt;br/&gt;understand better how they relate to the structure of the category of&lt;br/&gt;modules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
