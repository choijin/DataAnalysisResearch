<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of Kentucky will to establish a demonstration project called the Girls&lt;br/&gt;in Science Program (GIS), to encourage young women from rural southeastern Appalachian&lt;br/&gt;Kentucky to pursue careers in science, math, engineering and technology (SMET). This three-&lt;br/&gt;year project, to begin in September 2002, targets 120 girls entering the seventh-grade &lt;br/&gt;from 21 rural Kentucky Appalachian counties, parents of these girls, and a minimum of &lt;br/&gt;30 rural Kentucky Appalachian middle school teachers from these 21 county school &lt;br/&gt;districts. This project targets a select group of middle school girls with a program that &lt;br/&gt;involves: 1) Weeklong Summer Institutes for each girl at the University of Kentucky campus&lt;br/&gt;for two years, 2) Saturday/After-school sessions throughout two academic school years,&lt;br/&gt;and 3) Mentoring relationships with University scientists and community mentors. The &lt;br/&gt;project also the project targets middle school math and science teachers through &lt;br/&gt;professional development courses focused on engaging each girl in science and math for &lt;br/&gt;two years. This project will include parental involvement with a series of workshops.&lt;br/&gt;The project team will also develop and disseminate a model middle school curriculum &lt;br/&gt;manual focused on institutionalizing the program in rural Appalachian Kentucky.  Girls and&lt;br/&gt;teachers who enroll in the program will be the primary beneficiaries; however, the program &lt;br/&gt;is designed to have a broad-based impact on other students, teachers, relatives, and &lt;br/&gt;ultimately rural Kentucky and Appalachia.</AbstractNarration>
