<AbstractNarration>The goal of this research is to elaborate an elegant and comprehensive &lt;br/&gt;specification language and semantics for interactive computational &lt;br/&gt;problems and explore the corresponding logic, --- the set of valid &lt;br/&gt;principles of interactive computability expressible in that language. &lt;br/&gt;Such a logic provides us with a powerful tool for systematically &lt;br/&gt;studying computational tasks and automatically generating solutions to &lt;br/&gt;new problems from known solutions to old problems. Other applications &lt;br/&gt;include the possibility to base on this logic knowledge- and resource-&lt;br/&gt;oriented automatic reasoning systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intuitive notion of interactive computational problem is formalized &lt;br/&gt;as a game between two players: the machine and the environment (user). &lt;br/&gt;Moves of the game represent actions/choices by these agents, and &lt;br/&gt;positions represent states/situations that emerge in the course of &lt;br/&gt;interaction. A game is considered winnable (and hence the corresponding &lt;br/&gt;problem solvable), if there is a computer program that wins it against &lt;br/&gt;any possible environment.  The language of the logic of interactive &lt;br/&gt;computational problems suggested by the investigator is a non-disjoint &lt;br/&gt;union of the languages of classical, intuitionistic and linear logics, &lt;br/&gt;with logical operators interpreted as certain, --- most basic and &lt;br/&gt;natural, --- operations on games. Validity of a formula is understood &lt;br/&gt;as winnability for every game/problem interpretation of its atoms. The &lt;br/&gt;restriction of winnability to the classical fragment of the language &lt;br/&gt;turns out to be equivalent to the classical concept of truth, which &lt;br/&gt;makes classical logic a natural syntactic fragment of the logic of &lt;br/&gt;interactive computational problems. The same is conjectured to be the &lt;br/&gt;case for the intuitionistic logic and (a version of) linear logic. This &lt;br/&gt;way, the logic of interactive computational problems can unify, within &lt;br/&gt;the framework of one general semantics, the classical, intuitionistic &lt;br/&gt;and linear logics, with their seemingly unrelated or even antagonistic &lt;br/&gt;philosophies. Verifying this conjecture, along with finding an &lt;br/&gt;axiomatization for the logic of interactive computational problems, is &lt;br/&gt;among the main technical objectives of this research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
