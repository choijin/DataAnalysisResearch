<AbstractNarration>The Principal Investigator studies fundamental groups and absolute&lt;br/&gt;Galois groups of varieties, especially in finite characteristic.  In&lt;br/&gt;particular, he investigates the fundamental groups of affine curves over&lt;br/&gt;an algebraically closed field of finite characteristic; the absolute&lt;br/&gt;Galois groups of function fields of curves over non-algebraically closed&lt;br/&gt;fields of finite characteristic; and the fundamental groups and absolute&lt;br/&gt;Galois groups of higher dimensional varieties over algebraically closed&lt;br/&gt;fields of arbitrary characteristic.  This study is in large part guided&lt;br/&gt;by possible generalizations of Abhyankar's Conjecture for curves, which&lt;br/&gt;the Principal Investigator has proven.  A major goal is to determine the&lt;br/&gt;properties of the fundamental groups and absolute Galois groups in&lt;br/&gt;question, and to determine which finite groups are quotients of these&lt;br/&gt;profinite groups, in order to obtain greater insight into the algebra&lt;br/&gt;and geometry of these spaces.  Methods include formal patching,&lt;br/&gt;embedding problems, cohomology, valuation theory, and group theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The area of this project relates aspects of algebra and geometry in a&lt;br/&gt;way that makes it possible to solve problems that would be intractible&lt;br/&gt;in either field alone.  The linkage between the algebra and geometry&lt;br/&gt;arises from geometric spaces that are defined by algebraic equations. &lt;br/&gt;These spaces can have complicated patterns of symmetry, which manifest&lt;br/&gt;themselves both in the algebra and the geometry.  This project seeks to&lt;br/&gt;understand what types of symmetries can occur in the context of these&lt;br/&gt;spaces, and how spaces with one type of symmetry can relate to a given&lt;br/&gt;space with another type of symmetry.  These spaces are in many cases&lt;br/&gt;defined with respect to an algebraic system in which a particular prime&lt;br/&gt;number plays a special role; and the properties of those spaces can be&lt;br/&gt;interpreted as giving information about the solvability of equations&lt;br/&gt;involving prime numbers.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
