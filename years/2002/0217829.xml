<AbstractNarration>0217829&lt;br/&gt;Ojo&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a three-year collaborative research project between Professor Joseph O. Ojo, with the Department of Electrical Engineering at Tennessee Technological University, and Professor Michael O. Omoigui, with the Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering at Obafemi Awolowo University in Nigeria.  The investigators will study power flow control and stability improvement in longitudinal power systems using power flow controllers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Electric power systems in many developing countries are usually small and radial/longitudinal with little connectivity, making them operate like isolated systems.  They are susceptible to lengthy time interruptions, fluctuations in voltage currents, and poor voltage regulation, and as a result the transmission and distribution systems are generally overloaded.  Nigeria is moving away from the more traditional mechanical power systems towards a more electronic system that will use converter-based devices, which can then offer greater flexibility and improved operation.  The investigators will develop models for the power systems, and use them to analyze the power systems' performance using a unified power flow controller under varying conditions.  As part of the project, they will study the use of multi-terminal, converter-based power flow controller topologies to improve power flow capability and enhance the voltage system stability of weak and longitudinal power systems, especially in a deregulated environment.  This project combines Dr. Ojo's expertise in power electronics with Dr. Omoigui's knowledge of power system analysis and control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Currently in the United States little study is being done on the unique problems of small and longitudinal power systems, but they will become increasingly important as more US power systems become deregulated.  It is anticipated that the results of this project will provide viable and efficient solutions to perennial power system disturbances that are common in longitudinal power systems.  Both investigators have a strong record in graduate education, and they also expect that a significant amount of knowledge transfer will occur among their students as a result of this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Office of International Science and Engineering and the Division of Electrical and Communications Systems are jointly supporting this project.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
