    <AbstractNarration>A grant has been awarded to the University of Connecticut under the direction of Dr. Linda Strausbaugh to acquire multiple instruments for genomics-related research and education.&lt;br/&gt;Recent years have witnessed milestones in genetics research as the scientific community has developed advanced methods for the sequencing and analysis of the genomes of humans and other model organisms. These collective accomplishments herald a new era in genomics-related research and training, providing unparalleled opportunities for new avenues of investigation. It is the goal of this project to transport genome project paradigms to the study of a wide range of important research topics and organisms, and to train students at all levels in the theory and practice of genomics research. The instruments acquired in this project will provide the framework necessary to accomplish these goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Specific research problems to be addressed fall into three current areas of interdisciplinary research strengths and one newly emerging area that builds upon these three foundations. Scientists from Genetics and Animal Sciences will address problems in Chromosomes and Mechanisms of Expression that focus upon how structural features of the genome influence expression in the context of development, aging, and genome changes. Scientists from Microbiology, Engineering and Plant Science will conduct research in Environmental Biotechnology by using genomic information and genetic engineering to study the complex interactions between microorganisms and their environments. Researchers in Evolutionary Biology, Molecular Biology, Civil Engineering and Computer Science will conduct research projects in Molecular Evolution and Comparative Genomics to better understand the molecular changes that accompany adaptation and evolutionary histories of organisms. In an emerging, highly interdisciplinary area, scientists from these three areas of research will join forces with Forensic Scientists to advance DNA typing research by innovative applications of genomics and new technology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The genomics-related accomplishments in research and training made possible by this project have significance on many levels. At the most basic level, knowledge of the structure, function and expression of relatively poorly understood components of the genetic blue prints of many plants, animals, and microorganisms will be gained. This knowledge will be applied to several pressing problems facing contemporary society, such as: the need to understand the responses of living systems to environmental or genomic stress and aging; the requirements for remediation of contaminated sites; and the necessity of expanding the spectrum of environmental conditions under which plant growth may be sustained. Equally important to its role in research, this project is also a key part of a research-intensive learning environment for undergraduates, students in two new and innovative professional master's programs in genomics and microbiology, and doctoral candidates. Ties to more practical applications should attract students from diverse populations. The advanced, state-of-the-art training possible under this project will help meet the demands for a highly skilled workforce required in a multitude of genomics-related applications from pharmaceuticals to agriculture to forensics.</AbstractNarration>
