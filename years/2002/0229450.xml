<AbstractNarration>9877118&lt;br/&gt;Chen&lt;br/&gt;MIT&lt;br/&gt;Study of Natural Ventilation in Buildings by Large Eddy Simulation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;U.S. buildings use about onethird of the total energy used in the nation, and&lt;br/&gt;the Heating, Ventilating, and Air Conditioning (HVAQ systems in the buildings&lt;br/&gt;use a major part of it. The use of HVAC systems does not necessarily create a&lt;br/&gt;more comfortable and healthy indoor environment. On the other hand, natural&lt;br/&gt;ventilation generally improves indoor air quality, provides the occupants a&lt;br/&gt;high comfort level, and saves the energy used by the HVAC systems. The U.S. has&lt;br/&gt;a great potential to use natural ventilation. In many regions in the U.S., no&lt;br/&gt;air-conditioning system is needed during the summer with proper natural&lt;br/&gt;ventilation. This will save the first costs of the airconditioning systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall objectives of the proposed research are to develop a reliable&lt;br/&gt;method to study natural ventilation in buildings, and to study the impact of&lt;br/&gt;the thermal and geometrical conditions in buildings on natural ventilation. &lt;br/&gt;The empirical data and equations available in literature are not suitable for&lt;br/&gt;accurate estimation of natural ventilation. The study of natural ventilation&lt;br/&gt;requires either experimental measurements or computer simulations. The&lt;br/&gt;experimental approach needs a wind tunnel to study the airflow around buildings&lt;br/&gt;and a full-scale environmental chamber to study the airflow in buildings.&lt;br/&gt;Although the approach can generate reliable data, it is expensive and time&lt;br/&gt;consuming. The computational approach includes Direct Numerical Simulation&lt;br/&gt;(DNS), Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equation modeling and Large Eddy&lt;br/&gt;Simulation (LES). DNS requires a computer not available at present. RANS is not&lt;br/&gt;accurate enough and cannot predict single-side natural ventilation. Only LES&lt;br/&gt;seems most appropriate for natural ventilation study.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigation will develop a reliable Sub-Grid-Scale model for LES. The new&lt;br/&gt;SGS model will be validated by the experimental data from the literature and an&lt;br/&gt;environmental chamber. Then the validated LES model will be used to study the&lt;br/&gt;impact of thermal and geometrical conditions of a building on natural&lt;br/&gt;ventilation. The thermal conditions to be studied are:  forced convection (no&lt;br/&gt;thermal buoyancy); natural convection (no wind); and mixed convection (the&lt;br/&gt;momentum force due to the wind is comparable to the buoyant force due to the&lt;br/&gt;heat gain in the building and the solar radiation on the outside of the&lt;br/&gt;building).  The geometrical conditions to be studied are cross natural&lt;br/&gt;ventilation (an indoor space with openings in two or more walls) and&lt;br/&gt;single-side natural ventilation (an indoor space with only one opening)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The LES program will calculate instantaneous and averaged distributions of air&lt;br/&gt;pressure, air velocity, air temperature, and contaminant concentrations, such&lt;br/&gt;as CO 2, in and around the building. The study is to understand how momentum&lt;br/&gt;and buoyancy forces can change the airflow pattern and pressure distribution&lt;br/&gt;around the building and how natural ventilation is interacted with the building&lt;br/&gt;opening location. The results are useful to determine the ventilation rate as a&lt;br/&gt;function of the flow Reynolds and Grashof numbers. Measurements in a wind&lt;br/&gt;tunnel at a Taiwanese university and in the environmental chamber will be&lt;br/&gt;conducted to further validate the computed results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Chinese university will conduct on site measurements in an actual apartment&lt;br/&gt;building in Beijing. The LES model will be used to simulate the situations&lt;br/&gt;measured on site. The LES results are useful to analyze the impact of wind&lt;br/&gt;velocity and direction on natural ventilation, the impact of thermal buoyancy&lt;br/&gt;on natural ventilation, and the feasibility to design single-side ventilation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LES should be a next-generation tool to study natural ventilation in buildings.&lt;br/&gt;The results of this project will provide detailed and accurate information to&lt;br/&gt;analyze indoor air quality and thermal comfort in buildings with natural&lt;br/&gt;ventilation. The results present a scientific basis to architects and HVAC&lt;br/&gt;engineers to design healthy and comfortable buildings and to save energy used&lt;br/&gt;by the HVAC systems. This will increase occupants' productivity and efficiency.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
