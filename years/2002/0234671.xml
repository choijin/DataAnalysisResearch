<AbstractNarration>The project will provide undergraduate engineering students the opportunity to design build and test small-scale control systems that represent processes encountered in engineering practice.  The proposed instructional system follows the model of electrical or mechanical breadboard systems, and integrates the two in novel ways.  The approach will be integrated into every level of the curriculum using hands-on, team based design activities; enhancing the design education experience for freshmen, and will continue through to the senior capstone experience.  The students will work on real world problems with industrial mentors. This system is also expected to significantly enhance the ability of upper level students to design, build and test fully functional process control systems by reducing the time and effort required for system assembly. &lt;br/&gt;Following initial system development and testing, weeklong summer camps for &lt;br/&gt;Eight and ninth grade students will be conducted. Undergraduate student mentors, under faculty supervision, will assist attendees in hands-on design of process control systems. Women and historically underrepresented minority students will be strongly encouraged to attend the camps.  All attendees will be encouraged to pursue engineering careers. A resource guide, including vendor lists, sample design activities and a lessons learned summary will be provided on the WEB. In addition, as the project reaches completion, the guide will be widely distributed to approximately 150, small, to medium sized, agricultural, chemical, and mechanical engineering programs on CD-ROM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
