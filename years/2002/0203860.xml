    <AbstractNarration>Interest in organic solid state chemistry has undergone explosive growth in recent years due to the broadly based recognition of the scientific challenges and technological importance attached to the discovery and study of new organic andpoilymeric materials. Many scientists from other disciplines see opportunities for performing exciting research in this area. The 2002 Electronic Processes in Organic Materials Gordon Research Conference will be held at Salve Regina University, Newport, Rhode Island from July 21-26, 2002. The goal of the conference is to facilitate international collaborations and informatation exchange across a broad spectrum of researchers with interests in solid state organic materials. The NSF funds will be used to support the attendance of 5 graduate students and post-doctoral scholars and 7 senior U.S. session chairs and invited speakers.&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;The Solid State Chemistry community continues to have direct impact on technological areas that are crucial to advancing societal needs through the design, synthesis and application new materials. Specific area in which important advances are being made include organic superconductors, field-effect transisters, lasers, conducting wires, light emitting diodes and semiconductors. J Since these technical areas are of very high priority to industry, students educated and trained in these multidisciplinary areas involving solid-state organic chemistry compete very well in the job market and go on to contribute in many significant ways to the global economy.&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>
