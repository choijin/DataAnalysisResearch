<AbstractNarration>Knessl&lt;br/&gt;0202815&lt;br/&gt;     The investigator, together with colleagues and students,&lt;br/&gt;studies a variety of problems in computer science, information&lt;br/&gt;theory, and applied probability.  These have the common feature&lt;br/&gt;that they can be reduced to solving recursion or differential&lt;br/&gt;equations.  Sometimes these equations can be solved exactly using&lt;br/&gt;transform methods.  Then one can obtain asymptotic information by&lt;br/&gt;expanding the results using methods such as the Laplace or saddle&lt;br/&gt;point methods, the Euler-Maclaurin and Poisson summation&lt;br/&gt;formulas, Watson transformations, etc.  Many applied problems of&lt;br/&gt;interest (especially nonlinear ones) cannot be solved exactly.&lt;br/&gt;For these the investigator and colleagues develop appropriate&lt;br/&gt;asymptotic techniques that analyze directly the governing&lt;br/&gt;equations.  These are variants of applied mathematics methods,&lt;br/&gt;such as WKB expansions and matched asymptotic expansions.  The&lt;br/&gt;latter are especially useful for asymptotic problems that involve&lt;br/&gt;several different scales.  The focus is on problems in&lt;br/&gt;combinatorics, data compression, analysis of algorithms, digital&lt;br/&gt;and binary trees, queuing, and coding.&lt;br/&gt;     Computers play a progressively greater role in all of our&lt;br/&gt;lives.  Important problems in computer science include sorting and&lt;br/&gt;searching, efficient data storage, and data compression.  To&lt;br/&gt;decide on what is a good method to search out a given item in&lt;br/&gt;some database, or a good method for storing music or video with&lt;br/&gt;minimal use of memory, it is important to analyze the method or&lt;br/&gt;algorithm.  For example, one might ask for the average search&lt;br/&gt;time, or for the likelihood that the search time will be very&lt;br/&gt;long, exceeding some prescribed tolerance.  Such questions involve&lt;br/&gt;the "analysis of algorithms."   They can frequently be reduced to&lt;br/&gt;solving certain classes of equations.  The investigator and&lt;br/&gt;colleagues develop mathematical tools for obtaining solutions of&lt;br/&gt;these equations, either exact ones or accurate approximations.&lt;br/&gt;Approximations are often sufficient, because for example the&lt;br/&gt;searching problem is most important if the total number of items&lt;br/&gt;stored is very large.  This "largeness" shows up as a parameter in&lt;br/&gt;the governing equation that facilitates its solution.  Related&lt;br/&gt;mathematical problems arise in other important areas such as&lt;br/&gt;molecular biology and communications, and the investigators'&lt;br/&gt;methods and results should thus find applicability to a wide&lt;br/&gt;range of problems.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
