<AbstractNarration>This project focuses on three areas important to the development of polymeric light-emitting di-odes (PLEDs), polymer based photovoltaic devices, and to elucidation of the structure/property relationships that govern the performance of the active polymer layers in these devices. The ap-proach is to develop a new layer-by-layer deposition technique that is compatible with deposition of polymers or oligomers from organic solvents. This deposition technique combines the fine control of device structure now available in LEDs prepared via the evaporation of small organic molecules with the mechanical integrity and solution processability of polymers. The ability to engineer device structure via precise control of several polymeric layers is expected to improve the performance of PLEDs and photovoltaics, and aid in the investigation of the science that un-derpins their performance. Also, the approach includes synthesis of an array of novel polymers and oligomers that will be utilized to build PLEDs and photovoltaic devices with the new layer-by-layer deposition technique. Additionally, fundamental studies of the role that struc-ture/property relationships, such as energetic disorder, play in device performance will be pur-sued. &lt;br/&gt;%%% &lt;br/&gt;The project addresses fundamental research issues in areas of electronic/photonic materials sci-ence having technological relevance. An important feature of the project is the emphasis on edu-cation, and the integration of research and education. The available resources provide special op-portunities for education and training of graduate and undergraduate students in interdisciplinary forefront research.&lt;br/&gt;***  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
