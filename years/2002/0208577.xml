<AbstractNarration>Computational information theory is concerned with techniques (such as&lt;br/&gt;channel coding) for achieving channel capacities.  The field has&lt;br/&gt;achieved dramatic scientific breakthroughs in recent years, and codes&lt;br/&gt;that come close to theoretical limits have been discovered.  Today,&lt;br/&gt;the development of coding and information theory is closely related to&lt;br/&gt;the explosion of information technology, with applications to the&lt;br/&gt;Internet and the next generation of networks technologies.  The rapid&lt;br/&gt;development of a myriad of networked devices for computing and&lt;br/&gt;telecommunications presents new and exciting challenges for coding and&lt;br/&gt;information theory. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will explore interconnections among coding theory,&lt;br/&gt;theoretical computer science, information theory, and related areas of&lt;br/&gt;computer science and mathematics in order to deal with research&lt;br/&gt;challenges arising from optical/magnetic recording and optical&lt;br/&gt;transmission, the interface between information theory and symbolic&lt;br/&gt;dynamics, the development of network information theory, advances in&lt;br/&gt;high speed data transmission in wired channels, the connection between&lt;br/&gt;coding theory and related mathematical approaches (especially using&lt;br/&gt;discrete mathematics), the role of compression in all layers of data&lt;br/&gt;networks, and exploiting the connections between algorithmic&lt;br/&gt;complexity and notions of entropy and randomness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research efforts will be carried out by ``working groups'' that will&lt;br/&gt;come together at DIMACS for several meetings aimed at catalyzing&lt;br/&gt;communications and collaborations. Subgroups will investigate problems&lt;br/&gt;of interest. The working groups will be concerned with Data&lt;br/&gt;Compression in Networks and Applications and with Optical/Magnetic&lt;br/&gt;Recording and Optical Transmission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will integrate research and education through a series of&lt;br/&gt;workshops aimed at identifying areas for research, involving large&lt;br/&gt;groups of researchers in the field of computational information theory&lt;br/&gt;and coding, and introducing many people (including outstanding junior&lt;br/&gt;people and students) to the field.  Workshops are&lt;br/&gt;planned on the topics of High Speed Data Transmission in Wired&lt;br/&gt;Channels, Network Information Theory, Complexity and Inference,&lt;br/&gt;Information Theory and Symbolic Dynamics, and Coding Theory and&lt;br/&gt;Discrete Mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
