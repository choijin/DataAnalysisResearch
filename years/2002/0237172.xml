<AbstractNarration>Medium temperature DeNOx  processes have been widely utilized throughout the world since the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NO by ammonia is widely recognized as a key chemical transformation for environmental protection. Hoewever, water and sulfur dioxide poisoning are important challenges for SCR catalysts that will be used to process alternative fuels and chemical feedstocks.  Prior work by the principal investigator has demonstrated that Mn/TiO2 is active at temperatures as low as 80 oC and is resistant to water.  Addition of Ni to this catalyst appears promising in order to enhance sulfur dioxide tolerance.  The research will provide a fundamental understanding of Mn-Ni/TiO2 systems based on key mechanistic and spectroscopic investigations.  Transient kinetic methods will be utilized in order to provide new insights into the reactions pathways and to establish the basis for high selectivity.  The principal investigator will also use advanced instrumentation capabilities such as in situ FTIR spectroscopy with labeled compounds to determine adsorbed species and reactive intermediates.  Other surface analysis techniques are skillfully incorporated into the proposed work.  The combination of approaches is characteristic of excellent, modern catalysis research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this research include education of students in advanced catalysis and characterization techniques and involvement in relevant technological applications.  Students will be involved in poster and paper presentations and in preparation of numerous publications.   The principal investigator is committed to recruiting under-represented minorities for the research program, including working with a new ethnic engineering office at the University of Cincinnati.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
