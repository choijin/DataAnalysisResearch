<AbstractNarration>Engineering of InAs Quantum Dot Ensembles Using Interference of Optical&lt;br/&gt;Surface Waves&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses the problem of inhomogeneous broadening of the size&lt;br/&gt;distribution of quantum dot (QD) epitaxial semiconductor ensembles formed&lt;br/&gt;via a stress-driven Volmer-Weber or Stranski-Krastanov growth mechanism. The&lt;br/&gt;uniformity and narrow size distribution of the QDs are the major challenges&lt;br/&gt;for the utilization of QD structures in optoelectronic devices. The primary&lt;br/&gt;goal of this proposal is to evaluate the feasibility of nanoscale control of&lt;br/&gt;the nucleation process of InAs QDs on a GaAs surface using the interference&lt;br/&gt;of the optical surface waves. The interference pattern will be generated on&lt;br/&gt;the surface of the substrate using a pulsed UV laser during the growth of&lt;br/&gt;QDs by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). The pattern, with a typical period of&lt;br/&gt;few hundred nm, will be created using two different optical schemes based&lt;br/&gt;on: (i) the interference of the incident wave with the scattered coherent&lt;br/&gt;surface wave; and (ii) the interference of the incident waves with two&lt;br/&gt;surface waves coupled to the split laser beams. The optical interference&lt;br/&gt;pattern will modulate periodically the surface properties of the substrate&lt;br/&gt;at 100-200 nm level. The nucleation of QDs will be controlled through either&lt;br/&gt;substrate temperature modulation, thereby destroying the nucleation clusters&lt;br/&gt;in the antinode of the standing wave pattern, or through undulation of the&lt;br/&gt;surface by laser ablation to control the surface energy. The 100-nm&lt;br/&gt;modulation scale is expected to form a template for initial QD nucleation,&lt;br/&gt;and the subsequent evolution of the QD ensemble will be driven&lt;br/&gt;thermodynamically towards higher density of dots, (3-10)e10 cm-2. The&lt;br/&gt;important features of the in-situ optical impact are that it does not leave&lt;br/&gt;any residues on the surface, can be conducted during the growth process, and&lt;br/&gt;can be adjusted to introduce the minimum defect density.&lt;br/&gt;We will systematically investigate the factors (growth temperature, As flux,&lt;br/&gt;growth rate, laser power, etc.) that provide uniform and narrow QD&lt;br/&gt;distribution and efficient luminescence. The samples grown using optically&lt;br/&gt;controlled nucleation will be studied by the in-situ RHEED, as well as STM,&lt;br/&gt;TEM and photoluminescence methods to reveal the correlations between growth&lt;br/&gt;parameters, and the structure and properties of the QD systems. The&lt;br/&gt;laboratories at the Institute have all the necessary equipment for the QD&lt;br/&gt;characterization. This includes state-of-the-art field-emission ultra-high&lt;br/&gt;resolution TEM, focused ion beam station, surface analysis tools, five STM&lt;br/&gt;tools configured for different imaging modes and environment including&lt;br/&gt;ultra-high vacuum, and unique ultrasonic force microscope.&lt;br/&gt;The successful completion of the proposed work would have a significant&lt;br/&gt;impact on the performance of various optoelectronic components. The method&lt;br/&gt;will allow the growth of QD structures with sharp size distribution and high&lt;br/&gt;radiative recombination efficiency. For example, the QD structures will be&lt;br/&gt;used as active media for laser diodes with superior performance&lt;br/&gt;characteristics, such as higher efficiency, higher thermal stability, higher&lt;br/&gt;modulation frequency and increased reliability. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
