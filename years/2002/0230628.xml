<AbstractNarration>PROPOSAL NO.: 0230628&lt;br/&gt;PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Goldsman, Neil&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION NAME: University of Maryland College Park&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: A Multidisciplinary Integrated Capstone Design Curriculum for Electrical and Computer Engineering&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at the University&lt;br/&gt;of Maryland at College Park (UMCP) is in the process of planning a major curriculum&lt;br/&gt;revision for its undergraduate program.  This planning grant will address the Capstone design&lt;br/&gt;program, which will be greatly revised to provide a multidisciplinary design experience&lt;br/&gt;for senior students and to integrate juniors and sophomores into the Capstone experience.&lt;br/&gt;The team  will assess the outcomes of the Capstone experience to generate data to guide the revision of our curriculum in general.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A major objective of the Capstone design courses is for the students to work on a&lt;br/&gt;design project at a professional level. The project makes use of most of the knowledge&lt;br/&gt;that students have acquired in the previous two to three years of the ECE curriculum.&lt;br/&gt;Therefore, the outcome of the Capstone design experience should be an excellent&lt;br/&gt;indicator of the how well the education process in the ECE Department is preparing&lt;br/&gt;students for their professional career. A year-to-year assessment of the outcomes of the&lt;br/&gt;Capstone design courses will enable us to make continuous improvements in the&lt;br/&gt;sophomore, junior, and also the senior year curricula. This being the case, the revision of&lt;br/&gt;the Capstone program will serve as the engine to drive curriculum revision for the entire&lt;br/&gt;ECE program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
