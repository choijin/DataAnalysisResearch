<AbstractNarration>     The investigator aims to complete the nascent theory of&lt;br/&gt;output-sensitive algorithms in real algebraic geometry.&lt;br/&gt;Output-sensitive in this context means that the complexity of the&lt;br/&gt;underlying algorithm depends mainly on intrinsic geometric&lt;br/&gt;parameters, e.g., the number of connected components of the&lt;br/&gt;underlying solution set, as opposed to extrinsic parameters like&lt;br/&gt;the degrees of the input polynomials.  Such algorithms are faster&lt;br/&gt;than the traditional methods of computational algebra by a factor&lt;br/&gt;exponential in the dimension, but have so far been discovered&lt;br/&gt;only in various isolated contexts.  So a unified algorithmic&lt;br/&gt;approach has a broad impact.  Furthermore, the underlying&lt;br/&gt;approach takes numerical conditioning into account from the&lt;br/&gt;outset, thus providing algorithms that are certifiably precise&lt;br/&gt;even when applied to approximate data.  Another novelty is that&lt;br/&gt;the underlying theory applies in the even broader arena of real&lt;br/&gt;and p-adic analytic functions.  The algorithmic aspects of p-adic&lt;br/&gt;analytic functions are almost completely unexplored, so a&lt;br/&gt;secondary focus of this project is to elaborate and apply this&lt;br/&gt;new theory to equation-solving over finite fields and motivic&lt;br/&gt;integration.&lt;br/&gt;     The investigator combines advanced techniques from numerical&lt;br/&gt;analysis and algebraic geometry to provide a new approach to a&lt;br/&gt;fundamental problem occuring in many applications: solving&lt;br/&gt;analytic inequalities.  For example, finding the optimal&lt;br/&gt;allocation of resources in a large organization (e.g., an army,&lt;br/&gt;an airline, or a large business) has long been known to reduce to&lt;br/&gt;solving linear inequalities.  From a different direction, it is&lt;br/&gt;known that the complexity of certain neural net architectures&lt;br/&gt;(which are useful in training automated bomb-sniffers and pattern&lt;br/&gt;recognition systems) depends critically on understanding the&lt;br/&gt;solutions of nonlinear polynomial inequalities.  Both these&lt;br/&gt;examples are special cases of analytic inequalities, and this&lt;br/&gt;project provides new algorithms for their solution that are&lt;br/&gt;magnitudes faster than current algorithms.  Furthermore, these&lt;br/&gt;new algorithms provide certifiably precise solutions --- a&lt;br/&gt;feature which is especially important when facing uncertain&lt;br/&gt;physical data.  Another novel aspect is the principal&lt;br/&gt;investigator's recent discovery that the underlying techniques&lt;br/&gt;apply to an even broader context, which can provide new solutions&lt;br/&gt;to many problems in the design of cryptosystems.</AbstractNarration>
