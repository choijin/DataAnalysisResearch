<AbstractNarration>This award is for the acquisition of an instrumented low to medium-velocity impact testing equipment (Instron Dynatup Model 8250HV Impact Test System).  The equipment will be used to enhance the research capability in the areas of mechanics of composite materials and structural mechanics, particular for aeronautics and aerospace engineering applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This acquisition will have a broad impact on improving research environment of Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University (ERAU), which is an undergraduate institution. A multi-disciplinary research team is formed with five investigators from four engineering and technology departments.  Several on-going as well as planed research projects will be conducted using this equipment, including "Damage Identification for Laminated Composites Caused by Low Velocity Impact Using C-scan NDT," "Impact Damage Detection on Filament Wound Pressure Vessels Using Acoustic Emission," "Impact Response of New Cross Cell Sandwich Panels," and "Impact Behavior of Modified Adhesive Bonded Joints." &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This acquisition will also have a significant impact on professional development of the investigators.  Three of the five investigators are junior faculty members.  Although they have demonstrated some success in their respective research areas, they have not yet established reputations in their research fields.  This has also reduced their competitiveness in external funding solicitations. This award will provide them a much-needed equipment for their research activities and eventually makes them more competitive in research funding solicitations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; While the main purpose of acquiring this impact equipment is to enhance the capability of ERAU in advanced materials and structures research programs, this acquisition will have an extensive impact to strengthen the educational quality of the university both at the undergraduate and graduate levels.  With this advanced impact equipment, the investigators will be able to conduct more research projects.  Students in the involved departments will be exposed to the most current research progress in the field.  Such an exposure will significantly enhance the departments' capability to prepare students for entry into advanced degree programs and/or careers in aerospace/aeronautical science and engineering.  The increased research activities by the investigators will also provide an excellent opportunity to directly train our students by involving them in these projects through research assistant programs (both undergraduate and graduate).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
