<AbstractNarration>The proposed research is in the area of geometry and&lt;br/&gt;dynamics. The objective is to understand the asymptotic behavior&lt;br/&gt;of orbits of dynamical systems. One specific problem deals with&lt;br/&gt;surface laminations in hyperbolic three-manifolds. Rather than&lt;br/&gt;studying recurrence phenomena taking place in a compact space a&lt;br/&gt;global approach is taken. The geometry of hyperbolic space has a&lt;br/&gt;well defined visual boundary representing the many possible ways&lt;br/&gt;of diverging to infinity. Moreover, the ambient hyperbolic&lt;br/&gt;geometry affects the geometry of the leaves of the lamination&lt;br/&gt;under consideration. The basic problem is then to study how these&lt;br/&gt;geometries relate with respect to their approach to the visual&lt;br/&gt;boundaries, and to examine the influence that the ambient&lt;br/&gt;hyperbolic geometry exerts on the leaves.  Within this program it&lt;br/&gt;is also natural to consider laminations whose leaves have&lt;br/&gt;stronger geometric or analytic properties, or both, as for&lt;br/&gt;example when they satisfy the minimal surface differential&lt;br/&gt;equation. Such hypothesis allows for the use of analytical and&lt;br/&gt;probabilistic tools, and more precise information can be&lt;br/&gt;obtained. Laminations whose leaves are minimal surfaces are also&lt;br/&gt;relevant to understand the geometry of other three-manifolds as&lt;br/&gt;well. They appear to play an important role in the topological&lt;br/&gt;hyperbolization conjecture for three-manifolds, as is known that&lt;br/&gt;non-hyperbolic three manifolds have a lamination by minimal&lt;br/&gt;surfaces.  This proposal also includes problems in the area of&lt;br/&gt;rigidity of actions of semisimple groups. The main focus is in&lt;br/&gt;the so-called Gromov's centralizer theorem, a major tool in&lt;br/&gt;understanding the symmetries of geometric structures on&lt;br/&gt;manifolds. Other questions relating to the structure of&lt;br/&gt;pseudogroups of transformations are also proposed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dynamical systems are used to model processes in many areas, for&lt;br/&gt;example the weather, physical or chemical processes, and the&lt;br/&gt;evolution of living organisms and their morphology. They are also&lt;br/&gt;used for modeling processes which evolve from a finite amount of&lt;br/&gt;data according to some set of rules, either specified before hand&lt;br/&gt;or of a random nature, as neural networks in the brain or systems&lt;br/&gt;of digital processors in a computer. The objective of the&lt;br/&gt;proposed research is to understand the qualitative structure and&lt;br/&gt;asymptotic behavior of certain dynamical systems. One of the&lt;br/&gt;topics in this proposal is to study the behavior of&lt;br/&gt;two-dimensional systems evolving in a three-dimensional space,&lt;br/&gt;and specifically the interaction of the features of the&lt;br/&gt;surrounding space and the geometry and asymptotic behavior of&lt;br/&gt;their trajectories. This can be approached in a variety of ways:&lt;br/&gt;by purely geometric means, by studying certain differential&lt;br/&gt;equations that define their orbits, or via a probabilistic&lt;br/&gt;approach. Understanding basic features of these dynamical systems&lt;br/&gt;and these spaces, while having intrinsic geometric interest and&lt;br/&gt;beauty, could be relevant, for example, in areas like partial&lt;br/&gt;differential equations, solid state physics, structure of&lt;br/&gt;crystals and quasi-crystals and their defects, statistical&lt;br/&gt;mechanics, computation and algorithms.</AbstractNarration>
