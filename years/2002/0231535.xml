<AbstractNarration>Network Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are one of several tools used by security professionals to detect and respond to security breaches.  Typically an IDS is implemented by tapping a network and diverting a copy of every network message to a sensor. Usually, the sensor is a general-purpose computer running software that examines every packet that it receives. This approach to IDS is easy to implement as it relies on off-the-shelf hardware and software. However, the overhead incurred by the general-purpose operating system and the limited I/O throughput of most PC and workstation architectures restrict such IDS to low and medium bandwidth networks. Special-purpose IDS platforms, on the other hand, can be optimized to handle high-bandwidth traffic, but the lack of flexibility and the high cost of custom hardware and software make this approach not viable in practice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recently, parallel and distributed IDS architectures exist that operate on high bandwidth traffic by distributing network packets over a number of general-purpose machines. This approach combines the flexibility of off-the-shelf hardware and software with the high performance of parallel processing. A systematic study of the scalability of this approach as well as an analysis of suitable packet distribution strategies has not been done. Because such clustered architectures pay a potential penalty in terms of space and power required as they are essentially a set of complete computer systems that occupy shelf or rack space, consume power, and require time consuming management and configuration they have space and power costs that are high.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to develop a scalable parallel appliance-based architecture for network intrusion detection systems that is able to reliably monitor high-bandwidth network segments, yet is cost-efficient and retains the flexibility of general-purpose based IDS. High performance is achieved by distributing network traffic among an array of low-cost sensors in a way that does not impact the quality of intrusion detection, while maximizing the available concurrency and minimizing required communication among sensors. Utilizing off-the-shelf single-board computers leads to an inexpensive and compact design that requires less power than a comparable number of complete workstations or PCs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The key component of a parallel intrusion detection platform architecture is the approach by which network packets are distributed across the sensors. As a result, the system design will by guided by a systematic analysis of network traffic characteristics which will provide input into high-level models and simulations. To verify and evaluate the performance and scalability of the resulting architecture, a prototype system will be implemented based primarily on low-cost off-the-shelf hardware and software. By addressing IDS issues using off the shelf components, a product to assist in security breaches may be quickly developed.  This could have large, immediate impact on an important network topic.</AbstractNarration>
