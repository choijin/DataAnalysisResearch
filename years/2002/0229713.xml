<AbstractNarration>0229713&lt;br/&gt;Illman&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dense Nonaqueous Phase Liquids (DNAPLs) are prevalent at a large number of &lt;br/&gt;sites throughout the world. The variable release history and geologic &lt;br/&gt;heterogeneity make the distribution of DNAPLs in the source zone complex. &lt;br/&gt;These source zones can contribute to long-term groundwater contamination &lt;br/&gt;for decades to centuries. Therefore, the spatial distribution, mass, and &lt;br/&gt;composition of DNAPLs present in the source zone need to be characterized &lt;br/&gt;in great detail so that efficient remediation schemes can be designed. &lt;br/&gt;During the last few years, many tracer techniques have been introduced to &lt;br/&gt;enhance the characterization of DNAPL source zones. While these tracer &lt;br/&gt;techniques allow for the in situ estimation of volume-averaged values of &lt;br/&gt;DNAPL saturation, there is an urgent need for the development of a &lt;br/&gt;cost-effective technology to characterize the spatial distribution of &lt;br/&gt;DNAPLs at high resolutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of this proposed study are: 1) to develop a &lt;br/&gt;software/hardware package that fuses different types of information using a &lt;br/&gt;stochastic approach to provide a cost-effective characterization, &lt;br/&gt;monitoring, and predictive tool for the DNAPL source zone, 2) to conduct &lt;br/&gt;laboratory experiments to test and verify this proposed technology, and 3) &lt;br/&gt;to distribute the results of the research to assist scientists, engineers, &lt;br/&gt;and managers to solve DNAPL contamination problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;              Intellectual Merit: The proposed new data processing &lt;br/&gt;technique, stochastic information fusion, combines different types of &lt;br/&gt;measurements taken at different locations over different scales in an &lt;br/&gt;iterative manner to provide the best estimate of the DNAPL residual &lt;br/&gt;distribution and its uncertainty.  Specifically, it analyzes the &lt;br/&gt;information derived from hydraulic tomography to identify hydraulic &lt;br/&gt;heterogeneity first in three-dimensions.  It then improves the estimate of &lt;br/&gt;the heterogeneity by incorporating new information acquired from the &lt;br/&gt;conservative tracer tomography.  Afterward, the improved estimate of &lt;br/&gt;hydraulic heterogeneity is used to simulate the hydraulic tomography such &lt;br/&gt;that more detailed information about the response of the subsurface becomes &lt;br/&gt;available. This new information again is fed back to the technique to &lt;br/&gt;update the estimate of hydraulic heterogeneity.  The iterative process &lt;br/&gt;continues until all available information and measurements are fully &lt;br/&gt;utilized in identifying the processes and variables that control the &lt;br/&gt;spatial distribution of DNAPLs.  Upon completion, the newly derived &lt;br/&gt;knowledge of the processes and variables are then combined with data &lt;br/&gt;derived from the partitioning tracer tomography to effectively delineate &lt;br/&gt;the spatial distribution of DNAPL residual saturation in the source &lt;br/&gt;zone.  The proposed tomography technique and the stochastic fusion of &lt;br/&gt;information algorithm are to be tested and validated in a sandbox. Success &lt;br/&gt;of the proposed research advances not only estimation theory in general but &lt;br/&gt;also our technologies for characterizing and monitoring the subsurface.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The proposed stochastic fusion technology can be &lt;br/&gt;integrated with different characterization techniques in diverse geological &lt;br/&gt;conditions. It is also amenable to all stages of DNAPL source zone &lt;br/&gt;characterization including initial screening, site characterization, &lt;br/&gt;remediation, and long-term monitoring.  A web-based virtual &lt;br/&gt;hydraulic/tracer tomography laboratory will be created and be available to &lt;br/&gt;any student, educator, practitioner, and researcher around the world.    We &lt;br/&gt;believe this virtual laboratory will stimulate creativity to revolutionize &lt;br/&gt;not only classical subsurface hydrology but also other disciplines of &lt;br/&gt;hydrologic sciences.  For example, using our stochastic information fusion &lt;br/&gt;technology, one may be able to assimilate meteorological information such &lt;br/&gt;as lighting and precipitation as alternative excitation sources for &lt;br/&gt;tomographic surveys of the subsurface environment at large scalesseeing &lt;br/&gt;into the earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
