<AbstractNarration>Title Integration of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology Research, Education, and Outreach: Systematic Tailoring of Carbon Nanotubes to Designed Electronic Properties&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Investigator Jun Jiao&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sponsor Portland State University&lt;br/&gt;P.O. Box 751&lt;br/&gt;Portland, Oregon 97207-0751&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal aims at the development of an integrated research, education, and outreach program in nanoscience and technology at Portland State University, with an emphasis on carbon nanotube research. The objectives of the proposed research are focused on (i) developing a reliable method for synthesizing carbon nanotubes of controlled properties; (ii) studying the growth mechanisms of various forms of nanotubes as a function of preparation conditions, and establishing the correlation between microstructure and preparation conditions; (iii) investigating the electron field-emission properties of carbon nanotubes in relation to their geometrical configurations; (iv) fabricating individual carbon-nanotube field emitters and exploiting their use as electron sources for electron-beam instruments such as TEM, SEM, and electron-beam lithography systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The innovative aspects of this research are &lt;1&gt; to combine nanotube synthesis, microstructural characterization, electron field-emission measurements, and individual nanotube field emitter fabrications into a single project, and &lt;2&gt; to explore the special requirements of electron-beam instruments, as opposed to flat-panel displays. The effectiveness of this approach is that progress at each stage will provide immediate feedback to advance the improvement of the others. The research program is highly multidisciplinary, involving close collaboration with colleagues in Physics, Chemistry and Electrical Engineering Departments, with Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, and with a local high-tech company (FEI). One Ph.D. graduate student will be trained through this program, in addition to eight undergraduate students and two high school students who will each year be offered opportunities to participate in the research activities. All of them will receive excellent training in preparation for careers in science and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The educational objectives of this program include (i) incorporating research findings to develop a new curriculum. New courses, introducing students to up-to-date knowledge and state-of-the-art techniques, will be developed; (ii) involving undergraduate and high school students (in particular, female students) in research and science-education activities, and motivating them to pursue careers in science and engineering; (iii) enriching outreach activities by collaborating with local educational institutions to increase the awareness of local citizens with regard to the future impact of nanoscience and nanotechnology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
