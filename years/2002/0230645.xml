<AbstractNarration>PROPOSAL NO.: 0230645&lt;br/&gt;PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Schimmel, Keith&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION NAME: North Carolina Agricultural &amp; Technical State University&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: An Education and Engineering Partnership for Development of an Institutional Model for Bridges to Student Success in Science and Engineering at an HBCU&lt;br/&gt;NSF RECEIVED DATE: 06/04/2002&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The need for a larger pool of African-American students prepared for careers in engineering has&lt;br/&gt;been documented in many reports. An additional need that has been well documented is the&lt;br/&gt;need for K-12 teachers who can provide students with interesting, real-world applications of&lt;br/&gt;math, science, and engineering. The need for faculty who apply the latest advances in pedagogy,&lt;br/&gt;assessment, and learning theory to engineering curricula has also been clearly demonstrated.&lt;br/&gt;This planning grant proposal addresses these needs through a comprehensive plan to be&lt;br/&gt;implemented initially through a partnership between the College of Engineering and the School&lt;br/&gt;of Education at North Carolina A&amp;T State University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this planning grant, education and engineering faculty will work together to develop a&lt;br/&gt;comprehensive plan that will enhance the role of education pedagogy in the engineering college&lt;br/&gt;and establish a presence of engineering material in the education curriculum. Current A&amp;T&lt;br/&gt;linkages with K-12 schools in North Carolina will be exploited to help them develop effective&lt;br/&gt;strategies for meeting newly established State guidelines in science. Interactive workshops with&lt;br/&gt;nationally recognized experts on integration of engineering into K-12 and cognitive science will&lt;br/&gt;be used to develop effective partnerships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The long-term vision is a novel coordinated effort between the A&amp;T College of Engineering,&lt;br/&gt;A&amp;T School of Education, A&amp;T College of Arts and Sciences, K-12 partner schools, industrial&lt;br/&gt;partners, and nationally known centers of cognitive science to train A&amp;T faculty in pedagogy&lt;br/&gt;that is effective with HBCU students, train School of Education students in math, science, and&lt;br/&gt;engineering applications that can be used to excite K-12 students about careers in these areas,&lt;br/&gt;train engineering students in education topics that will allow them to excite K-12 students about&lt;br/&gt;engineering, and provide resources to current K-12 math and science teachers. The ultimate goal&lt;br/&gt;is to couple A&amp;T experience with teaching minority scientists and engineers with state-of-the-&lt;br/&gt;art pedagogy to increase the quality and quantity of African-American engineering graduates.&lt;br/&gt;The successes of this institutional model would then be shared with other HBCU as well as&lt;br/&gt;other universities with engineering programs.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
