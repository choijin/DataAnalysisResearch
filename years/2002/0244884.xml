<AbstractNarration>1. The purpose of this project is to enhance our understanding of fundamental problems in&lt;br/&gt;statistical mechanics and probability theory through the use of mathematical methods&lt;br/&gt;involving supersymmetry and the renormalization group. Of particular interest are&lt;br/&gt;statistical models with a geometrical flavor, such as branched polymers and self-avoiding&lt;br/&gt;walks. Basic questions for these models involve, for example, determining the rate at&lt;br/&gt;which the size of a sample grows with the number of monomers or steps. Such divergences&lt;br/&gt;are governed by critical exponents. The values of the exponents may be determined in one&lt;br/&gt;of two ways, either through dimensional reduction (which relates exponents to known&lt;br/&gt;exponents in related systems in fewer dimensions), or through the renormalization group&lt;br/&gt;(which calculates the flow of couplings with the length scale as the microscopic&lt;br/&gt;structures of the problem are averaged out). Supersymmetry plays an important role in&lt;br/&gt;both methods.&lt;br/&gt;Specific goals are: (a) to continue to develop a mathematical theory of dimensional&lt;br/&gt;reduction and apply it to new models, such as directed branched polymers; and (b) to&lt;br/&gt;construct an exact renormalization group flows for such systems.&lt;br/&gt;2. Research activities in this proposal will involve collaborations and exchanges of&lt;br/&gt;ideas with mathematicians and physicists in a wide range of fields, including probability,&lt;br/&gt;analysis, statistical mechanics, and quantum field theory. Graduate student support, and&lt;br/&gt;graduate student participation in scientific meetings, will integrate research and&lt;br/&gt;education and help train a new generation of mathematicians in the methods of field&lt;br/&gt;theory, supersymmetry, and the renormalization group. These activities will in the long&lt;br/&gt;run lead to enhanced interaction between mathematics and physics and to new ideas in both&lt;br/&gt;fields.</AbstractNarration>
