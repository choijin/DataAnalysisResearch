<AbstractNarration>0243764 &lt;br/&gt;Khokhar&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description: This award supports a US-Pakistan Workshop on Information Technology to be held in Islamabad, Pakistan, April 2003.  The organizers are Dr. Ashfaq Khokhar, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Chicago and Dr. S.M. Junaid Zaidi, Rector of the COMSATS (Commission on Science and Technology for Sustainable Development in the South) Institute of Information Technology in Islamabad, Pakistan.  The purpose of the workshop is to exchange information between the US and Pakistani sides on advances in information technology and to discuss R&amp;D needs that may be met through cooperative research projects.  The key areas chosen for this workshop include:  role of IT in large scale enterprise infrastructure, security and protection of IT infrastructure, network centric information and computing, IT based applications including digital government, e-commerce, e-learning and bioinformatics, and higher education and research in IT.  Several parallel sessions will be organized to make use of the expertise of expatriate and other US-based leading researchers. The workshop will include plenary sessions to introduce cutting edge research in each of the four identified areas, and two panel sessions to discuss future research trends in IT.  The workshop will provide a platform for fostering research collaborations among the researchers from US and Pakistan and initiate research and development projects related to key IT research areas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scope: This project enables US and Pakistani scientists to discuss an area of great importance to both countries, and to identify potential collaborative research where the two sides can complement each other's capabilities.  Dr. Khokhar is an experienced researcher with a strong record of NSF-funded projects.  He is also familiar with the science scene in Pakistan.  Dr. Zaidi is also an experienced scientist who leads a major specialized institute for IT in Pakistan and who will have the backing of that country's Ministry of Science and Technology.  Among the US participants are five junior scientists.  The project will increase collaboration in science and technology with Pakistan in an area of great importance to both countries.  This project is being supported by the Office of International Science and Engineering and the Division of Computer and Communications Research.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
