<AbstractNarration>In its 1996 report, Shaping the Future--New Expectations for Undergraduate Education in Science, Mathematics, Engineering, and Technology, the Advisory Committee to the National Science Foundation Directorate of Education and Human Resources charges college-level science educators to effectively use technology to enhance learning and communication, and to develop curricula that take full advantage of modern technology. Many of the key recommendations made to STEM faculty in Shaping the Future are addressed in the design of the Chemistry is in the News (CIITN) project. The overarching goal of CIITN project is to facilitate learning activities by connecting real world social, economic, and political issues to the teaching of organic chemistry. The activities consist in the study, creation, and peer-review of CIITN projects online. A CIITN project consists of (a link to) an electronically published news article from the popular press or any online media and includes a tutorial/editorial and questions. These activities are conducted in small collaborative groups, guided by peer-learning assistants, in the context of large lecture settings and they are aimed at undergraduate students majoring in science. The online tools and components of the Chemistry is in the News project are being developed in order to enable its nationwide implementation and adoption. We hold workshops at the University of Missouri-Columbia for faculty development and symposia at American Chemical Society meetings to disseminate the CIITN news projects. We hope that with the Chemistry is in the News project we bring about broader and deeper scientific literacy, a systemic change that is so desired by educators, administrators and politicians alike.</AbstractNarration>
