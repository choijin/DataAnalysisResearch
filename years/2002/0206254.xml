<AbstractNarration>A grant has been awarded to Dr. Linda Watson, Mr. Eric Tepe and Dr. Michael Vincent at Miami University to study the evolution of symbiotic interactions between ants and plants.  This study focuses on several New World tropical species of Piper, the genus of black pepper and kava, and explores the mutualistically beneficial interactions these plant species have with certain ant species.  The ants protect the plants against herbivores and fungal infection in exchange for plant-provided nesting space and nutrients.  This relationship is important for both organisms because neither the ants nor the plants are able to survive in the absence of the other. In addition to specialized associations, some species of Piper have resident ants only sometimes, and still other species are never found with ants.  An understanding of relationships between species in this continuum will allow insights into the evolutionary patterns that lead to the highly specialized relationships between ants and some species of Piper.  To this end, this study integrates molecular phylogenetics with comparative anatomy of the plant structures involved in the ant associations.&lt;br/&gt;Mutualistic interactions are important in the evolution of a vast majority, if not all organisms, and are responsible for a large part of the biodiversity seen today.  Despite this, surprisingly little is known about the properties and potential benefits of most tropical plants.  As an example, species of Piper are used medicinally by a number of traditional cultures throughout the tropics against maladies ranging from tooth decay to internal parasites, but the biochemistry behind these benefits remains to be studied.  To study the benefits of these plants accurately and effectively, a reliable classification is essential.  This study will result in a classification of a large and poorly known genus, in addition to a better understanding of the evolutionary patterns of these unique organisms.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
