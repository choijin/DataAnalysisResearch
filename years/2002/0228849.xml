<AbstractNarration>Geissman&lt;br/&gt;EAR-0228849&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Frictional heating during coseismic deformation can lead to the &lt;br/&gt;melting of the fault rocks and formation of pseudotachylite if slip &lt;br/&gt;is important. The increasingly reported existence of earthquake &lt;br/&gt;lightning shows that transient coseismic electric currents of large &lt;br/&gt;intensity are associated with large magnitude earthquakes (M  &gt; 6.0). &lt;br/&gt;Such currents are likely to follow pseudotachylite veins because &lt;br/&gt;their electric conductivity, being melts, is considerably larger than &lt;br/&gt;that of the unmolten rocks. All previous and preliminary results on &lt;br/&gt;fault-related pseudotachylites show that they have an anomalously &lt;br/&gt;high remanent magnetization. Their remanent magnetic properties are &lt;br/&gt;similar to those of lightning struck rocks, which suggests that large &lt;br/&gt;electric pulses were involved in the magnetization.  This project &lt;br/&gt;aims at demonstrating that remanence anomalies in pseudotachylites &lt;br/&gt;are generally observed and that coseismic electric currents are &lt;br/&gt;responsible for it. The investigators propose to test the hypothesis &lt;br/&gt;on three young pseudotachylites from seismically active fault zones &lt;br/&gt;(California, Japan and Western Alps) by collecting oriented samples &lt;br/&gt;for paleomagnetic studies. Samples collected at various points with &lt;br/&gt;respect to the main fault plane will enable us to test the coseismic &lt;br/&gt;current hypothesis. The geometry and the characteristics of the &lt;br/&gt;magnetizing field will be compared with the Earth's magnetic field at &lt;br/&gt;the time of pseudotachylite formation. This will provide an &lt;br/&gt;independent second test for the coseismic current hypothesis. A &lt;br/&gt;series of experiments will generate artificial pseudotachylites using &lt;br/&gt;the friction welding method. The artificial and natural &lt;br/&gt;pseudotachylites will be compared to assess the possible causes of &lt;br/&gt;anomalous magnetization in natural specimens. The direct study of &lt;br/&gt;coseismic currents is made difficult by their transient nature. This &lt;br/&gt;problem can be circumvented by using the remanent magnetic record of &lt;br/&gt;rocks affected by the electrical  phenomenon.  This research will &lt;br/&gt;open new directions of investigation on coseismic electric currents &lt;br/&gt;in fault rocks and should contribute to a better understanding of &lt;br/&gt;coseismic electric phenomena&lt;br/&gt;-- &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
