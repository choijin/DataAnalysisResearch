<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to create and validate new methods of controlling the flow of plastic melts in polymer processes such as extrusion and injection molding. This research is motivated by lack of&lt;br/&gt;controllability common in polymer processing, which prevents the efficient and consistent production of high quality products. To overcome existing constraints related to size and power consumption, the&lt;br/&gt;research will investigate design approaches that are powered predominantly by the polymer melt and require little or no control energy.  Furthermore, the size of the devices will be reduced until dominating mechanical and rheological constraints are identified. The research will be conducted at both theoretical and applied levels with close interaction with industry. Theoretical models will be developed to simulate the polymer flow through the melt control devices, thereby enabling the rapid development and optimization of improved designs. At the the applied level, extensive industrial collaboration is providing the opportunity to implement and validate the research relative to industry requirements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide fundamental advances towards improved characterization the polymer processes as well as enabling technologies for improved manufacturing processes. Finally, the research will enhance the existing educational infrastructure, and be transferred to industry through improved undergraduate, graduate, and continuing education courses.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
