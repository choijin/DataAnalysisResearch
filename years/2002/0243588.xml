    <AbstractNarration>The principal investigator will apply techniques from algebra and&lt;br/&gt;topology to study a number of basic questions in transformation &lt;br/&gt;groups, orbifolds, field theory, group cohomology and related topics. &lt;br/&gt;Among other things he proposes the following research projects: &lt;br/&gt;(1) construction of finite group actions using methods from group&lt;br/&gt;cohomology and homotopy theory; (2) research on representation spaces &lt;br/&gt;and K-theory of the braid groups and other discrete groups; (3) algebraic&lt;br/&gt;topology of orbifolds: the development and study of topological invariants&lt;br/&gt;associated to orbifolds; (4) field theory and cohomology of groups: the&lt;br/&gt;analysis of Galois groups using cohomological methods; and (5) computation&lt;br/&gt;of the cohomology of low rank simple groups, using a combination of&lt;br/&gt;theoretical and computer-assisted methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is interdisciplinary in its conception, as it intends&lt;br/&gt;to combine methods from algebra and topology to address a broad range &lt;br/&gt;of problems. Symmetry is a topic of central interest in mathematics,&lt;br/&gt;which can be effectively studied using topological methods. Research &lt;br/&gt;on mathematical aspects of orbifold string theory is representative &lt;br/&gt;of the emerging fusion between geometry and physics. Many important &lt;br/&gt;ideas have originated in physics and they consistently lead to the &lt;br/&gt;opening of new frontiers in mathematics. On the other hand the cohomology &lt;br/&gt;of groups is a subject involving intricate algebraic invariants which &lt;br/&gt;very naturally play a role in representation theory, number theory, &lt;br/&gt;field theory, etc. Recent techniques use advanced methods and capabilities &lt;br/&gt;from computer algebra, and the proposed calculations will serve as benchmarks &lt;br/&gt;for further computational as well as theoretical developments in the &lt;br/&gt;field--with many potential applications. This proposal will seek to develop &lt;br/&gt;close and fruitful interactions between topology, algebra and physics, &lt;br/&gt;helping to consolidate the cohomology of groups as an interactive subject &lt;br/&gt;involving both theoretical and computational methods.</AbstractNarration>
