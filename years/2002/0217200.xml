    <AbstractNarration>The goal of this dissemination project is to develop a model public service ad campaign&lt;br/&gt;that will advance the participation of women and girls in SMET through effecting a&lt;br/&gt;positive shift in attitudes among parents, educators, students and others in the community&lt;br/&gt;regarding girls' pursuit of interests / careers in SMET. The projects lead institution is &lt;br/&gt;Stony Brook University and collaborating organizations / institutions include the Long &lt;br/&gt;Island Fund for Women and Girls, Briarcliffe College, and television stations WLIW21 (PBS) &lt;br/&gt;and WLNY55.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This informal education project will develop a series of dynamic television spots, to be&lt;br/&gt;disseminated through local television broadcasts and through online links. The target &lt;br/&gt;audienceconsists of parents, educators and other authority figures, as well as peers, who &lt;br/&gt;have a great deal of influence over young peoples' perceptions of their educational and &lt;br/&gt;future professional options. Spots will reflect research findings that illustrate current&lt;br/&gt;gender inequities in SMET education and careers, and "de-bunk" some of the commonly &lt;br/&gt;accepted beliefs regarding gender-related causes for these disparities; information &lt;br/&gt;about often ignored or unremarked historical and current contributions of women in&lt;br/&gt;SMET; and national statistics on professional shortages in the SMET&lt;br/&gt;employment pool.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This video campaign will attempt to re-shape public attitudes regarding the gender&lt;br/&gt;appropriateness of girls' SMET pursuits. Using psychosocial research as a guide, the&lt;br/&gt;project will disseminate information in ways that may directly alter attitudes among&lt;br/&gt;individuals in the targeted groups, as well as encourage new behaviors that may then&lt;br/&gt;trigger compensatory attitude changes. This is a novel approach which combines&lt;br/&gt;technology-based applications, marketing strategies, and psychosocial research to target &lt;br/&gt;change in specific underlying public attitudes that hinder the participation of girls and&lt;br/&gt;young women in SMET.</AbstractNarration>
