<AbstractNarration>This project involves the incorporation of enzymes or antibodies in sol-gel processed transition metal oxides with the purpose of producing advanced biosensor components for the detection of harmful chemical and biological species. The proposed approach primarily addresses the material-related issues for creating controlled porous structures in which the biomolecules may easily "fit" and function. Environmental transmission electron microscopy will be employed to assess the nature of bio-molecule-sol-gel matrix interactions. A prototype of a functional biosensor will be delivered at the end of the program. The operating principle of this device is based on the release of gaseous ammonia as a result of biochemical reactions occurring between the biological component and the analyte. The bio-doped ceramics to be developed in this program are expected to find uses beyond the fields of bio-sensing and medical diagnostics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ability to detect the presence and monitor the concentration of harmful gaseous species and biological agents is important in any setting where humans live and work. This work proposes a novel way to "mix" ceramic and biological materials together in order to produce novel composites for use as sensing elements in miniaturized and possibly implantable, biosensors (such as a urea detector). These novel materials are expected to allow for faster and more efficient detection of contaminants and dangerous species. The students working on this project will learn new materials processing and characterization techniques and will obtain valuable skills on biosensor development that will be very useful for their professional development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal was submitted in response to the Dear Colleague Letter: Next Generation Chemical and Biological Sensors and Sensing Systems [nsf 02-112].&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
