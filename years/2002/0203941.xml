<AbstractNarration>DMS-0203941&lt;br/&gt;John Etnyre&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of this proposal is to better understand the nature of contact structures in &lt;br/&gt;all (odd) dimensions, with special attention given to dimension three, and to apply contact &lt;br/&gt;topological techniques to questions in hydrodynamics. The first main theme of the &lt;br/&gt;proposed research is Legendrian knots. Legendrian knots are knots that are tangent to &lt;br/&gt;a contact structure and seem to encode a great deal of information about the contact &lt;br/&gt;structure. For example, the famed tight vs. overtwisted dichotomy in dimension three &lt;br/&gt;can be understood in terms of Legendrian knots. These knots also give an important invariant &lt;br/&gt;of a contact structure. As part of this proposal the general structure of Legendrian knots &lt;br/&gt;will be studied. The expected outcome will be various classification result for certain &lt;br/&gt;Legendrian knots and contact structures; and, moreover, a better understanding of Legendrian &lt;br/&gt;surgery (an important surgery construction of contact structures). Legendrian knots in &lt;br/&gt;higher dimensions will also be studied using contact homology. There is very little known &lt;br/&gt;about contact structures, or Legendrian knots, in dimensions above three. By investigating &lt;br/&gt;Legendrian knots in these dimensions the nature of contact structures should be illuminated, &lt;br/&gt;just as the corresponding study revealed much about three dimensional contact structures. &lt;br/&gt;The final part of the proposed research centers on the connection between contact structures &lt;br/&gt;and hydrodynamics discovered a few years ago by the Principal Investigator and R. Ghrist. &lt;br/&gt;Here work with Ghrist will continue with the aim of understanding when, and what type of, &lt;br/&gt;closed flow lines occur in fluid flows. We shall also study hydrodynamic instability from &lt;br/&gt;the contact topological perspective. This naturally leads into the study of energy minimization &lt;br/&gt;for fluid flows and relations between contact and Riemannian geometry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contact structures are very natural objects, born over two centuries ago, in the work of Huygens, &lt;br/&gt;Hamilton and  Jacobi on geometric optics. Through the centuries contact structures have touched &lt;br/&gt;on many diverse areas of mathematics and physics, including classical mechanics and thermodynamics. &lt;br/&gt;In everyday life one encounters contact geometry when ice skating, parallel parking a car, &lt;br/&gt;navigating a submarine, using a refrigerator, or simply watching the beautiful play of light in a &lt;br/&gt;glass of water. Many great mathematicians have devoted a lot of their work to this subject  but &lt;br/&gt;only in the last decade or two has it moved into the foreground of mathematics. This renaissance &lt;br/&gt;is due to the recent remarkable breakthroughs in contact topology, resulting in a rich and beautiful  &lt;br/&gt;theory with many applications. The most remarkable feature of all this recent work is the intimate &lt;br/&gt;connections between contact structures and topology in dimension three. Moreover, there were &lt;br/&gt;important newfound interactions with Hamiltonian mechanics, symplectic and sub-Riemannian geometry, &lt;br/&gt;foliation theory, complex geometry and analysis, topological hydrodynamics, and knot theory. The &lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator will explore new connections between contact structures and topology in all &lt;br/&gt;(odd) dimensions and continue his study of idealized fluid flows (hydrodynamics) via contact geometry.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
