<AbstractNarration>Shaoyi Jiang, University of Washington&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"Upgrade of a Scanning Probe Microscope for Chemical and Biochemical Analysis"&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scanning probe microscopic (SPM) technique can be used not only for the characterization of surfaces at the sub-nanometer resolution, but also for the measurement of nano-scale forces. SPM has been one of main techniques used in the PI's group for various ongoing nanotechnology projects, including (a) characterizing self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) formed by alkanethiols on Au(111), dendrimer monolayers on Au(111), and alkyl monolayers on Si(111) at the molecular resolution, (b) studying protein adsorption and detecting antigen-antibody interactions, and (c) measuring quantitative frictional properties of various thin films. Tapping mode SPM is very important for these ongoing projects, particularly for the study of interfacial phenomena and properties of biological systems on surfaces in liquids. The current SPM system in the PI's group was acquired from Digital Instruments (DI) about five years ago. It has been heavily used in various research and teaching activities. However, it does not have many important features, such as tapping mode operation. The PI proposes to upgrade the existing SPM from NanoScope E to NanoScope IIIa Control Station with Extender Electronics Module. This upgrade will allow the PI's group to perform tapping mode SPM in liquids. Upgrade of the SPM will greatly enhance the PI's research capacities, broaden his research areas, and facilitate collaborations with people on and off campus. The broader impact of this grant will be that many graduate students and undergraduate students will benefit from the instrument through their research experience or laboratory sessions in a course.  If the research is successful, society will benefit through better biocompatible materials.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
