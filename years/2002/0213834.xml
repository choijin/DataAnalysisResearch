    <AbstractNarration>This project aims for a comprehensive understanding of microstructures of mixed group III-nitride layers, intending to advance understanding of the occurrence of phase separation and atomic ordering in these materials. Experiments to discern whether or not phase separation oc-curs in the bulk or on the surface will be conducted. The approach is to examine the effects of growth rates and growth temperatures on phase-separated microstructures. In-diffusion experi-ments to evaluate whether or not these microstructures represent the equilibrium state in the bulk will be carried out. The origins of atomic ordering will be studied through growth of mixed lay-ers on [ 1 1 10 ] microfaceted GaN layers to ascertain the role of these facets in atomic ordering. Interfaces between differently ordered regions and distribution of ordered domains in layers that have been grown at different growth rates will be examined. Additionally, the influence of phase separation and atomic ordering on carrier mobility by Hall measurements will be evaluated. These studies will utilize InGaN and AlGaN layers, and may also include AlInN and AlInGaN films. Film growth will be done using metalorganic chemical vapor deposition and molecular beam epitaxy. Microstructures will be studied by X-ray diffraction and transmission electron mi-croscopy, both conventional and high resolution. Energy loss spectroscopy, coupled with energy filtered imaging, will be utilized to study the distribution of atomic species in layers. &lt;br/&gt;%%% &lt;br/&gt;The project addresses fundamental research issues in areas of electronic materials science having technological relevance. It is envisaged that this research could have a significant impact on sci-ence and technology of group III-nitride materials and devices. An important feature of the proj-ect is the strong emphasis on education, and the integration of research and education. The avail-able resources provide special opportunities for education and training of graduate students in-volved in interdisciplinary forefront research.&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>
