<AbstractNarration>     In this project, I shall consider problems in harmonic analysis &lt;br/&gt;arising in geometric analysis and geometric measure theory, and in   &lt;br/&gt;the theory of elliptic and parabolic partial differential equations&lt;br/&gt;and operators.   These questions are interesting because of their&lt;br/&gt;applicability to real world phenomena (see below), but also because &lt;br/&gt;of the deep connections among them.  The main directions of the &lt;br/&gt;proposed research include the following:&lt;br/&gt;1. To develop and apply ``T1/Tb" (i.e., Carleson measure) &lt;br/&gt;criteria for the solvability of boundary problems for &lt;br/&gt;divergence form elliptic equations and systems.&lt;br/&gt;2. To treat various problems in the theory of uniformly &lt;br/&gt;rectifiable sets, in the applications of this theory to &lt;br/&gt;elliptic and parabolic PDE, and in the theory of &lt;br/&gt;quasiconformal mappings.&lt;br/&gt;3. To obtain sharp average decay estimates for Fourier transforms, and &lt;br/&gt;to apply these to concrete problems including lattice point problems and&lt;br/&gt;the Falconer distance problem.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;      As mentioned above, I propose to work on problems in the area &lt;br/&gt;of harmonic analysis and its application to, and interaction with, &lt;br/&gt;geometric measure theory and the theory of elliptic and parabolic&lt;br/&gt;partial differential equations.  Roughly speaking, in &lt;br/&gt;harmonic analysis one investigates properties of&lt;br/&gt;functions and ``operators" (i.e., mappings which transform one function&lt;br/&gt;into another) by decomposing them into smaller, constituent pieces,&lt;br/&gt;which are easier to understand, and then reassembling the pieces.  The&lt;br/&gt;name itself arose by analogy to the decomposition of a musical sound&lt;br/&gt;into its various frequency components, or ``harmonics".&lt;br/&gt;geometric measure theory involves the study of the relationship between&lt;br/&gt;geometric properties of sets, and their ``measures" (the latter are&lt;br/&gt;generalizations of the notions of length, area, and volume).  Partial&lt;br/&gt;differential equations of elliptic and of parabolic type describe a &lt;br/&gt;wide variety of phenoma in the real world, including electrostatics, &lt;br/&gt;certain fluid flows and elastic deformations, and various diffusion&lt;br/&gt;processes such as the conduction of heat, the flow of ground water, certain&lt;br/&gt;phenomena arising in the mathematical theory of population biology, and the &lt;br/&gt;pricing of options in financial markets.  In the last decade the interplay &lt;br/&gt;between these different subfields of mathematics has turned out to be a&lt;br/&gt;fertile ground for investigation, with much exciting work remaining&lt;br/&gt;to be done.</AbstractNarration>
