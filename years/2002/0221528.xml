<AbstractNarration>The Next Generation Internet (NGI) poses scalability challenges to the efficient operation of &lt;br/&gt;the  transport  protocol  (TCP).  In  particular,  as  the  product  (bandwidth  x  delay)  grows,  the &lt;br/&gt;congestion window required to .fill the pipe. becomes quite large, especially on cross-country &lt;br/&gt;links. One well known  problem in TCP in this scenario is the selection of the .initial &lt;br/&gt;window.. More recently, new challenges have emerged because of the increasing popularity &lt;br/&gt;of nomadic access to the Internet via wireless links (e.g., wireless LANs, satellite links, &lt;br/&gt;UMTS, etc).  The data rates on wireless links have been constantly on the rise, approaching &lt;br/&gt;the 50Mbps on 802.11a wireless LANs and thus providing an effective extension of backbone &lt;br/&gt;services to mobile users. However, wireless links tend to introduce random packet errors and &lt;br/&gt;loss  that are not correlated to congestion.  This creates problems to conventional TCP &lt;br/&gt;protocols (e.g., TCP New Reno and TCP SACK), which interpret any loss as a buffer overflow &lt;br/&gt;(i.e., as a symptom of congestion) and thus reduce the congestion window unnecessarily with &lt;br/&gt;consequent loss in performance. The drop in performance is proportional to the (bandwidth x &lt;br/&gt;length) product  of the connection and can be quite significant in the high  bandwidth NGI &lt;br/&gt;environment, especially on cross country paths  including .last hop wireless LANs, UMTS &lt;br/&gt;links, or  high bandwidth satellites.   &lt;br/&gt;Several  approaches  to  enhance TCP  congestion  control  over  high bandwidth  wireless  links &lt;br/&gt;have  been  reported  in  the  literature  (e.g.,  TCP  Peach,  TCP Westwood  (TCPW)).  Some  of &lt;br/&gt;these  enhancements  have  been  quite  successful.  For  example,  TCPW,  a  TCP  variant  that &lt;br/&gt;uses bottleneck bandwidth share estimation. to adjust the congestion window upon loss, has &lt;br/&gt;shown scalable properties and good link utilization in large leaky pipes., (i.e. large &lt;br/&gt;bandwidth delay product, and non negligible  random packet loss).  &lt;br/&gt;This proposal is about carrying out a systematic, experimental investigation of performance &lt;br/&gt;of TCP over wired/wireless paths. This investigation will include the comparison of various &lt;br/&gt;TCP enhancements proposed so far in the literature. It will consider a representative set of &lt;br/&gt;experimental  environments  and  application  scenarios.  The  proposed  project  is  in  part &lt;br/&gt;motivated  by  our  recent  positive  experience  with  TCPW  Internet  experiments  of  large  file &lt;br/&gt;transfers over lossy paths. In this project the researchers will broaden the scope to include a vast gamut of TCP wireless enhancement techniques. The researchers  will  identify the pros and cons of each scheme, characterize the traffic/network environment for which it is best suited, and, more generally, develop  models  that  relate  wireless  media  characteristics,  TCP    congestion  control &lt;br/&gt;parameters and performance results.   &lt;br/&gt;In summary, given:  (1) the increasing importance of nomadic computing and  wireless access  &lt;br/&gt;to the high speed wired Internet; (2) the performance degradations observed in conventional &lt;br/&gt;TCP  protocols  over  wireless  path,  and  (3)  the  encouraging  improvements  offered  by &lt;br/&gt;modified, wireless versions  of  TCP  (which  yet  retain  the  basic  end  to  end  paradigm),  the researchers believe this a very appropriate time to engage in a systematic, experimentally based &lt;br/&gt;evaluation of wireless TCP  protocols  by  a  team  that  includes  protocol  developers, &lt;br/&gt;applications developers and network measurement experts.</AbstractNarration>
