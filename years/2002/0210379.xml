<AbstractNarration>This project will advance the practice of information security and computer networking forensics in the public sector, and build the national capacity to deal with threats in this area.  The target audience is public sector professionals and managers, including law enforcement officials.  Starting with existing materials and the expertise of CERIAS at Purdue University (a NSA Center of Excellence in Information Assurance Education), the University at Albany/SUNY is developing competency-based distance-deliverable courseware in two key Information Security content areas, aimed primarily at professional needs in the public-sector.  These curricula and materials are designed to be flexible, and able to be used in a variety of settings including undergraduate and graduate degree programs, certificate programs, and professional education.  We use these materials in a variety of outlets, including degree and certificate programs at the University at Albany and Purdue University, as well as public-sector training programs and workshops in New York and Indiana. We are using the universities close relationships with the New York and Indiana State Police, and the New York State Office for Technology in a partnership to develop and test these modules.  In engaging these organizations as partners on the project, we bring the resources of the University to bear on critical public needs.  In doing so, we are developing a mutually beneficial relationship that enable  the university educational programs to be more responsive to both public and private sector needs.  The results of this project will be disseminated through a number of national outlets, including distance education learning communities, and consortia for information security education and training.</AbstractNarration>
