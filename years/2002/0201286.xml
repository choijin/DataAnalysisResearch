<AbstractNarration>The investigator studies applications of algebraic geometry to &lt;br/&gt;coding theory.  In this proposal, the investigator focuses on &lt;br/&gt;problems relating semigroups and algebraic geometry codes.  This &lt;br/&gt;involves exploring connections between Weierstrass semigroups of &lt;br/&gt;m-tuples of points on a curve and algebraic geometry codes formed &lt;br/&gt;using these m points.  The first aim of this project is to better &lt;br/&gt;understand the structure of Weierstrass semigroups of m-tuples of &lt;br/&gt;points on certain curves over finite fields.  The second goal is &lt;br/&gt;to apply this knowledge to improve bounds on the minimum distances &lt;br/&gt;of codes constructed using these curves as well as arbitrary &lt;br/&gt;curves over finite fields.  This builds on the investigator's &lt;br/&gt;previous work showing that Weierstrass semigroups of pairs of &lt;br/&gt;points can be used to construct algebraic geometry codes with &lt;br/&gt;parameters exceeding the usual lower bounds.   These codes, &lt;br/&gt;constructed using two points on a curve, have better parameters &lt;br/&gt;than any comparable code constructed using a single point on the &lt;br/&gt;same curve.  Thus, in the third component of this project, the &lt;br/&gt;investigator compares codes constructed using m points on a curve &lt;br/&gt;to those constructed using fewer than m points.  In addition to &lt;br/&gt;these topics, this project includes a focus on semigroups used in &lt;br/&gt;decoding algorithms for algebraic geometry codes.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Error-correcting codes are used to ensure reliable transfer of &lt;br/&gt;information across noisy communication channels by detecting &lt;br/&gt;and correcting errors.  Such codes are found in a wide range of &lt;br/&gt;devices, from computing equipment to cellular telephones to &lt;br/&gt;compact disc players.  For practical applications, codes should &lt;br/&gt;be efficient and correct as many errors as possible.  While there &lt;br/&gt;are many ways to construct codes, one of the most promising uses &lt;br/&gt;tools from algebraic geometry.  In particular, curves over finite &lt;br/&gt;fields are used to define error-correcting codes, called algebraic &lt;br/&gt;geometry codes.  One can gain information about these codes by &lt;br/&gt;studying the curves used to define them.  In this proposal, the &lt;br/&gt;investigator examines curves commonly used to define algebraic &lt;br/&gt;geometry codes by studying semigroups associated with the curves.  &lt;br/&gt;This knowledge is then applied to obtain better estimates of the &lt;br/&gt;efficiency and error-correcting capabilities of the corresponding &lt;br/&gt;codes.  In addition, the investigator pursues applications of &lt;br/&gt;semigroups to the process of decoding algebraic geometry codes.     &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
