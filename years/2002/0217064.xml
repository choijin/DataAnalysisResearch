<AbstractNarration>Biological invasions represent a major component of global environmental change.&lt;br/&gt;Invasions may lead to reduced biodiversity and often result in permanent alterations to&lt;br/&gt;ecosystems.Invasive non-native plant pathogens have dramatically affected ecosystems in many&lt;br/&gt;parts of the world.The mechanisms underlying dispersal of these pathogens and their ecological&lt;br/&gt;consequences are critical issues for conservation and ecosystem management.Spatial pattern is&lt;br/&gt;a fundamental property of disease dynamics because it reflects the genetic heterogeneity and&lt;br/&gt;environmental forces acting on pathogen dispersal and life history.A multidisciplinary approach&lt;br/&gt;is required to solve the challenges of 1)incorporating fine-scale processes of pathogen dispersal&lt;br/&gt;into landscape-level models and 2)integrating spatial variation in environmental factors and host&lt;br/&gt;population genetics with disease incidence.&lt;br/&gt;In this proposal,we describe research to analyze spatio-temporal dynamics of&lt;br/&gt;Phytophthora ramorum,an emerging,and probably exotic,pathogen that causes a lethal disease&lt;br/&gt;of oaks and tanoaks in coastal California.This disease,known as Sudden Oak Death (SOD),has&lt;br/&gt;reached epidemic levels in several counties.The proposal integrates spatial data on host&lt;br/&gt;genetics,community structure,and environmental variation with investigations of mechanisms&lt;br/&gt;underlying spread of P.ramorum to model changes in the distribution of this plant disease across&lt;br/&gt;the landscape.Model predictions will identify critical factors that influence the distribution of&lt;br/&gt;SOD and provide forecasts of habitat loss in oak woodlands as a consequence of SOD.This&lt;br/&gt;proposal describes a multidisciplinary program to model the spread of a destructive plant disease&lt;br/&gt;and to predict its ecological consequences.Our objectives are not developed as discrete&lt;br/&gt;activities for individual researchers,but rather a collaborative effort among researchers to attack&lt;br/&gt;a single problem.We aim to accomplish the following:&lt;br/&gt;1.Develop a statistically based model that predicts spatial patterns of SOD risk on the&lt;br/&gt;landscape,based on relationships among several critical environmental factors.These factors&lt;br/&gt;include proximity to previously infected locations,genetic background of host species,plant&lt;br/&gt;community structure,landscape structure,abiotic conditions,and anthropogenic activities.&lt;br/&gt;2.Develop a mechanistic model that predicts spatial patterns of pathogen activity and host&lt;br/&gt;susceptibility based on empirical studies of pathogen dispersal between hosts on fine spatial&lt;br/&gt;scales and on environmental conditions conducive to pathogen reproduction and dispersal.&lt;br/&gt;3.Develop a model of SOD spread that integrates the most predictive components of the&lt;br/&gt;statistical and mechanistic models.&lt;br/&gt;4.Foster participation of undergraduates in this cross-disciplinary research and integrate the&lt;br/&gt;research into the curriculum of core courses in the Departments of Biology and Geography at&lt;br/&gt;Sonoma State University.&lt;br/&gt;Sonoma State University is located within 20 km of the study area,which is easily&lt;br/&gt;accessible to PI s and their students.Previous analyses of the relationship between&lt;br/&gt;environmental variation and SOD spread have concentrated on the most heavily impacted&lt;br/&gt;regions in Marin County where the pathogen has infected trees throughout the study area.In&lt;br/&gt;contrast,the present study focuses on SOD spread into new areas that presently show no sign of&lt;br/&gt;infection.We believe that this approach will contribute substantially towards a greater&lt;br/&gt;understanding of the biology of this pathogen and to our understanding of the ecology and&lt;br/&gt;genetics of plant-pathogen interactions.The timing of this study will also ensure involvement by&lt;br/&gt;motivated undergraduates at Sonoma State University who wish to participate in research that&lt;br/&gt;everyone recognizes is of critical significance to the larger community.</AbstractNarration>
