    <AbstractNarration>The objective of the symposium is to present by example the power of integrative biology in approaching complex biological phenomena. This includes integration across all levels of biological organization: taxonomic, habitat, and methodological; from molecules to global ecosystems; from observation to experimentation; and from different perspectives, including those from different cultures. Integrative biology can and should be used both for research and to train the next generation of biologists so they can better think broadly and synthetically about solutions to complex problems of pressing importance. With the Society's strong student membership, we are particularly concerned about training in integrative biology. Funding from the International Union of Biological Sciences (IUBS) will bring two prominent foreign scientists (from France and Japan) together with five US biologists to share their approaches in integrative biology. The presentations will be published in the Society's journal, The Journal of Integrative and Comparative Biology, and sent to all members of the Society, as well as widely distributed to subscribing scientific libraries around the world.</AbstractNarration>
