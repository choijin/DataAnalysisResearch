<AbstractNarration>Computing devices and applications are rapidly infiltrating every aspect of our everyday lives.  The move of computing from the office desktop to ubiquitous presence in homes, in communities, and at play poses a challenge to human-computer interaction, because many of the attributes that are most important for workplace computing such as efficiency, problem-solving functionality, and standardization, are less central for other parts of our lives.  Designing everyday computing applications that are appropriate for everyday life requires rethinking and adapting our methodologies; otherwise, we risk making all of our life like work.  In this project, the PI will exploit cultural theory to analyze the cultural context of everyday life and develop appropriate computer science technologies and methodologies that support open-ended activity, user reflection, variations in style of living, personal meaning, and everyday values.  These themes will be studied within the context of three applications: a system that monitors a home's emotional climate and provides users with open-ended feedback about it; information appliances for the home that support awareness of consumption; and an affective wearable device that explores emotional issues in backpacking.  The project integrates activities across the disciplines that make up Cornell's new Information Science program, and supports the consolidation of the currently fragmented interdisciplinary community of researchers working in this area.  It will also educate students from a variety of backgrounds and interests to integrate technical and cultural perspectives through interdisciplinary courses and involvement in the PI's research.</AbstractNarration>
