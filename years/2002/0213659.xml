<AbstractNarration>Large columnar cacti, such as the saguaro (Carnegiea gigantea), are prominent features of&lt;br/&gt;many ecosystems. Because of their extensive distribution and abundant production of large&lt;br/&gt;succulent fruit they play an important role in structuring food webs and ecosystems. Up until&lt;br/&gt;now, however, researchers studying the ecological and evolutionary aspects of plant-frugivore&lt;br/&gt;mutualisms have largely ignored this important group of plants. These succulent fruit may be&lt;br/&gt;particularly important in hot deserts where high air temperatures and water scarcity may&lt;br/&gt;constrain animal behavior as well as the timing and investment in reproduction. The saguaro's&lt;br/&gt;fruit are available during the driest and hottest period (June-July) of the summer in the Sonoran&lt;br/&gt;Desert, before the onset of monsoon rains.&lt;br/&gt;In this research, I use a two-faceted approach to assessing the importance of a unique&lt;br/&gt;resource, the saguaro, to a community of avian consumers. The proposed research has several&lt;br/&gt;features that set it apart from earlier studies examining plant -animal interactions: 1) it combines&lt;br/&gt;observational data of resource use by individual consumers with direct measurements nutrient&lt;br/&gt;transfer between the plant resource and a community of consumers using stable isotopes as&lt;br/&gt;tracers; 2) it quantifies both temporal changes in fruit availability and changes in avian&lt;br/&gt;abundance, diversity, and productivity and 3) it directly manipulates resource availability,&lt;br/&gt;through fruit removal, while quantifying changes in consumer abundance, diversity, and&lt;br/&gt;productivity. Taken in concert, these studies provide a unique approach to assessing the&lt;br/&gt;importance of presumed irkeystonely or irfoundationlr resources by: 1) directly quantifying the&lt;br/&gt;flux of nutrients between a primary producer and individual consumers and 2) through a fruit&lt;br/&gt;removal experiment, examining the effects of the fruit resource on consumer abundance,&lt;br/&gt;biodiversity, and productivity.&lt;br/&gt;I expect this research to produce an extensive array of new insights into: 1) the water and&lt;br/&gt;energy balance of desert birds; 2) the role of cacti as consumer resources in arid and semi-arid&lt;br/&gt;ecosystems; 3) frugivory and nutrient transfer rates between plant-consumer interactions and 4)&lt;br/&gt;community dynamics as it relates to changes in resource levels. This work will also quantify how&lt;br/&gt;different consumer groups (seed predators versus seed dispersers) interact with the plant to affect&lt;br/&gt;the plant's reproductive potential. It will provide the first comparative analysis of traditional&lt;br/&gt;methods of studying resource use to the newer techniques using stable isotopes.&lt;br/&gt;At the same time, it will be among the first studies to quantify the effects of removal of a&lt;br/&gt;presumed irKeystone Plant Resourcele on the abundance, diversity and reproductive output of an&lt;br/&gt;entire animal community. This research will also be the first to quantify the importance of a&lt;br/&gt;single resource to the nutrient and water balance of multiple species of different body sizes,&lt;br/&gt;foraging modes and dietary guilds in any ecosystem. This work should also provide important&lt;br/&gt;new empirical evidence on how home range size and foraging mode affect individual&lt;br/&gt;exploitation of a resource system.&lt;br/&gt;Finally, this research will bring all facets of the scientific process to a large number of&lt;br/&gt;graduate and undergraduate students. Twenty undergraduate students and 1 graduate student will&lt;br/&gt;obtain extensive research experience working on this project and it is likely that many more will&lt;br/&gt;be trained through the REU program. This research is bound to have a major inpact with the&lt;br/&gt;public as well, because of my association with the Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum. Research&lt;br/&gt;results from this project will be the basis of a centerpiece display at the museum that explores the&lt;br/&gt;scientific process and the interactions of saguaros with the other inhabitants of the Sonoran&lt;br/&gt;Desert.</AbstractNarration>
