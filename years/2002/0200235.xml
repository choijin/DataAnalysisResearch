    <AbstractNarration>DMS-0200235&lt;br/&gt;Project title: Quantum corrections to classical approximations&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: Laszlo Erdos, Georgia Institute of Technology&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal contains three related projects that investigate&lt;br/&gt;residual quantum effects in classical approximations&lt;br/&gt;of complex quantum problems. The first project considers&lt;br/&gt;the correction due to the self-generated &lt;br/&gt;magnetic field in the Thomas-Fermi theory of large atoms. &lt;br/&gt;The optimal magnetic field obtained from a variational&lt;br/&gt;principle is spatially inhomogeneous. The second project aims at&lt;br/&gt;deriving nonlinear self-consistent evolution equations &lt;br/&gt;from the quantum dynamics of many particles&lt;br/&gt;interacting via weakly coupled Coulomb force. The quantum statistics of the&lt;br/&gt;particles determine the scaling and the limiting&lt;br/&gt;classical equation (Hartree or Vlasov). The last project&lt;br/&gt;studies the long time dynamics of noninteracting&lt;br/&gt;electrons in a random environment in the diffusive regime.&lt;br/&gt;On the shorter kinetic time scale the Boltzmann&lt;br/&gt;equation has been established earlier.&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to determine the quantum corrections to the&lt;br/&gt;classical diffusivity obtained from the Boltzmann equation&lt;br/&gt;and verify some predictions of the celebrated scaling theory&lt;br/&gt;of conductance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The physics of charged particles governs all electric phenomena.&lt;br/&gt;From theoretical point of view, these particles can be accurately described &lt;br/&gt;using many-body quantum mechanics. In practice, however, &lt;br/&gt;the fundamental equation of quantum&lt;br/&gt;physics, the Schr\"odinger equation, is too complicated. Typical electronic&lt;br/&gt;devices contain a huge number of electrons and it is impossible to&lt;br/&gt;describe their precise microscopic behavior &lt;br/&gt;even with the current computer technology.&lt;br/&gt;The Schr\"odinger equation is usually replaced with&lt;br/&gt;much simpler equations that are computationally more feasible.&lt;br/&gt;These equations do not contain all information about the complex&lt;br/&gt;electronic system, but they may describe certain quantities&lt;br/&gt;of interest with a sufficient precision. The proposal&lt;br/&gt;studies three complex quantum systems: &lt;br/&gt;(i) a large atom in a self-generated magnetic field; &lt;br/&gt;(ii) many charged particles with a weak interaction;&lt;br/&gt;(iii) a single electron in an impure medium.&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to find the correct approximating equations&lt;br/&gt;and to justify rigorously that &lt;br/&gt;they are consistent with the Schr\"odinger theory in certain limits.&lt;br/&gt;Heuristically, some of these equations can be guessed based upon&lt;br/&gt;classical mechanics. Quantum mechanics, however, may modify&lt;br/&gt;the classical picture. The proposed work identifies the quantum &lt;br/&gt;correction effects in the classical description of these three basic models.</AbstractNarration>
