<AbstractNarration>A grant has been awarded to Dr. Sandercock at Kansas State University to make&lt;br/&gt;improvements to the Kansas State University Ornithology Collection. The Ornithology&lt;br/&gt;Collection currently contains 1172 round skins, 188 mounts, 30-40 spread wings, and 20-30&lt;br/&gt;nests that are a representative sample of the avifauna of the Great Plains ecoregion. The&lt;br/&gt;collection holdings are valuable because they include many bird specimens that were collected in&lt;br/&gt;Kansas during the late 1800s and early 1900s, including two specimens of the now extinct&lt;br/&gt;Eskimo Curlew. The goal of this project is to conserve and improve the resources of the&lt;br/&gt;Ornithology Collection for use in undergraduate teaching and public education.&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of the project are threefold. First, an urgent need of the Ornithology&lt;br/&gt;Collection is improved storage facilities. The study skins are currently stored in wood frame&lt;br/&gt;cabinets that are at least 30 years old and not airtight. Mounts are currently housed in wooden&lt;br/&gt;display cabinets that were salvaged when the collection was moved to Ackert Hall in 1969. A&lt;br/&gt;majority of the direct costs of this grant (56%) are for new museum storage cabinets that will&lt;br/&gt;ensure that the collection will be protected from insect damage. Second, another major need of&lt;br/&gt;the collection is cataloguing of the existing specimens. The long-term goal for this collection is&lt;br/&gt;to transfer or exchange older specimens of potential research value to major natural history&lt;br/&gt;museums, such as the nearby Museum of Natural History at the University of Kansas. To&lt;br/&gt;facilitate transfers, the contents of the Ornithology Collection will be inventoried into an&lt;br/&gt;electronic database that will be made available on the Internet. A portion of the direct costs&lt;br/&gt;(35%) will be used to hire and train three undergraduate curatorial assistants to complete this&lt;br/&gt;task. Last, a final need for the collection is acquisition of new materials to replace older&lt;br/&gt;specimens of research value. The remaining direct costs (9%) are for curatorial supplies to&lt;br/&gt;prepare and store new materials.&lt;br/&gt;This project is scientifically important because it will make the museum holdings of the&lt;br/&gt;Kansas State University Ornithology Collection available to the scientific community for the&lt;br/&gt;first time. Access to study skins will be of greatest value to researchers conducting retrospective&lt;br/&gt;analyses of museum specimens, but the collection also contains valuable specimens that will fill&lt;br/&gt;gaps in historical sampling efforts. The project will have broader impacts by offering&lt;br/&gt;comprehensive training in the techniques of museum curation to three undergraduate students.&lt;br/&gt;The resources of the Ornithology Collection also serve an important role in undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;education and outreach programs for the public. Museum specimens are regularly used as&lt;br/&gt;teaching materials in three core undergraduate courses in the Division of Biology: Principles of&lt;br/&gt;Biology (Biol 198), Organismic Biology (Biol 201) and Ornithology (Biol 543). Avian&lt;br/&gt;specimens are also an important resource for public outreach programs coordinated by the&lt;br/&gt;Division of Biology. Mounts and study skins will be used in permanent exhibits in Ackert Hall,&lt;br/&gt;in displays for annual open house events at Kansas State University, in displays for field trips of&lt;br/&gt;grade school students from the Riley Town school district, and in environmental education&lt;br/&gt;programs for K-12 students and teachers at nearby Konza Prairie Biological Station. Long-term&lt;br/&gt;conservation of the museum holdings will benefit local communities in northeast Kansas.</AbstractNarration>
