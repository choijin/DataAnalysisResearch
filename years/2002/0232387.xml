<AbstractNarration>     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will assist in the development of an &lt;br/&gt;innovative method for effective and low cost destruction and removal of hazardous air &lt;br/&gt;pollutants (HAPs), specifically Halogenated Volatile Organic Compounds (HVOCs), &lt;br/&gt;using non-thermal plasma generated in microwave discharges.  In the non-thermal &lt;br/&gt;technique described in this proposal, the non-equilibrium properties of the plasma are &lt;br/&gt;fully exploited.  These plasmas can produce energetic electrons (typical energies of 1-10 &lt;br/&gt;eV), which effectively lead to the creation of free radicals without the necessity of adding &lt;br/&gt;the enthalpy associated with very high gas temperatures.  Therefore, from the chemical &lt;br/&gt;point of view, destruction reaction rates normally associated with temperatures of 10,000 &lt;br/&gt;to 100,000 K can be realized with the gas near ambient temperature.  The proposed &lt;br/&gt;technique utilizes the dissociation and ionization of the background gases to produce &lt;br/&gt;radicals that, in turn, destroy and decompose the toxic and hazardous compounds.  The &lt;br/&gt;input energy of the system is directed mostly to the production of the desired density of &lt;br/&gt;radicals which react preferentially with the HVOCs that are often present in very small &lt;br/&gt;concentrations in the exhaust gas.   &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The proposed technology will meet a growing need in the semiconductor industry, and &lt;br/&gt;other HVOC sources for a simple and cost-effective method for the removal of hazardous &lt;br/&gt;compounds from the flue gas.  The new method is likely to be successful due to its &lt;br/&gt;simplicity and the ease with which the gas-cleanup unit can be retrofitted to the existing &lt;br/&gt;combustion systems.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
