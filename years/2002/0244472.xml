<AbstractNarration>Abstract &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigators will work on two fundamental&lt;br/&gt;projects in the field of geometric analysis.  The first&lt;br/&gt;project concerns the interrelated analytic study of&lt;br/&gt;rational billiards, moduli spaces of abelian&lt;br/&gt;differentials, and the dynamics of the Teichmuller&lt;br/&gt;geodesic flow. A recent theme has been the interplay&lt;br/&gt;between the dynamics on flows on homogeneous spaces on the&lt;br/&gt;one hand, and the dynamics of flows on rational billiards&lt;br/&gt;and flat surfaces on the other.  This synergy has led to&lt;br/&gt;recent breakthroughs in both subjects.  Broadly speaking, the&lt;br/&gt;principal investigators propose to apply the methods and&lt;br/&gt;ideas developed in the case of homogeneous spaces to study&lt;br/&gt;rational billiards and dynamics on Teichmuller space.  &lt;br/&gt;The second project is to give a combinatorial approach&lt;br/&gt;to the study of Teichmuller Space and its geometry.  One&lt;br/&gt;of the major goals is to develop a complete analogue&lt;br/&gt;between this theory and the classical theory of the&lt;br/&gt;geometry of the modular curve.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many natural phenomena are studied via the branch of&lt;br/&gt;mathematics known as dynamical systems.  One important&lt;br/&gt;example is planetary motion. Another centuries old example&lt;br/&gt;is the theory of billiards, or the study of collisions of&lt;br/&gt;molecules. Triangular billiards occur in the study of&lt;br/&gt;elastic collisions of two masses in an interval.  The&lt;br/&gt;study of a dynamical system can take many forms. One&lt;br/&gt;example is to study periodic orbits (or repeating&lt;br/&gt;behavior); another is to study choatic behavior.&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigators plan to study a variety of&lt;br/&gt;dynamical systems that occur in mathematics. One of the&lt;br/&gt;prominent topics will be billiards in polygons in the&lt;br/&gt;plane, and a generalization known as flat surfaces.  &lt;br/&gt;These surfaces also fit together into a family known as a&lt;br/&gt;moduli space, and the principal investigators plan to&lt;br/&gt;study dynamics on moduli spaces. A major component of the&lt;br/&gt;project will be educational. The principal investigators&lt;br/&gt;plan to give workshops for students, both at the&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate and graduate levels, in order to introduce&lt;br/&gt;them to these fields of mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
