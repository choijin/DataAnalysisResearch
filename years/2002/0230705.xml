<AbstractNarration>PROPOSAL NO.: 0230705&lt;br/&gt;PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Watkins, Steve&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION NAME: University of Missouri-Rolla&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: "How Things Work" - A Model for Introducing Engineering Concepts to Primary Students&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will create educational resources for primary school teachers dealing with technical literacy and to develop significant interactions between engineering programs and K-12 schools. Unfortunately, many K-12 students lose interest and motivation for science, mathematics, and technology early in their school years. Consequently, technical programs and resources dealing with high school students and, to some extent, middle school students are too late in the educational process. Primary school instruction needs a strong technical component that captures the imagination and stimulates interest of students. Too little work is currently being done to develop the technical abilities of primary teachers and to provide level-appropriate resources for our youngest scholars. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will build a foundation that connects engineering faculty, programs, and resources to elementary teachers, schools, and students. In particular, a comprehensive, multi-course program in science, mathematics, and engineering for primary teachers is a long-term aim. The specific goals for this planning proposal are to facilitate the collaboration among university faculty in education, engineering, and arts and sciences; to increase pre-college student interest and motivation in engineering concepts by developing an innovative prototype course; and to enhance the synergy among university programs, K-12 curriculum, and Missouri teachers. A fundamental aspect of the plan is to involve university faculty, university students, in-service teachers, and parents as partners in the developments. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
