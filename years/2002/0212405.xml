    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Phase I Project is to develop a bioremediation technology for treating groundwater contaminated with N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA). NDMA is a potent carcinogen and an emerging groundwater contaminant in the United States. Accordingly, the State of California has established an acceptable level in drinking water for NDMA of only 20 ng/L. Current technologies for treating NDMA, such as ultraviolet irradiation and carbon adsorption, are expensive and/or ineffective for removing the contaminant to required levels. Envirogen scientists have recently discovered a bacterial strain that is capable of metabolizing NDMA during growth on a second substrate (i.e., by co-metabolism). This bacterium is one of only a few strains that are known to degrade NDMA. In the course of this Phase I project, the biodegradation of NDMA by this organism andby other bacterial strains possessing similar broad specificity oxidase enzymes will be examined. The most effective culture(s) will be seeded into bioreactors and the abilities of these strains to remediate NDMA in groundwater will be quantified. In addition, the potential to&lt;br/&gt;stimulate specific microorganisms in contaminated aquifers to degrade NDMA by cosubstrate application will be tested.&lt;br/&gt; The commercial application of this project is in the area of wastewater treatment linked to municipal drinking water supplies. Additional industrial and military uses of the core technology are also expected.</AbstractNarration>
