    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project focuses on providing ambient power for wireless smart sensor units used for condition-based monitoring. Specifically, this project is to develop a Micro-Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS)-based power-scavenging module. Current research in the area of ambient power has established a strong foundation from which future solutions in the area of condition-based maintenance will take shape. Research will also be performed on rare earth magnets to custom design thin permanent magnets that will produce a high-flux density in the compactly designed system. The proposed component will provide power through the conversion of ambient machine vibration using electromagnetic induction. Design objectives include the optimization of energy-scavenging efficiency in varying environmental conditions, operating conditions, and system types. The proposed system uses MEMS technology to realize small dimensions (one-inch square and less than 0.5 cm. thick) and energy storage capabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Commercial applications include industrial machinery, vehicles, air conditioners, and refrigerators. Additional options are large markets such as building controls and manufacturing.</AbstractNarration>
