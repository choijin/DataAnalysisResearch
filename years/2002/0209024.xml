<AbstractNarration>Lee, Insup&lt;br/&gt;CCR-0209024&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many embedded systems are part of safety-critical applications, e.g.,&lt;br/&gt;avionics systems, manufacturing, automotive controllers, and medical&lt;br/&gt;devices.  The safety-critical nature of embedded applications requires a higher&lt;br/&gt;level of robustness and reliability than is called for in conventional&lt;br/&gt;software systems development.  In the attempt to insure a higher level of&lt;br/&gt;confidence in the design and implementation, current practice merely&lt;br/&gt;increases the duration, frequency, scope, etc. of traditional&lt;br/&gt;verification practices.  The net result is substantially higher&lt;br/&gt;development costs and longer design cycles, leading to a design cycle&lt;br/&gt;where a verification bottleneck is impacting overall operational&lt;br/&gt;effectiveness, efficiency and safety.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks to mitigate the verification bottleneck by identifying&lt;br/&gt;appropriate specification formalisms, and using those formalisms as a&lt;br/&gt;basis to develop fully automated techniques for verifying&lt;br/&gt;implementations using testing.  An important distinguishing &lt;br/&gt;characteristic of the embedded applications listed earlier is the &lt;br/&gt;hybrid (discrete and continuous)nature of behaviors. The continuous &lt;br/&gt;components of embedded systems, and the large state&lt;br/&gt;spaces of all industrially relevant systems, make verification&lt;br/&gt;techniques based on exhaustive exploration of the state space&lt;br/&gt;intractable.  Therefore, it is necessary to approach the verification&lt;br/&gt;problem with techniques based on sampling, i.e., testing.  This requires &lt;br/&gt;abstracting the original system state space to&lt;br/&gt;create a condensed state space that can be explored to determine&lt;br/&gt;valuable points to sample.  Methods of abstraction, methods for&lt;br/&gt;selecting test points, and methods for evaluating the relative merit&lt;br/&gt;of one set of test points vs. another are all issues addressed by this&lt;br/&gt;work. The research also explores the use of traditional&lt;br/&gt;notions of test coverage applied to formal specifications of hybrid&lt;br/&gt;systems.  Test suites are generated using the counterexample or&lt;br/&gt;witness generation techniques of model checkers as well as random path&lt;br/&gt;generations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The practical issues of demonstrating the working techniques, and the&lt;br/&gt;efficacy of these techniques when applied to realistic systems, are&lt;br/&gt;addressed through the implementation of tools that automate all&lt;br/&gt;steps of the process: abstraction, test selection, test derivation,&lt;br/&gt;test application to concrete implementations, and the evaluation of&lt;br/&gt;test results.  Tools are developed on top of the existing&lt;br/&gt;CHARON framework for creating hybrid system models.&lt;br/&gt;Case-study work based on real system specifications and&lt;br/&gt;benefit from interaction with practicing engineers working for Honeywell, a&lt;br/&gt;leader in the development of advanced avionics systems.  One issue is how&lt;br/&gt;to integrate the techniques into development processes that conform &lt;br/&gt;to the DO-178B avionics certification process.&lt;br/&gt;Among the broader impacts that are anticipated from this work are (1)&lt;br/&gt;an increase in awareness of and actual use of formal methods by&lt;br/&gt;practicing developers, and (2) an acceleration of the safety-critical&lt;br/&gt;embedded system development process that will enable the creation of&lt;br/&gt;safer, more reliable systems with shorter development cycle times.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
