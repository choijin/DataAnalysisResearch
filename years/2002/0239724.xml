    <AbstractNarration>This CAREER project addresses fundamental materials science issues associated with spintronics materials systems, magnetic ultrathin films in proximity to insulators and semiconductors. The approach is to develop coordinated UHV in-situ probes of spin polarized transport and surface structure. UHV deposition techniques will be used to control atomic-scale roughness and inter-mixing in films whose transport properties will be measured in-situ. Measurements will be com-pared with ab-initio calculations of spin-polarized transport to understand atomic structure-properties relationships. One of the project aims is to ascertain and develop the potential of giant-magnetoresistive (GMR) spin valves, used widely in ultrahigh density magnetic recording. Over-all, the proposed research strives to demonstrate a path from atomic-level materials understand-ing and design to enhanced device performance in information storage. &lt;br/&gt;%%% &lt;br/&gt;The project addresses fundamental research issues in electronic/magnetic materials science hav-ing technological relevance. An important feature of the project is the strong emphasis on educa-tion, and the integration of research and education. The research program provides excellent op-portunities for hands-on experience in the use of sophisticated scientific equipment, and the in-terdisciplinary approach and technological focus proposed for the research will carry over into undergraduate and graduate Materials Science curriculum development at Columbia, and into outreach activities at local K-12 schools. &lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>
