<AbstractNarration>DMS-0203976&lt;br/&gt;Yair Minsky&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project Minsky will study connections between the geometric&lt;br/&gt;structure of hyperbolic 3-manifolds, and the combinatorial structure&lt;br/&gt;of surfaces. The main focus of the project is a program to solve&lt;br/&gt;Thurston's Ending Lamination Conjecture, which states that a&lt;br/&gt;hyperbolic 3-manifold is uniquely determined by its topological type&lt;br/&gt;and a list of invariants describing the asymptotic geometry of its&lt;br/&gt;ends. This conjecture is central in the field and would settle a&lt;br/&gt;number of outstanding questions about the structure of the deformation&lt;br/&gt;space of all hyperbolic structures on a given manifold.  The principal&lt;br/&gt;tool in this approach is the Complex of Curves, a combinatorial object&lt;br/&gt;which describes the set of all essential homotopy classes of simple&lt;br/&gt;loops on a given surface.  Such a complex, viewed as a metric space,&lt;br/&gt;is hyperbolic in the sense of Cannon and Gromov, and the invariants&lt;br/&gt;which describe the geometry of a 3-manifold turn out to be "points at&lt;br/&gt;infinity" for the complex. A study of geodesics within the complex of&lt;br/&gt;curves then allows us to construct a model for the geometry of the&lt;br/&gt;3-manifold which depends only on its end invariants.  Part of the&lt;br/&gt;program is joint work with Brock and Canary.  The complex of curves is&lt;br/&gt;also instrumental in studying the Teichmuller space of hyperbolic&lt;br/&gt;structures on a surface, and its symmetry group, known as the Mapping&lt;br/&gt;Class Group. Hyperbolicity of the complex implies a type of relative&lt;br/&gt;hyperbolicity property for the Teichmuller space and the Mapping Class&lt;br/&gt;Group, and in collaboration with Brock and Masur, Minsky hopes to&lt;br/&gt;apply this to study the geometric properties of Teichmuller space, and&lt;br/&gt;to answer a number of group-theoretic and algorithmic questions about&lt;br/&gt;the mapping class group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Topological spaces appear in mathematics at varying levels of&lt;br/&gt;abstraction. The earth, for example, can be thought of as a sphere,&lt;br/&gt;spinning around its axis. The set of all positions of this sphere,&lt;br/&gt;perhaps as parameterized by the time of day in New York, can itself be&lt;br/&gt;visualized as a circle.  The positions of the earth in its orbit&lt;br/&gt;around the sun also make up a circle, and all this information&lt;br/&gt;together can be described by a 2-dimensional surface, called a torus,&lt;br/&gt;so that each point in the torus corresponds to exactly one position of&lt;br/&gt;the earth-sun system, and our motion in space gives rise to a&lt;br/&gt;trajectory winding around the torus.  Once a surface is being studied,&lt;br/&gt;we often give it various structures: it can have a metric, which is a&lt;br/&gt;way of measuring distance in it; it can also be filled up in different&lt;br/&gt;ways by loops. The set of all possible metrics can itself be studied&lt;br/&gt;as a "space", where motion in this space corresponds to changing&lt;br/&gt;shapes of the surface. The set of all loops in the surface gives&lt;br/&gt;rise to another space, of a more combinatorial character.  A&lt;br/&gt;fascinating phenomenon, not uncommon in mathematics, is the appearance&lt;br/&gt;of analogies between these different levels of abstraction. For&lt;br/&gt;example, a property of a single metric on a surface called "hyperbolicity"&lt;br/&gt;appears again, in another guise, as a property of the space of all&lt;br/&gt;metrics on the surface and the space of all loops. The interaction&lt;br/&gt;between these different levels yields interesting phenomena and tools&lt;br/&gt;which can be applied to solve a number of problems in&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
