<AbstractNarration>0200681&lt;br/&gt;Streator&lt;br/&gt;This project is a 3-year experimental and theoretical investigation of capillary effects in tribological contacts.  The proposed investigation is motivated by the technological trend for smaller and smaller form factors, leading to higher surface-area-to-volume ratios and an increasing significance of liquid-mediated interfacial adhesion.  Direct measurements of negative capillary pressures will be conducted with several different liquids at sub-micron interfacial spacings, under dynamic conditions.  The liquids to be studied include selected perfluoropolyether (PFPE) oils as well as water.   The effects of liquid properties such a molecular weight, viscosity, polarity and surface tension will be investigated.   Mathematical modeling will be conducted in conjunction with the experiments.    It is anticipated that this work will lead to better models of capillary effects in tribological contacts, thereby providing micro- and nano-system designers with improved mathematical tools.   Graduate and undergraduate students will be exposed to modern experimental and computational methods, and will learn fundamentals of liquid-mediated contact.   Additionally, special efforts will be made to involve under-represented students in this project by taking advantage of an existing NSF-sponsored program at Georgia Tech that provides graduate stipends and undergraduate research funds to under-represented students in engineering and science.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
