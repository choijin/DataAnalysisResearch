<AbstractNarration>EAR-0230336&lt;br/&gt;Raymond M. Russo&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Carpathian arc marks the suture of a now-closed major embayment of&lt;br/&gt;Tethys, the expansive ocean basin that once stretched along the southern&lt;br/&gt;margin of Eurasia from the western Mediterranean to Indochina.  The arc&lt;br/&gt;is unique in several respects:  Closure of the remnant Tethys here entails&lt;br/&gt;some degree of very recent (Miocene-present) continent-continent collision&lt;br/&gt;and disappearance of, most likely, a part of the Tethyan oceanic lithosphere&lt;br/&gt;into the upper mantle.  However, study of Carpathian tectonics may have wide&lt;br/&gt;application, since the processes now visible there must have taken place&lt;br/&gt;elsewhere in the past along the diachronously closing Tethys margin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The unusual seismicity, volcanism, and surface deformation at the Vrancea&lt;br/&gt;bend zone of the Carpathian arc (45.5 N lat., 25.5 E long.) has yielded&lt;br/&gt;a debate about their cause(s):  one viable tectonic scenario invokes&lt;br/&gt;subduction of a piece of Tethyan oceanic lithosphere, a remnant of which&lt;br/&gt;is presumed to be just detaching from continental lithosphere of the&lt;br/&gt;East European and Moesian platforms.  A second model holds that oceanic&lt;br/&gt;lithosphere subduction ended some time in the late Miocene, and that since&lt;br/&gt;then a portion of East European or Moesian platform continental lithosphere&lt;br/&gt;has been delaminating along a horizontal mid-lithospheric interface and&lt;br/&gt;dripping down into the upper mantle.  The predicted distribution of high&lt;br/&gt;velocity `slab' and low velocity asthenosphere in the upper mantle beneath&lt;br/&gt;Vrancea zone differs between these models and can be determined seismically&lt;br/&gt;by a combination of tomography (ongoing in Romania and independent of this&lt;br/&gt;project) and measurements of seismic attenuation and shear wave splitting,&lt;br/&gt;which delineate the distribution of cold lithosphere and warm asthenosphere,&lt;br/&gt;and the flow directions of any upper mantle asthenosphere.  The active&lt;br/&gt;seismicity at Vrancea can be exploited to delimit both slab distribution&lt;br/&gt;and upper mantle flow directions via measurements of seismic attenuation&lt;br/&gt;and shear wave splitting.  Targeted tests of mantle responses to Tethys&lt;br/&gt;closure will include establishment of the presence and thickness of&lt;br/&gt;mantle asthenosphere beneath the study region, observations of mantle&lt;br/&gt;flow directions, estimation of seismic attenuation and associated&lt;br/&gt;inferences concerning mantle temperature fields, and, ultimately, a&lt;br/&gt;strong test of competing hypotheses put forth to explain the unusual&lt;br/&gt;seismicity and volcanism of the Carpathian arc.  Finally, improved&lt;br/&gt;understanding of seismic wave propagation and attenuation in the study&lt;br/&gt;region will directly enhance our understanding of seismic hazard in&lt;br/&gt;this populous area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-- &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
