    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop encapsulation layers for organic light emitting diode (OLED) displays. Cost-effective thin film encapsulation is widely recognized as a crucial key technology needed to capitalize on the full potential of OLED technology. Transparent thin film encapsulation layers deposited at low temperatures and moisture-free ambient are needed for lightweight and low cost OLED displays and microdisplays. This project is focused on novel atomic layer deposition (ALD) techniques that are especially designed for cost-effective encapsulation of OLED devices at process temperatures below 100 C. Traditional ALD techniques are impractically slow at this temperature range and make inefficient usage of chemicals. These problems are circumvented by a combination of efficient ALD process and equipment. Objectives include evaluation of encapsulated OLED device performance and reliability, with corresponding cost analysis. A successful project can mark a breakthrough in the market of portable display devices since adequate thin film encapsulation technologies for OLED devices have not been developed successfully so far. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The OLED market is projected to grow to over $1.6 billion in revenues annually, attributed mostly to microdisplay applications, within the next five years. It is&lt;br/&gt;expected that OLED will play a bigger role in the $50 billion Flat Panel Display (FPD) market in subsequent years. Currently the missing piece in OLED device processing equipment, vacuum-deposition encapsulation technology will provide a substantial competitive edge to process equipment vendors. It can thus signify an entry point for the U.S. to regain a substantial market share in the FPD market.</AbstractNarration>
