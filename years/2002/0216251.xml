<AbstractNarration>A grant has been awarded to the University of Chicago to acquire a Surfac Plasmon resonance (SPR) analyzer. Underlying all biological processes are highly specific interactions between large molecules such as proteins, DNA and RNA.  In order to determine the mechanisms that promote life it is important not only to detect interactions between macromolecules, but to measure their strength using quantitative methods.  The members of our group of research laboratories share an interest in understanding how molecules recognize their specific partners among the huge number of macromolecules in and on cells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The instrument measures the change in light refraction near a surface that occurs when macromolecules interact on that surface. This phenomenon is called surface plasmon resonance (SPR).  SPR allows very rapid and quantitative measurements of interactions between macromolecules.  The instrument has robotic functions that allow automatic processing of many different samples making it possible to test many different interactions under a wide range of conditions with relative ease. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed funding would contribute significantly to the ability of investigators at the University of Chicago to contribute to the understanding of a number of biological processes.  These processes include how pollen recognizes plants of its own species, how hormones recognize specific target cells, how viruses convert inactive virus precursor proteins into active ones, how cells repair their DNA, how cells turn on specific genes so that they are expressed as RNA, and how RNA is modified by large protein-RNA machines.  In addition to advancing our knowledge of the living world, the proposed work will eventually lead to improvements in medicine, agriculture, and industrial manufacturing.  Moreover, the availability of an SPR system will enhance the education of undergraduate and graduate students at the University of Chicago by providing them the opportunity to gain hands on experience with a state-of-the-art method for characterizing the interactions of biomolecules.   The SPR instrument will be part of a series of instruments housed in the Biophysics Core facility. This facility contains several high-end instruments which contribute valuable learning tools for biology students.  The Biophysics facility is one of a number of facilities at the University of Chicago that make the University attractive to a wide variety of students including women and people from underrepresented groups. The University engages in a range of programs designed to specifically attract and retain students from underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
