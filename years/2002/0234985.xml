<AbstractNarration>The purpose of this project 1) to assess the summative impact of (WISE) Women in Science &amp; Enginerring programs and other programs on student career outcomes; 2) to develop a standardized methodology for evaluating student career outcomes and the relationship to participation in WISE programs and related support programs; 3) to pilot-test and evaluate the methodology nationally at selected institutions, to ensure generalizability across institutions, and 4) to disseminate the model methodology nationally. This unique approach will include a web-based format that can be used nationally by institutions, with a back-end database and analysis capability.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Six higher education institutions have been identified to participate as pilot sites. These institutions include: Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ; University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI; University of Puerto Rico, Mayaguez, PR; the University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX; the Florida International University, Miami, FL; and, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA. These six institutions are representative of institutions nationwide, broadly reflect the Carnegie classification of institutions, and provide significant numbers of Hispanic and African-American students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The products that will result from this study will include: 1) a template for a user-friendly data collection method for tracking WISE program and other support program participation and career outcomes, 2) a web-mediated survey instrument and data collection method that institutions nationwide can use and which will be analyzed by CWD and disseminated to participating institutions, 3) an Exit Survey and a Professional Survey to gather career outcomes information, and 4) the results of a pilot-test at six institutions.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
