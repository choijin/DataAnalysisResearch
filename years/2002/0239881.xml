<AbstractNarration>AST 0239881&lt;br/&gt;Witt&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will provide partial funding for the support of travel of young scientists, to make it possible for them to attend an international symposium on the Astrophysics of Dust, scheduled to convene in Estes Park, CO, in May, 2003.This is the first comprehensive symposium dealing with observational, theoretical, and laboratory-based aspects of cosmic dust since 1988, with participants expected from numerous countries from five continents. The coming decade will provide several new space- and ground-based observing facilities whose primary subject will be the study of emissions from and through dusty astrophysical environments.  The full and productive utilization of these facilities will require close collaboration between astronomers and scientists from related disciplines in physics, materials science and chemistry.  The Astrophysics of Dust symposium is intended to provide the forum for close interactions between members of these different groups.  It is of particular importance that young astronomers, just entering the field of dust-related astrophysics, have the ability to participate in this symposium and make the essential professional and personal connections with other colleagues in the field, which will enhance their future scientific contributions to this rapidly growing sub-discipline within astronomy.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
