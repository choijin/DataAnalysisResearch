<AbstractNarration>This supports the development of a low cost, high performance, and fully automated microarray fabrication system expected to lower the cost and increase the accessibility of DNA array-based technology.  Despite the well-recognized significance of gene expression profiling, research activities are currently concentrated in major centers and service facilities with the resources to manage the cost and cycle time associated with preparing and processing DNA microarrays.   Development of an automated system to control spot sizes can increase the density of arrays and reduce their cost. The proposed system is a new generation of microarray spotter capable of depositing aqueous samples of various types (DNA, protein, etc.). The system has the flexibility and cost advantage of the printing approach, and can be operated remotely via the world wide web. The key enabling features include a composite piezoelectric device with nanometer precision in spot size and position.  The system will be connected to the Internet with real-time data streaming and simultaneous multi-client access. This feature will enable 24/7 monitoring of the microarray facilities as well as setting the groundwork for web-based collaborative research between laboratories. It will also complement the dissemination of overall project information via the Internet. Educational components of the project include participation of undergraduate and graduate students in the instrument development effort and summer research opportunities available to high school students from inner city areas. In addition to journal publications, workshop and conference presentations will be used to disseminate the project results to the public.  The project will be conducted within a microarray core facility that has ongoing research projects with 51 collaborators and 14 service users in 24 different institutions across the country. Thus, once developed, this system will promote broad based genomic research by making the technology available to other researchers in the nation and by facilitating collaborative research and education.</AbstractNarration>
