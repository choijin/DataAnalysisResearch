<AbstractNarration>DMS-0211446&lt;br/&gt;Ralph D. Kopperman&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Topology, which grew from Geometry, is the study of shapes and their&lt;br/&gt;behavior under deformation, and of limits. It is an important field in its&lt;br/&gt;own right and has applications in other fields of Mathematics, and also in&lt;br/&gt;a wide range of other sciences including Computer Science, Chemistry,&lt;br/&gt;Physics and Biology.&lt;br/&gt;     The Summer Conference on Topology and its Applications was first held&lt;br/&gt;in New York in 1984; it has been held each summer since then, except 1986.&lt;br/&gt;For most of its existence this series of conferences has been an important&lt;br/&gt;part of the international topological landscape. Most of the participants&lt;br/&gt;have been Americans, but an increasing number come from across the world.&lt;br/&gt;Until 1994, all these conferences were held in the United States, but to&lt;br/&gt;encourage and support worldwide participation, that year the Conference&lt;br/&gt;was held in Amsterdam, and it has since been held in Mexico City and North&lt;br/&gt;Bay (Ontario); about half of the future Summer Conferences are expected to&lt;br/&gt;be held in the United States. The holding of the conference in the&lt;br/&gt;southern hemisphere for the first time, in New Zealand, recognises the&lt;br/&gt;topological strength of that country. It is also expected that this will&lt;br/&gt;lead to increased participation in the conference series by topologists&lt;br/&gt;from south-east Asia and Australia.&lt;br/&gt;     This year the conference will be held at the University of Auckland,&lt;br/&gt;New Zealand, July 1 to 4.
