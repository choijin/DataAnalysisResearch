<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop non-thermal, plasma technology to achieve uniform surface modification of plastic materials at atmospheric pressure in air, without need of significant amounts of a carrier gas. This uniform surface treatment can be achieved flexibly and economically on three-dimensional objects of practical size to a multitude of industries.  In the program, well-characterized flat surfaces of polypropylene will be subjected to plasma treatment using a matrix of experimental conditions to determine surface modification and damage effects as a function of voltage/current characteristics, plasma source configuration and processing speed.  Surface analytical tools such as Scanning Probe Microscopy, Scanning Electron Microscopy, XPS and FTIR will be employed to evaluate changes in surface morphology and surface chemistry.  Changes in surface energy will be gaged by standard wetting tests.  The program will then examine performance with three-dimensional objects of various size and shape and TPO blends of industrial significance. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The proposed program is compelling because the technology offers a major leap forward in surface treatment across a spectrum of major markets.  Typically the surface preparation for finishing involves chemical treatment with highly caustic or acidic agents or with organics, imposing concomitant safety and environmental problems.  The plasma technology of this proposal can be applied in place of many of these processes. Markets include, for example, sterilization or biological activation in the biomedical field and fiber conditioning in optical and composite-fiber technologies.  However, the greatest commercial impact will be to promote better adhesion, whether it be for inks used in labeling, for thin films in electronics or for paints or other coatings to provide color, texture and/or corrosion protection. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
