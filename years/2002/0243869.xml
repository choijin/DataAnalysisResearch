<AbstractNarration>This site is co-funded through a partnership of the Department of Defense and the NSF REU program.&lt;br/&gt;SAGE (Summer of Applied Geophysical Experience) blends teaching and research into a partnership between universities, industry, and federal laboratories.  The summer portion of SAGE is 4 weeks long for REU; an additional week is scheduled in early January for follow-up and advanced research.  SAGE faculty come from seven universities and a national laboratory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary goal of the REU portion of SAGE is to actively involve undergraduate students in all phases of exciting, applied geophysical research using the newest field equipment and latest computer processing/interpretation tools.  The SAGE REU site has 15 REU students of the 25-30 students (including graduate students) that attend SAGE each year.  A target to have one-half underrepresented REU students at SAGE has been achieved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students at SAGE participate in every phase of a geophysical research program:  they collect data with modern equipment; they process, model, and interpret the data with workstations and PC's; and they present their results in both oral and written form.  First the students are introduced to fundamental scientific principles involved when applying geophysics to geologic problems.  Then there are interactive discussions on what the objectives of the field research are, what geophysical techniques will be used and why, and how the data will be collected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The central activity of SAGE is the hands-on collection and interpretation of field research data.  Students work with faculty, teaching assistants, and industry experts in a variety of geophysical surveys such as seismic reflection, seismic refraction, gravity, magnetics and electromagnetics including manetotellurics.  Industry contributions include visits from professionals, evening discussions, financial donations, and free equipment use and software loans.  This allows a high level of technical expertise not available at most college campuses.</AbstractNarration>
