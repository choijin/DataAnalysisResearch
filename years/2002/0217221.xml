<AbstractNarration>                                                                                                                                                                                 The vast success of products like the "GameBoy" sends a clear message that technology is&lt;br/&gt;the domain of boys. The Girls Creating Games Program is a demonstration project designed&lt;br/&gt;to challenge this message by teaching girls to design and program a computer game. This &lt;br/&gt;project is unique in its approach: it puts girls in the role of producers of technology, rather &lt;br/&gt;than simply consumers. One hundred eighty middle school girls will participate in a study &lt;br/&gt;to determine whether producing technology (computer game design) can increase girls'&lt;br/&gt;fluency, interest, active participation and persistence in technology studies. The&lt;br/&gt;specific project goals are to a)increase girls' knowledge, interest, attitudes, and&lt;br/&gt;confidence with computers, b) increase adults capacity to support girls in technology,&lt;br/&gt;and c) add to research on the kinds of programs and technologies that increase the interest &lt;br/&gt;and persistence of middle school girls in technology studies and careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will take place with small groups of girls after school and during&lt;br/&gt;the summer in a small, urban county (70% White, 21% Hispanic) in California.  It involves an&lt;br/&gt;unusual partnership between four entities: 1) researchers and program developers from a &lt;br/&gt;non-profit health promotion agency (ETR Associates); 2) school personnel and students&lt;br/&gt;from New Brighton Middle School; 3) staff and youth from a Boys &amp; Girls Club; and 4) &lt;br/&gt;female technology students, teachers, and professionals from local colleges and&lt;br/&gt;companies. This partnership is essential for building knowledge (e.g., identifying&lt;br/&gt;effective program strategies to increase girls interest and persistence in&lt;br/&gt;technology studies), and increasing social capital (e.g., building the capacity of&lt;br/&gt;adult female role models, teachers, and staff to provide a supportive environment).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Teaching computer game design holds great promise as an intervention strategy for&lt;br/&gt;increasing girls' interest in technology. Indeed, interactive games have an early&lt;br/&gt;influence on theskills and attitudes that are the best predictors of future &lt;br/&gt;technology-related behavior (Greenfield &amp; Cocking, 1996; Levine &amp; Donitsa-Schmidt,&lt;br/&gt;1998; Subrahmanyam &amp; Greenfield, 1998).  Only two other known programs (with &lt;br/&gt;elementary and high school students) have used game creation as an intervention &lt;br/&gt;strategy or as part of a research-driven agenda (Kafai, 1995; Miller, Chaika, &amp;&lt;br/&gt;Groppe, 1996).  Our work extends that research by working with middle school students &lt;br/&gt;in an informal learning (out of school) environment, and using theoretically and&lt;br/&gt;empirically-based program activities that build on girls development research. &lt;br/&gt;Our project is also innovative in that it includes identity formation as part of the&lt;br/&gt;program as a way to transform, not simply respond to existing gender roles&lt;br/&gt;(Cassell &amp; Jenkins, 1999). Our program strategies are designed to appeal to girls.&lt;br/&gt;They include having fun with computers; linking technology with its real-world &lt;br/&gt;application; focusing the game content on social issues; using a collaborative &lt;br/&gt;instructional model; involving technical female role models, school teachers and &lt;br/&gt;program staff; and assessing the impact of game design on participants as well as&lt;br/&gt;the teachers and staff.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed intervention will be evaluated using a quasi-experimental, pre-post test&lt;br/&gt;design. Two hypotheses will be tested.  First, compared to the control group, the &lt;br/&gt;participants in the intervention group will report a greater increase in problem-solving&lt;br/&gt;and computer skills, interest in computers, positive attitude toward computers, intention &lt;br/&gt;to pursue computer studies, confidence using computers, knowledge about tech careers,&lt;br/&gt;and support to pursue a career in technology.  Second, the instructional model that uses &lt;br/&gt;collaboration with peers and guidance from teachers, staff, and female role models &lt;br/&gt;will increase the adults' capacity and interest to support girls active participation&lt;br/&gt; in technology, and challenge stereotypes about who is good at computers. Data will &lt;br/&gt;be collected using surveys, interviews, and student notebooks. The findings will result &lt;br/&gt;in a replicable version of the program that can be used to increase girls interest in &lt;br/&gt;technology and adults capacity to support them in other school and after school settings.</AbstractNarration>
