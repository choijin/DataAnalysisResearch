<AbstractNarration>This project develops time-domain solvers for wave propagation problems&lt;br/&gt;in two and three dimensions, with fundamentally improved properties,&lt;br/&gt;namely, significantly reduced sampling requirements and, at the same&lt;br/&gt;time, significantly higher accuracy.  Such solvers would allow modeling&lt;br/&gt;of linear and, eventually, nonlinear wave propagation in domains that&lt;br/&gt;are thousands of characteristic wavelengths in size, with interfaces and&lt;br/&gt;variable coefficients.  This approach would also provide improved bases&lt;br/&gt;for solving nonlinear advection-diffusion problems.  The solvers are&lt;br/&gt;built upon two new techniques, namely, optimal quadratures to represent&lt;br/&gt;bandlimited functions, and a numerical generalization of separation of&lt;br/&gt;variables to accelerate applying higher-dimensional operators.  Each&lt;br/&gt;technique contains the potential to significantly advance computational&lt;br/&gt;science across a wide range of applications.  Together they provide a&lt;br/&gt;new paradigm that efficiently organizes the information contained in&lt;br/&gt;operators governing physical phenomena.  This project develops these&lt;br/&gt;techniques further, and develops multiresolution representations for&lt;br/&gt;operators and functions, based on the optimal quadratures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Any computational modeling of natural phenomena requires discretization&lt;br/&gt;of the underlying mathematical equations. This project addresses&lt;br/&gt;questions of optimality and efficiency of such discretizations, and of&lt;br/&gt;organization of information for two important modeling areas, wave&lt;br/&gt;propagation and geophysical fluid dynamics.  This research aims to&lt;br/&gt;generate a much wider use of efficient techniques for representing&lt;br/&gt;information in scientific modeling, and to increase the speed and&lt;br/&gt;accuracy of simulations by up to two orders of magnitude, with&lt;br/&gt;foreseeable benefits to such areas as seismology, remote sensing,&lt;br/&gt;acoustics, optics, geophysical fluid dynamics, and quantum chemistry. It&lt;br/&gt;would reduce the computational cost of obtaining high accuracy, which is&lt;br/&gt;necessary to describe phenomena that are highly sensitive to changes in&lt;br/&gt;physical parameters, and that often cause technological bottlenecks.&lt;br/&gt;This Collaborative Research is led by the Department of Applied&lt;br/&gt;Mathematics at the University of Colorado at Boulder, and includes the&lt;br/&gt;Department of Meteorology at the University of Maryland at College&lt;br/&gt;Park.  It will fund one research associate, two visiting scientists from&lt;br/&gt;UMD and Ohio University, and one graduate student in a diverse research&lt;br/&gt;group that includes a research associate, two postdoctoral researchers,&lt;br/&gt;a graduate student, and four undergraduate students.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
