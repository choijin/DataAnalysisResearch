<AbstractNarration> This dissertation investigates how Danes mobilized in 1943 to rescue Danish Jews from Nazi deportation.  Unlike rescue efforts in other parts of occupied Europe, the Danish case was a nationwide collective movement.  The research should clarify the conditions facilitating high risk activism.  The Danish case will be compared with two other cases: the Netherlands (a similar culture without a collective response) and Le Chambon, France (a similar although smaller collective response, but a different culture).  The research will use archival data and interviews with participants to analyze the sources of the Danish movement.  Close attention will be paid to the role of social networks and the development of inclusive collective identities.  Pre-existing social networks connected by strong ties between separate clusters of people may be especially important for enabling this kind of high risk mobilization.  These networks are relatively uncommon since strong ties usually characterize overlapping but separate groups.  The usual use of weak ties to bridge those groups is not effective in high risk situations for which high trust is necessary to initiate mobilization attempts.      &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
