    <AbstractNarration>Janusz Konrad&lt;br/&gt;Boston University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is concerned with the processing of visual information captured by a video camera. To date, image sequences have been typically analyzed and processed in groups of two frames; by differentiating one &lt;br/&gt;frame from another, short-term image dynamics can be measured, such as changed areas (e.g., occlusions) or pixel displacements. Although the approach has been very successful to date (e.g., MPEG compression &lt;br/&gt;standards), further gains are difficult to attain based on two image frames only. This research project offers a different approach to the analysis of image sequences - one based on a joint processing of multiple &lt;br/&gt;image frames at a time. This joint treatment of, for example, 10 or 20 frames is expected to result in new gains in video compression, more reliable video database querying, and more accurate detection of &lt;br/&gt;innovations (occlusion and exposure areas) that are of interest in surveillance applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary problem attacked in the project is the joint space-time segmentation of an image sequence into "object tunnels", i.e., 3-D volumes carved out in the space of horizontal, vertical and temporal coordinates &lt;br/&gt;by a moving object. The estimation of object tunnels is approached as a volume competition problem, and solved using active-surface evolution equations embedded into the level-set solution framework. In order to &lt;br/&gt;model motion of points within each object tunnel, a new spatially-parametric, temporally-quadratic motion model is studied. Various cost functionals relating object-tunnel intensities to the underlying motion are investigated. Since the standard volume competition can only extract a single moving object from background, an extension to more objects by means of multiple "repelling" surfaces evolving simultaneously is studied as well.</AbstractNarration>
