<AbstractNarration>In the past few decades, R&amp;D efforts have resulted in production of high performance materials, which are stronger and more durable than before. We have also learned that many deterioration processes in our structures involve deleterious chemical reactions, rate-controlled by ionic transport, which lead to degradation of the physical properties of the material. Developments in sensing technology in the past decade have enabled us to measure the physical damage caused by these chemical reactions. However, with a few exceptions, tools for real-time monitoring and evaluation of the chemical environment of the system from within are not available. Availability of this information will help optimize repair and replacement strategies, and it will lead to significant reductions in rehabilitation costs. &lt;br/&gt;Development of a family of fiber optic chemical sensors for real-time distributed monitoring of civil and mechanical systems is proposed. The proposed chemical sensor comprises an optical fiber with a sensitive fluorescent polymer cladding/coating, whose absorption and emission properties are altered by interaction with its environment. This interaction that leads to emission of specific wavelength by the target-specific fluorophore, provides a highly selective and sensitive process for distributed chemical sensing of chlorides, calcium, oxygen, pH and more.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
