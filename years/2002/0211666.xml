<AbstractNarration>The overall goal of this proposal is to develop a prototype for a new type of collaborative education&lt;br/&gt; that meets broad and expanding needs in the areas of nanoscience and nanotechnology that will build on the research and educational strengths of the University of Washington (UW) and Pacific Northwest National&lt;br/&gt;Laboratory (PNNL) and their newly formed UW-PNNL Joint Institute for Nanoscience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is primarily targeted to speed up undergraduate and graduate entry into the&lt;br/&gt;nanotechnology field and enhance education and research by developing a new series of&lt;br/&gt;interdisciplinary nanotechnology courses taught via a combination of local and remote&lt;br/&gt;instruction. These courses will be taught by faculty at the University of Washington and&lt;br/&gt;by researchers at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and be taken by students at both&lt;br/&gt;locations, as well as other locations around the state, region, and country. Some of the&lt;br/&gt;course offerings will be specifically oriented to making introductory interdisciplinary&lt;br/&gt;nanotechnology courses available to students at smaller undergraduate institutions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;Additional nanotechnology offerings will attract undergraduates into the nanotechnology&lt;br/&gt;program and train future leaders for industry by providing hands-on research experience&lt;br/&gt;and contact with faculty and researchers both within and outside of the UW. They will&lt;br/&gt;broaden the nanotechnology curriculum and provide opportunities for students to explore&lt;br/&gt;individual research projects and to collaborate with each other and with faculty and&lt;br/&gt;researchers at both locations. The program will contribute to the interdisciplinary PhD&lt;br/&gt;program in nanotechnology and other relevant sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The courses to be developed will increase distance learning curriculum offerings, while&lt;br/&gt; also providing a new model of teaching/learning that can be adopted in other disciplines&lt;br/&gt; and across other geographies to enhance research, education, and faculty/student collaboration.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
