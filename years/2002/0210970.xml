    <AbstractNarration>The focus of the SGER grant is on a new processing technique based on mechanical milling that involves chemical reaction during milling process. The method eliminates the traditional leaching process that is usually required to isolate the metal from by-product salts. The process involves introducing aluminum as a reducing agent, in place of Mg, Ca or Na. The starting material is metal chloride and the by-product aluminum chloride can be separated by vacuum distillation in lieu of leaching thereby eliminating the usually noted surface oxidation. The proof-of-concept will be checked in processing nickel aluminide starting from nickel chloride with aluminum. The resulting powder is consolidated by pressing at slightly high temperatures that will result in fine-grained alloy. The production of NiAl by this new method will be very cost-effective because of the low processing temperature and the valuable by-product. The technique once proven and established will be applicable for other aluminides that find extensive application as high-temperature structural material.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new technique of using Al as a reducing agent during mechanochemical reaction eliminates the usually required second step of leaching that in general results in surface oxidation. This process once proven effective can be adopted for processing of many other metal alloys with superior purity along with substantial cost reduction.</AbstractNarration>
