<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT DMS - 0204002.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI's first program in this proposal is concerned with the &lt;br/&gt;geometry of Hermitian or hyper-Hermitian connections with totally &lt;br/&gt;skew torsions. The results will be applicable to an investigation &lt;br/&gt;in quantum mechanical black holes. The PI's second program is to &lt;br/&gt;study the complex deformation theory and Hermitian geometry of &lt;br/&gt;nilmanifolds. Parallel to the algebraic analysis on the classical &lt;br/&gt;and extended moduli, he and his collaborators investigatge the &lt;br/&gt;geometry on these spaces from the viewpoint of special holonomy &lt;br/&gt;and symplectic structures. A senior participant proposes to &lt;br/&gt;analyse the structures of compact quaternionic Kaehler manifolds &lt;br/&gt;and the A-hat genus of non-spin manifolds with finite second &lt;br/&gt;homotopy. Both issues are tackled through an analysis of the &lt;br/&gt;rigidity of elliptic genus. Through the theory of elliptic genus, &lt;br/&gt;the two proposers will jointly calculate a Hilbert polynomial &lt;br/&gt;relevant to holomorphic contact structures or rational curves &lt;br/&gt;invariant with respect to a holomorphic automorphisms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed projects here are enabled by theoretical physicists' &lt;br/&gt;and mathematicians' knowledge on field theory, complex deformation &lt;br/&gt;theory and differential topology of fixed point sets. All proposed &lt;br/&gt;projects are intended to address issues relevant to current &lt;br/&gt;physcial or mathematical issues. The PI's projects will address a &lt;br/&gt;type of geometry less  known to mathematicians than to physicists. &lt;br/&gt;The results will increase mathematicians' knowledge on Hermitian &lt;br/&gt;geometry and directly addresses issues to theoretical physcists' &lt;br/&gt;concerns. The senior participant's project addresses a long-&lt;br/&gt;standing conjecture in the field of holonomy. The central tool in &lt;br/&gt;this project is a novel differntial topological mechinary for &lt;br/&gt;studying fixed point sets with respect to group actions. The &lt;br/&gt;investigators joint project will combine their expertise to &lt;br/&gt;extract topological information on a class ofspace central in &lt;br/&gt;algebraic geometry.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
