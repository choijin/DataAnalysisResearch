<AbstractNarration>This Faculty Early Career Development project describes an effort to integrate innovative educational and research activities as a basis for an active career in both areas. A dearth of science majors is a national problem with serious implications for the country's technological future. The education component of this plan focuses on attracting and retaining physics majors by improving the class work and general environment of the University of Connecticut undergraduate physics program. Pedagogical efforts will apply strategies that have proved successful for large introductory courses to smaller courses for physics majors. Student advising efforts include seminars for undergraduates on graduate school, careers, and invited presentations from past UConn physics graduates on their career choices. Advanced education and training along with the creation of new knowledge is promoted through research into fundamental properties of nanometer scale films of complex, functional oxides. An array of advanced surface science probes will be brought to bear on in-situ grown films in order to study questions concerning reduced dimensionality, strain, and non-equilibrium structures. The focus will be on understanding properties that are strongly altered in very thin films, particularly phase transitions. The project will serve as a nexus for establishing interdisciplinary research at UConn and foster ties with national laboratories. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Faculty Early Career Development project describes an effort to integrate innovative educational and research activities as a basis for an active career in both areas.

Student advising efforts include seminars for undergraduates on graduate school, careers, and invited presentations from past University of Connecticut physics graduates on their career choices. Advanced education and training along with the creation of new knowledge is promoted through research into fundamental properties of nanometer scale films of complex, electronic materials. Under the proper conditions, very thin films show properties that are remarkably different from the bulk versions of the same compounds. However, such films are difficult to study with traditional techniques and the reasons for the altered properties are largely unknown. This project will adapt very powerful experimental techniques usually used on large bulk samples for use with films. The project will serve as a nexus for establishing interdisciplinary research at UConn and foster ties with national laboratories.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
