<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;NSF Proposal DMS - 0204730: Rafe Mazzeo&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work in this project involves the continuing&lt;br/&gt;development of analytic tools to study a variety of problems&lt;br/&gt;in geometric analysis. These include the global theory of&lt;br/&gt;the moduli space of constant mean curvature surfaces in Euclidean&lt;br/&gt;space, the application of new gluing techniques to construct&lt;br/&gt;new types of Einstein metrics, a more detailed study of the&lt;br/&gt;analytic and geometric behaviour of conformally compact Einstein&lt;br/&gt;metrics and the deformation theory of such metrics, with special&lt;br/&gt;attention to self-dual conformally compact Einstein metrics in&lt;br/&gt;four dimensions. The proposed techniques here include further&lt;br/&gt;extensions of Cauchy data matching, as developed by the PI and&lt;br/&gt;Pacard, as well as refinements of the PI's `edge calculus'.Abstract for &lt;br/&gt;Other parts of the proposal involve use of the pseudodifferential&lt;br/&gt;calculus of fibred boundary operators, as developed by the PI and&lt;br/&gt;Melrose, to the study of gravitational instantons, particularly&lt;br/&gt;their L2 cohomology. Finally, the PI and Vasy propose to&lt;br/&gt;investigate the connections between geometric scattering theory&lt;br/&gt;on symmetric spaces of rank greater than one, as well as a&lt;br/&gt;class of spaces asymptotically modelled on these, and the&lt;br/&gt;microlocal theory of quantum N-body scattering. For the human&lt;br/&gt;resources component, the PI proposes to continue his directorship&lt;br/&gt;of the Stanford University Math Camp, a residential summer&lt;br/&gt;program for talented high school students, and also to continue&lt;br/&gt;his other outreach efforts to disseminate mathematics appreciation&lt;br/&gt;to the general public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From a more general point of view, the PI's research concerns&lt;br/&gt;problems arising in geometry and analysis involving what are&lt;br/&gt;known as curvature equations (the theory of Einstein metrics in&lt;br/&gt;general relativity being the best-known case) as well as scattering&lt;br/&gt;theory on spaces which possess high degrees of symmetry `at infinity'.&lt;br/&gt;A central concern throughout is the application of somewhat novel&lt;br/&gt;techniques from harmonic and microlocal analysis to these problems. The&lt;br/&gt;theme is that one should develop analytic techniques which are&lt;br/&gt;specifically adapted to each geometric problem, and these geometric&lt;br/&gt;settings in turn should suggest new developments in the analytic&lt;br/&gt;technology. This approach has proved very successful in the PI's&lt;br/&gt;previous research. The problems considered here are inspired by main&lt;br/&gt;trends in various aspects of mathematical physics, most specifically&lt;br/&gt;the two somewhat separate fields of quantum scattering and some parts&lt;br/&gt;of string theory. Some of the current and proposed work has already&lt;br/&gt;stimulated interest on the part of some communities of physicists,&lt;br/&gt;and their intuitions provide an interesting guide for further mathematical&lt;br/&gt;directions in this work. Beyond these motivations, the PI regards this&lt;br/&gt;particular interplay between geometry and analysis as an important one,&lt;br/&gt;particularly because the types of geometric objects studied here are&lt;br/&gt;becoming increasingly important in many other places in mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;The PI has also undertaken extensive human resources development,&lt;br/&gt;including the above-mentioned summer program, and is active in&lt;br/&gt;mentoring a number of young researchers.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
