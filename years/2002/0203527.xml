<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT - DMS 0203527&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Geometric tomography uses data concerning sections by planes and&lt;br/&gt;projections on planes of geometric objects to obtain information&lt;br/&gt;about these objects.  The latter include general compact sets,&lt;br/&gt;but often they are convex bodies, polytopes, star-shaped bodies,&lt;br/&gt;or finite sets.  One advantage of this setting is that it becomes&lt;br/&gt;more probable that inverse problems have a unique solution.&lt;br/&gt;Generally, the a priori knowledge that the unknown object is of&lt;br/&gt;uniform density can be exploited to retrieve more information&lt;br/&gt;than would otherwise be possible.  This can lead to algorithms&lt;br/&gt;that are more effective when few measurements are available, and&lt;br/&gt;less sensitive to measurement errors or noise.  Geometric&lt;br/&gt;tomography has links to functional analysis, convex geometry,&lt;br/&gt;Minkowski geometry, and combinatorics. The project will continue&lt;br/&gt;the development of geometric tomography.  New directions include&lt;br/&gt;an extension of Lutwak's dual Brunn-Minkowski theory by the&lt;br/&gt;introduction of moments of sets; work towards a coherent discrete&lt;br/&gt;Brunn-Minkowski theory that applies to finite sets, with volume&lt;br/&gt;replaced by cardinality; and an investigation into the&lt;br/&gt;possibility of a Brunn-Minkowski theory for capacity. In related&lt;br/&gt;applications, the plan is to consolidate links between geometric&lt;br/&gt;tomography and a practical method called local stereology, and to&lt;br/&gt;solve an inverse problem concerning finite sets with an&lt;br/&gt;application to medical imaging. New discoveries about&lt;br/&gt;intersection bodies are anticipated, with an application to the&lt;br/&gt;reconstruction of star bodies from the volumes of their sections&lt;br/&gt;through the origin. Also included is a program designed to&lt;br/&gt;stimulate undergraduate research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CAT scanners are machines that save lives daily.  They take&lt;br/&gt;X-rays in a number of different directions, and synthesize the&lt;br/&gt;information to create an image of a two-dimensional section of&lt;br/&gt;part of the body.  The mathematics behind this process is called&lt;br/&gt;computerized tomography.  It is very successful, but not perfect;&lt;br/&gt;the reconstructed image is only approximate, and to get a better&lt;br/&gt;picture with the same procedure one has to take more X-rays,&lt;br/&gt;causing greater expense and likelihood of side effects.  In&lt;br/&gt;geometric tomography, only homogeneous objects are allowed - the&lt;br/&gt;density of the object is the same everywhere inside it.  An&lt;br/&gt;example from medicine would be a bone or a kidney.  One can use&lt;br/&gt;this information to find better reconstruction procedures.  The&lt;br/&gt;scope of geometric tomography is actually much wider.  Any&lt;br/&gt;measurement involving sections of a homogeneous object by lines&lt;br/&gt;or planes or its shadows on lines or planes can be considered.&lt;br/&gt;Because of this, it has many links to other areas, both in&lt;br/&gt;mathematics (there is a large overlap with convex geometry, the&lt;br/&gt;geometry of shapes without holes or dents) and outside.  For&lt;br/&gt;example, a new technique called local stereology depends on&lt;br/&gt;measurements of planar sections of biological tissue; each section&lt;br/&gt;passes through a fixed point, usually the nucleus of a cell, and&lt;br/&gt;the measurements can be made optically rather than physically.&lt;br/&gt;This project continues the development of several aspects of the&lt;br/&gt;mathematics of geometric tomography. Also included is a program&lt;br/&gt;designed to stimulate undergraduate research.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
