<AbstractNarration>The University of California at Berkeley together with CUREE (the Consortium of Universities for Research in Earthquake Engineering) have planned a symposium in honor of Emeritus Professors Ray Clough and Joseph Penzien to be held on the Berkeley campus on May 9-11, 2002. The event recognizes the notable contributions made by two of the most influential researchers and educators in structural and earthquake engineering.  The wide-ranging careers of Professors Ray Clough and Joseph Penzien at UC Berkeley included teaching, research and consulting on topics such as the finite element method; shake table testing; seismic analysis and design of dams, bridges, water tanks, offshore structures, power plants, and buildings; analysis of strong ground motion records; and development of seismic design criteria.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Symposium features a technical program having broad appeal for practicing engineers, researchers, teachers and students. The program combines historical perspectives of structural and earthquake engineering with state-of-the-art discussions on topics represented by the seminal works of the honorees. Attention is given to emerging technologies, including those related to the Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES) and to protective devices and sensors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program is particularly valuable to junior faculty starting careers in structural and earthquake engineering, as it provides them an opportunity to have a four-decade perspective of the field as well as an appreciation of the contributions of the two noted pioneers. They also have an opportunity to hear about emerging technologies and the future directions in the fields of structural and earthquake engineering. The opportunity to mingle with the giants of the field in an inviting technical environment is one that will make a lasting impression on the junior faculty in particular.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
