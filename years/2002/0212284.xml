    <AbstractNarration>Despite current interest in tropical forests as key components of the global carbon&lt;br/&gt;cycle and as centers of biodiversity,we remain largely ignorant of the inter-relationships&lt;br/&gt;among forest attributes (e.g.,dynamics,diversity,structure),and the physical properties&lt;br/&gt;of the environments in which these forests grow.In recent years datasets have become&lt;br/&gt;available describing growth,mortality and recruitment of approximately 10%of the&lt;br/&gt;global diversity of tropical tree species.These data result from the development of a&lt;br/&gt;network of large-scale forest dynamics plots coordinated by the Center for Tropical&lt;br/&gt;Forest Science (CTFS),and established using methods identical to those used to survey&lt;br/&gt;and census the 50-ha Forest Dynamics Plot on Barro Colorado Island (BCI),Panama.&lt;br/&gt;Just as data from the BCI plot have played a prominent role in our understanding of the&lt;br/&gt;community-level consequences of ecological processes played out at local scales,we will&lt;br/&gt;show how these plots now provide an unprecedented opportunity to examine a venerable&lt;br/&gt;question in tropical ecology:How do soil-borne resources influence the variation in forest&lt;br/&gt;structure and demographic turnover rates observed among plots,and among habitat types&lt;br/&gt;within plots?&lt;br/&gt;To achieve this objective we propose three sets of measurements.At nine plot&lt;br/&gt;sites we will characterize variation in soil-moisture availability through the year and&lt;br/&gt;throughout the plots using a hydrological model (TOPMODEL).This model predicts&lt;br/&gt;soil-moisture saturation deficit based on rainfall,stream-flow data and local topography.&lt;br/&gt;Second,at five plots currently lacking soils data we will sample soil-chemical properties&lt;br/&gt;within standardized,topographically-defined habitat types.Third,at the same plots we&lt;br/&gt;will perform seedling growth experiments using mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal&lt;br/&gt;pioneer species to assess plant-availability of soil nutrients for each habitat type.These&lt;br/&gt;measurements will allow us to address questions at two spatial scales.At the among-plot&lt;br/&gt;scale we will be able to ask how stem density and basal area,as well as community-wide&lt;br/&gt;patterns of growth,mortality and recruitment,correlate with moisture availability and soil&lt;br/&gt;fertility.At the within-plot scale we will ask whether species exhibit specialization to&lt;br/&gt;particular hydrological niches,and whether habitat types differ in soil fertility,in&lt;br/&gt;turnover rates,and in local species richness.Resolution of these broad questions&lt;br/&gt;concerning correlations among soil-borne resources and characteristics of the vegetation&lt;br/&gt;will in turn permit us to refine future hypotheses aimed at understanding the mechanistic&lt;br/&gt;basis for interspecific variation in demographics and distribution.&lt;br/&gt;This study will provide the first standardized large-scale measurements of the&lt;br/&gt;environmental context within which tropical forests grow.Our trans-continental approach&lt;br/&gt;to testing questions of ecosystem function and community organization has rarely been&lt;br/&gt;attempted,but it will be essential if we are to improve our understanding of the&lt;br/&gt;biogeographic and biophysical limits to our ecological generalizations.Understanding&lt;br/&gt;how variation in water and nutrient availability determines forest structure,composition&lt;br/&gt;and dynamics,and potentially influences local diversity through niche partitioning,will&lt;br/&gt;be essential to predicting future vegetation responses to climate change and will also&lt;br/&gt;provide a first step in guiding management to protect forest diversity.Wide dissemination&lt;br/&gt;and application of the results of this project is ensured by the active participation of in-&lt;br/&gt;country collaborators,and by data sharing through CTFS.</AbstractNarration>
