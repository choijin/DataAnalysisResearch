<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to investigate the role played by diverse representational modes&lt;br/&gt;in the learning of physics and chemistry concepts. We will explore the relationship between the&lt;br/&gt;form of representation of complex concepts in physics and chemistry, and students' ability to learn&lt;br/&gt;these concepts. We will determine the specific learning difficulties that arise as students struggle to&lt;br/&gt;master concepts posed in different representational forms, and we will apply our findings&lt;br/&gt;immediately to the development of improved curricular materials and instructional methods. We&lt;br/&gt;will then assess the effectiveness of these new materials and methods in bringing about greater&lt;br/&gt;student mastery of the targeted concepts.  The issues we will investigate include the following:&lt;br/&gt;1) What subject-specific learning difficulties may be identified with various forms of&lt;br/&gt;representation of particular concepts in the introductory physics and chemistry curriculum?&lt;br/&gt;2) What generalizations may be possible regarding the relative degree of difficulty of various&lt;br/&gt;representational modes when compared with each other, in learning of particular concepts?&lt;br/&gt;3) Do individual students do consistently well or poorly with particular forms of representation,&lt;br/&gt;with widely varying types of subject matter?&lt;br/&gt;4) Are there any consistent correlations among students' relative performance with different&lt;br/&gt;representational modes, and parameters such as major field, gender, age, learning style, etc.?&lt;br/&gt;5) Does the overuse or under-use of certain types of representational&lt;br/&gt;forms in standard instruction have any potential impact on members of traditionally&lt;br/&gt;underrepresented groups? Test instruments, consisting of sets of closely matched problems presented in several different forms of representation, will be administered simultaneously to all students in a class.&lt;br/&gt;Analysis of students' responses will allow us to determine whether the learning difficulties are&lt;br/&gt;concept-related or representation-related, or both. We will develop and validate many of these&lt;br/&gt;closely matched problem sets, dealing with a wide variety of basic topics in the introductory&lt;br/&gt;curricula. These will be administered to students enrolled in both algebra-based and calculus-based&lt;br/&gt;courses, at Iowa State University and at other institutions. We will also conduct and record many&lt;br/&gt;clinical interviews with individual students in order to probe in more depth their understanding of&lt;br/&gt;multiple representations. As we identify widespread learning difficulties related to representational&lt;br/&gt;mode, we will develop and test curricular materials specifically designed to address and remedy&lt;br/&gt;these obstacles to learning.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
