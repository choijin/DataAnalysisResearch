<AbstractNarration>Abstract - CAREER: Distributed Multi-Objective Optimization for the Construction of Large-Scale Transportation Systems &lt;br/&gt;Recent applications of performance-based contracting methods in the construction of transportation systems present decision makers in the construction industry with new and serious challenges that require: (1) optimizing the utilization of construction resources to satisfy multiple and conflicting contractual objectives; (2) solving large-scale construction optimization problems; and (3) maintaining optimality for the developed plans in a dynamic construction environment. &lt;br/&gt;This CAREER project addresses these new and vital challenges using an integrated research and education plan. The research plan focuses on the development of an innovative Information Technology Framework for Optimizing Construction Utilization of Resources in Transportation Systems, named IT-FOCUS. The main research objectives of IT-FOCUS are to: (a) develop robust multi-objective optimization models; (b) formulate scalable methodologies for solving large-scale optimization problems; and (c) explore dynamic frameworks for revising optimal plans whenever and wherever needed. The education plan promotes the education of optimization and information technology in construction engineering and management. The main objectives of this plan are to: (a) incorporate research developments into new and existing courses; (b) use IT-FOCUS as an effective educational tool; (c) expand student advising and mentoring activities; (e) increase participation of students from underrepresented groups; and (f) disseminate research findings to the construction engineering community.   &lt;br/&gt;The integrated research and education plan provides promising broad impacts on construction engineering research, construction education, and society. First, the research developments have strong potential to advance knowledge in distributed multi-objective optimization of construction resources. Second, the educational activities will enhance the education of construction optimization and IT for undergraduate and graduate students. Third, the societal benefits of optimizing the utilization of construction resources in transportation systems include: improving cost effectiveness of public expenditures on these systems, accelerating the revitalization of aging transportation facilities, minimizing construction-related service disruptions, improving construction quality and safety, and reducing negative impacts of construction on the environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
