<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;A central question in community ecology is how species diversity will typically respond to&lt;br/&gt;the removal of a one or a few species. Are species highly redundant so that the loss of one species&lt;br/&gt;is easily compensated for by other, functionally equivalent species? Or, do species tend to play&lt;br/&gt;unique functional roles so that the loss of one species can propagate out to cause a catastrophic&lt;br/&gt;loss of diversity. These questions assume ever greater practical importance as the global wave of&lt;br/&gt;extinctions accelerates. And, although some progress has been made in simple model systems, we&lt;br/&gt;still have a vague understanding of more complex communities with dynamics that evolve over&lt;br/&gt;large temporal and spatial scales. It is not clear whether anthropogenically induced extinction of&lt;br/&gt;individual species will generally cascade across these communities. Most notably, we have little&lt;br/&gt;ability to predict how the mounting loss of the largest mammals to hunting is likely to affect&lt;br/&gt;diversity in tropical forests, which are home to a large proportion of the world's species.&lt;br/&gt;The primary focus of this study will be the collection of empirical data linking the ranging&lt;br/&gt;behavior of terrestrial mammals to tree species diversity in a Congo forest. The study site typifies&lt;br/&gt;tropical forests worldwide in that its  mammals act both as seed dispersers for a species rich guild&lt;br/&gt;of spatially rare trees and seed predators of a species poor guild of spatially aggregated trees.&lt;br/&gt;Even though mammals of many body sizes disperse and predate the same tree species, they may&lt;br/&gt;not be functionally redundant because mammalian body size is highly correlated with ranging&lt;br/&gt;scale. Thus, large mammals are particularly mobile seed predators that are drawn to dense stands&lt;br/&gt;of the species poor guild from great distances. Large mammals also tend to disperse seeds over a&lt;br/&gt;great area, which provides a number of benefits to mutualists in the species rich tree guild,&lt;br/&gt;including escape from predators &amp; pathogens. Consequently, local extinction of large mammals&lt;br/&gt;may well tip the competitive balance between guilds, triggering a loss of diversity in the species&lt;br/&gt;rich tree guild that propagates out through a myriad of dependent plants and animals, including&lt;br/&gt;smaller mammalian seed dispersers.&lt;br/&gt;This project will include both animal and vegetation studies and use a combination of ground&lt;br/&gt;and remote sensing methods. Aerial video and satellite imagery at several resolutions will be used&lt;br/&gt;to develop detailed maps of the distribution of the two tree guilds over a large scale. Line transect&lt;br/&gt;methods will then be used to quantify how the spatial grain of mixing between the two tree guilds&lt;br/&gt;influences both fruit availability and the spatial distribution of mammals varying in body size&lt;br/&gt;from mice to elephants. Trapping studies on rodents, the first GPS telemetry study on several&lt;br/&gt;duiker species, and the first telemetry study of any kind on red river hogs will quantify how body&lt;br/&gt;size influences the spatio-temporal pattern of fruit availability within an animal's home range.&lt;br/&gt;And an attempt will be made to identify a set of individual tree species using high-resolution&lt;br/&gt;digital photography and aerial videography. If this proves successful, it will allow the first large-&lt;br/&gt;scale scale study of tropical tree distribution and phenology. The empirical data collected in the&lt;br/&gt;study will be used to parameterize coupled, spatially explicit models of animal ranging and&lt;br/&gt;vegetation dynamics with the goal of predicting how large mammal extirpation is likely to affect&lt;br/&gt;tree species diversity.&lt;br/&gt;In addition to addressing basic theoretical issues, data collected in this project will be of&lt;br/&gt;direct value to wildlife management, both guiding management at the study site and informing&lt;br/&gt;park planning and sustainable hunting programs across the region. Remote sensing methodologies&lt;br/&gt;developed in this project will also provide the tools for studying how the wave of logging&lt;br/&gt;currently sweeping Central Africa is likely to affect tree species diversity. And African personnel&lt;br/&gt;trained and employed in the study will bolster feeble research and management capacity in the&lt;br/&gt;region.</AbstractNarration>
