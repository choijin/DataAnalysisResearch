    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the development of a miniaturized and inexpensive solid-state electrochemical carbon dioxide gas sensor for environmental air quality control, based on a novel-sensing concept, utilizing solid polymer electrolytes and thick film device miniaturization techniques. Carbon dioxide emissions are a global issue. In addition, CO2 monitoring and control in offices, homes, indoor sport arenas, enclosed parking garages and schools are of growing importance. The method of infrared spectroscopy is predominantly used in commercially available carbon dioxide monitors. Although the infrared spectroscopic system offers acceptable precision, it is large and relatively expensive. To the best of our knowledge no solid state, room temperature electrochemical carbon dioxide sensor is commercially available for environmental air quality control applications. The proposed novel electrochemical sensor, which could be configured as a handheld or a panel mount room device or for surface mounting on air ducts, will be reliable, inexpensive and compact and will yield an enhanced response signal at room temperature, utilizing miniaturized thick film sensors for CO2 monitoring in environmental applications. The feasibility of the proposed novel concept will be demonstrated and the best catalyst material and thick film sensor design parameters will be identified.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The potential commercial applications for the proposed solid state, room temperature electrochemical carbon dioxide sensor include: A) Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) control applications where demand control ventilation based on CO2 concentration of residential, commercial and industrial spaces occupied by people, could improve energy efficiency while simultaneously improving the indoor environment. B) Agricultural and bio-related process applications. The growth rate and development of plants can be improved by controlling the concentration of carbon dioxide. C) Food packaging industry. In the meat packaging industry, a high concentration of CO2 in the packaging inhibits bacterial growth and retains the natural color of the meat. D) Medical applications where an inexpensive electrochemical sensor could be used to measure the concentration of carbon dioxide in an exhaled breathe and could be incorporated in breathing systems.</AbstractNarration>
