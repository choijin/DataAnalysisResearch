<AbstractNarration>In the last 3 years, with funding from NSF, the members of the our Program have introduced 30 undergraduate students, mostly from small colleges, to the fascinating world of scientific research by allowing them to participate in research at the frontiers of molecular biology and genetics.  We are able to continue this successful Undergraduate Research Program to benefit students mainly from groups traditionally under-represented in research and students from regional undergraduate institutions.  Ten students will conduct research in laboratories that use molecular biology and genetic techniques to study problems including the regulation of gene expression, the mechanisms of cell differentiation and development, host-parasite interaction and disease resistance in plants, gene evolution, signal transduction, DNA repair, and virus infection and replication.  This program is designed to develop both the technical and the intellectual abilities of the participants.  Our philosophy is that one learns how to do research by doing it but that this only occurs under the appropriate guidance.  We will emphasize the "doing it" aspect of research by involving the students in a research project under close supervision.  Students will learn about the different stages and aspects of scientific investigation by interaction with their mentors and in sessions on scientific writing and research ethics.  Students will also be exposed to the research conducted in the other host laboratories during weekly lunchtime seminars given by faculty mentors.</AbstractNarration>
