<AbstractNarration>This award from the Instrumentation for Materials Research program supports Florida International University with the acquisition of a structural monitoring system for a laser- molecular beam epitaxy (LMBE)-scanning tunneling microscope system. The PI's will construct comprehensive tools with multi-component growth capability coupled with in-situ nano-scale characterization capabilities. This is essential for success in "Complex Materials Growth by Design." The in-situ structural monitoring system includes a newly designed in-situ reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) instrument for real-time monitoring of materials growth and low-energy electron diffraction (LEED I-V) optics for surface structure determination will be the essential component for the studies of artificial structured materials. The system will be added on a pulsed laser deposition (PLD) system, forming a controlled growth LMBE facility. This facility will be integrated with a variable temperature (VT) (25 - 1500K) scanning tunneling microscope (STM) and other existing surface characterization probes with a growth capability in an ultra-high vacuum (UHV) cluster. The objective is to construct a unique facility capable of growing and characterizing materials in-situ for interdisciplinary research and education of materials scientists in the new field of nano-technology.  The goal is to: 1) exploit materials tailoring for desired functionalities, 2) explore new physical phenomena in artificially structured materials, and 3) educate a new breed of materials scientists with an expertise in science-driven nano-fabrication. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award from the Instrumentation for Materials Research program supports Florida International University with the acquisition of a structural monitoring system for a laser- molecular beam epitaxy (LMBE)-scanning tunneling microscope system.
