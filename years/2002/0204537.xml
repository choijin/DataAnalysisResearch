<AbstractNarration>The ongoing work involves the analysis of the structural behavior of the Pentagon building on 11 September 2001. There are two poignant questions about the observed behavior of the building that deserve investigation:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Immediately upon impact of the Boeing 757, the reinforced concrete building lost approximately 30 columns in the ground story. Instead of an immediate collapse the structure remained standing to allow its occupants to be rescued. What were the structural attributes that prevented progressive collapse?&lt;br/&gt;2. The Boeing 757 crashed into the building at a speed exceeding 750 ft/sec. It had enormous kinetic energy. The debris was stopped in 300 ft. What characteristics of the structure were the main factors in absorbing the energy?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The insights gained are made available a Group. The final report will include the development of a web site containing the data and their studies. Presentations are made at professional society meetings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
