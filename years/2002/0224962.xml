<AbstractNarration>The investigator and his colleagues study problems in the overlap&lt;br/&gt;of algebraic geometry and commutative algebra. A major goal&lt;br/&gt;is to understand the structure of minimal free resolutions&lt;br/&gt;of homogeneous ideals, particularly those defining &lt;br/&gt;zero dimensional schemes. Ideals of interest range from ideals &lt;br/&gt;of fat points (motivated by their intimate connections to questions &lt;br/&gt;about linear systems on projective varieties),&lt;br/&gt;to ideals of generic forms (work on which is closely connected to&lt;br/&gt;work on the Weak and Strong Lefschetz properties &lt;br/&gt;for Artinian algebras, and, via Matlis duality, to work on &lt;br/&gt;fat points), to ideals whose quotients are Gorenstein rings (and &lt;br/&gt;hence involve problems on arithmetically Gorenstein subschemes &lt;br/&gt;of projective space, and Gorenstein liaison). This broad range of &lt;br/&gt;methods and motivations is a significant hurdle that young and &lt;br/&gt;future researchers must overcome to do productive work&lt;br/&gt;in this area. This grant aims to advance the training and career &lt;br/&gt;development of young investigators and graduate students by providing&lt;br/&gt;travel support to attend and interact with leaders in the field at &lt;br/&gt;an international conference addressing the research cited above.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Computational issues underlie much of this research, and machine &lt;br/&gt;computation is both an important tool in the research described &lt;br/&gt;above and the object of some of this research. However, work in this &lt;br/&gt;area can easily outrun the capability of any conceivable computer, so &lt;br/&gt;theoretical studies are essential not only for understanding the results &lt;br/&gt;of machine computations, but to achieve results beyond the reach of brute &lt;br/&gt;force computation. This is, for example, a significant issue for applications &lt;br/&gt;of the research described here to interpolation. Large data sets are a&lt;br/&gt;common feature of modern life, whether in science, technology or business.&lt;br/&gt;Such data sets often involve functional relationships among various&lt;br/&gt;variables. Among the most tractable functions are the polynomials.&lt;br/&gt;If one wants to model relationships with polynomials it is helpful to know &lt;br/&gt;theoretically how complicated the worst case such polynomial might be&lt;br/&gt;(as measured, say, by degree), whereas it might be expensive or impossible to&lt;br/&gt;determine this directly. Such theoretical results about polynomials&lt;br/&gt;are what researchers aim for in studying minimal free resolutions&lt;br/&gt;of homogeneous ideals. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
