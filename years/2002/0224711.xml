    <AbstractNarration>A grant has been awarded to Plattsburgh State University, under the direction of Dr. William J. Ehmann, Assistant to the Vice-President for Academic Affairs, to assess the educational and scientific potential of a university-affiliated property in Essex County, New York. The site, known locally as "Twin Valleys", lies within Adirondack Park and consists of a 660-acre forest with a lodge, cabins, and classrooms. Twin Valleys was used for summer science camps in the 1960s and 1970s, but the facilities have degraded and the site is currently under-utilized. Special natural features of the site include mature white pine forest, wetlands, and other habitats for migratory birds, mammals, salamanders, and at least 14 species of native plants listed as "vulnerable" in New York State. With this grant, Plattsburgh State will be able to carefully re-evaluate the property, with specific attention to its suitability for further development as a biological field station.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A team of six experts associated with the Organization of Biological Field Stations (OBFS) will visit Twin Valleys with PSU faculty and staff and representatives of College Auxiliary Services, Inc., (the not-for-profit corporation that owns the property) in December 2002 and May 2003. Through site visits, interviews, and workshops, OBFS experts will help assess the scientific merits of the property, prioritize needed upgrades in facilities, and suggest academic programs that could use the site to best advantage. A Team Leader will coordinate production of a written report and will make an on-campus presentation in September 2004. The recommendations are expected to provide a basis for requesting more funds to implement the vision, through funding agencies such as the National Science Foundation, private foundations, and institutional donors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eleven biological field stations in New York focused on terrestrial systems are currently listed with the Organization of Biological Field Stations, but the closest is 85 miles from Plattsburgh, which significantly reduces access for our teaching and research and that of other area educational institutions. PSU is interested in 1) furthering existing partnerships with North Country high school students and teachers and community colleges, 2) supporting field components of a proposed undergraduate major in ecology as well as current majors in Biology and Environmental Science, and 3) creating new research affiliations. Twin Valleys also has the potential to attract audiences from large urban areas such as Boston and New York City (both within a half-day's drive) to Adirondack Park, a 6 million-acre forest conservation area and model of public-private partnership.</AbstractNarration>
