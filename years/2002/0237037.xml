<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;0237037&lt;br/&gt;Philip Schmiter&lt;br/&gt;Ohio State University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rapidly evolving global information infrastructure includes broadband wireless communication as a key component.   Communication technology of the future will need to  operate at the data rates, at high carrier frequencies, in high mobility situations, and under high levels of co-channel interference,  all while maintaining reliable data transmission using small and inexpensive components.  The fundamental challenge for future wireless technology stems from the harsh characteristics of the wireless propagation channel.&lt;br/&gt;In specific, reflections from objects in the physical environment induce rapidly changing echo patterns which make it difficult for the receiver to recover the transmitted information without error.   Especially challenging are doubly-selective channels, i.e., channels which echo or blur the transmitted information significantly in both the time and frequency domains.   Since, these characteristics arise when high-rate information streams are propagated at high frequencies in highly mobile environments, the success of future wireless applications hinges on our ability to  communicate information reliably over the doubly-selective channel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research investigates practical signaling, detection, and estimation strategies for spectrally-efficient broadband data communication over doubly-selective wireless channels.  Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing, known for its advantages in time-non-selective fading, is used as a starting point in the &lt;br/&gt;study of practical data detection and channel estimation methods.  Extending these ideas, the investigators focus on non-orthogonal multicarrier signaling schemes which are specifically designed to optimize detection performance under receiver complexity constraints. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
