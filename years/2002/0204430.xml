<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EIA-0204430&lt;br/&gt;Major, Debra A., Davis, Donald D., Mann, Joan, Sanchez-Hucles, Janis V.&lt;br/&gt;Old Dominion University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Climate for Opportunity and Inclusion: Improving the Recruitment, Retention and Advancement of Women and Minorities in IT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This ITWF award provides support to investigate how characteristics of the information technology (IT) workplace can foster increased retention and advancement of women and minorities.  In the first year, several work organizations with IT departments of varying sizes and demographic compositions will be recruited to participate in the study.  Survey and interview data will be collected from human resource directors, IT supervisors and IT employees in order to assess the climate for opportunity and inclusion of each department.  The goal is to identify barriers and enablers to the career success of women and minorities in IT departments. In the second year, a survey feedback intervention will be conducted in each participating organization to encourage IT departments to capitalize on their strengths and improve their weaknesses with regard to opportunity and inclusion for all employees.  In the third year, survey and interview data will again be collected to assess the effectiveness of the interventions implemented during the second year.  The objective is not only to assist the participating organizations in establishing an inclusive workplace environment, but also to develop "best practices" that can be shared, through publications and presentations, with others in the IT field and researchers interested in workplace diversity issues.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
