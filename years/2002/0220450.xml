<AbstractNarration>PROJECT SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;This scholarship program is designed to provide increased financial assistance to qualified students pursuing a baccalaureate program in mathematics or computer science in preparation for successful entry into a career field or graduate study related to these disciplines. The objectives of this scholarship program are: 1) to increase the number of academically qualified low income students obtaining undergraduate degrees in mathematics or computer science, with special encouragement given to women, under-represented minorities and persons with disabilities; 2) to collaborate with the St. Louis corporate community in its efforts to attract, retain and develop a qualified talent pool of employees; and 3) to increase the number of qualified students who enroll and persevere in the mathematics and computer science programs at Fontbonne College. A total of ten students will be chosen as scholarship recipients. Seven students will be selected as entering freshmen, and will continue to receive a scholarship of $3,125 throughout their four-year program provided they meet the published academic standards of the department. Three transfer students, preferably from the St. Louis Community College system, will be selected in year one and three in year three. Each will receive the $3,125 per year scholarship for the two years they are at Fontbonne College.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Principle Investigator and two Co-PIs will direct the program. A review committee composed of the three directors, with appropriate input from the Directors of Admission and Financial Aid, will make the final selection of participants. Selection will be made based on criteria including U.S. citizenship status, financial need, published admission and department requirements, evidence of the candidate's ability demonstrated through transcripts, a written essay and personal interview, and the expressed desire to pursue a career or graduate study in an area related to mathematics or computer science. All students will agree to complete a baccalaureate degree as full-time students during the two or four year duration of the program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CSEMS scholars will have access to all student support services available as needed through the Kinkel Center for Academic Resources, the Office of Multicultural Affairs and the Career and Counseling Center. In addition to their academic program, scholarship recipients will participate in department sponsored programs designed to optimize their chances for successful program completion and entry into the career of their choice. The PI and Co-PIs will serve as academic advisers to the scholars, closely monitoring each scholar's progress. They will participate in the career center's four year Professional Development Certificate Program for entering freshmen; the two-year Career Advancement Program will be recommended for the transfer scholars. Five graduates from the department will serve as mentors for these scholars throughout their academic program. A one hour supplemental instruction/problem solving&lt;br/&gt;session will be scheduled weekly during each semester. Scholars will also have the option for Co-op which will be coordinated through the Director of Cooperative Education and internship placement coordinated through the academic department. All scholars will present a poster session on their research prior to graduation in addition to the regular presentation of their portfolio which is required of all graduates from the department.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
