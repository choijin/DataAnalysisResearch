<AbstractNarration>To guide large investments of time, effort, and money, policymakers need more evidence about the impacts of educational technology, but little information useful to them has yet been derived from evaluations of ubiquitous computing initiatives.  SRI International is working with six partner organizations to develop a common framework for evaluating the impacts of ubiquitous computing on K-12 mathematics and science education.&lt;br/&gt;The framework is based on existing frameworks developed for other purposes (e.g., the EnGauge model developed by North Central Regional Educational Laboratory and the Metiri Group) and on findings from a policy study conducted for this project designed to clarify policymakers information needs and their expectations about ubiquitous computing. Experienced evaluators from SRI International, the Metiri Group, the University of Virginia, the University of Minnesota, ROCKMAN ET AL, EDC's Center for Children and Technology, and Kent State University's Research Center for Educational Technology are also working as separate organizations conducting evaluations of many ubiquitous computing initiatives in several states.&lt;br/&gt;The framework to be developed by the group will be used to strengthen the individual evaluations and make them more responsive to policymakers' needs. By using a framework in which a variety of important evaluation questions about the impacts of ubiquitous computing on mathematics and science education can be framed and understood, we greatly increase the chances that knowledge will accumulate.&lt;br/&gt;The project team is posting the framework, evaluation findings, and syntheses of these findings on a project Web site. In addition, a number of new evaluation tools are being developed, and these, too, will be available through the Web. Information is also being disseminated through conference presentations and journal articles. Other evaluators, policy-makers, and practitioners are invited to make use of any of these products, which are intended to help strengthen evaluation work in the field of ubiquitous computing. A better understanding of ongoing ubiquitous computing initiatives, derived from evaluations, is expected to lead to improvements in mathematics and science education practices that use educational technology.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
