<AbstractNarration>In 1984 the first South American in-vitro fertilization (IVF) baby was born in Columbia. Since&lt;br/&gt;then clinics that offer assisted reproductive techniques like IVF and gamete donation have begun&lt;br/&gt;operations in most Latin American countries. This dissertation research study investigates the social impact of IVF and gamete donation in urban Ecuador. It asks what happens when reproductive biotechnologies travel&lt;br/&gt;from their initial sites of development in Europe and the United States to nations often considered&lt;br/&gt;marginal to scientific practice and research. The investigators will examine how religious practices,&lt;br/&gt;issues of political economy, and kinship narratives affect the way that IVF and gamete donation have&lt;br/&gt;been understood and put to use in Ecuador. The author's preliminary research in three infertility&lt;br/&gt;clinics in Ecuador shows that local Catholic practice plays a critical role in IVF laboratories in Quito&lt;br/&gt;where images of the Virgin Mary are used to bless eggs and sperm to aid in fertilization. In addition to&lt;br/&gt;documenting how local practice reshapes IVF in Ecuador, this study will examine how assisted&lt;br/&gt;reproduction affects Ecuadorian society. For example, how does the technoscientific production of&lt;br/&gt;children alter local understandings of overpopulation and the Ecuadorian ictraditionalli family?&lt;br/&gt;This study will focus on four Ecuadorian IVF and gamete donation clinics. Using the&lt;br/&gt;ethnographic tools of participant observation, semi-structured interviewing and discourse analysis, the&lt;br/&gt;authors will investigate how IVF and gamete donation are understood and practiced by clinical&lt;br/&gt;personnel and patients undergoing infertility treatment. To elucidate both the production and&lt;br/&gt;consumption of public narratives concerning assisted reproduction interviews will also be conducted&lt;br/&gt;with religious leaders, lawmakers, reporters and lay citizens about their perception of IVF and gamete&lt;br/&gt;donation. Although IVF and gamete donor clinics now operate worldwide, the vast majority of the social&lt;br/&gt;science literature concerning assisted reproduction has focused on North America and Europe. The&lt;br/&gt;data generated from the author's study of assisted reproduction in Ecuador, concerning issues of&lt;br/&gt;political economy, religious and kinship practices, will be used comparatively in a point by point&lt;br/&gt;reexamination of the Euro-American literature. This rigorous comparative approach to the study of&lt;br/&gt;bioscientific practice brings the cultural dimensions of science and technology to the forefront,&lt;br/&gt;elevating this study beyond a specific focus on reproductive technologies or Latin America.&lt;br/&gt;Ultimately this knowledge will allow for a more complex understanding of how the biosciences&lt;br/&gt;everywhere, both in nations considered "developed" and "developing", are constituted and affected by&lt;br/&gt;the local social realities surrounding their practice.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
