<AbstractNarration>Innovative Programming Technology for Embedded Systems&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a proposal to provide innovative programming technology for&lt;br/&gt;designing and implementing reliable distributed embedded systems.  The proposal&lt;br/&gt;addresses a critical generic problem and a major opportunity.  The generic&lt;br/&gt;problem is that the research community does not know how to scale logical&lt;br/&gt;methods that are known to improve programs and small systems to the task of&lt;br/&gt;improving larger systems.  The opportunity is that new methods of factoring are&lt;br/&gt;possible for embedded systems, and new kinds of specifications are important.&lt;br/&gt;This project approaches the problem/opportunity by creating advanced logical&lt;br/&gt;methods and tools to structure embedded systems in a new way and to draw on&lt;br/&gt;relevant formal knowledge about them to accelerate both the design and coding&lt;br/&gt;process and to improve the quality of the system code and its documentation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will add extensive formal knowledge to a logical programming&lt;br/&gt;environment (LPE) and use it to generate system components that are correct by&lt;br/&gt;construction and to combine components based on semantic methods.  The&lt;br/&gt;semantics supports formal classes and aspect-oriented programming.  One test&lt;br/&gt;case for the new methods is a particular distributed embedded system called&lt;br/&gt;MediaNet -- a system for processing various media (audio, video, text) over a&lt;br/&gt;distributed computing network to adaptively respond to quality of service&lt;br/&gt;constraints.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will use mathematical knowledge about media streams and transition&lt;br/&gt;systems to precisely formulate design requirements and component functionality.&lt;br/&gt;Quality of service constraints will be incrementally added to the functional&lt;br/&gt;specifications and used to automatically modify the proof and the extracted&lt;br/&gt;code so that these requirements are met.  This is a very high level example of&lt;br/&gt;formal aspect-oriented programming and proof reuse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The library of formal knowledge about the system will be organized as a&lt;br/&gt;mathematical theory.  That organization draws on concepts about stream&lt;br/&gt;transformers, the distributed network of machines, quality of service&lt;br/&gt;properties and communication services.  An expressive logic will be used to&lt;br/&gt;state properties of the system and keep track of logical dependencies among&lt;br/&gt;system components.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project team has considerable experience working together building and&lt;br/&gt;supporting distributed communications systems by specifying and verifying&lt;br/&gt;communication protocols and optimizing them using formal methods.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
