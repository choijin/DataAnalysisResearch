<AbstractNarration>Information theory has enjoyed over fifty years of rigorous research,&lt;br/&gt;development, and application.&lt;br/&gt;In spite of its relative maturity,&lt;br/&gt;new challenges arise due to novel  applications and emerging theoretical&lt;br/&gt;developments (e.g., there is a resurgence of interest in source&lt;br/&gt;coding in multimedia applications, molecular biology, and security).&lt;br/&gt;In the 1997 Shannon  Lecture Jacob Ziv&lt;br/&gt;presented compelling arguments for ``backing off'' to a certain extent&lt;br/&gt;from first-order asymptotic analysis of information&lt;br/&gt;systems in order to predict the behavior of real systems with&lt;br/&gt;finite (and often small) lengths (of sequences, files, codes,&lt;br/&gt;databases, etc.) One way of overcoming these difficulties is to&lt;br/&gt;increase accuracy of asymptotic analysis by replacing first-order&lt;br/&gt;analyses (e.g., a leading term of the average code length)&lt;br/&gt;by full asymptotic expansions and more&lt;br/&gt;accurate analyses (e.g., large deviations, central limit laws).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research primarily focuses on an important aspect of&lt;br/&gt;source coding, namely, the redundancy rate problem.&lt;br/&gt;Recent years have seen a resurgence of interest in&lt;br/&gt;redundancy rates of lossless and lossy coding.&lt;br/&gt;We describe analytic, combinatorial and algorithmic methods that&lt;br/&gt;work hand in hand to solve this and other problems in information theory.&lt;br/&gt;The redundancy rate problem for&lt;br/&gt;a class of sources corresponds to determining the extent to which&lt;br/&gt;the actual code length exceeds the optimal code length.&lt;br/&gt;This problem is an ideal candidate&lt;br/&gt;for second-order asymptotics&lt;br/&gt;since one must look beyond the leading term of the code length,&lt;br/&gt;which is known to be the entropy of the source.&lt;br/&gt;Following Hadamard's precept we study these problems using&lt;br/&gt;techniques of complex analysis such as generating functions,&lt;br/&gt;Rice's formula, Mellin transform, Fourier series,&lt;br/&gt;sequence distributed modulo 1, saddle point methods,&lt;br/&gt;analytic poissonization and depoissonization, and&lt;br/&gt;singularity analysis.  We present new results for&lt;br/&gt;well-studied problems (e.g., optimal codes for maximal redundancy,&lt;br/&gt;memoryless and Markovian sources) as well as novel formulations of old problems&lt;br/&gt;(e.g., redundancy of the class of mixing sources, redundancy of&lt;br/&gt;arithmetic coding and the Lemepl-Ziv codes). Furthermore,&lt;br/&gt;we apply the techniques developed as a part of this study&lt;br/&gt;to related problems such as prediction (based on pattern matching),&lt;br/&gt;random number generators, the average worst case probability of&lt;br/&gt;undetected error in channel coding, pattern matching approach to&lt;br/&gt;(exact and approximate) run length coding, and others.</AbstractNarration>
