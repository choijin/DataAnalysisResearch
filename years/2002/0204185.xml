<AbstractNarration>DMS-0204185&lt;br/&gt;Karen Vogtman&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project continues to develop a set of ideas which &lt;br/&gt;began with an attempt to understand automorphism groups &lt;br/&gt;of free groups by representing them as homotopy equivalences &lt;br/&gt;of graphs. The space of all such homotopy equivalences, &lt;br/&gt;called Outer space, is a contractible space on which the &lt;br/&gt;group of outer automorphisms of a free group acts properly&lt;br/&gt;discontinuously.  Analyzing the quotient of Outer space by &lt;br/&gt;this action has yielded a significant amount of algebraic &lt;br/&gt;information about this group over the years.  More recently,&lt;br/&gt;work of Maxim Kontsevich has  related the rational homology &lt;br/&gt;of this quotient to the homology of a certain &lt;br/&gt;infinite-dimensional Lie algebra, consisting of derivations &lt;br/&gt;of the free Lie algebra.   Kontsevich also defined variations &lt;br/&gt;of this infinite-dimensional Lie algebra whose homologies &lt;br/&gt;are related to the homology of mapping class groups and to&lt;br/&gt;Kontsevich's graph homology, which is a homology &lt;br/&gt;theory containing various 3-manifold and knot invariants.  &lt;br/&gt;The Principal Investigator will use this point of view to &lt;br/&gt;obtain new information about invariants of these groups &lt;br/&gt;of classical interest to topologists; conversely, topological &lt;br/&gt;methods will be applied to obtain new information about &lt;br/&gt;these Lie algebras and their homology.  In particular, new &lt;br/&gt;Lie bi-algebra structures on the chain complexes used to&lt;br/&gt;compute graph homology, recently discovered by Jim Conant &lt;br/&gt;the the Principal Investivator,  will be investivated. &lt;br/&gt;Finally,  the local geometry of Outer space will be studied.  &lt;br/&gt;Certain neighborhoods in Outer space are non-positively &lt;br/&gt;curved metric spaces, and can be identified with spaces &lt;br/&gt;of finite labelled metric trees.  Such trees are of interest &lt;br/&gt;in many branches of science, including biology, where they &lt;br/&gt;appear as evolutionary trees produced from DNA data. Another &lt;br/&gt;aim of this project is to determine efficient algorithms for &lt;br/&gt;finding geodesics in this space, and to continue from there &lt;br/&gt;to develop a program of applying statistical methods to this &lt;br/&gt;space of trees.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Graphs and trees appear in many contexts in the sciences and &lt;br/&gt;in mathematics.  In Geometric Group Theory  a space of graphs &lt;br/&gt;known as Outer space, originally defined by Marc Culler and &lt;br/&gt;the Principal Investigator,  has been used extensively to &lt;br/&gt;study the group of outer automorphisms of a finitely &lt;br/&gt;generated free group.  In this project the Principal &lt;br/&gt;Investigator will continue to study how the geometry of &lt;br/&gt;this space is related to algebraic properties of the group &lt;br/&gt;of automorphisms. A new perspective on this problem is &lt;br/&gt;provided by work of M. Kontsevich; motivated by &lt;br/&gt;considerations from physics and symplectic geometry, &lt;br/&gt;Kontsevich defined various abstract infinite-dimensional &lt;br/&gt;algebraic structures whose invariants  are closely related &lt;br/&gt;to invariants of Outer space.  Finally, small regions of &lt;br/&gt;Outer space can be identified with spaces of finite trees.  &lt;br/&gt;Such trees are used as a tool by evolutionary biologists, &lt;br/&gt;and another focus of this project is understanding the &lt;br/&gt;local geometry of these regions in a very concrete, &lt;br/&gt;algorithmic way which can be applied to problems in&lt;br/&gt;molecular phylogenetics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
