    <AbstractNarration>The Oregon experimental relativity research program is aimed at the search for burst sources of gravity waves (GWBs). An important prerequisite to the realization of this significant scientific discovery is identification and amelioration of noise sources in the LIGO interferometers. Dealing &lt;br/&gt;with these sources is one principal focus of the Oregon effort, as is the development of data analysis tools directed at a range of issues from instrumental effects to astrophysical investigations. The overall effort can be categorized into four areas: &lt;br/&gt;1.) identifying and reducing environmental influences, in order to improve interferometer sensitivity and decrease false detection rates for the individual interferometers. This involves identifying sources, reducing coupling and helping produce environmentally based vetoes. In addition to environmental coupling, this involves coupling between auxiliary interferometer channels and the gravity-wave channel for veto production purposes. &lt;br/&gt;2.) studying and, where possible, reducing the false coincidence rates between the three LIGO interferometers. This will involve a continuation of the inter-site environmental correlations project and an investigation of any phenomena which reduces the statistical independence of noise from the two Hanford interferometers. &lt;br/&gt;3.) developing and applying data distribution, monitoring and astrophysical analysis tools. The active role developed during the LIGO engineering and science runs will continue.&lt;br/&gt; 4.) applying the lessons learned with Intial LIGO to the plans and preparation for Advanced LIGO. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research of the Oregon group contributes significantly to the outside community through a number of efforts undertaken to broaden the impact. These include undergraduate participation in the group's research activities, summer research programs for talented high school students, &lt;br/&gt;work with Oregon high school teachers to bring the research experience into the high school (part of the Quark Net program), and speaking engagements to community groups. This research will also contribute to the broader benefit of society through the publication of the scientific results, and the education of the graduate students and postdoctoral associates working on the project.</AbstractNarration>
