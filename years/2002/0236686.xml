<AbstractNarration>The work of Dr. Craig Hill, Department of Chemistry, Emory University is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program of the Division of Chemistry. The project involves new inorganic complexes and systems that catalyze transformations using the most environment friendly and economically desirable oxidants (oxygen/air) and solvent (water). Specifically, the project will develop three major topics. First, multi-iron polyoxometallates (POMs) will be employed as very reactive catalysts for selective organic oxidations and the oxidative mineralization of carboxylic acids using oxygen in air at room temperature.   Secondly, catalytic oxidations by oxygen in water will be designed to utilize stable POM ensembles that consume acidic/basic side product produced during oxidations. Finally, the fundamental electron transfer reactions of the POM catalysts will be determined using stop-flow methods. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The project emphasizes utilization of environmentally benign oxidants such as air and oxygenated water to oxidize organic materials, including paper bleaching. The research will lead to great benefits to society as more environment friendly and selective catalytic processes are developed. The research activity will provide excellent training and educational experiences to graduate students and post-doctoral associates. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
