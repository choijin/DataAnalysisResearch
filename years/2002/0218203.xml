<AbstractNarration>All around the world people face problems in their daily lives and need to make decisions. In these times of globalization, many people live and work abroad or work together with people from different countries and consequently need to make decisions and solve problems together. How does cultural background influence individuals' problem solving and decision making? Research in Cross-cultural Psychology rarely investigates these topics, whereas research in Cognitive Psychology rarely includes cultural variables in the investigation of decision making. This study will thus bridge a theoretical gap between the two disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research focuses on the relationship between cultural values and decision making. Cultural values - more specifically, individualistic versus collectivist, and vertical versus horizontal value orientations - will be measured by means of value orientation questionnaires. Decision making analysis will focus on different strategies and decision making success. Four hundred psychology and business administration college students from Germany and the US (individualistic cultures), from Brazil and the Philippines (collectivist cultures), and from India (neither individualistic nor collectivist culture) will participate in the study. To analyze dynamic decision making, two computer simulations "WinFire" and "Coldstorage" will be used. In contrast to simple decision tasks, these computer simulations about forest fires and a broken coldstorage are more realistic and related to daily life. In decision-making studies, computer simulations have proved to be systematic, fruitful, and productive methods for data gathering. The data from the simulations will be collected in individual sessions, saved on computer files and videotapes, and then analyzed. From a theoretical model, specific hypotheses will be derived on how decision-making strategies will vary according to different cultural value orientations. The model will then be tested with structural equation modeling. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besides the theoretical merit, results of this study will also have relevance to the field of applied psychology. Findings can be incorporated in educational training programs for strategic thinking and dynamic decision making as well as for training programs in intercultural competence and sensitivity. Implications and relevance for research, training, and practice will be addressed.</AbstractNarration>
