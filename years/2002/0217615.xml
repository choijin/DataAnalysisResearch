<AbstractNarration>Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (LSAMP) Indiana&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The LSAMP Indiana project is a result of collaboration among Ball State University; &lt;br/&gt;IndianaUniversity, Bloomington; Indiana University Purdue University Indianapolis;&lt;br/&gt;Purdue University, Calumet; and Purdue University, West Lafayette. Each university&lt;br/&gt;surveyed existing studentretention and minority programs. At many of our universities,&lt;br/&gt;there are a substantial number of K-12 outreach programs designed to enhance initial &lt;br/&gt;interest in Science, Math, Engineering, and Technology (SMET) disciplines, as well as&lt;br/&gt;numerous programs to help freshmen transition from high school into college. In addition,&lt;br/&gt;there are a substantial number of programs to support research projects by upper-division&lt;br/&gt;students in SMET disciplines. However, there are fewer (if any) programs across the &lt;br/&gt;participating universities to help first-year students identify with their SMET discipline &lt;br/&gt;and help them to sustain that initial identification through research and mentoring&lt;br/&gt;experiences over their next two years of college. In response to this finding, the &lt;br/&gt;involve institutions formed an alliance to increase the number of minorities receiving &lt;br/&gt;baccalaureate degrees in SMET disciplines by providing (1) early research enrichment &lt;br/&gt;experiences; (2) sustained teaching and mentoring opportunities in gatekeeper as well &lt;br/&gt;as upper-level courses; (3) personalized interactions with graduate students and faculty&lt;br/&gt;mentors beginning in the students' freshman year; and (4) professional and personal &lt;br/&gt;development opportunities. These early experiences with research and teaching are &lt;br/&gt;designed to encourage students to forge and sustain an academic and a social &lt;br/&gt;identification within their SMET discipline. These goals will be reached by the &lt;br/&gt;implementation of the following three programs:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Summer Transition and Academic Research Programs (STAR Programs) -- The STAR&lt;br/&gt;programs will help LSAMP students' transition from high school to college by &lt;br/&gt;exposing them to research and career enrichment experiences designed to enhance &lt;br/&gt;the student's initialcommitment to a SMET discipline beginning in the summer&lt;br/&gt;before their first year of college. Importantly, to sustain this initial commitment,&lt;br/&gt;the STAR programs then continue to provide research and career enrichment &lt;br/&gt;experiences from the students' freshman year through the summer after their &lt;br/&gt;sophomore year. STAR programs will provide research and career enrichment &lt;br/&gt;experiences that include such activities as the following: (1) participation in a&lt;br/&gt;summer bridge program with a "hands on" introduction to research experiences &lt;br/&gt;component; (2) formal and informal meetings with faculty and/or graduate mentors; &lt;br/&gt;(3) visits to laboratories that emphasize the active involvement of students; &lt;br/&gt;(4) participation in a higher-level summer research experiences between their first&lt;br/&gt;and second years of college; and (5) participation in the annual LSAMP Indiana Research&lt;br/&gt;and Alliance Enrichment Conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Supplemental Instruction (SI) -- SI programs offer participants the chance to lead &lt;br/&gt;and/or participate in review and study skill sessions to supplement course instruction. &lt;br/&gt;Some of the universities in this alliance have established SI programs for a few of the &lt;br/&gt;historically high-risk 100and 200 level "gatekeeper" courses, and they are particularly &lt;br/&gt;effective in raising participants'(especially minority participants') G.P.A. and&lt;br/&gt;retention rate. As an alliance, therefore, we are interested in the following: (1) beginning &lt;br/&gt;the SI program in SMET courses at universities with no SI program; (2) expanding the&lt;br/&gt;SI program to (more) SMET courses at universities with an established SI program; and &lt;br/&gt;(3) adding SI to upper-level courses known to be difficult for students (i.e., 2 nd level&lt;br/&gt; gatekeeper courses).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Coordination and Development Programs -- To forge the Alliance, all parties involved in&lt;br/&gt;LSAMP Indiana will be invited to conferences in order to: (1) enhance the alliance by &lt;br/&gt;sharingdata, program experiences (successes and failures), and ideas for improving&lt;br/&gt;programs and the alliance; (2) provide conference experiences that serve academic&lt;br/&gt;and social identification needs; (3) build a supportive network of SMET scholars &lt;br/&gt;(faculty, graduate students, administrators, and students) working toward a shared&lt;br/&gt;goal who can help guide the alliance; and (4) develop diversity competencies among &lt;br/&gt;faculty, administrators, support staff, graduate students, and undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;students affiliated with LSAMP Indiana by developing new and innovative workshops&lt;br/&gt;that are then adapted and administered on each campus.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
