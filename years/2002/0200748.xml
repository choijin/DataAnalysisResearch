    <AbstractNarration>This award renews support for maintenance of a collection of prosimian primates housed at the Duke University Primate Center (DUPC). Study of the biology and behavior of Prosimians continues to increase in scope, intensity, and sophistication, and it is now one of the most active and exciting fields of primatology. The DUPC houses the largest and most diverse collection of prosimian primates in the world, most of whom are native to Madagascar. The Center is recognized as the focal point for prosimian research and conservation activities outside Madagascar. As part of its research mission, the DUPC provides on-site access to animals, and ships tissues and blood samples to faculty and students from diverse local, regional, national, and foreign institutions for off-site use. Users are charged a fee scaled to the kind and quantity of usage. This award insures the continued availability of animals and tissues for use by outside researchers at relatively modest cost.</AbstractNarration>
