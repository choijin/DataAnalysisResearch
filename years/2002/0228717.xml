<AbstractNarration>With this award, Connie Stelly, Saundra McGuire, Su-Seng Pang, Gregory Vincent, and Isiah Warner of LSU will lead the establishment of the Louisiana State University Research Scholars Program (LA-STEM).  LA-STEM is a strategically planned, cooperative, comprehensive activity that will put in place at LSU a system that will increase the numbers of minority students - primarily African Americans - who obtain undergraduate degrees in science, engineering, and mathematics, and who go on to graduate degrees in these fields.  The LA-STEM strategy is to (1) identify pre-college (high school) students with high potential for achievement and recruit them for the program; (2) facilitate the development of these students' necessary skills and competencies in addition to their undergraduate education in a STEM discipline that will (3) prepare these students to go on to earn graduate degrees in their STEM disciplines.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Modeled after the widely-acclaimed University of Maryland - Baltimore County 'Meyerhoff Scholars Program,' LA-STEM is projected to reach ~ 115 students in the initial five-year period of the activity through a disciplined combination of 'innovative intervention activities' including:&lt;br/&gt;A Summer Bridge Program prior to the freshman fall semester;&lt;br/&gt;Association with a faculty mentor upon acceptance into the program;&lt;br/&gt;Peer advising and counseling along with academic program advising and counseling;&lt;br/&gt;Monthly social and informational sessions; &lt;br/&gt;A sustained On-Campus Academic Year Internship/Research Experience beginning the fall semester of the freshman year;&lt;br/&gt;Intensive On- and Off-Campus Summer Internships/Research Experiences;&lt;br/&gt;Professional Conference Participations and Presentations;&lt;br/&gt;Tutoring and Workshops for instruction in essential skills for academic and personal success;&lt;br/&gt;Communication Skills Instruction that will help to develop a positive self-concept and increased self-confidence;&lt;br/&gt;Instruction in applying Study Skills and Personal Skills for the successful completion of the undergraduate program;&lt;br/&gt;Coaching for the successful Admittance to Graduate Programs across the country through Graduate Preparation Workshops (application and interview process, test preparation, etc.); and &lt;br/&gt;Career Planning Workshops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is expected that outcomes of the LA-STEM project will guide further diversification of undergraduate STEM majors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
