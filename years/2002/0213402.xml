<AbstractNarration> This project will start the work of archiving the data from the Beginning School Study, a panel study of 790 Baltimore children who began first grade in1982.  Their educational and personal development have now been studied through their early twenties.  A majority of the sample (55%) is African American and two thirds were classified as low income in the initial wave.  These data are one of the only data sets of young adults that has thorough information back to first grade, thus permitting tests of the effects of early childhood situations on subsequent educational, work, and family outcomes.   The data have been collected in several waves with various target samples (e.g., parents, schools)  over the last twenty years, each with its own computer technology and analysis systems.  The archiving work will begin to establish more standardized variable and codebook systems that will permit ready access by new users.  Problems of data confidentiality will also be analyzed and solutions developed so that public access does not compromise respondent anonymity.</AbstractNarration>
