    <AbstractNarration>This project seeks to increase the number of students receiving baccalaureate degrees in STEM fields at Xavier University. The pilot program focuses particularly on first-year students in computer science, mathematics, and physics. The objectives for the project are: to increase the numbers of undeclared majors who become majors in computer science, mathematics, or physics by the end of their first year; to increase the retention rate from first to second year of students who enter Xavier with a declared major in computer science, mathematics, or physics; to increase the number of underrepresented minorities majoring in computer science, mathematics, and physics, and the number of women in computer science and physics; and to assess the impact of these efforts so that the successful parts can be expanded to all mathematics and science departments at Xavier after the end of the grant period. The pilot effort includes components that support both the recruitment of STEM majors from the undecided majors and the retention of incoming STEM majors: a first-year STEM exposure program for prospective majors; an undergraduate teaching assistant program that assigns current majors to be tutors/mentors in the first-year, major-level courses; a grants program providing funds for computer science, mathematics, and physics students to do student-planned activities aimed at outreach both on- and off-campus; a summer bridge program to help at-risk students between the first and second years to acquire the mathematical and scientific skills necessary to continue in the major; and a workshop series for STEM faculty to raise awareness of STEM recruitment and retention issues, particularly those of underrepresented groups. Current STEM majors are used extensively in the project. This involvement strengthens the bonds of the existing STEM community and provides essential role models for incoming students. The project provides an opportunity to test several approaches towards increasing STEM majors in a liberal arts environment, thus providing results that can be used across the nation. It focuses particularly on approaches that create a supportive learning environment for underrepresented groups in science and mathematics.</AbstractNarration>
