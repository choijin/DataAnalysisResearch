    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT: DMS 0203164.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We have been studying problems in Riemannian geometry that &lt;br/&gt;concern with interplays between curvature and topology, and &lt;br/&gt;the major part of our work are about the controlled topology of &lt;br/&gt;collapsed manifolds with sectional curvature bounded in absolute value and &lt;br/&gt;applications to the global Riemannian geometry. &lt;br/&gt;For the past three years, we have made substantial progresses&lt;br/&gt;in this field pioneered by Cheeger-Gromov-Fukaya: we &lt;br/&gt;established the isomorphism finiteness result for the higher homotopy groups, &lt;br/&gt;the diffeomorphism finiteness result for a certain class of manifolds, and the &lt;br/&gt;convergence of collapsing sequences in this class. We have &lt;br/&gt;made a progress on investigating some rigidity phenomena &lt;br/&gt;for the class of closed manifolds of non-positive sectional &lt;br/&gt;which are not locally symmetric spaces. We have made a progress &lt;br/&gt;in the homeomorphism classification of positively curved manifolds &lt;br/&gt;whose isometry group contains a torus of large rank, and extend &lt;br/&gt;this result to the larger class of manifolds which only admit &lt;br/&gt;isometric discrete abelian group actions. We will continue our &lt;br/&gt;programs in these fields in the near future that &lt;br/&gt;represents a continuation of the work proposed three years &lt;br/&gt;ago for NSF Grant DMS 9971360. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the most important developments in Riemannian geometry &lt;br/&gt;in the last two decades is our understanding of the Riemannian &lt;br/&gt;manifolds which appear to be smaller than &lt;br/&gt;their actual dimension (i.e collapsed). For instance, the surface &lt;br/&gt;of a very thin donuts looks like a circle while whose curvature and diameter are &lt;br/&gt;bounded. Our progress is amplified by the amazing fact that &lt;br/&gt;among the manifolds whose curvature and diameter are bounded, all &lt;br/&gt;but finitely many appear to be smaller than their actual dimension.</AbstractNarration>
