<AbstractNarration>Self-regulation is associated with inhibiting actions an individual may otherwise be inclined to perform. Poor self-regulation has been linked to failure to control emotions, alcohol abuse, addictions, overeating, behavioral control problems (e.g., aggressive behavior), and victimization. Interestingly, previous research has focused on either young children or adults.  However, the pre-frontal cortex, the area of the brain believed to be responsible for impulse control and self-regulation, continues to develop throughout adolescence.  The present research focuses on adolescents aged 10-14.  The study specifically examines individual differences in adolescent self-regulation that promote long-term social outcomes and the possible underlying neural mechanisms that are implicated in these differences by employing physiological measures as a source of data about the individual.  Two fundamental questions will be addressed:  (1) Are agreeableness and conscientiousness related to effortful control processes in adolescence?; and (2) Are agreeableness and conscientiousness predictive of psychosocial adjustment in adolescence?   It is anticipated that agreeableness and conscientiousness will be directly related to traditional cognitive assessments associated with impairments in self-regulation.  Adolescents higher in agreeableness and conscientiousness will score higher on these traditional cognitive assessments and will have greater physiological reactivity while performing these cognitive tasks than will persons lower in agreeableness and conscientiousness.  In addition, adolescents lower in agreeableness and conscientiousness will exhibit more behaviors associated with poor self-regulation than will their peers. Overall, this study will provide converging data between child and parent reports about personality and behaviors associated with self-regulation on an age group that is often neglected in self-regulation research.  Second, this study will link personality to behavioral observations and physiological responses associated with self-regulation.  Third, this study will examine whether personality and self-regulation are predictive of adjustment in adolescence.  Finally, this study will lay groundwork for future research that will examine the possible developmental transitions related to personality and self-regulation during adolescence.  If we can understand how personality is linked to control processes, we may then be able to understand what factors affect development and psychosocial adjustment negatively in adolescents.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
