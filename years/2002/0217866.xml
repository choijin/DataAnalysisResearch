<AbstractNarration>This research links the application of specific lean manufacturing practices and principles to organizational characteristics and business performance metrics for electronics manufacturers. Lean manufacturing is distinguished from traditional mass production in that it utilizes fewer resources, but results in more and a larger variety of products often distinguished by high levels of product quality and service. The emphasis of this research is on deriving from theory a practitioner model that can be used by organizational leaders in their decisions to invest in training, human resource development, equipment purchases, and/or process development focused on creating a lean manufacturing enterprise. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Current research demonstrates that manufacturing plants have improved operations as a result of implementing lean manufacturing practices. However, there is evidence to indicate that lean manufacturing may not be appropriate for all manufacturers. Because of the rate at which technology evolves, electronic manufacturers are under constant pressure to reduce new product introduction cycle times, reduce product costs, and to incorporate new technology in supporting processes and materials. While these pressures would seem to create an environment ripe for the implementation of lean manufacturing principles and practices, there is little research that links lean manufacturing implementation to business results for this manufacturing sector. Because existing research and the supporting literature are based on the automotive industry or related assembly operations, this research extends the existing body of knowledge by studying the role of lean manufacturing in the complex realm of electronics manufacturing, specifically in the area of printed circuit board assembly manufacturing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal describes two distinct projects to be undertaken in this research. The first area is the development of a set of printed circuit assembly manufacturing profiles that help identify the most relevant lean manufacturing principles based on the key identifiers contained in the profile. This research is accomplished through the development of survey targeted at understanding what lean manufacturing principles and practices have been adopted. Defining characteristics of these electronic manufacturers will be developed using a multi-site case study. The second area of focus in the research is linking the implementation of specific lean manufacturing principles and practices to organizational results for an electronics manufacturer. This portion of the research will utilize a single-site case study. This case study will focus on the specific issues of implementing lean manufacturing practices in the operations of a typical electronics manufacturer engaged in the assembly of printed circuit boards utilizing both surface mount and through-hole process technologies.</AbstractNarration>
