<AbstractNarration>     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project uses wireless handheld devices that are interconnected to create an educational simulation architecture called C5, supporting simulations that are compact, connected, continuous, customizable, and collective.  C5 tightly connects four information technologies: handheld devices to run individual and distributed simulations; a desktop computer with a wireless network hub acting as the simulation manager; the Web as a live data and information source; and. end-user customization entailing customization of simulations and the integration of real time Web information into simulations.  Because next generation handheld devices are sophisticated regarding the following features: speed, networking, and display; they are capable, respectively, of running complex simulations, of running distributed simulations over fast wireless networks, and of displaying high resolution color.  Thus, handheld devices promise tools well beyond electronic versions of paper and pencil applications.  Individuals can run handheld versions of interactive simulations and collectively create advanced distributed simulations.  The research objectives of this project are to explore cognitive (interface), pedagogical (classroom), technical (hardware and software) and commercial issues for handheld-based simulations.  &lt;br/&gt;     The proffered education simulation architecture portends the revolution to come; it has the potential to provide cost effective information technology enabling learning and scientific exploration in wide range of fields, such as life sciences, biology, health, political science, and economics.  While the project initially focuses on K-12, it ultimately aims to generate the more general lifelong learning markets that include distance learning, secondary education, home schooling and corporate training.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
