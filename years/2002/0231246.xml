<AbstractNarration>This proof-of-concept project is designing and evaluating three prototype Calibrated Peer Review (CPR) assignments for use in introductory Earth and environmental science classes. CPR is a technical writing tool established by a consortium of institutions in California and used by chemistry and biology departments at universities and colleges. This instructional assessment tool employs an interactive web-based approach that&lt;br/&gt;allows a student to develop increased understanding by writing about timely, relevant topics. Students develop short essays and review their peers' essays in a manner that is both time-efficient and effective. This CPR project is implementing digital tools for three Earth science-based assignments providing managed review, analysis, assessment of student input, and preparation of reports for both student and instructor. Central to the identification of topics that are content-rich and, from a citizens' perspective, relevant, the Lexis-Nexis news database is being utilized. Using this searchable resource, three topics of particular relevance are being used: earthquake and plate boundaries, evidence for global warming, and flood hazards. Collaboration with a group of faculty involved in the CPR project is being established to facilitate the PIs use of available technological infrastructure and to help develop a medium appropriate for use by Earth science departments nationwide. The project is being evaluated at Iowa State University and by instructors at a community college, undergraduate-oriented state college, and a research university.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
