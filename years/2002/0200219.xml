    <AbstractNarration>Proposal Number: DMS-0200219&lt;br/&gt;PI: Jeffrey Geronimo&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research will be conducted into the Fejer-Riesz factorization&lt;br/&gt;of two variable positive trigonometric polynomials. The results&lt;br/&gt;obtained recently with Hugo Woerdeman on this problem will be&lt;br/&gt;used to investigate the properties of stable two variable&lt;br/&gt;polynomials. A two variable polynomial is said to be stable&lt;br/&gt;if it is non vanishing inside and on the bicircle. Results&lt;br/&gt;obtained from these investigations will then be applied to the&lt;br/&gt;construction of two variable wavelets, two variable filter&lt;br/&gt;design, and image processing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An important problem with many applications that was solved&lt;br/&gt;early inthe twentieth century was the problem of factorizing&lt;br/&gt;positive trigonometric polynomials. A trigonometric polynomial&lt;br/&gt;of degree n in x is a polynomial that can be written as linear&lt;br/&gt;combination of sines and cosines of integer multiples of the&lt;br/&gt;frequency x. It was shown by Fejer and Riesz that such a&lt;br/&gt;polynomial can be written as the magnitude squared of another&lt;br/&gt;polynomial. This result has had many useful applications in&lt;br/&gt;the area of filter design for electrical circuits, prediction&lt;br/&gt;theory, and more recently in wavelets.</AbstractNarration>
