<AbstractNarration>9805771  CHAPMAN   During development, different tissues and  organs require different numbers of cells.  Programmed cell death  (or "apoptosis"), along with cell division, is a primary way that  cell number is controlled.  Apoptosis occurs as a series of  cellular and biochemical events in which the cell, instead of  dividing, involutes, falls apart, and is engulfed.  Every normal  cell appears to have the "program" for cell death, which can be  activated in a number of ways.  The neurotrophin receptor gp75NTR  or NTR, expressed by neurons and some immune cells, is a member of  a family of cytokine and growth factor receptors known to regulate  many cellular decisions to undergo programmed cell death.  The NTR  contains an intracellular domain that is similar to the "death  domain" of other receptors that can initiate apoptosis, but it has  not yet been shown that the NTR's putative death domain functions  in apoptotic signaling.  The objective of Dr. Chapman's study are  to establish whether the NTR's death domain interacts with  elements of the apoptotic mechanism (caspases), and to demonstrate  whether this receptor can induce programmed cell death when  expressed ectopically in cultured mammalian cells.       This project is particular suitable for a POWRE award.  Dr.  Chapman recently made the unusual transition from the  biotechnology industry to take a faculty job at the new San Marcos  campus of the California State University system.  CSUSM  emphasized hands-on laboratory experience with modern technology  to prepare their students in the biological sciences for careers  as researchers, science teachers and in the biotechnology  industry.  Dr. Chapman brings real world experience to her  students, and will be able to actively engage them in research  with this POWRE award, which will provide the funding for her to  initiate this research project.</AbstractNarration>
