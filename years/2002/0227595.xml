<AbstractNarration>We  propose  to  organize  a  joint COST-IST (EU) / NSF (USA)  workshop  on  Networking in September/October 2002,  in  Crete, Greece.  There are two main  objectives  for  the  proposed  workshop.  The  first  is  to  discuss  and  try  to  shed  some more  light  into key, new and upcoming networking technologies by focusing on the driving fundamental aspects and principles. A better understanding could help better steer  the upcoming advancements with the expected benefits in reduced complexity, improved performance and enhanced services.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The second main objective is to give the opportunity to the networking communities in  Europe  and USA  to get  together and  have a first-hand exposure to the advancements and strengths in the other side of the Atlantic.  The targeted balance in the participation of  researchers from  the two sides  of the Atlantic will help achieve this cross-fertilization objective, bring the benefits  to  both communities  and  help advance the technology. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;As funding is a major driving force, another objective of this workshop is to provide a forum that  could help the workshop-sponsoring  funding  agencies from the EU  and USA identify the key and required networking technologies and direct their funding accordingly.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Key networking areas represented by the best researchers from EU and USA will be targeted. The focus of the proposed workshop may be divided into three broad themes: &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Internet Modeling and Control &lt;br/&gt; Overlay Networks, Content Distribution Networks, Peer-to-Peer &lt;br/&gt; Broadband Wireless, Ad Hoc and Sensor Networks, Hybrid Networks &lt;br/&gt;The  precise focus will be determined by  the  makeup of  the  participants.  Program  officers  from COST-IST  and ANIR-NSF are  expected to attend the workshop.  The General Workshop Chair is Ioannis Stavrakakis, University of Athens. The Program Co-chairs  are  Ioannis  Stavrakakis,  Ibrahim Matta  (the  PI) and Michael Smirnov (Fraunhofer  FOKUS,  Germany). Ibrahim Matta will handle the NSF funding and Michael Smirnov  will  handle the COST  funding for the workshop. After  the conclusion of the  workshop,  the  organizing  committee  will furnish a report to  the &lt;br/&gt;COST-IST (EU) and ANIR-NSF (USA),  and  will  make  it  publicly  available  to participants an  others via the workshop site.</AbstractNarration>
