<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT DMS - 0204154.  PI: Tatyana Foth&lt;br/&gt;                   &lt;br/&gt;I will study holomorphic automorphic forms on bounded symmetric domains and &lt;br/&gt;related problems of quantization. Let X be a quotient of a bounded symmetric &lt;br/&gt;domain by a lattice. The space of holomorphic automorphic forms can be &lt;br/&gt;identified with  the space of holomorphic sections of a tensor power of the &lt;br/&gt;canonical line bundle on X. In the context of geometric quantization this &lt;br/&gt;is the quantizing line bundle, X is the classical phase space, and &lt;br/&gt;automorphic forms are quantum states, i.e. wave functions of a particle.&lt;br/&gt;I shall investigate properties of Poincare series and relative Poincare series &lt;br/&gt;associated to real submanifolds of X. From the point of view of quantization &lt;br/&gt;they are components of the delta-function. Explicit construction of relative &lt;br/&gt;Poincare series associated to closed geodesics in finite volume smooth ball &lt;br/&gt;quotients and the spanning result can be used to obtain rational structures &lt;br/&gt;on the spaces of cusp forms for arithmetic subgroups of SU(n,1). Another &lt;br/&gt;problem I shall address is the computation of curvature of a natural connection&lt;br/&gt;in the vector bundle over a space of compatible complex structures on&lt;br/&gt;a symplectic manifold X, whose fiber over J is the space of J-holomorphic &lt;br/&gt;sections of k-th tensor power of the quantizing line bundle. To begin with,&lt;br/&gt;I will compute the symbol of the curvature in the semiclassical limit for&lt;br/&gt;certain types of X. The first interesting example would be the case when X is &lt;br/&gt;a hyperbolic Riemann surface, where an explicit basis in the space of&lt;br/&gt;automorphic forms can be used as a moving frame.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main object of my research is automorphic forms on bounded symmetric &lt;br/&gt;domains. They are functions with very special properties on spaces which have &lt;br/&gt;interesting geometry and many symmetries. In addition to being an important &lt;br/&gt;and intensively studied subject by itself it has a very close relation to &lt;br/&gt;geometric quantization  which is a part of mathematics whose development was &lt;br/&gt;strongly motivated by physics and by general desire to understand better the &lt;br/&gt;nature of the world and to describe it in terms of suitable mathematical &lt;br/&gt;formalism. The main goal of geometric quantization is to find a rigorous &lt;br/&gt;mathematical way to pass from classical mechanics to quantum mechanics in &lt;br/&gt;a space which may have a very complicated geometry. More precisely, the &lt;br/&gt;question is how one can establish a suitable correspondence between &lt;br/&gt;classical observables and quantum observables. The space of wave functions &lt;br/&gt;is, clearly, a fundamental and very important object. It turns out that for &lt;br/&gt;certain classical phase spaces automorphic forms are wave functions of &lt;br/&gt;a particle. Properties of automorphic forms are strongly related to the &lt;br/&gt;complex structure. One of the questions I shall address is to what extent &lt;br/&gt;the procedure of geometric quantization depends on the complex structure. &lt;br/&gt;That leads to discussion of connections in vector bundles on certain moduli &lt;br/&gt;spaces which are of great interest and significance for both mathematicians &lt;br/&gt;and physisists.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
