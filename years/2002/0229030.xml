    <AbstractNarration>0229030&lt;br/&gt;Freiman&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed Tenth Engineering Foundation Conference on risk-based decision making represents the natural growth of the field and the culmination of the theory, methodology, and applications in risk assessment and management o water resources and natural and man-made hazards. The most striking observation is that the objectives and goals set forth for the first conference in September 1980 in Asilomar, CA and the issues raised in the preface of the 1980 proceedings are as relevant and as timely today as they were then. After the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on September II, 200 1, and the subsequent anthrax mailings, the United States can no longer afford to respond to threats on an ad hoc basis.</AbstractNarration>
