<AbstractNarration>0208125&lt;br/&gt;Davis&lt;br/&gt;It is widely agreed that invasion ecology theory needs to become more mechanistic,&lt;br/&gt;quantitative, and predictive and that field experiments and better models are required to help&lt;br/&gt;accomplish this goal. The initial goal of the proposed project is to test a recent mechanistic&lt;br/&gt;hypothesis of invasibility and to develop a quantitative empirical model that can be used to&lt;br/&gt;predict the changing invasibility of an environment over time. The hypothesis tested proposes&lt;br/&gt;that a mechanistic relationship exists between invasibility and resource availability, and that&lt;br/&gt;changes in invasibility are often due to changes in the competition intensity from resident&lt;br/&gt;vegetation, which in turn result from fluctuations in resource availability. This project will be&lt;br/&gt;conducted in a native grass environment located on a Minnesota sand plain. Thus, a second goal&lt;br/&gt;of the project is to increase our understanding of the invasion dynamics associated with&lt;br/&gt;grasslands and woodland/grassland ecotones in semi-arid environments. These goals will be&lt;br/&gt;accomplished in a study consisting of three parts.&lt;br/&gt;During the first stage, an empirical model of invasibility will be developed using data&lt;br/&gt;from a field experiment in which temporal patterns of resource availability (water) will be&lt;br/&gt;manipulated in plots being experimentally invaded. During this stage, data from the field&lt;br/&gt;experiments will also be used to directly test predictions of the fluctuating resource availability&lt;br/&gt;hypothesis. Water was selected as the resource to be manipulated because previous studies of&lt;br/&gt;seedling establishment at Cedar Creek have shown that establishment success of herbaceous and&lt;br/&gt;plants was most strongly correlated with soil water conditions. During the second stage, an&lt;br/&gt;existing mechanistic soil water model will be used to produce season-long soil water profiles at&lt;br/&gt;the study site under a variety of climatological (temperature and rainfall) data sets, including&lt;br/&gt;climatological data recorded at the study site during the project, historical climatological data for&lt;br/&gt;the region, and various hypothetical temperature and precipitation regimes that might occur in&lt;br/&gt;the future if the climate changes. During the third stage, the season-long water profiles produced&lt;br/&gt;by the mechanistic model will be used as input for the empirical model of invasibility. The&lt;br/&gt;invasibility predictions produced by the integration of the empirical and mechanistic models will&lt;br/&gt;compared to invasibility data obtained from a separate field experiment conducted during the&lt;br/&gt;study. If the integrated model is successful in its predictions, then it will be used with the&lt;br/&gt;historical and hypothetical climatological data to determine the extent of annual variability in&lt;br/&gt;invasibility of native grasslands in the past, and the extent to which invasibility may change in&lt;br/&gt;the future if temperature and/or precipitation regimes change.&lt;br/&gt;The goals of the proposed study are both to advance ecological theory and the ecological&lt;br/&gt;understanding of specific environments. In addition to testing a recent mechanistic theory of&lt;br/&gt;invasibility, the study will develop a method to model and predict invasibility that is intended to&lt;br/&gt;be transferable to other environments. Recent evidence has shown that grasslands and old fields&lt;br/&gt;are more responsive to fluctuations in precipitation than other biomes and that water limited&lt;br/&gt;environments such as grasslands and savannas are likely to be some of the biomes most affected&lt;br/&gt;by future climate change. Thus, by testing a specific mechanistic theory of invasibility in the&lt;br/&gt;water limited grassland-forest ecotone at Cedar Creek with an experimental study culminating in&lt;br/&gt;the development of a model of invasibility, this study will contribute to the important pool of&lt;br/&gt;knowledge that will be necessary to predict and prepare for the possible ecological consequences&lt;br/&gt;of global environmental change in these environments.</AbstractNarration>
