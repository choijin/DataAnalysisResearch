    <AbstractNarration>As a result of a 1998 critical needs analysis, the faculty of Mount Wachusett Community College (MWCC), Gardner, Massachusetts, applied for and received a grant from the National Science Foundation (ATE Award No. 9850317). Under this project faculty developed an educational program for woodworking technicians, employing a unique combination of educational videos, classroom and in-plant instruction utilizing a "Corps of Craftsman." The latest efforts build on this work to further develop and implement a national model offering distance-learning courses to industry professionals or students in existing woodworking training programs. Through this program, students earn a wood technician certificate which is applied towards an associate degree in wood products technology. MWCC is completing the development of and is offering the full associate degree program for woodworking technicians on a distance-learning basis in conjunction with an ongoing Winrock International apprenticeship program in Arkansas. Once their full program is underway in Arkansas, it will be expanded to at least one other state during the project period. The intent is to eventually use the Arkansas program as a national model. Courses are being offered through a unique combination of distance-learning and classroom instruction. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The "Corps of Craftsmen," consisting of both retired and non-retired personnel, was established as part of the initial NSF project. These craftpersons also assist in some of the hands-on educational instruction of the program. The course materials developed for the education of apprentices in Arkansas are also being used for a project currently underway in Washington, D.C. MWCC faculty are working in Washington, D.C. to train a diverse group of inner-city youths in woodworking, with partial support from their previous NSF grant. Ongoing participation of these youths in the project enhances their opportunities for learning. Another unique component of their program involves the inclusion of an industry trade magazine. Non-credit and for-credit course modules (portions of full courses) are being administered in cooperation with Wood Digest magazine on a national level. A major strength of their project is the involvement of several public and private organizations.</AbstractNarration>
