<AbstractNarration>AST-0239425&lt;br/&gt;Barger&lt;br/&gt;This project intends to identify and study the sources that comprise the X-ray extragalactic background light.  For the first time, a nearly complete census of soft and hard X-ray sources can now be made using images from the Chandra X-ray Observatory, and follow-up observations will be made from the ground at radio, submillimeter, infrared and optical wavelengths.  Study of the supermassive black holes in the host galaxies should help to resolve one of the most important questions about the thermal history of the Universe, namely, whether the intergalactic medium was reionized by accreting black holes or by stars.  The combination of very deep with wide area data will determine the luminosity function for active galactic nuclei and thus reconstruct the black hole accretion history of the Universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The significant discoveries that will be made in this very special era of observational cosmology will be presented to the public and to educators through various programs.&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>
