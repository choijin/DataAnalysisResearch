<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; A grant has been awarded to the Whitney Laboratory, University of Florida, under the direction of Dr. Anderson, to protect the electrical power supply of the Whitney Laboratory. Because of its location in on the north east coast of Florida, a region traversed by tropical weather systems, the Laboratory is extremely vulnerable to disruptions of its power supply. Long term interruptions of the power supply can result in the loss of valuable and sometimes irreplaceable stocks of cells, antibodies and other supplies, and would put animals in the Laboratory's aquarium at risk because of a lack of flowing sea water and aeration. Furthermore, when power to the air conditioning system is lost, the Laboratory's sensitive cell and molecular biological equipment is be extremely vulnerable to damage from the high humidity and salt air that accumulates in the Laboratory. The Laboratory is also very vulnerable to short term outages and power surges caused by the many lightening strikes that typify weather pattern in the region. These can and have damaged equipment and cause unnecessary interruption to on-going research. While small items of equipment (i.e. computers) can be protected by commercial surge suppressors, large items such as ultracold freezers cannot be protected in this manner and are frequently damaged by power surges, putting frozen stocks and supplies at risk of thawing and subsequent loss. &lt;br/&gt; The Laboratory currently uses a 25 year old generator to provide emergency power. However, this unit, which was installed when the Laboratory was established and minimally equipped, supplies less than 50% of its rated power. Consequently, it is insufficient for the current needs of the Laboratory, to the point at which much of the critical equipment, including freezers, cannot be served by this unit. Furthermore, during prolonged operation it overheats and must be turned off to cool down every few hours. To correct this deficiency, the Laboratory will use the funds provided by this grant to purchase and install a replacement generator that will meet the current and projected needs of the Laboratory. To protect against power surges from lightening strikes, central surge suppressors will be installed in the Laboratory's electrical system.&lt;br/&gt; The Whitney Laboratory is recognized as one of the leading marine biomedical institutions in the country that has and continues to make significant contributions to our understanding of basic biological mechanisms, many of which directly affect mankind. To support this research, the Laboratory possess a diverse array of very sensitive instrumentation such as a DNA sequencer, numerous microscopes, including a laser scanning confocal microscope, a capillary electrophoresis systems, ultracentrifuges and electrophysiological equipment.  In addition to its research mission, the Laboratory has developed a variety of training programs for college students, including a very active REU program, and a very active and well received program of outreach education to all age groups in the surrounding community. The funds provided by this grant will ensure that these activities are not jeopardized by short and long term power interruptions that are a common feature of the coastal environment that is so critical to the Laboratory's mission and success.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
