<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;The project would focus on examining aspects of in-service professional development of elementary and secondary teachers.  The researchers propose to use existing national surveys, such as the Schools and Staffing Survey and the Eisenhower Professional Development Program to analyze how state and school district policies influence teacher participation in professional development.  The study would also address how the content covered in professional development is associated with the content covered in teachers' instruction and student achievement.     One hypothesis is that school organization influences the teacher's participation in professional development and that the content-focus of professional development influences the content of instruction which is associated with student achievement for particular content areas.  The study is intended to emphasize the role of professional development within the causal framework of affecting the adoption of reform efforts and student achievement.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal seeks to use large existing databases about teachers to learn more about linking state and local policies to improving professional development and how it is linked to student achievement, if at all.  The researchers will conduct extensive analysis of large databases.</AbstractNarration>
