    <AbstractNarration>The main objective of the Gordon Research Conference on Nuclear&lt;br/&gt;Chemistry is to provide the international community of nuclear&lt;br/&gt;scientists with a unique forum in which the newest developments at&lt;br/&gt;the forefront of this science can be presented and subjected to&lt;br/&gt;detailed and extended discussions and criticism. The purpose of the&lt;br/&gt;conference is to encourage communication and the discussions to be&lt;br/&gt;conducted in an atmosphere conducive to open interactions between&lt;br/&gt;the scientists, provoking new and even speculative ideas for future&lt;br/&gt;research. To accomplish these goals requires the participation in&lt;br/&gt;all of the conference activities of a significant number of leaders&lt;br/&gt;in the field. The participation of younger scientists is essential&lt;br/&gt;to address the future manpower needs of this rapidly changing field.&lt;br/&gt;Therefore, bright and promising postdoctoral researchers and&lt;br/&gt;graduate students have been specially selected for participation in&lt;br/&gt;this conference and encouraged to present their ideas. Their&lt;br/&gt;participation in this conference provides them with unique and&lt;br/&gt;extensive access to the leaders in their field, exposes them to new&lt;br/&gt;research opportunities and techniques and helps prepare them for the&lt;br/&gt;leadership roles they will assume in the future. This award will&lt;br/&gt;facilitate participation from these junior scientists.</AbstractNarration>
