    <AbstractNarration>The Garfield Park Conservatory will develop, install and evaluate "Sugar from the Sun," a living plant exhibition that explores the fundamental biological process of photosynthesis. The exhibit addresses common misunderstandings and misconceptions about photosynthesis by engaging children and adults in activities that explore the primary concepts that plants require air, water and light to produce sugar, and that the sun is the energy source. The exhibit will be constructed in the Conservatory's Sweet House, where tropical plants such as mangos and bananas will provide the stimulus to engage visitors in learning how plants manufacture sugar from the sun. Exhibits convey the science of photosynthesis and inspire appreciation for the critical role plants play in sustaining life on earth. Supplementary educational materials (self-guides, exploration backpacks and an interactive website) will be layered into the visitor experience, enabling visitors to develop a deeper understanding of photosynthesis. The project also will develop a non-exhibit based model dissemination package for teaching photosynthesis in other conservatories, promoting active science learning about photosynthesis nationwide.</AbstractNarration>
