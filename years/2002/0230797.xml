<AbstractNarration>Ocean Studies Board Study on Cabled Observatories for Regional Oceanographic Research&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For many years, Geoscientists have realized that Earth cannot be studied adequately in a static manner by simply characterizing it over limited regions or for short periods; instead, we must understand the myriad global processes that actively shape the Earth and ultimately impact society. These processes occur over a vast range of temporal and spatial scales and exhibit considerable co-variation and dynamic linkages.  To characterize the temporal behavior of these dynamic systems, the establishment of long-term observational capabilities has been proposed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NSF proposed Ocean Observatories Initiative would provide new modes of access to the ocean in order to study these interconnected processes. The system would consist of three elements: 1) a regional-scale observatory consisting of interconnected sites on the seafloor that span several geological and oceanographic features and processes; 2) several relocatable deep-sea observatories that are based around a system of buoys; and 3) an expanded network of coastal observatories.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1999, OCE funded a National Research Council study designed to examine the scientific merit of, technical requirements for, and overall feasibility of establishing a system of seafloor observatories. The Committee on Seafloor Observatories was formed and the "Symposium of Seafloor Observatories" was held in January 2000. This symposium and study resulted in the publication of  "Illuminating the Hidden Planet: The Future of Seafloor Observatory Science"     &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a follow on to the previous study, this study will describe the scientific problems that could most effectively be addressed through a regional-scale cabled ocean observatory. It will then discuss the strategies needed to design an observatory that can best carry out this science. Strategies considered should include criteria for locating a cabled observatory, sensor requirements, data transfer rates, power needs, and other design considerations.  In arriving at its findings and recommendations, the study committee will consider recent reports that outline ocean science research priorities, existing cabled observatory strategies and implementation plans, and input from the ocean research community.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
