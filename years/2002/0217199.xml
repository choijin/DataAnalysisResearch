    <AbstractNarration>The Educational Television Endowment of South Carolina, in collaboration with the South&lt;br/&gt;Carolina Educational Television Network (SCETV), will carry out a program to increase middle&lt;br/&gt;school girls' enthusiasm for and understanding of technology and introduce them to women who&lt;br/&gt;work in science and technology fields. The project is a three-year pilot program called TECH&lt;br/&gt;TEAM that consists of afterschool technology clubs, workshops in computer applications at&lt;br/&gt;SCETV and Summer Technology Day Camps. Partners include the Girl Scouts of the Congaree&lt;br/&gt;Area, Inc., the Girl Scout Council of the Pee Dee Area, and the College of Education of the&lt;br/&gt;University of South Carolina. In addition to the girls themselves, TECH TEAM will train the club&lt;br/&gt;facilitators - teachers and Girl Scout leaders - in video and computer-based technologies, project&lt;br/&gt;based curriculum development and techniques for gender equitable education in an annual series&lt;br/&gt;of Saturday workshops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The TECH TEAM project will take place in three South Carolina school districts - the School&lt;br/&gt;District of Fairfield County, Richland District One and Marion District One - all of which are&lt;br/&gt;considered critical needs districts. Fairfield is a rural county in which 40.8% of the adults have&lt;br/&gt;less than a high school education and unemployment is at the second highest level in the state.&lt;br/&gt;Marion District One is in a poor, rural area in which 76% of the students qualify for free or&lt;br/&gt;reduced lunch, over 50% come from single parent homes and 75% are minority. Richland District&lt;br/&gt;One is an urban district. 80% of students are minority and 58% qualify for free or reduced lunch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECH TEAM is designed to increase girls' technological fluency through a progressive sequence&lt;br/&gt;of technology applications in a hands-on, project based setting. In the first year, 2002-2003, the&lt;br/&gt;girls will videotape interviews with local women who work in the fields of science, math,&lt;br/&gt;technology and engineering. To locate their interviewees, they will learn and use research skills,&lt;br/&gt;including both informal and Internet-based techniques. The girls will edit their videos using a&lt;br/&gt;computer-based editing program, and broadcast them to schools across South Carolina via&lt;br/&gt;SCETV's Instructional Television Fixed Service (ITFS). They will host two-way call-in shows on&lt;br/&gt;the ITFS, allowing students anywhere in the state to respond and ask the girls questions.&lt;br/&gt;In the second year of the project, 2003-2004, the girls will create a Web site about TECH TEAM&lt;br/&gt;that will be integrated into www.knowitall.org, SCETV's Web portal for teachers and students. The&lt;br/&gt;girls will design the layout of their site and publish writing, post videos and contribute to a&lt;br/&gt;threaded discussion that will be developed for the site. In TECH TEAM's third year, 2004-2005,&lt;br/&gt;the girls will create a searchable database of their videos for inclusion on the site, adding dynamic&lt;br/&gt;elements that require the use of computer codes, so that they extend their fluency in the use of&lt;br/&gt;computer technology. They will learn about SQL (Structured Query Language), and they will&lt;br/&gt;develop CFML (Cold Fusion Markup Language) to make their databases Web accessible. In&lt;br/&gt;addition to the afterschool clubs, they will attend a series of Saturday workshops taught by&lt;br/&gt;SCETV programmers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During each summer of the project the TECH TEAM girls will attend a Summer Technology Day&lt;br/&gt;Camps at SCETV's Telecommunications Center in Columbia. The camps will allow all the&lt;br/&gt;participants to meet each other, work in SCETV's computer labs, and present their work to an&lt;br/&gt;invited audience. Throughout each year a video crew will document the progress of TECH TEAM&lt;br/&gt;on videotape and interview the participants. This material will form the basis of a CD-ROM to be&lt;br/&gt;produced for teachers' professional development. The CD will be mailed free of charge to every&lt;br/&gt;middle school in South Carolina and will be made available nationwide through SCETV's&lt;br/&gt;marketing division. Evaluation and assessment of TECH TEAM will be conducted by Dr. Kenneth&lt;br/&gt;Stevenson of the College of Education of the University of South Carolina.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The impact of TECH TEAM goes beyond gender equity considerations to universal issues of&lt;br/&gt;technology education, teacher training, adolescent development, the design of afterschool&lt;br/&gt;programs, and partnerships between schools and informal education providers; TECH TEAM will&lt;br/&gt;advance understanding of these areas as they apply not only to girls but to all students and&lt;br/&gt;teachers.</AbstractNarration>
