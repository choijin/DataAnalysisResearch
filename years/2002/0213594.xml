    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to develop a novel low-voltage periodic poling technique for creating highly efficient quasi-phase matched waveguides in nonlinear optical materials. The key innovation of the proposed technology is the use of co-planar micro-comb electrodes to periodically pole waveguides embedded in a nonlinear optical material such as potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP). Periodically poled waveguides will enable highly efficient, quasi-phase matched (QPM), nonlinear optical frequency conversion of continuous wave and low peak power quasi-continuous radiation. The proposed technique will allow multiple waveguides with different QPM gratings to be fabricated onto a single device, thereby building in wavelength flexibility as well as reducing cost. The anticipated benefits of low-voltage poling are waveguides with significantly improved conversion efficiency, low scattering loss, and increased manufacturing yields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial applications of this project are in the areas of bioanalytical instrumentation (such as medical diagnostics, flow cytometers and medical imagers) and telecommunications.</AbstractNarration>
