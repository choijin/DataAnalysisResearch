<AbstractNarration>This proposal was received in response to NSE, NSF 01-157.  The project focuses on the development of a new approach to structured atomic deposition and lithography.   Lithography using neutral atom beams focused by standing wave light fields shows great promise for nanoscale fabrication.  However, the method has so far been limited to the production of spatially periodic patterns, which greatly limits the versatility of the technique.  In this new approach a new method of synthesizing light induced lenses which permit the creation of a single localized spot at an arbitrary position in the plane will be used.  The spot can be scanned without mechanical motion using spatial light modulators, such that arbitrary two-dimensional patterns can be generated.  The project is jointly funded by the Divisions of Physics and Materials Research in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate.</AbstractNarration>
