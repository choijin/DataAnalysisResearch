<AbstractNarration>Recent trends in submicron CMOS scaling suggest that global interconnects will increasingly become a major performance limitation due to increased signal delay and cross-talk noise. The implementation of copper and low k wiring technology mitigates the effect of scaling on signal delay and cross-talk in local and intermediate interconnects. However, the benefits of new materials may not be sufficient for scaling long global interconnects due to the increasing RC delays. The near term solution adopted by the semiconductor industry to minimize the relative delay, according to the 1TRS roadmap, has been to increase the aspect ratio of interconnects. However, the increase in metal thickness, reduction in metal pitch and continuing voltage scaling with each technology generation will progressively exacerbate the noise problem due to interconnect capacitive and inductive coupling effects and will eventually become the dominant problem over local and global propagation delays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research described in this proposal will address the signal propagation delay and cross-talk noise limitations in deep submicron interconnects by introducing a fundamental change in the signaling approach: the use of current-mode band-limited signaling to reduce the signal delay and cross-talk noise bottlenecks in CMOS VLSI's. To reduce cross-talk noise due to capacitive and inductive effects, the proposed signaling scheme based on band-limited basis waveforms will partially replace the square pulses in critical communication links within the system. A preliminary remit from the proposed band-limited signaling scheme in 0.35-urn CMOS process shows capacitive cross-talk noise reduction beyond 30 percent for aluminum and copper interconnects. An attractive result from the proposed signaling approach is that given the signal bandwidth and noise margin requirements, longer interconnects lines or higher interconnect densities can be achieved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To overcome the bandwidth limitations in the deep submicron regime, new approaches to high-speed signaling are required. In the proposed research, we intend to use current-mode circuit techniques to improve the bandwidth performance and reduce signal delay. Current-mode sensing has received limited attention for signaling in global interconnections partially due to the popularity of voltage-mode full swing repeater insertion methodologies. . It can be shown that as CMOS technology continues to scale, the number of repeaters required to achieve the projected performance criteria will increase dramatically and constitute a significant portion of the total system power dissipation. Therefore, current-mode sensing circuits will increasingly become popular in this deep submicron IC era.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Accurate estimation of propagation delay and cross-talk noise in long global interconnects plays an important role in the early design stages of high performance VLSI systems. Various techniques based on simulations and/or analytical closed-form formulations have been proposed to model delay and cross-talk in interconnects. The bulk of the work dedicated to this area targets capacitively terminated lines for voltage mode signaling. However, with the increasing speed requirements in VLSI circuits, current mode signal transporting techniques may provide an attractive solution to some of the challenges caused by aggressive interconnect scaling. To accommodate current-mode signaling techniques, we propose to derive efficient closed-form analytical models for a driven distributed RC line with arbitrary termination. The accuracy of this work is predicted to be the same as Elmore Delay formulation, extended to accommodate current-mode type circuits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this research, we intend to develop the theoretical basis for the proposed current-mode band-limited signaling scheme and analytically formulate its impact on cross-talk noise and signal delay reduction. We will target our study toward understanding its effects on interconnect coupling noise. Study of circuit design issues will be followed by prototype fabrication for conceptual and experimental verification. Finally, we intend to apply this knowledge to build a high performance wide bus system to prove the noise reduction advantages.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
