<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;A grant has been awarded to Dr. John T. Beneski at West Chester University to purchase an Environmental Scanning Electron Microscope with an EDS system. The addition of this equipment to West Chester University will significantly increase the research opportunities for our faculty and students (particularly in the sciences), enhance our ability to attract new students from the widest diversity of backgrounds, enhance our ability to train students in state-of-the-art marketable skills, and provide new opportunities for our faculty and students to collaborate with scientists from the local high-tech corridor of biotechnology-related industries.&lt;br/&gt;The new electron microscope will be used extensively by faculty and students in the Departments of Biology, Geology &amp; Astronomy, and Chemistry to investigate a wide variety of problems including: (1) a taxonomic investigation of bryophytes; (2) the formation, structure, composition, and physiology of urine spheres in uricotelic vertebrates; (3) the examination of various halophilic bacteria isolated from ancient (250 mya and older) surface sterilized salt crystals; and (4) the dynamics of Mid-Cretaceous ocean circulation. Dr. Beneski will provide additional opportunities for students by actively promoting independent student research projects and internships. In addition to research and training, the new SEM/EDS will be used as a recruitment tool for attracting new science majors from both traditional and non-traditional backgrounds. To accomplish this, Dr. Beneski will expand the hands-on demonstrations and tours that showcase the imaging technologies available in the Center for Advanced Scientific Imaging; these demonstrations and tours are presented to the potential students that regularly visit the University as part of existing programs targeting area high schools, transfer students, and underserved groups.&lt;br/&gt;West Chester University's continued growth in providing state-of-the-art imaging technologies and resources not only serves the immediate and future needs of our faculty and students in the sciences, it also mirrors a growing emphasis on the sciences and technology by the State of Pennsylvania and PA State System of Higher Education. Both of these institutions expect West Chester University to recruit and train more students in the sciences and technology. The acquisition of the requested equipment is a critical step in the continued development of Center for Advanced Scientific Imaging as a key resource for research and research training at West Chester University. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
