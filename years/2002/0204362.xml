<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;0204362&lt;br/&gt;Beeson, Michael&lt;br/&gt;San Jose State Univ Fdn&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will enhance the theorem-prover Otter to cope better with second-order logic. It will use this enhanced version of Otter to formalize a small amount of elementary number theory, a small amount of set theory, and theorems about the cardinality of finite sets, as required to proceed to theorems in group theory as usually presented in an undergraduate course in algebra, up to and perhaps (but not necessarily) including the Sylow theorems.   It will also enhance Otter by adding a capability for polynomial simplification,  which in turn will enable it to proceed further in number theory.  Although first-order group theory has been a source of many test problems for automated deduction, the material in an undergraduate course typically begins with theorems about subgroups and homomorphisms, and uses the concept of a prime number,  so second-order logic (or set theory) and induction are essential ingredients to even sophomore-level mathematics. It is high time that theorem-provers be made able to cope with these fundamental areas of mathematics, which are naturally multi-sorted (elements, numbers, functions, and sets) and second-order (elements, cosets, subgroups).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The long-term aim of automated deduction is to make the computer useful as a "mathematician's assistant".   The goal is that the computer could check proofs,  filling in any missing details, and verify their correctness.  Perhaps the computer could carry out some of the simpler parts of the mathematics mechanically.  Maybe (in the distant future) the computer might even prove interesting new theorems on a regular basis.   At present computers can be used for some kinds of calculations,  but their use for helping with proofs is in its infancy, in spite of half a century of research.   Part of the problem is the richness of mathematical language;  part of the problem is the complicated relationship between calculations and proofs; and part of the problem is the "needle-in-the-haystack" difficulty of finding a proof or disproof of an unsolved conjecture.    Otter  is a theorem-proving program developed at Argonne National Laboratories. This research will provide some enhancements to Otter that should help it deal with the "richness of language" problem and the "calculations within proofs"  problem.   To test the effectiveness of our efforts, the PI will try to "computerize" some theorems in mathematics that are usually taught in the sophomore or junior year to mathematics majors.   These are theorems in an area of mathematics called "group theory", which usually comes after calculus and is widely used in many branches of mathematics and physics.  Many of the theorems found in the first course in this subject have so far resisted attempts to get computers to prove them.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
