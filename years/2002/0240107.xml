<AbstractNarration>The Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research (IAI) was created by an international agreement concluded among representatives of American States, namely the Agreement Establishing the Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research, done at Montevideo on May 13, 1992 ("the IAI Agreement").  The IAI Agreement created an intergovernmental organization for the purposes of coordinating and promoting scientific research related to global change.  The Institute has an evolving "Scientific Agenda" identifying particular areas for research.  Full membership in the IAI is limited to States, although the IAI Agreement also provides for non-State entities to become "Associates of the Institute."&lt;br/&gt;The Institute is governed by an annual Conference of the Parties, and by a subsidiary Executive Council (EC).  The US Government currently serves on the EC.  The Institute has a permanent secretariat, the "Directorate."  The procedures and practices of the IAI's governing institutions are elaborated in detailed rules of procedure.  The IAI thus possesses the fundamental institutional characteristics of an international organization:  it was created by international agreement, is composed of States and is governed by governing bodies composed of representatives of States.&lt;br/&gt;The US Government participates actively in the IAI.  The United States played a leading role in the creation of the IAI and has been an active participant in the IAI since its creation.  Senior US Government officials serve on the Executive Council and hold other responsible positions related to IAI activities.  Furthermore, the IAI has been listed by the State Department and by the Office of Personnel Management as an international organization within the meaning of the Federal Employees International Organization Service Act, covered by 5 U.S.C. 3343 and 5 U.S.C. 3581.&lt;br/&gt;Core Budget support, for which this proposal is submitted, allows the operation of the Directorate of the IAI, and provides support for its scientific advisory body.  Currently, the IAI Directorate is hosted by Brazil in Sao Jose dos Campos, Sao Paulo state, on the campus of the Brazilian National Space Research Institute (INPE), where the IAI Directorate functions as an internationally recognized juridical personality, with the corresponding privileges and immunities granted by the Government of Brazil.&lt;br/&gt;The IAI receives Core Budget contributions from the other Parties to the Agreement Establishing the IAI:  Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Jamaica, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela.  Amounts are arrived at by consensus at an annual meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the IAI Agreement.&lt;br/&gt;The IAI is a U.S. initiative to stimulate cooperative research on global change issues among the scientific institutions of the Americas.  The National Science Foundation is the lead U.S. Government agency designated by the White House to carry out U.S. responsibilities within the IAI.&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;The Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research (IAI) was created by an international agreement concluded among representatives of American States, namely the Agreement Establishing the Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research, done at Montevideo on May 13, 1992 ("the IAI Agreement").
