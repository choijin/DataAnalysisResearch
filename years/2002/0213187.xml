<AbstractNarration>0213187&lt;br/&gt;Hooper&lt;br/&gt;The search for patterns of community assembly has occupied the last 25 years in&lt;br/&gt;community ecology and remains controversial today. A commonly sought assembly rule is that&lt;br/&gt;species coexistence in communities will be enhanced by differences in traits related to&lt;br/&gt;competition for limiting resources (i.e., that niche overlap is minimized). Put another way, do&lt;br/&gt;species from complementary guilds or functional groups have a better chance of persisting than&lt;br/&gt;those with strong overlap in resource use characteristics? Evidence for the role of&lt;br/&gt;complementarity among plant groups in structuring communities is sporadic. The balance&lt;br/&gt;between rates of external stochastic processes (such as disturbance or priority effects of&lt;br/&gt;colonization) compared to internal community dynamics (such as competition or facilitation)&lt;br/&gt;may be critical in determining the degree to which internal assembly dynamics are manifested.&lt;br/&gt;Gaining further insight into this question is critical for understanding how communities might be&lt;br/&gt;structured, and for the implications of that structure for ecosystem dynamics.&lt;br/&gt;We propose a five-year experiment to assess the roles of initial plant composition and&lt;br/&gt;functional complementarity in structuring communities of serpentine annual grasslands. We&lt;br/&gt;seek to test several hypotheses centered on the following questions, generally grouped into two&lt;br/&gt;themes: 1) Does the initial composition of a community shape its subsequent development? If so,&lt;br/&gt;for how long? Are there different stable endpoints? 2) To what extent does complementary&lt;br/&gt;resource use (i.e., niche differentiation) versus dominance among plant species govern patterns&lt;br/&gt;of community development? Are other factors, such as seed input or climatic conditions more&lt;br/&gt;important in determining community composition? Our goal is not to prove or disprove the&lt;br/&gt;predominance of assembly rules, but rather to better understand the conditions under which they&lt;br/&gt;might strongly influence community composition versus be overwhelmed by other factors.&lt;br/&gt;We will use as our experimental system a series of California serpentine grassland&lt;br/&gt;communities that vary in functional group composition and richness. Functional composition&lt;br/&gt;has been maintained since the plots were established in 1992. In fall 1999 and 2000, seeds of six&lt;br/&gt;additional species (3 species each from two groups) were added to test the effects of functional&lt;br/&gt;characteristics and diversity on invasibility of ecosystems. Thus we now have a system with&lt;br/&gt;treatments that differ in initial functional composition, that have had common seed sources for a&lt;br/&gt;number of additional species, and that will be subject to continuing seed rain from surrounding&lt;br/&gt;grasslands. Our plan is to track changes in community composition over the next five years as&lt;br/&gt;the communities develop from their initially different starting points.  Monitoring of vegetation changes in these experimental communities through the next several years provides a unique opportunity to gain insight into interactions among a variety of processes that help shape ecological communities.</AbstractNarration>
