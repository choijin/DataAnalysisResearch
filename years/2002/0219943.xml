    <AbstractNarration>The recent and growing popularity of thin-client systems makes it&lt;br/&gt;important to develop techniques for analyzing and comparing their&lt;br/&gt;performance, to assess the general feasibility of the thin-client&lt;br/&gt;computing model in modern networking environments, and to determine&lt;br/&gt;the factors that govern the performance of these architectures. &lt;br/&gt;This project involves carrying out a series of experiments to gain&lt;br/&gt;information and understanding on the effectiveness of thin-client&lt;br/&gt;architectural mechanisms for graphical and multimedia applications in&lt;br/&gt;various network environments. These experiments include performance&lt;br/&gt;analysis using several real applications as well as controlled&lt;br/&gt;experiments with specialized micro-benchmarks designed to isolate&lt;br/&gt;particular aspects of thin-client architectures that have significant&lt;br/&gt;impact on overall application performance. Application and user&lt;br/&gt;workloads will be varied to understand and analyze the scalability of&lt;br/&gt;different remote display mechanisms in terms of network and server&lt;br/&gt;resources. These experiments will be conducted in a testbed&lt;br/&gt;environment in which network characteristics such as bandwidth,&lt;br/&gt;latency, and packet loss are varied in a controlled manner to&lt;br/&gt;understand their impact on thin-client architectural design&lt;br/&gt;choices. The results of these experiments will have a fundamental&lt;br/&gt;scientific impact by laying a quantitative foundation for future&lt;br/&gt;innovations in thin-client computing research.</AbstractNarration>
