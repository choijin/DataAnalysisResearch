<AbstractNarration>Pnueli, Emerson, and Sistla&lt;br/&gt;CCR-0205571, CCR-0205483 and CCR-0205365&lt;br/&gt;"Towards a Seamless Process for the Development of Embedded Systems"&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Embedded systems are of vital economic importance and are literally&lt;br/&gt;becoming ubiquitous. They have already become an integral component of&lt;br/&gt;safety critical systems involving aviation, military,&lt;br/&gt;telecommunications, and process control applications.  Interest in&lt;br/&gt;embedded systems is growing further due to the expectation that they&lt;br/&gt;will become a key component of many commonplace consumer appliances.&lt;br/&gt;Consumers will expect levels of reliability and predictability&lt;br/&gt;associated with the very best brands of cars, televisions, and&lt;br/&gt;refrigerators. Glitches, crashes, and general erratic behavior of the&lt;br/&gt;sort seen with prior generations of consumer PC software products will&lt;br/&gt;be unacceptable for these embedded applications.  It thus becomes&lt;br/&gt;crucial that these embedded software systems satisfy high levels of&lt;br/&gt;correctness criteria, well above those of today's large software&lt;br/&gt;systems, which are often highly error-prone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besides the requirement of a new standard of functional correctness,&lt;br/&gt;embedded systems pose additional challenges which were not fully&lt;br/&gt;addressed by previous validation and verification approaches. These&lt;br/&gt;include adequate guarantees of timeliness, low or controlled power&lt;br/&gt;consumption, and low or controlled memory utilization.  With the&lt;br/&gt;spread of embedded systems, and the need to guarantee an acceptable&lt;br/&gt;level of functionality and reliability of the applications they are&lt;br/&gt;embedded in, the industry needs an effective and reliable development&lt;br/&gt;process. Due to market constraints, such a process should also support&lt;br/&gt;a fast turn-around time as well as enable the easy design of many&lt;br/&gt;customized variations of the same product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is developing the foundation for a seamless design&lt;br/&gt;process for embedded systems as described below.  In particular, it is&lt;br/&gt;developing:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; A formal visual language for requirements, including behavioral,&lt;br/&gt; temporal, and TPM constraints;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; A methodology for the automatic synthesis of an executable&lt;br/&gt; specification from the requirement specification language;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; A methodology for the verification of the intermediate and&lt;br/&gt; distributed representation of the systems against requirements;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; A methododology for automatic code-distribution of&lt;br/&gt; specifications, possibly with some architectural constraints&lt;br/&gt; provided by the user;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; A model for representing hardware/software co-design&lt;br/&gt; platforms that enables modeling of both loosely- and tightly-coupled&lt;br/&gt; components as well as compositional reasoning about them;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Algorithms for automatically generating &lt;br/&gt; architecture-optimized code from executable specifications;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Methods for translation validation of the&lt;br/&gt; generated code and run-time validation on the system using&lt;br/&gt;  monitors;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The Design of a profiler process which analyzes machine code,&lt;br/&gt; computes the resulting figures for time, power, and memory, and&lt;br/&gt; back-associate these figures with their executable specification&lt;br/&gt; sources, enabling early-stage analysis of these requirements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The impact of the project is to streamline and significantly&lt;br/&gt;accelerate the time to market of embedded applications of both new&lt;br/&gt;products and revisions and customizations of existing product lines.&lt;br/&gt;Another impact is to upgrade the level of dependability and&lt;br/&gt;predictability of embedded software to new standards, compatible and&lt;br/&gt;comparable to those expected from the best brands of consumer&lt;br/&gt;products.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
