<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;CCR0 0239511&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a workshop on information for Critical Infrastructure Protection, organized by the University of California at Berkeley, in cooperation with Vanderbilt University and the University of Virginia.  The NSF Workshop on Information Technology Research for Critical Infrastructure Protection, to be held in cooperation with OSTP, September 19-24, 2002 in Leesburg VA.  The purpose is to evaluate status and identify research needs for information technology embedded in critical infrastructures.  This workshop addresses research gaps in secure, networked, embedded systems for critical infrastructures; Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems; and infrastructure interdependencies.  The first session is a two-day, in-depth exploration of research needs.  This session brings together the academic research community, industry, and federal participants.  The objective is the identification of challenge areas and development of a research agenda for software and information technology to support secure, networked, embedded systems.  The goal is a new software and systems research strategy that can underpin next-generation embedded systems, provide research infrastructure, and ultimately improve the nation's critical infrastructure.  Next is a one-day session, organized and co-funded by the Computing Research Association, to discuss academic perspectives on challenges in Critical Infrastructure Protection.  Concluding the workshop is a two-day session jointly sponsored by NSF, the Department of State, and OSTP to promote global progress on these issues and to promote international collaboration between researchers in the US and the EU.   The product of the workshop is a report, made available to the research community, to OSTP for strategic planning and to NSF and other Federal program managers for planning and coordination of research investments.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
