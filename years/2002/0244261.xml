<AbstractNarration>The proposal is to study duality in various field theories. In particular target space duality will be investigated in two dimensional sigma models. Particular emphasis will be placed on uncovering geometrical structure in quantum field theories. Geometrical methods will also be used to study Yang-Mills theory in the 1/N expansion in 2, 3 and 4 dimensions.&lt;br/&gt;Another aspect of the proposal is to study integrable quantum field theories that have boundaries. One such model is the sine-Gordon model with higher-spin conserved charges. Due to the exact solvability of the model, one hopes to gain insight into the non-perturbative aspects of theories with boundaries. This has important significance for brane-world physics as well as many condensed matter systems.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
