<AbstractNarration>99743430&lt;br/&gt;Bates&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project concerns the dynamics of both spatially discrete and &lt;br/&gt;continuous but non-local evolutionary systems.  In particular, we are &lt;br/&gt;concerned with the existence, stability, and variety of spatial patterns in &lt;br/&gt;interacting and reacting systems which exhibit threshold behavior.  Not &lt;br/&gt;just stationary patterns but also those which evolve in a predictable way.  &lt;br/&gt;The systems of equations arise in the field of computational neural &lt;br/&gt;networks designed to perform specialized tasks such as automatic image &lt;br/&gt;recognition.  They also arise in population dynamics, in models of phase &lt;br/&gt;transitions, in models of the primary visual cortex of the brain, and in &lt;br/&gt;computer simulation of a wide variety of continuum processes where &lt;br/&gt;discretization is the standard approach.  Results from the project will have &lt;br/&gt;a direct impact on the understanding of computational experiments and on &lt;br/&gt;the assumptions on which the mathematical models of many physical &lt;br/&gt;phenomena rest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From one perspective, the project explores some of the basic challenges of &lt;br/&gt;present day material science: The modeling of processes which cause and &lt;br/&gt;accompany change of phases or crystalline variants of a substance. New &lt;br/&gt;mathematical models are being continually proposed, with the hope of &lt;br/&gt;shedding insight into the basic physics of these processes. Successful &lt;br/&gt;modeling can offer help in the development of new high performance &lt;br/&gt;materials, which is vital to economic and other national interests.  From &lt;br/&gt;another perspective, the theoretical study of neural networks will lead to &lt;br/&gt;the development of automatic pattern recognition, useful in such widely &lt;br/&gt;diverse areas as text analysis, target identification, and image &lt;br/&gt;enhancement.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
