<AbstractNarration>This Conference on Visualization in Science and Education brings together practitioners from four sectors:  scientists, cognitive psychologists, educators, and evaluators to examine the teaching of science and the science of teaching. All four sectors are needed to ensure that the next generation of visualization tools are accurate (the scientists' role), convey the intended message (the cognitive psychologists' role) and minimize barriers to learning (the educators' role).  Evaluators, the fourth sector, form the essential base for the other three groups by determining that the student has assimilated the intended message and evaluating whether the visualization facilitated the process. The primary purpose of the conference is to lay the foundation for images that are ever more effective at conveying the intended meaning.  To bring participants up-to-speed on the latest hardware and software developments, the project contains a pre-conference Workshop. Workshop participants will be provided with hands-on experience with cutting-edge hardware and software.  Finally, to ensure a lasting change from the newly formed collaborations, conference participants will be invited to apply for Mini-Grants.  Mini-Grants consist of modest funds that are intended to assist with development of larger scope proposals to either create new technology or improve existing tools for visualization to deliver on the promise of reconceptualizing instructional delivery.  In addition, a session is planned that specifically addresses alternate learning styles, a subject that is expected to appeal to a broad audience. As part of the Gordon Research Conference Organization, the conference is well advertised, recruiting participants from all members of the science research and education enterprise.</AbstractNarration>
