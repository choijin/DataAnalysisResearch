<AbstractNarration>DVD research reports can bring coherence to teachers and researchers perspectives on pedagogy that are very difficult to convey in written text, by embodying them as active learning supports.  The research proposed here will explore the design and technological issues in making such DVDs imbedded in an ongoing NSF-sponsored research study of urban children's mathematical thinking.  This new line of research draws on the substantial progress that was made in understanding of student mathematical thinking in inner city classrooms.  Furthermore, this project will allow for dissemination efforts that will reach teachers in ways that allow them to change their own teaching in constructive ways.  Additionally, researchers will be able to use the DVD material to support new research avenues.  The research will generate 3 successive versions of the DVD with field-testing among audiences with each iteration/version.  Products of the research include the DVD's and a design framework for further work in the domain.</AbstractNarration>
