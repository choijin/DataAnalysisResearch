<AbstractNarration>PROPOSAL NO.: 0230642&lt;br/&gt;PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Gilbert, Thomas&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION NAME: Northeastern University&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: Engineering Connections in Grades 11-13 Science and Math Courses&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal describes  a  year-long planning process to develop  a model of teaching &lt;br/&gt;that  reflects  current  cognitive  learning  theory  and  that  will  create  a  common  pedagogical framework for science  and math  courses taken by  juniors and seniors in high school  and college freshmen. The  overarching  goal of this project is to recruit and retain a large and diverse population of young people to programs of study leading to careers as: 1) engineering professions in which they are master problem  solvers and developers  of new solutions to engineering challenges; and 2) high school math and science teachers who understand and are critical consumers of technology, and who can extrapolate fundamental concepts to engineering applications.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The planning team consists of Northeastern University (NU) faculty from engineering, &lt;br/&gt;biology,  chemistry,  mathematics  and  physics  and  Boston  Public  School  (BPS)  math  and science  teachers.  They will  form  a  community  of reflective teaching practitioners spanning across disciplines and the high school-university divide.  These communities will meet to assess and enhance their own teaching practices and will collaboratively design: 1) a 3-week Urban Engineering Summer Camp for juniors from the John D. O'Bryant School of Mathematics and  Science in Boston; 2)  engineering activity modules for G11 and 12 math and science courses; 3) math and science courses taken by first-year  engineering majors that are based on solving a series of engineering problems; 4) math and science courses taken by undergraduates in NU's School of Education that emphasize the connections between these courses  and issues from engineering  and technology; and 5) comprehensive, conceptual tests to assess student understanding of the principles of math and science and their abilities to apply these principles. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
