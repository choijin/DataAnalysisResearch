    <AbstractNarration>PI: Vladimir Temlyakov, University of South Carolina&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0200187&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nonlinear approximation seeks ways to approximate complicated functions by simple functions using methods that depend nonlinearly on the function being approximated. Recently, a particular kind of nonlinear approximation, namely, greedy approximation attracted a lot of attention in both theoretical and applied settings. Greedy type algorithms proved to be very useful in various applications such as image compression, signal processing, design of neural networks, and the numerical solution of nonlinear partial differential equations. The theory of greedy approximation is emerging now: some fundamental convergence results have already been established; many fundamental problems remain unsolved. The purpose of the proposed research is to continue investigations of greedy approximation. We propose to continue to study greedy approximation with regard to bases, where substantial progress has been achieved recently. We propose to place emphasis on studying the efficiency of greedy algorithms with regard to redundant systems (dictionaries). Redundancy on the one hand offers much promise for greater efficiency in terms of approximation rate, but on the other hand gives rise to highly nontrivial theoretical and practical&lt;br/&gt;problems. We note that there is a solid justification of importance of redundant systems in both theoretical questions and practical applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Approximation theory is a branch of Mathematics that studies methods of replacing complicated objects by simpler objects. This idea has proved to be fruitful in many applications to the real world problems. Among these applications are signal processing, image compression, finance&lt;br/&gt;problems, and many others. As one of the model problems consider image compression.&lt;br/&gt;Take for example an image (picture) on a TV screen. Why should we approximate it? In many cases we cannot afford to transmit (or store in a computer memory) the whole information of an image, perhaps because of a high cost for transmission of a bit of information or&lt;br/&gt;limited channel capacity. This is exactly the point where an application of approximation theory can be fruitful. Clearly, when we replace an image by its approximant we lose the quality of picture: the more information we keep the better approximation to the original image we have. As a result we have an interplay between the reduction of information and the quality of approximation. In approximation theory we try to find the best (optimal) solution to this problem. The purpose of the proposed research is to continue the investigations of methods of approximation which are motivated by these types of applications. We note that nonlinear &lt;br/&gt;approximation is at the current frontiers of approximation theory. Nonlinear approximation is the only hope at present for the increase in available approximation power still needed to handle problems of real practical interest.</AbstractNarration>
