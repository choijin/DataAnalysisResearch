<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project pairs new teachers with Fellows and Fellows with discipline mentors.  Throughout a summer and academic year they work together at UCLA in courses to address pedagogical issues and at our partner schools in the classrooms to implement the mathematics and science activities developed.  As part of the intellectual merits of this project, the GK-12 Fellows gain first-hand experience in designing and testing curricular materials; GK-12 teachers refine their content knowledge as they collaborate with Fellows; and the high school and middle school students gain an enriched understanding of mathematics and science as well as an opportunity to interact with role models for careers in science and mathematics.  There are broad impacts for the Fellows, teachers and students involved.  The fellows, most of whom intend to pursue careers in higher education, are gaining useful teaching skills and pedagogical knowledge as well as developing abilities that will help them engage professionally in addressing the social issues that confront all urban schools.  During the three years of the project benefits will accrue to over 120-150 first-year mathematics and science teachers who teach a total of over 50,000 students in the most poorly performing schools in Los Angeles.  Over 200 standards-aligned, inquiry-based mathematics and science activities that meet the needs of these students are being adapted or developed and then field-tested during the three years of this project.  This resource of edited materials with annotated teaching notes is being published during the course of the project and distributed electronically through the UCLA in LA web site (http://www.la.ucla.edu) a portal created by the University for the entire Los Angeles community.  Part of the support for this project comes from the Directorate for Mathematics and Physical Sciences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project title:  Science and Mathematics Inquiry in Los Angeles Urban Schools&lt;br/&gt;Institution:  University of California Los Angeles  &lt;br/&gt;PI/Co-PI:  Arlene Russell, Frederick Freking, Theodore Gamelin&lt;br/&gt;Partner School Districts:  Belmont-Lincoln-Wilson Community (LA Dst F), Centinela Valley High&lt;br/&gt;Funding: $$1,418,032 total for 3 years &lt;br/&gt;Number of fellows/year: 10 graduate, 4 undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;Setting:  Urban&lt;br/&gt;Target audience: Middle-high school&lt;br/&gt;NSF supported disciplines involved: Science and Math&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
