    <AbstractNarration>PI: Braslau Institution: U of California, Santa Cruz&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award supports a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at the University of California, Santa Cruz for the summers of 2003-2005. Rebecca Braslau is the program director. Nine students will carry out research with faculty and research groups in the chemistry department over a ten-week period. Undergraduate students with limited opportunities for research at their home institutions will be targeted, while striving to achieve a broad representation of minorities, women and students with disabilities. The research projects span many multiple disciplines ranging from organic, bioorganic, bioinorganic, physical and biophysical chemistry. Many of the projects are interdisciplinary in nature. The students will also participate in a weekly series of research seminars presented by graduate students in the department. They will give a mid-summer progress report. At the end of the summer program each participant will prepare a journal style research report of their project and present a final seminar in a research colloquium.</AbstractNarration>
