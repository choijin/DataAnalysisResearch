<AbstractNarration>Morse is working on a project involving a filtration for &lt;br/&gt;the space of symmetric functions that depends on a positive &lt;br/&gt;integer k.  In earlier work, Lapointe, Lascoux, and Morse &lt;br/&gt;introduced new families of polynomials that lie in these subspaces,&lt;br/&gt;and they made a number of assertions relying on their characterization &lt;br/&gt;of these elements.  Among these conjectures is one stating &lt;br/&gt;that their elements form a basis for the k-subspaces of the symmetric &lt;br/&gt;function space and that the Macdonald polynomials expand positively on &lt;br/&gt;this new basis.  More generally, their claims lead to a family of &lt;br/&gt;positivity conjectures which will provide a natural refinement for &lt;br/&gt;many fundamental concepts in symmetric function theory.  For example, &lt;br/&gt;their elements appear to play a role in the k-subspaces analogous to &lt;br/&gt;the important role that the Schur functions play for the symmetric &lt;br/&gt;function space.  Morse is working on proving these conjectures and is also &lt;br/&gt;investigating the possible representation theoretic interpretation &lt;br/&gt;for these polynomials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theory of symmetric functions is a classical part of &lt;br/&gt;mathematics with a wide variety of applications in fields&lt;br/&gt;including physics, engineering, and computer science.&lt;br/&gt;Recent development in the study of symmetric functions&lt;br/&gt;was made with the introduction in 1988 of a new family of&lt;br/&gt;symmetric functions called the Macdonald polynomials.&lt;br/&gt;Remarkably, these polynomials have also been found to play an&lt;br/&gt;important role in areas such as geometry, representation &lt;br/&gt;theory, and many-body physics.  The successful completion of &lt;br/&gt;this project would prove important properties of the Macdonald &lt;br/&gt;polynomials and more generally, would provide a natural refinement &lt;br/&gt;for the fundamental concepts in symmetric function theory.</AbstractNarration>
