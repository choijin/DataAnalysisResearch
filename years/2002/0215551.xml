<AbstractNarration>A central goal of the National Consortium on Violence Research's (NCOVR) capacity-building activities is to increase the number of new researchers trained in cross-disciplinary violence research. The objective is that by training young scholars, NCOVR can impact the field of violence research.  NCOVR has three strategies for attaining this goal. The first is to increase the number of NCOVR fellowships that are awarded.  The second is to establish affiliations with selected minority-serving institutions to increase the pool of underrepresented students introduced to violence research.  The third is to conduct special outreach to minority undergraduates to encourage their choice of violence research as a career.  NCOVR will increase the number and discipline diversity of researchers participating in the NCOVR experience. They recruit senior researchers from new disciplines and establish affiliations with other extant research teams. They sponsor a number of intellectually compelling substantive and methodological workshops each year designed to appeal to senior researchers by promoting intellectual scientific exchange and research that cuts across disciplines. Some workshops bring together diverse perspectives on important research questions or address a difficult methodological question. Others develop proposals for outside funding, using small grants for pilot projects needed to strengthen the proposals. Some synthesize research findings in areas where there are already extensive significant findings. The objective of these workshops is to foster both new and expanded collaborations. These collaborations may lead to the preparation of larger proposals for outside funding that can provide opportunities for young researchers to participate in multidisciplinary research.</AbstractNarration>
