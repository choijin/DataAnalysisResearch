<AbstractNarration>Chi-Bin Chien&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lay Abstract&lt;br/&gt;-------------------------&lt;br/&gt;To form the correct circuitry in the developing nervous system, &lt;br/&gt;billions of nerve cells must send their axons (individual nerve &lt;br/&gt;fibers) over long distances to find their specific target cells. How &lt;br/&gt;these axons find their targest is one of the fundamental questions of &lt;br/&gt;developmental neuroscience. When many axons take similar pathways and &lt;br/&gt;form a nerve bundle or axon tract, individual axons are often highly &lt;br/&gt;organized within the larger tract. How such sorting within axon &lt;br/&gt;tracts is achieved is a basic question of axon guidance that has been &lt;br/&gt;studied very little.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the visual system, retinal axons exit the eye and form the optic &lt;br/&gt;nerve, where they are organized in a very precise array according to &lt;br/&gt;their point of origin. Shortly after passing through the optic &lt;br/&gt;chiasm, these retinal axons reorganize in a characteristic way, so &lt;br/&gt;that they are sorted out according to a different order as they grow &lt;br/&gt;through the optic tract on their way to visual centers in the brain. &lt;br/&gt;This sorting of retinal axons in the optic tract allow the proper &lt;br/&gt;formation of normal visual connections, and is therefore critical for &lt;br/&gt;normal vision.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will study the mechanisms of axon sorting in the visual &lt;br/&gt;system of the zebrafish, Danio rerio. The zebrafish visual system has &lt;br/&gt;many fundamental similarities (both genetic and anatomical) to humans &lt;br/&gt;and other vertebrates, and so the principles discovered here are &lt;br/&gt;likely to have wide applicability. In a particular zebrafish mutant &lt;br/&gt;strain, called boxer, a subset of the retinal axons fail to &lt;br/&gt;reorganize normally within the optic tract. Thus, normal function of &lt;br/&gt;the boxer gene is critical for normal development of the visual &lt;br/&gt;system. The proposed experiments will analyze whether boxer function &lt;br/&gt;is required in the eye or in the brain, and will clone boxer to &lt;br/&gt;determine which mutated gene is responsible for the visual system &lt;br/&gt;defect. These experiments will shed light on a critical aspect of how &lt;br/&gt;the brain is properly wired during development.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
