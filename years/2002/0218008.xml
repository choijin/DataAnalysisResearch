<AbstractNarration> &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of the proposed research effort is to develop methodology which&lt;br/&gt;allows simulation of effects playing an important role in nano-scale&lt;br/&gt;devices, within the framework of existing device simulators. The important&lt;br/&gt;underlying mechanisms are, on one hand, quantum effects such as tunneling&lt;br/&gt;and quantization, and, on the other hand, many-body effects, electron-ion&lt;br/&gt;interactions and single-dopant effects. The goal of the project is to&lt;br/&gt;include these effects into existing models and codes in such a way, that&lt;br/&gt;their influence on device performance is accurately represented, while&lt;br/&gt;simulations can be made at a computational cost comparable to that of&lt;br/&gt;existing particle-based device simulators. The basic approach to achieve&lt;br/&gt;this goal consists of the use of novel forms of effective quantum potentials&lt;br/&gt;and quantum versions of existing particle-based approaches to simulate&lt;br/&gt;short-range many-body interactions. Comparison will be made with&lt;br/&gt;experimental data provided by the Nanostructures Research Group at ASU, and&lt;br/&gt;Intel and Motorola.  The calibrated tools can help device designers in&lt;br/&gt;fabricating optimal device structures with a reduced cost. The educational&lt;br/&gt;effort of this project will be closely tied to the proposed research&lt;br/&gt;activities. This will be accomplished via specially developed&lt;br/&gt;interdisciplinary courses in a classical as well as a distance learning&lt;br/&gt;format, and through the direct participation of students in the research&lt;br/&gt;project on the graduate as well as the undergraduate level.  Course&lt;br/&gt;materials will be developed for this purpose and will be placed on the&lt;br/&gt;Computational Electronics Hub that is being developed as part of an existing&lt;br/&gt;NSF sponsored project.</AbstractNarration>
