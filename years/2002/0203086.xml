    <AbstractNarration>Statistical methods will be developed to sharply improve time-resolution for the recently proposed technique of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The objective of the project is to improve the time-resolution of fMRI by sampling only a small fraction of the Fourier transform of the spin density, and using a prolate wavelet filter to approximately obtain an integral representing the total activity of the difference in susceptibility between task and pre-task, over various regions of interest in the brain at successive time -points. The cost for this is a decrease in spatial resolution. This space/time trade-off allows us to obtain, at high-time resolution, the total activity in specified regions of the brain, believed to process the specific stimulus/task, to learn or verify where the brain function takes place. Furthermore, the proposed methodologies is believed to be applicable to other types of MRI studies, especially magnetic resonance spectroscopy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal focuses on developing statistical methods and related theory for fast functional magnetic resonance (fMRI), to sharply improve the time resolution of present techniques via 3-dimensional sampling. The principal investigators and their collaborators have conducted a fMRI imaging experiment to answer the feasibility question. The results based on this small experiment are quite encouraging. Further experiments will conducted to confirm the preliminary results and improve upon technology. Fast fMRI is expected to have profound and far-reaching consequences in the understanding of brain function, a problem of central scientific interest at the present time</AbstractNarration>
