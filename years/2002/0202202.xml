    <AbstractNarration>This project is developing and disseminating low-cost laboratory apparatus and innovative, competency-based, activity-based, interdisciplinary curriculum materials that integrate mathematics, science, and technology. The project objectives are to:&lt;br/&gt;1. Develop four curriculum modules incorporating 24 Authentic Learning Tasks to be distributed to high school and community college faculty using inquiry-based activities that apply rigorous mathematics and science to realistic technological tasks.&lt;br/&gt;2. Offer four in-depth summer institutes based on the curriculum modules to 72 Ohio high school and community college faculty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is implemented in two major phases: Curriculum Development and Summer Institutes.&lt;br/&gt;Phase 1: Four curriculum modules incorporating laboratory apparatus and innovative, competency-based, activity-based learning through 24 Authentic Learning Tasks (a series of discrete learning events that build experience and competencies related to the module's goals) are being created in the following curriculum modules: Algebra, General Mathematics and Trigonometry, Science/Physics, Technology and Electronics. Leading developers of hardware and software are participating in this phase. &lt;br/&gt;Phase 2: A series of four institutes are being offered for 72 mathematics, science, and technology high school and two-year college faculty in Ohio.</AbstractNarration>
