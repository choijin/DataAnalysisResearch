<AbstractNarration>The objective of the research is to help ensure an efficient, effective &lt;br/&gt;and equitable distribution of resources in responding to events that &lt;br/&gt;cause disruption in infrastructure systems and to aid in designing &lt;br/&gt;infrastructure systems that are robust under disruptions, due to &lt;br/&gt;natural, human-caused or willful acts. The approach is to develop a &lt;br/&gt;clear and unambiguous set of definitions of critical infrastructure &lt;br/&gt;interdependencies; a mathematical representation of infrastructure &lt;br/&gt;systems that incorporates interdependencies among and between systems; &lt;br/&gt;algorithms that can be used to run the model(s) for vulnerability &lt;br/&gt;assessment and emergency response; and a human-computer interface for &lt;br/&gt;user interaction with the model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the benefits will be an improved ability to both mitigate &lt;br/&gt;the impact of and respond to events that have the capability to cause &lt;br/&gt;large-scale, potentially catastrophic damage to critical infrastructure &lt;br/&gt;systems. Critical infrastructure systems provide services that are &lt;br/&gt;essential to both the economy and well-being of nations and their &lt;br/&gt;citizens. As documented in a recent report to the U.S. Congress, it is &lt;br/&gt;of vital importance that these services not be degraded, whether by &lt;br/&gt;willful acts such as terrorism or by natural or random events such as &lt;br/&gt;earthquakes. The research will permit different act and event scenarios &lt;br/&gt;to be modeled, and their impact on the service provided by an &lt;br/&gt;infrastructure system assessed. The result would be infrastructure &lt;br/&gt;systems that are designed to be more resilient to disruptions, with the &lt;br/&gt;expected loss of service reduced and the required level of service &lt;br/&gt;restored more quickly.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
