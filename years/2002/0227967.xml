<AbstractNarration>0227967&lt;br/&gt;Cavin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Historically, mixed-signal technologies have had a back seat to high-performance digital technologies. The ITRS has in the past focused on high-speed digital, which drove technology scaling with little thought to the research needs for mixed-signal. Mixed-signal SoCs are being developed now at a rapid pace but with most being developed on technologies optimized for only high performance digital. As an example, a wireless&lt;br/&gt;LAN or cell phone depends on an efficient radio receiver optimized for performance and cost to manufacture. With a mainstream bulk CMOS process, these radio receivers cannot be optimized as direct conversion receivers due to the noise and linearity issues with bulk CMOS. As a result, the radio section must be made much more complex by adding external filtering and many more components in the form of an IF section. A few companies have learned to make direct conversion receivers in SiGe process, however cost is higher. So one key question is, how can we influence research driven by the ITRS that will not only provide technologies that are optimum for high performance digital, but also for mixed signal? This workshop will bring together a great many experts from both industry and academia to discuss and formulate research needs for mixed-signal especially as relates to technologies (wafer fab processes, packaging, test, CAD, etc.). These needs will serve to guide the research funding efforts for both industry&lt;br/&gt;(SRC) and NSF.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
