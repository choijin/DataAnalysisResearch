    <AbstractNarration>The main objective of the Gordon Research Photonuclear Conference is&lt;br/&gt;to provide the international community of nuclear scientists with a&lt;br/&gt;unique forum in which the newest developments at the forefront of&lt;br/&gt;this science can be presented and subjected to detailed and extended&lt;br/&gt;discussions and criticism. The purpose of the conference is to&lt;br/&gt;encourage communication and the discussions to be conducted in an&lt;br/&gt;atmosphere conducive to open interactions between the scientists,&lt;br/&gt;provoking new and even speculative ideas for future research. To&lt;br/&gt;accomplish these goals requires the participation in all of the&lt;br/&gt;conference activities of a significant number of leaders in the&lt;br/&gt;field. The participation of younger scientists is essential to&lt;br/&gt;address the future manpower needs of this rapidly changing field.&lt;br/&gt;Therefore, bright and promising postdoctoral researchers and&lt;br/&gt;graduate students have been specially selected for participation in&lt;br/&gt;this conference and encouraged to present their ideas. Their&lt;br/&gt;participation in this conference provides them with unique and&lt;br/&gt;extensive access to the leaders in their field, exposes them to new&lt;br/&gt;research opportunities and techniques and helps prepare them for the&lt;br/&gt;leadership roles they will assume in the future. This award will&lt;br/&gt;facilitate participation from these junior scientists.</AbstractNarration>
