<AbstractNarration>0205699&lt;br/&gt;Wets&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research proposal is centered around approximation issues in &lt;br/&gt;stochastic programming, in particular as they arise in two quite &lt;br/&gt;challenging problems: equilibria problems in a stochastic environment and &lt;br/&gt;recourse problems involving partial differential equations.  The &lt;br/&gt;"stochastic" equilibrium problem adds a new level of difficulty; rather &lt;br/&gt;than just optimizing one must find a mechanism to determine a price &lt;br/&gt;system under which the optimization takes place. Such equilibria have &lt;br/&gt;been derived by relying on fixed point theorems.  Thirdly, because it is &lt;br/&gt;only possible to solve discretized versions of stochastic optimization &lt;br/&gt;problems, it is of paramount importance to investigate thoroughly &lt;br/&gt;approximation issues. Not only the question of approximating the &lt;br/&gt;stochastic process that describes the uncertainty but also how to improve &lt;br/&gt;the construction of this process from the available data and to analyze the &lt;br/&gt;effect this will have on the solution of the stochastic program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The field of stochastic programming provides mathematical tools for &lt;br/&gt;solving and analyzing models for decision making under uncertainty. This &lt;br/&gt;project will be concerned with two significant and difficult applications &lt;br/&gt;and with approximation issues:  &lt;br/&gt;-- A problem in groundwater remediation which was selected because it &lt;br/&gt;requires both theoretical and computational developments. It is a &lt;br/&gt;stochastic optimization problem where the state of the system is obtained &lt;br/&gt;by solving a partial differential equation whose coefficients are rapidly &lt;br/&gt;oscillating (heterogeneous media) and stochastic (uncertainty about the &lt;br/&gt;media composition). The possibility of deriving a homogenized version of &lt;br/&gt;this problem will also be investigated.  &lt;br/&gt;-- Walras equilibrium problem in an uncertain environment. This problem &lt;br/&gt;is selected because it adds a dimension to stochastic optimization in that &lt;br/&gt;one must also find price systems (setting up an "equilibrium") under &lt;br/&gt;which this stochastic optimization must take place.   &lt;br/&gt;-- Approximation issues in stochastic programming. The question of &lt;br/&gt;having a reliable estimate for the parameters of a dynamic stochastic &lt;br/&gt;programming problem is raised. It is expected that a more comprehensive, &lt;br/&gt;approach which makes use of all the information available, rather than just &lt;br/&gt;the collected data will result in more reliable solutions for stochastic &lt;br/&gt;programming problems.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
