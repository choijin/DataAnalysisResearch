<AbstractNarration>     This research will examine sampling and zone estimation within an integrative framework for the form verification of cone, sphere and torus features.  The objective is to develop a comprehensive and integrative approach to the inspection of these complex forms using coordinate metrology.  Individual research problems within this integrative context include sample point location determination for complex forms using alternative strategies, probe path length optimization, and minimum zone estimation using alternate formulations and solution methodologies. The impact of sample size and strategy and the optimization method used will be assessed on the computed tolerance zone.  Experiments will be conducted on actual Coordinate Measuring Machines and the role of multiple factors and their interactions determined.  The applicability of appropriate models and methods for specific part inspection problems will be suggested through a decision support software system that will be developed using the research results.  A 'guidelines' repository will be attempted for effective dissemination of research findings.  Research will be deployed to education, through multiple channels, throughout the project.  &lt;br/&gt;     Sufficient number of industrial parts such as nozzles, frustrum cylinders, dies, tapered holes, and balls, tapered rollers and roller races in bearings possess complex features that must be efficiently inspected for form.  Considering these applications of complex features, and their impact on interchangeability, it is logical that these features be studied more exclusively and extensively.  If successful, this project will lead to better standards and solutions for complex feature verification.  Further, the mathematical developments for these advanced forms will be useful to other inspection methodologies.  In addition, the integrative analysis will be useful to the development of formal guidelines for part-based inspection.</AbstractNarration>
