<AbstractNarration>DMS-0204634&lt;br/&gt;Richard Hind&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One can associate to a smooth manifold a symplectic structure&lt;br/&gt;on its cotangent bundle, and to a real-analytic Riemannian manifold&lt;br/&gt;a canonical complex structure on a domain inside its cotangent bundle.&lt;br/&gt;This project will continue work of the investigator studying these&lt;br/&gt;symplectic and complex structures. A broad aim is to discover how&lt;br/&gt;closely the symplectic geometry relates to the smooth structure on&lt;br/&gt;the original manifold, and how the complex geometry reflects the&lt;br/&gt;Riemannian properties. Also, since much symplectic infomation is&lt;br/&gt;contained in properties of compatible complex structures, it is also&lt;br/&gt;interesting to relate the symplectic and complex geometry. Cotangent&lt;br/&gt;bundles are the simplest examples of symplectic manifolds, yet many&lt;br/&gt;fundamental problems in symplectic geometry are still elusive in&lt;br/&gt;these cases. The investigator will conduct research into the&lt;br/&gt;uniqueness of symplectic structures and of isotopy classes of&lt;br/&gt;Lagrangian submanifolds. The complex manifolds we study arise&lt;br/&gt;naturally in many branches of mathematics, notably algebraic geometry&lt;br/&gt;and representation theory. Important aspects of their geometry&lt;br/&gt;remain to be understood, together with analytical problems which&lt;br/&gt;should have applications to number theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Symplectic geometry originated as the modern mathematical&lt;br/&gt;language of classical and quantum mechanics. It is now an exciting&lt;br/&gt;area of pure mathematical research, but continues to benefit from&lt;br/&gt;current physical ideas. Since the eighties it has been clear that&lt;br/&gt;much insight into symplectic geometry can also be gained from&lt;br/&gt;studying compatible complex structures. Fortunately the study of&lt;br/&gt;complex geometry has long been a main focus of mathematics. This&lt;br/&gt;project will conduct research into both symplectic and complex&lt;br/&gt;geometry, focussing on interactions between the two. The specific&lt;br/&gt;objects of study arise as the first examples of symplectic&lt;br/&gt;manifolds, and as examples of complex manifolds occuring frequently&lt;br/&gt;in many branches of mathematics and theoretical physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
