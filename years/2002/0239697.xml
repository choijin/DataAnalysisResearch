<AbstractNarration>The proposed research activities will focus upon the preparation and analysis of ternary copolymers designed to self-assemble into two classes of novel structures.  In one class of materials, phase-segregation of ABC triblock copolymers in the bulk will be used to arrange different sets of metal compounds for preparation of interworked arrays of gold and cobalt nanoparticles within a polymer matrix.  In the second class of materials, solution-phase assembly of ternary block and graft copolymers containing thermomorphic components will lead to formation of micellar structures with temperature-dependent shapes and sizes.  Established techniques for the cross-linking of micelles will be used to prepare robust collapsible nanometer scale materials and devices from these materials.  Living free radical polymerization techniques will play a major role in preparation of these ternary copolymers.  The intellectual merit of the proposed activities lies in their extension of current synthetic techniques for the preparation of new triblock and ternary copolymers, their likely expansion of current understanding of block copolymer self-assembly phenomena, and their enablement of the connection of theory concerning these topics to potential applications.  Study of these assemblies will complement and build upon the current state of research in not only polymeric materials, but also in more broadly defined nanomaterials research fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In terms of broader impact, the proposed research activities will contribute greatly to current understanding of nanoscale devices and lead to the development of nanometer scale materials with potential for elaboration into larger functional materials.  These activities will also involve the training of graduate and undergraduate students in materials and polymer research.  As inclusion of polymer chemistry in a general education in chemistry is becoming increasingly desirable and the current chemistry curriculum at Dartmouth College offers only a single one-term course in polymer chemistry, the PI will also develop an elective course in the synthetic aspects of polymer chemistry for graduates and upper-level undergraduates.  This new course will complement the more physical bent of the existing polymer chemistry course.  As part of a greater effort toward polymer education in the community, an exhibit on important and interesting aspects of modern polymer science at a local science museum is being developed.  The proposed educational activities will bring an awareness of polymer science to several groups of people:  the students directly involved in research, the students participating in the new polymer chemistry curriculum, and to community members who visit the proposed museum exhibit.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
