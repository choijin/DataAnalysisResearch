    <AbstractNarration>The International Conference on Questionnaire Development, Evaluation, and Testing Methods (QDET) will be held in Charleston, South Carolina from November 14-17, 2002. The conference is the ninth international conference in a series devoted to survey methodology. The QDET conference will foster scientific research and critical commentary on questionnaire evaluation methods that can lead to improved methods, better understanding of the error properties of survey questions, and improvements in survey measurements. The conference will also serve to document and communicate recent advances in the field and increase their use by survey practitioners, in the U.S. and abroad. There will be 22 invited papers and approximately 65 contributed papers with presenters coming from Italy, Finland, New Zealand, Sweden, Israel, France, Germany, Canada, Slovenia, the Netherlands, and the United States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An edited volume of 22 invited papers is expected to be published by John Wiley &amp; Sons. It will be advantageous to the survey research field to have a single volume that includes contributions from those researchers who have been instrumental in developing, applying and/or evaluating the new questionnaire development and evaluation techniques. This volume will be valuable in university settings to train future survey methodologists and survey practitioners and in organizational settings to provide a reference volume that describes and provides guidance on current best practices in questionnaire development, evaluation, and testing.</AbstractNarration>
