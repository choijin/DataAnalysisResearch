<AbstractNarration>0241979 Heyliger&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award funds a three-year Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site at the Colorado State University (CSU) that will provide students with a research experience in the area of vibration and sound. Activities will involve fundamental research in three focus areas - modeling, measurements, and visualization. The REU site is designed as a year-round program with 5-7 students participating during the academic year and 8-10 students participating during the summer. During the school year, many of the students will be students from the home institution, Colorado State University, with a focus on using recruitment resources within CSU such as the Women and Minorities in Engineering Program and the Colorado Alliance for Minority Participation. For the summer research experience, students will be recruited from across the U.S. with special attention given to recruit students attending schools where summer research opportunities do not exist. Regionally, special efforts will be made to attract students from Fort Lewis College, the University of Southern Colorado in Pueblo, and several community colleges. Students will interact with researchers and scientists at the Dynamic Measurements Laboratory at NIST-Boulder; the Acoustic Testing Laboratory at Johns -Manville in Littleton, Colorado; and Engineering Data Management of Fort Collins, Colorado. This REU Site is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU Program.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
