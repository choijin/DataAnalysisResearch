<AbstractNarration>Despite many advances in the visualization community over the past decade,&lt;br/&gt;effective and efficient representations for three-dimensional flow fields are still elusive.&lt;br/&gt;Many techniques show promise, but do not represent a complete picture of&lt;br/&gt;the flow.&lt;br/&gt;This project  consists of a systematic investigation of the current&lt;br/&gt;techniques, their advantages and disadvantages, research and analysis of combined techniques which complement each other, and research into new techniques.&lt;br/&gt;Cognitive analysis and user studies will be undertaken to investigate existing research. Many of these techniques, including those of the PIs, proposed a method of representing or rendering a flow&lt;br/&gt;field, with little selfexamination of the limitations towards garnering a true understanding of the flow&lt;br/&gt;field.&lt;br/&gt;Several of these techniques have obvious limitations, but present an improvement over&lt;br/&gt;the dearth of any good techniques for three-dimensional flow visualization. By&lt;br/&gt;combining several techniques appropriately, more improvements can be&lt;br/&gt;made. &lt;br/&gt;Are these improvements sufficient? What combinations work and which ones do not?&lt;br/&gt;These questions will be investigated and quantified in this research.&lt;br/&gt;Finally, we will ask: How can new techniques be developed that will overcome some of these&lt;br/&gt;limitations?Our subjective understanding of the field allows us to propose several&lt;br/&gt;avenues of investigation. These include an-isotropic volume renderings, embedded&lt;br/&gt;with flow differentiators; schematic texture algorithms for opaque and semi-transparent stream&lt;br/&gt;surfaces; level-of-detail models for representing the flow; multi-resolution representation&lt;br/&gt;of underlying features; and new representations that provide a more meaningful context&lt;br/&gt;for the flow.&lt;br/&gt;This research will greatly aid computational scientists across many disciplines: computational fluid dynamics scientists, environment scientists, atmospheric scientists, computational geological scientists and biomedical researchers.&lt;br/&gt;A primary component of their research is the investigation or simulation of natural phenomena.&lt;br/&gt;This phenomena is generally dynamic, leading to complex and interesting flow fields. For&lt;br/&gt;three-dimensional computations, effective tools to understand, represent and convey these&lt;br/&gt;flows are lacking. This research will provide a firm foundation for research in this area, as well as lead to new algorithms offering a much clearer representation for flows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
