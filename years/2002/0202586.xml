<AbstractNarration>This award to the Neutron Scattering Society of America (NSSA) is from four NSF units, the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities, the Chemistry Division, the Division of Materials Research and the Division of Biological Infrastructure. The award  provides partial support for the first biannual American Conference on Neutron Scattering (ACNS) organized by the NSSA with an inaugural four-day conference planned for June 23-27, 2002, in Knoxville, Tennessee. Neutron research in the past 40 years has played a crucial role in advancing fundamental science, technology and medicine in the U.S.  However, for the US to remain globally competitive in neutron science and continue to reap its technological rewards, it is important that the community of scientists and engineers using neutrons in research continue to grow in number and increase its public presence. The ACNS will serve a dual role as a national user meeting and a scientific meeting, providing a much-needed focal point for the U.S. neutron user community and a mechanism for outreach to prospective users of  national neutron facilities. The scientific portion of the meeting agenda will include a plenary session followed by parallel oral sessions over several days in the topical areas of Neutron Sources &amp; Instrumentation, Soft Condensed Matter, Magnetism, Materials Science, Biology, Chemistry &amp; Chemical Physics, Industrial Applications, and Fundamental Physics. Time has also been designated for poster sessions, user discussions, and a tour of the SNS. NSF funds will be used to support travel expenses of young faculty, students and postdocs who attend the first ACNS.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award to the Neutron Scattering Society of America (NSSA) is from four NSF units, the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities, the Chemistry Division, the Division of Materials Research and the Division of Biological Infrastructure.
