    <AbstractNarration>This is an RUI award for research at a predominantly undergraduate institution. Numerical and analytical approaches will be used to study spin transport in paramagnetic quantum fluids and solids. The research consists of three projects: analysis of transverse relaxation in NMR experiments with highly polarized Fermi liquids; computer simulation of spin waves and spin diffusion in Heisenberg paramagnets; and, calculation of the damping rates of slosh modes in trapped Fermi gases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Undergraduate research is an integral part of the Computational Physics program at Wisconsin - La Crosse. Hence, students play an important role in this research, including the presentation of results at national conferences and undergraduate research forums.&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;This is an RUI award for research at a predominantly undergraduate institution.
