<AbstractNarration>This proposal sets out a fundamental study that is  focused on probing the link between  catalytic  hydrodechlorination  activity/selectivity  and  catalyst  structure.  Previous  work by the PI has established that nano-dispersed nickel on amorphous silica in the presence of hydrogen is highly efficient in the dechlorination of concentrated chlorinated gas streams; the chlorine  that  is  removed  is  solely  in  the  form  of  HCl  that  is  easy  to  trap.  The  existing  catalyst activity/selectivity database will be extended in a strategic fashion, focusing on the treatment of chlorinated phenols as model reactants; the latter represents a class of commercially significant and highly toxic industrial waste. Preliminary  results have revealed that chlorobenzene  and chlorophenol hydrodechlorination over Ni/SiO2 is structure sensitive in that larger Ni particles (in the  range  1-4  nm)  exhibit  higher  specific  dechlorination  rates  but  are  more  susceptible  to deactivation. The issue of catalyst decay will be addressed through a comprehensive program of catalyst characterization before and after reaction. This will involve bulk structural studies (x-ray diffraction), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM), analytical TEM including EDX and EELS, surface area/porosity measurements, chemisorption/TPD/TPO studies and  x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to probe changes in Ni electronic structure. Moreover, the nature of the reactant(s)/product(s) interaction with the catalyst surface will be probed using spectroscopic (FTIR-DRIFT) and chromatographic techniques. The presence of chlorinated aromatics in industrial effluent is now established as a major source of environmental pollution.   This work may form the basis for a more efficient pollution prevention method.  The PI has previously worked with both graduate and undergraduate students in an international context.  In this project he will also work with chemistry students and provide training in engineering research.</AbstractNarration>
