<AbstractNarration>Michael J Shaw of the Southern Illinois University (a primarily undergraduate institution) is supported the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program for investigation of the factors that influence metal-mediated reactions that produce heterocyclic aromatic compounds from alkynes. A variety of d6-metal complexes involving acetylenic ketones and esters (including a variety of spectroscopic labels) will be synthesized. These will be used to probe a number of aspects of the reactions of interest. The main part of the research will be spectro-electrochemical investigations and surface normalized incident Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. (SNIFTIRS). These powerful techniques will be used to detect and characterize reaction intermediates with life-times of a few seconds or less.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The type of process that is of principal interest in this program is widely used for practical purposes, but the detailed course of the reaction is not well understood. The powerful combination of experimental techniques that this study will bring to bear on the process will greatly facilitate understanding the intermediate steps in the reaction sequence, leading to improved effectiveness of the transformation. This project will also provide an exceptional vehicle for introducing undergraduate students to research, using a variety of sophisticated, but well-tested and experimentally tractable methodologies. Success in this project will have impact both on the technological use of organometallic transformations, but also on the educational development of a number of students, some training to be future science teachers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
