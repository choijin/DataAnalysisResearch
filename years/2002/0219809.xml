<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;0219809&lt;br/&gt;Thomas L. Martin&lt;br/&gt;Va Poly Inst. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wearable  computing  has  the  potential  to  allow  access  to  information  anytime  and  anyplace.  &lt;br/&gt;Three of the major goals of wearable computing are to allow the user to go about a normal daily &lt;br/&gt;routine  while  constantly  wearing  a  device,  to  be  invisible  to  those  around  the  user,  and  to  be aware  of  the  user.s  actions  and  location.  The  purpose  of  this  research  is  to  investigate  the wearable  computing  uses  of  electronic  textiles  (e-textiles),  a  novel  hardware/software  platform  that  has  the  potential  to  solve  many  of  the  problems  in  achieving  these  goals,  and  to  create  a  design environment for e-textile-based wearable computing. &lt;br/&gt;E-textiles  are  fabrics  that  have  electronics  and  interconnections  woven  into  them.    The &lt;br/&gt;electronics  consist  of  general-purpose  microprocessors,  digital  signal  processors,  sensors,  and &lt;br/&gt;actuators at regular intervals throughout the fabric.  E-textiles allow the creation of systems with a &lt;br/&gt;physical  flexibility  and  size  that  cannot  be  achieved  with  currently  available  electronic &lt;br/&gt;manufacturing techniques. Components and interconnections are a part of the fabric and thus are &lt;br/&gt;much less visible and, more importantly, not susceptible to becoming tangled together or snagged &lt;br/&gt;by the surroundings. Consequently, e-textiles can be worn in everyday situations where currently &lt;br/&gt;available  wearable  computers  would  hinder  the  user.  E-textiles  also  have  greater  flexibility  in &lt;br/&gt;adapting  to  changes  in  the  computational  and  sensing  requirements  of  an  application  for  the &lt;br/&gt;purpose  of  managing  power  consumption  and  context  awareness. The  number  and  location  of &lt;br/&gt;sensor and processing elements can be dynamically tailored to the current needs of the user and &lt;br/&gt;application, rather than being fixed at design time.</AbstractNarration>
