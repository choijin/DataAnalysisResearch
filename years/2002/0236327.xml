<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;Ebadian, PI&lt;br/&gt;DBI-0236327&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Hemispheric Center for Environmental Technology (HCET) at Florida International University (FIU) will establish a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site in Environmental and Biological Sciences, including soil and groundwater research, brownfields redevelopment, waste disposal, emission control, and deactivation and decommissioning.  The main objectives of the proposed REU site are (1) to identify and expose students to scientific research early in their academic careers, (2) to prepare participants to engage in environmental and biological science practice and development, and (3) to encourage and assist participants in the pursuit of careers in environmental and biological sciences. To accomplish these objectives, students will be recruited and matched with a specific HCET research project, and experienced HCET scientists leading that project will serve as mentors for the participating students. &lt;br/&gt;Nine students will participate in the program during the academic year. Students will be recruited from FIU and from public and private universities in Florida that lack extensive research programs. As a research and development center at a minority institution, HCET will target primarily students from underrepresented minority groups to participate in the program and will strive to provide a diverse environment for all participants. In addition to research, students will participate in full-day workshops consisting on (1) career paths in environmental and biological sciences and (2) scientific ethics.&lt;br/&gt;For more information, please contact is Dr. M. A. Ebadian, tel. (305) 348-3585 or at ebadian@hcet.fiu.edu. Information about the proposed REU site will be placed on HCET's web site at &lt;www.hcet.fiu.edu&gt; and will also be linked to FIU's web site at &lt;www.fiu.edu&gt;. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
