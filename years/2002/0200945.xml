<AbstractNarration>The investigator will continue his work on the interplay between&lt;br/&gt;probability and algorithms. He has identified two distinct but &lt;br/&gt;very important aspects of such study. In the first instance he will &lt;br/&gt;study randomized algorithms i.e. those algorithms that introduce randomness&lt;br/&gt;as a means of speeding up computation. In the second instance, he will &lt;br/&gt;consider the average case performance of algorithms. Here, he wants to try&lt;br/&gt;to explain the good performance of simple algorithms on &lt;br/&gt;"typical" problems as opposed to the worst-case performance &lt;br/&gt;exemplified by the pathological examples of complexity theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the area of randomized algorithms, the investigator will consider&lt;br/&gt;problems arising in the study of Monte Carlo Markov Chain algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;In particular he will study their use in problems associated with &lt;br/&gt;combinatorial counting problems and with problems in Statistical &lt;br/&gt;Physics. He will also continue his study of the Edge Disjoint Path &lt;br/&gt;problem and the construction of a generalisation of the well known&lt;br/&gt;matrix Singular Value Decomposition to multi-dimensional matrices. &lt;br/&gt;In the area of average case analysis, he will continue his work on the&lt;br/&gt;Traveling Salesman Problem and try to extend his ideas to the &lt;br/&gt;independent symmetric model. He will continue his work on analysing the &lt;br/&gt;efficacy of the Sequencing By Hybridization technique in Computational&lt;br/&gt;Biology. Finally, he will continue to work on probabilistic models of the&lt;br/&gt;World Wide Web in an attempt to find a useful model for &lt;br/&gt;the testing of algorithmic ideas.</AbstractNarration>
