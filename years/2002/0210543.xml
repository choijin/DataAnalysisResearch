<AbstractNarration>This proposal was received in response to Nanoscale Science and Engineering initiative, NSF 01-157, category NIRT. Nano-scale positioning and control technology will be essential both for nanotechnology research instrumentation and for tools dedicated to fabrication and testing of nano-devices, but few, if any, robust and reproducible solutions exist. To realize manufacture of macroscopically useful systems, it is necessary to have mechanisms with geometric precision and accuracy to facilitate the transition from nano-science to productive nanotechnology. This will be particularly important for multi-process manufacture and assembly of complexly shaped mechanisms.  The objective of this project is to produce a portable and accurate instrument for sample/probe motion that is capable of performing at nanometer levels over protracted time periods. The output of this work will be a compact and highly integrated instrument, capable of reproducibly positioning a macro-sized object such as a silicon wafer over the complete scan area of 50 mm x 50 mm and return to a specified position thereby enabling observations of processes containing nanometer-sized objects as well as the ability to 'pick and place' for multi-component assembly. The instrument would enable nanometer resolution tools to focus on a nano-device placed anywhere over the instruments operating range for applications such as imprint lithography, lithographic self assembly, nanowire circuitry and complex multi-process and multi-scale assemblies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This development will provide a facility for nanotechnology studies in all fields for which fundamental measurements at the limits of current technological capability are an issue, in particular, in the fields of bio-mechanics, nano-electronics and nano-mechanics. Training of future engineers in the emerging field of instrument and machine design for nanotechnology applications will take place both during the development of the instrumentation systems and through subsequent projects and graduate instruction based around the developed facility. It is also envisaged that knowledge of architectures for nanometer mechanism design will be incorporated into graduate precision machine design courses. A new graduate course titled 'Mechanical systems for nanotechnology' is currently being developed and will be offered in the 2002 fall semester. Additionally, a project web-site will be developed that will include links to logistical and technical discussion pages specific to this project as well as links to related sites. As part of our outreach to the k-12 community there will be a section providing an overview of this work aimed towards high school level readership.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
