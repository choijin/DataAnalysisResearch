<AbstractNarration>This award provides partial support of the Gordon Conference on the Science, which will be held at Tilton School (NH) during the period August 11-16, 2002.  This conference is held every two years in summer, which to the true spirit of Gordon Conference, creates a lively environment to bring up cutting edge ideas and iron out controversial issues pertaining to adhesion science.  The 2002 conference will composed of nine sessions, with two to three speakers in each session.  In tune with the tradition of this conference, promising junior scientists have been invited along with established scientists from academia, government labs and industries as oral presenters and discussion leaders.  The conference will consist of 21 oral presentations that will deal with the interfacial, rheological and mechanics aspects of adhesion by highlighting the relevance of fundamental adhesion science in solving technologically important problems in coatings, structures, electronic, biological and MEMs devices.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The organizers intend to invite more junior faculty members, graduate students and postdocs to participate in the conference by presenting their research results in the poster session that will run throughout the conference.  In order to facilitate quality discussion quality  discussions attendance to the conference will be restricted to 120 attendees, aiming to attain broad representation across the diverse participants in the field of adhesion science and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
