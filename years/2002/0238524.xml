<AbstractNarration>This five-year research program is designed to advance our understanding of how to effectively engage diverse groups of youth in learning core IT concepts in ways that motivate them to continue learning in their future education. Basic research and design-oriented research will be conducted in three inter-related phases.  The first phase will focus on expanding what we know about students' access, interest, and experiences with new technologies-with an emphasis on identifying barriers to equity and revealing learning resources. Survey and interview work will be carried out with a large and diverse group of students across socio-economic strata in California's Silicon Valley region to investigate their access to, and interest in, various kinds of learning opportunities. The research will document how creative learning opportunities are distributed across different communities and their effects on student interests.  It will also contribute to defining different profiles of student fluency and how these are associated with learning ecologies constituted by the interweaving contexts of self, family, peer group, school, and community.  The second phase of the work will focus on co-developing courses with teachers. A core guiding principle of these courses will be a primary focus on the student as designer and a learning goal will be to help students understand design as a human process in which everyone can be involved.  The course material will build fluency in the context of projects in which students design, program, and implement information systems that address issues of youth interest. This approach will allow students to be authentic contributors of knowledge and processes while simultaneously building understanding of the core concepts and capabilities outlined in the NRC Fluency report-such as programming, information design, and human-computer interaction. In the third phase, the teaching and learning processes in these courses will be studied systematically, with a particular focus on collaborative design work. A key goal of this research is to contribute to theories of collaborative learning. Productive collaborative design practices will be identified and the ways that such collaborations are often less than productive and can be made more productive will be articulated. Learning properties of collaborative technology design work beyond cognitive outcomes will be identified for empirical study, including motivational, relational, and meta-communicative outcomes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beyond the intensive co-development of courses with local teachers, the educational component of this project will include the creation of a library of video case studies that highlight exemplars of more and less productive small group collaborative interaction.  These will be used to help teachers (both pre-service and in-service) and novice researchers see ways of engaging students in learning that support fluency and increase interest and the ability to use and understand technology broadly. The use of video cases will support conversations about teaching and learning processes as they provide concrete references that can be revisited and reflected on from multiple perspectives.  The video cases will be used to improve existing courses and in dissemination activities directed at the broader community of information technology teachers and researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
