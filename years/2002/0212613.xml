    <AbstractNarration>The control of reproduction is fundamental to the structure and evolution of animal societies. This project will examine the causes and consequences of variation in the breeding structure of colonies of the termite Nasutitermes corniger, focusing on the number of reproductive males and females (kings and queens) and their apportionment of reproduction. The wide range of colony genetic structures present within natural populations provides opportunities to test hypotheses arising from the rapidly growing body of theory on reproductive partitioning in social groups. Nest dissections, behavioral assays, and analysis of a highly informative set of genetic markers will determine (1) how reproduction is partitioned among co-occurring queens and kings, (2) how colony genetic structure affects interactions within and between groups, and (3) how colony reproductive characteristics change through time. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite their ecological and economic importance, termites are understudied relative to other social insects. Nasutitermes corniger is particularly well suited to the proposed research due to its abundance and to the comparative ease with which the queens and kings can be collected from mature colonies. Besides adding to knowledge of fundamental aspects of termite biology, this research will contribute to the broader understanding of social behavior, reproductive competition, and the genetic structure of populations.</AbstractNarration>
