<AbstractNarration>Scalar Curvature, Geometric Flows, and the General Penrose Conjecture&lt;br/&gt;                    &lt;br/&gt;                          DMS - 0206483  Hubert Bray, MIT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;                                                         &lt;br/&gt;The primary goal of this research is to prove the full Penrose &lt;br/&gt;conjecture in general relativity about the mass of black holes in &lt;br/&gt;a spacetime.  In 3+1 dimensions, this conjecture states that the &lt;br/&gt;total mass of a spacetime with nonnegative energy density &lt;br/&gt;everywhere is greater than or equal to the square root of the &lt;br/&gt;total area of the event horizons of all of the black holes in the &lt;br/&gt;spacetime divided by 16 pi.  This conjecture can be thought of as &lt;br/&gt;stating that the mass contributed by a collection of black holes &lt;br/&gt;is at least the square root of their surface areas divided 16 pi, &lt;br/&gt;so that nonnegative energy density everywhere else in the &lt;br/&gt;universe forces the total mass of the spacetime to be at least &lt;br/&gt;this amount.  The Penrose conjecture is best thought of as a &lt;br/&gt;conjecture on arbitrary three dimensional space-like slices of &lt;br/&gt;the spacetime.  In the special case that the space-like slice is &lt;br/&gt;assumed to have zero second fundamental form, the conjecture is &lt;br/&gt;known as the Riemannian Penrose conjecture.  This conjecture was &lt;br/&gt;first proved for a single black hole by Huisken and Ilmanen in &lt;br/&gt;1997 and then for any number of black holes by the author in &lt;br/&gt;1999.  The author would also like to prove the Riemannian Penrose &lt;br/&gt;Conjecture in dimensions higher than three and is close to &lt;br/&gt;announcing this result for dimensions less than eight.  &lt;br/&gt;Dimensions eight and higher present additional geometric and &lt;br/&gt;analytical challenges arising from the fact that the apparent &lt;br/&gt;horizons of black holes manifest themselves as minimal &lt;br/&gt;hypersurfaces which can have co-dimension seven singularities.  &lt;br/&gt;The positive mass theorem is also still open in these dimensions &lt;br/&gt;for similar reasons, and is another very interesting related &lt;br/&gt;problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The motivation for the above problems is to gain a better &lt;br/&gt;understanding of General Relativity.  While Einstein's theory of&lt;br/&gt;General Relativity is experimentally the best known theory of &lt;br/&gt;gravity, their are many theoretical questions about the theory &lt;br/&gt;which are not well understood at all.  For example, given the&lt;br/&gt;universe at some initial time, do the Einstein equations have &lt;br/&gt;unique well-behaved solutions in the future as one would hope, or&lt;br/&gt;do singularities typically occur which might radiate or consume&lt;br/&gt;energy for example?  The theory also predicts the existence of&lt;br/&gt;black holes, and astronomers believe that they have been able to &lt;br/&gt;detect the location of many black holes including one which is &lt;br/&gt;3 million times the mass of the sun at the center of our galaxy.  &lt;br/&gt;Since doing experiments with black holes is currently not &lt;br/&gt;feasible, it makes since to understand this potentially very &lt;br/&gt;important phenomenon on a theoretical level for now.  This &lt;br/&gt;research project hopes to lead to a better understanding of black&lt;br/&gt;holes as well as energy and mass in General Relativity.    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
