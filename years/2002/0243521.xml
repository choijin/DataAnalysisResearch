<AbstractNarration>The National Science Teachers Association (NSTA) and the Environmental Literacy Council (ELC) are collaborating on a twenty-four month project to produce a professional development resource and a related website that draws on the best existing material to help teachers improve their own understanding of the connections between science and the environment.  This project also seeks to provide teachers with effective science-environment teaching strategies and materials on which they can draw for themselves and their students.  A collaboration among scientists, curriculum developers and teachers will result in the development of two related products.  The first product is Resources for Environmental Literacy:  Professional Development for Middle and High School Teachers.  It will contain a collection of conceptually organized resources, including six modules that demonstrate how core science ideas can be effectively taught in the context of environmental issues.  The second product will be an interactive website that will include the content of the print version and will supplement it with databases, research materials and additional modules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
