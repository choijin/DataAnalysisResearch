<AbstractNarration>This award from the Major Research Instrumentation program supports the University of Cincinnati with the acquisition of an e-beam lithography system: the Raith-150. Fifteen interdisciplinary group of faculty from departments of physics, electrical engineering, optoelectronics, and materials science representing the 6 major universities in Southern Ohio will make use of the instrument. The instrument, which will provide the foundation for nanofabrication of structures with sizes down to 10 nm, will support research in the areas of Nanoelectronics, Photonic and Electronic Nanostructures, Nano BioElectronics, and Novel Microscopies. Advances in each of these areas depend crucially on the ability to carry out the nanofabrication provided by the Raith-150 system. New fundamental understanding will result from the work on nanoelectronics (e.g.nanotransport experiments), photonic nanostructures (e.g. strongly coupled quantum dots systems), new and challenging advances is expected in technologically relevant areas including nano bio-electronics (e.g. biochips and optical integrated circuits), and new tools for researchers will be developed (e.g. novel microscopies). A key part of the activity is the education and training of undergraduates, graduate students, and post-doctoral fellows in modern methods of e-beam lithography.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award from the Major Research Instrumentation program supports the University of Cincinnati with the acquisition of an e-beam lithography system: the Raith-150.
