<AbstractNarration>The failure of large groups of students to perform to their potential.such as females in &lt;br/&gt;math, or African Americans across a variety of academic disciplines.is one of the great &lt;br/&gt;tragedies in our educational system. The significance of this problem has inspired numerous &lt;br/&gt;investigations of its scope, nature, and potential causes. A recent breakthrough points to the &lt;br/&gt;power that social context can have in creating, perpetuating, or eliminating the underperformance &lt;br/&gt;that has hindered these groups. Steele, Aronson, Spencer, and their colleagues have demonstrated &lt;br/&gt;the crucial role of stereotype threat, a situational phenomenon that occurs when individuals who &lt;br/&gt;are targets of stereotypes alleging intellectual inferiority are reminded of the possibility of &lt;br/&gt;confirming these stereotypes (e.g., Spencer, Steele, &amp; Quinn, 1999; Steele, 1997).  For example, &lt;br/&gt;Spencer et al. (1999) showed that high-achieving female college students performed significantly &lt;br/&gt;worse than males on a standardized math test when the stereotype about their math ability was &lt;br/&gt;made salient (.Males have performed better than females on this test in the past..). However, this &lt;br/&gt;gender gap was eliminated simply by changing the words used for introducing the test (.Males &lt;br/&gt;and females have performed equally well on this test in the past..).  A counterintuitive finding is &lt;br/&gt;that only individuals who are highly identified with success and achievement in given &lt;br/&gt;stereotyped domains are the ones who show deficits under threat, in contrast to stigmatized &lt;br/&gt;individuals who are not achievement oriented in these domains (Steele, 1997). Thus, it is the &lt;br/&gt;people in the vanguard of their group who are the most vulnerable to situations in which &lt;br/&gt;stereotypes about their ability become salient. The detrimental effects of stereotype threat extend &lt;br/&gt;to African Americans (e.g., Steele &amp; Aronson, 1995), Latinos (e.g., Aronson &amp; Salinas, 1997), &lt;br/&gt;and students of low socioeconomic status (e.g., Croizet &amp; Claire, 1998), who are concerned with &lt;br/&gt;academic success. &lt;br/&gt;We hypothesize that the priming of a stereotype results in heightened physiological &lt;br/&gt;arousal. According to the classic Yerkes-Dodson (1908) law of physiological arousal, &lt;br/&gt;performance is optimal at intermediate levels of arousal and decreases when arousal is either low &lt;br/&gt;or high, resulting in an inverted-U shaped function.  More recent neurophysiological research has &lt;br/&gt;corroborated and expanded on the classic findings of the Yerkes-Dodson law in animals and in &lt;br/&gt;humans.  For example, Lupien and McEwen (1997) provided evidence for an inverted-U shape &lt;br/&gt;relationship between the level of the corticosteroid, cortisol, and cognitive processes in a variety &lt;br/&gt;of animal and human studies. We hypothesize that high-achieving individuals in stigmatized &lt;br/&gt;domains approach a problem-solving task in the given domains with an optimal level of arousal &lt;br/&gt;for performing well. Stereotype threat may interfere with these individuals. performance by &lt;br/&gt;leading to arousal that exceeds an optimal level, causing performance deficits.  By trying to &lt;br/&gt;uncover the role of physiological arousal in mediating stereotype threat and the cognitive nature &lt;br/&gt;of the resultant deficits, we are hoping to contribute to understanding the theoretical &lt;br/&gt;underpinnings of stereotype threat as well as to help stigmatized high-achieving students to &lt;br/&gt;overcome its effects. In the psychometric literature, Gallagher (1992, 1998) has shown that &lt;br/&gt;females performed more poorly than males on math-SAT problems that required the use of &lt;br/&gt;meaningful mental short cuts and estimation (versus problems that required standard calculation).  &lt;br/&gt;There is reason to believe that cortisol reactivity may be implicated in defaulting to rote &lt;br/&gt;algorithmic versus meaningful problem solving (Forget, Lacroix, Somma, &amp; Cohen, 2000).  We &lt;br/&gt;will test interventions for combating stereotype threat by reducing arousal, improving the use of &lt;br/&gt;meaningful problem-solving strategies, and creating a practice of self-affirmation. In sum, the &lt;br/&gt;proposed research is designed to examine: (1) the role of physiological arousal as a mediator of &lt;br/&gt;stereotype threat; (2) whether reasoning becomes more algorithmic and less meaningful under &lt;br/&gt;stereotype threat; and (3) ways in which the detrimental effects of stereotype threat can be &lt;br/&gt;mitigated or eliminated.</AbstractNarration>
