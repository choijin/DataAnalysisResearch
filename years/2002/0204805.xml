<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wallerstein, George&lt;br/&gt;"Travel Funds for Stellar Abundances Conference"&lt;br/&gt; AST- 0204805&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference, to be held March 27-29 in Seattle, WA, is on chemical abundances in stars and on nuclear astrophysics. The invited speakers are leading experts in the field. They will discuss the observations relevant to the determining the content of elements such as Helium, Lithium, Iron, and others in stars of various ages throughout the universe. There also will be presentations on the current state of our theoretical knowledge and of modeling  the production of various elements in the deep interiors of stars and how they are mixed into the outer layers of a star, as well as the creation of the elements at the time of the Big Bang. The conference is international in scope with attendees from several European countries as well as the U.S. The proceeding are to be published by World Scientific under the auspices of the Institute for Nuclear Theory. The funds support the travel for two of the invited speakers, 10 young American presenters, and 5 young European presenters to this meeting who would not otherwise be able to attend.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
