<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;         The PI's are requesting funding from NSF to support the attendance of US students&lt;br/&gt;         and young scientists to the "8th International Conference in X-Ray Lasers", that will be held at&lt;br/&gt;         the Aspen Institute, in Aspen Colorado during the last week of May of 2002. This bi-&lt;br/&gt;         annual international conference is recognized as the most important in the field of X-Ray lasers,&lt;br/&gt;         and constitutes a forum to report the most recent advances in one of the frontiers of laser&lt;br/&gt;         research. The conference will cover advances in ultrashort wavelength laser development,&lt;br/&gt;         theory, and applications. Advances in the field of soft x-ray lasers have a synergistic effect in&lt;br/&gt;         several disciplines. After decades of research these sources have now reached the point at which&lt;br/&gt;         they are making important contributions to numerous disciplines, including plasma physics,&lt;br/&gt;         material surface characterization, nanoelectronic metrology, and biology. The continuation of&lt;br/&gt;         advance of this field is therefore of significant scientific and industrial interest.&lt;br/&gt;         &lt;br/&gt;         The conference has historically changed locations, to give at different times the&lt;br/&gt;         maximum opportunity for attendance to scientists and students from different countries. In May&lt;br/&gt;         2002 it will be 8 years since the conference was held in the United States, in Williamsburg&lt;br/&gt;         (Virginia), in May 1994. The 2002 Aspen conference follows very successful meetings in&lt;br/&gt;         Sweden (Lund, 1996), Japan (Kyoto, 1998) and France (Saint Malo, 2000). The Aspen meeting&lt;br/&gt;         will offer the United States scientific and broad technical community the opportunity to actively&lt;br/&gt;         participate in this international forum. National Science Foundation support will be important in&lt;br/&gt;         assisting the participation a maximum number of US students and young scientists, and to make&lt;br/&gt;         the presentations at the meeting accessible to the scientific community in general through the&lt;br/&gt;         rapid publication of the conference proceedings. More than 250 scientists from all over the world&lt;br/&gt;         are expected to attend.&lt;br/&gt;         &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
