    <AbstractNarration>The James Agee Film Project is conducting planning to facilitate the integration of insights from a wide range of scientific disciplines into a filmscript for a four-part television series on the environmental and social history of the Appalachian region. "Appalachia: A Story of Mountains and People" will be the first film to weave the findings of the natural and social sciences into a story that examines the impact of landscape on culture and of human culture upon landscape. The planning phase will include the following activities:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The film producers/writers will work with a science content director to develop an outline of the themes and general organization of the film.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project staff will meet with scientists in small groups to brainstorm ways to integrate ideas and content into the script.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The science content director and the producer/writers will draft a script using input from the small groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A large group meeting of the science advisors will review the script focusing on the overarching themes and to refine ideas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The script will be revised based on the recommendations from the meeting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project director will review the scripts with rural school districts and get reactions and suggestions to guide the development of outreach projects and materials to support use of the film in formal educational settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Review of the script and outreach plans will be conducted with two general audience focus groups, one in Appalachia and one outside the region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principals for the project bring a background of filmmaking and science. Ross Spears, the producer/director/writer, has produced a number of award-winning films. The co-producer/writer is Jamie Ross. She is a free-lance writer and consultant with expertise in ecology, history, literature and culture of Appalachia and the American South. George Constantz, the content director, is a biologist, naturalist, ecologist, educator, watershed administrator and science writer/editor. The 15-person advisory committee includes members whose expertise includes: archaeology, anthropology, economics, geology, geography, sociology, ecology and evolutionary biology. A professional science writer also is a member of the committee.</AbstractNarration>
