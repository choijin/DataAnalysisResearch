<AbstractNarration>0212305&lt;br/&gt;Carroll&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funds are requested for partial support of the 61th Annual Meeting of the Society for Developmental Biology, to be held July 21-25, 2002 at the University of Wisconsin in Madison.  The Society has held this meeting since its founding in 1939, missing only two years during World War II.  This is an indication of its commitment and success in holding meetings of the highest scientific quality, as well as a reflection of the community's interest on the field of developmental biology.  The scientific sessions encompass work on diverse organisms including plants, invertebrates and vertebrates.  Fifty-one speakers have already accepted the invitation to tell the attendees about some of their latest findings in the following areas: Development of Cell, Organ, and Organismal Size, Making Boundaries, Developmental Timing, Extracellular Matrix and Cell Signaling, Signaling into the Cytoskeleton, Making and Connecting the Brain, Development of Sensory Systems, Organogenesis, Evolution of Morphological Diversity, Control of Gene Expression, Germ Cells, Dealing with Complexity in Development, and Imaging Cells and Molecules.  An additional 24-32 speakers will be chosen from submitted abstracts for platform presentations, allowing the inclusion of the latest results and providing an opportunity for postdoctoral fellows and graduate students to talk about their works.  The Education Symposium will center on the very current topic of Teaching Evolution and it will include a discussion period with audience participation.  An attendance of about 700 people is expected, and most of them will present their new data in the two dedicated poster sessions each day, one after lunch and the other in the evening.  The organizers are certain that this format allows them to continue to emphasize the best science and to provide a forum to bring together junior and senior investigators, and to allow them to exchange ideas on science, education and the role of science in today's society.  Merit-based travel awards will be available to students and junior postdoctoral fellows, as well as Latin American faculty and students to attend the meeting.   &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
