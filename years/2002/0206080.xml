<AbstractNarration>"UPCLOSE" is an after-school program designed to engage and develop the interest of underserved, inner city, middle school girls in the areas of science, engineering and technology.  Working with an early adolescent population, the "UPCLOSE" program recognizes the developmental needs of this group and has structured its curriculum to provide a holistic approach to learning.  Although the focus of the workshop inquiry activities is to increase knowledge and understanding of science, engineering and technology, the program goals include enhancement of self-esteem and self-confidence, development of teambuilding skills, refinement of communication and interpersonal skills, and enhancement of critical thinking skills.  Each year 26 girls in grades 7 and 8 will be recruited to attend the fall and summer sessions of the three-year program.  Fall sessions will be conducted two hours twice each week and one Saturday per month; summer sessions will operate five weeks.  Participants will be required to make a commitment to attend the program for at least two years.  Girls with satisfactory performance during the fall and summer sessions will be invited to join the Junior Discovery Leaders to assist in the summer camp.  Six inquiry-based workshops that incorporate science, engineering and technology with training on workplace skills will be used.  Professionals from the partner institutions and older students in the pre-engineering high school will teach the workshops.  Partners institutions include the University of Toledo, Bowling Green State University, The Family Learning Center and the Toledo Technology Academy.</AbstractNarration>
