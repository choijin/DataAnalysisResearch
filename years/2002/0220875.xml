<AbstractNarration>Portland Community College's(PCC), along with its contracting community colleges in Tillamook Bay (TBCC) and Columbia Gorge (CGCC,) project is a scholarship program called 'Increasing Access and Diversity in Engineering and Microelectronics Careers'. This CSEMS project serves students in Electronic Engineering Technology, Computer Software Engineering Technology, Civil and Mechanical Engineering Technology, and Microelectronics Technology. The Increasing Access and Diversity program awards a total of 60 two-year scholarships over four years, with each scholarship worth $3,000 per year. The scholarships are targeted to students who demonstrate financial need and academic promise, with special efforts to recruit and retain students who are underrepresented in technology disciplines, including African Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans, and women. The Increasing Access and Diversity scholarship program places special emphasis on recruiting students who have recently finished high school. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this program is to increase opportunities and access to higher education and employment for underrepresented minorities and women in engineering and microelectronics technology by providing scholarships that will cover the cost of tuition, books, and supplies for full-time students. The objectives that will help the program achieve this overall goal are:&lt;br/&gt;1. Increase the number of underrepresented minority students in participating departments by 50%.&lt;br/&gt;2. Increase the number of female students in the targeted departments by 25%.&lt;br/&gt;3. Increase by 20% the number of students in targeted departments who enter PCC, TBCC, or CGCC within 12 months of graduating from high school.&lt;br/&gt;4. 80% of CSEM scholars will complete the two-year program in which they enroll.&lt;br/&gt;5. 95% of graduating CSEMS scholars will be employed or enrolled in a four-year program related to their discipline within 12 months of graduation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To achieve these objectives, the Increasing Access and Diversity scholarships are publicized through meetings at area high schools, community organizations, and one-stop career centers, where eligible people will be encouraged to apply. The participating departments are committed to recruiting students directly from high school. The scholarships give motivated high school graduates a chance to begin their college careers immediately, rather than interrupting their education due to lack of funds. Once on campus, CSEM scholars benefit from the existing array of support services designed to help students at PCC, TBCC, and CGCC achieve academic success. These include student success seminars, communication skills workshops, academic advising, internships, job placement workshops, and career counseling. Each CSEM scholar benefits from CSEMS-specific services and activities, such as monthly workshops and troubleshooting sessions, an ongoing relationship with an industry mentor, increased access to tutoring, exposure to area universities and high-tech firms, and job placement assistance. These activities build&lt;br/&gt;peer and mentoring relationships for scholars that enhance retention and degree completion.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
