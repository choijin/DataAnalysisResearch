    <AbstractNarration>Mathematics conferences for undergraduates have been around for many years, but there are too few for the number of students who could benefit from them. Faculty members at colleges and universities have expressed interest in hosting undergraduate mathematics conferences, but the daunting tasks of obtaining funding, and organizing and advertising such conferences keeps most people from acting on their interest. This grant provides start-up funding for individuals who need support for an undergraduate mathematics conference through a simple application form to the MAA. The grant covering these awards run through the academic year 2005-2006, after which time it is assumed that funding from alternative sources will be found to continue the conferences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The requests for funding will be reviewed at the annual winter and summer meetings of the MAA. It is anticipated that most awards will be between $1,000 and $4,000, but awards up to $8,000 might be considered in exceptional cases. These awards will cover the typical expenses involved with hosting any conference. These include travel and honorarium for invited speakers, lunch and refreshments for participants, and duplicating and postage for advertising. The awards might also cover expenses that are often part of an undergraduate conference such as travel reimbursement for participants. Indirect costs to institutions hosting the conferences will not be allowed.</AbstractNarration>
