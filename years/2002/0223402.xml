<AbstractNarration>A contact center is a collection of resources providing an interface &lt;br/&gt;between a service provider and its customers. The classical contact center &lt;br/&gt;is a call center, containing a collection of service representatives (reps) &lt;br/&gt;who talk to customers over the telephone. In a call center, the service reps &lt;br/&gt;are supported by quite elaborate information-and-communication-&lt;br/&gt;technology (ICT) equipment, such as a private branch exchange (PBX), an &lt;br/&gt;interactive voice response (IVR) unit, an automatic call distributor (ACD), &lt;br/&gt;a personal computer (PC) and assorted databases. With the rapid growth of &lt;br/&gt;e-commerce, contact between the service provider and its customers is &lt;br/&gt;often made via e-mail or the Internet instead of by telephone.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The design and management of contact centers is important, and worthy of &lt;br/&gt;research, because contact centers comprise a large, growing part of the &lt;br/&gt;economy and because they are quite complicated. Classic call centers are &lt;br/&gt;complicated because there are often many types of calls, requiring &lt;br/&gt;different service skills, such as knowledge of different languages and &lt;br/&gt;knowledge of different special promotions. The ACD is able to respond &lt;br/&gt;through skill-based routing, but there remains an opportunity to determine &lt;br/&gt;better routing algorithms and more effective methods for staffing. The &lt;br/&gt;difficulties are largely due to uncertainty about future arrivals of service &lt;br/&gt;requests of various kinds and the time and resources that will be required &lt;br/&gt;to respond to those requests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Given that contact with customers no longer need be by telephone, it is &lt;br/&gt;necessary to consider the other media. When service reps perform several &lt;br/&gt;different kinds of work, there is a need to allocate effort to the different &lt;br/&gt;tasks, which presents opportunities for improved efficiency if some of the &lt;br/&gt;work can be postponed. Multimedia also lead to more complicated contact &lt;br/&gt;experiences.  For example, customers might alternate between periods of &lt;br/&gt;interaction with service reps and periods of browsing on the Internet.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to respond to these challenges by conducting exploratory &lt;br/&gt;research on stochastic (probability) models of contact centers, aiming to &lt;br/&gt;uncover fundamental principles and develop performance-analysis tools &lt;br/&gt;that will make it possible to improve the design and management of &lt;br/&gt;contact centers. Effort will be made to find conditions for resource pooling &lt;br/&gt;in contact centers, where the efficiency of a large single-skill center is &lt;br/&gt;achieved in a multi-skilled center with minimal flexibility. Staffing will be &lt;br/&gt;studied in each of three important time scales: real-time, short-term and &lt;br/&gt;long-term. Effort will be made to understand the contribution of different &lt;br/&gt;sources of uncertainty: model uncertainty, parameter uncertainty and &lt;br/&gt;process uncertainty.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
