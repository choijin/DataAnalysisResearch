<AbstractNarration>0228781&lt;br/&gt;Aitken&lt;br/&gt;This grant provides support for a workshop to discuss the  desirability and feasibility of creating a broadly representative and inclusive professional organization for the environmental engineering profession. Specific objectives are to (1) build concensus towards broadly recognizing the need for a professional society for environmental engineers that is not based on restricted membership, (2) identify approaches to fulfilling such a need and (3) begin working towards fulfilling such a need in a manner that minimizes animosity and compteition, engages as diverse a cross-section of the environmental engineering community as possible and best serves the needs of society.  The workshop will be held at the University of Toronto in August 2002 in conjunction with the joint conference on Education and Research in Environmental Engineering and Science sponsored by the Association of Environmental Engineering and Science Professors and the American Academy of Environmental Engineers.</AbstractNarration>
