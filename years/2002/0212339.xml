    <AbstractNarration>CTS-0212339&lt;br/&gt;Prieve, Dennis C.&lt;br/&gt;Gordon Research Conference&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this grant is for partial support of the Gordon Research Conference on&lt;br/&gt;Chemistry at Interfaces to be held 7-12 July 2002 at Connecticut College in New London,&lt;br/&gt;Connecticut. The funds requested will be used to encourage wider participation in the&lt;br/&gt;conference by young chemical engineering faculty and promising graduate students by&lt;br/&gt;providing partial support for travel expenses and conference fees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program for the conference has four sub-themes: 1) Biomolecules at Interfaces, 2)&lt;br/&gt;Self-Assembly at Interfaces, 3) Consequences of Colloid Forces and 4) Charge Effects in&lt;br/&gt;Nonaqueous Media. 22 speakers and 20 discussion leaders have been invited and agreed to participate in the oral program. In addition to the invited talks, posters are encouraged&lt;br/&gt;to be submitted from all conference participants, especially from those not invited to&lt;br/&gt;speak. A 30-minute time slot is included in the morning program each day for oral&lt;br/&gt;overviews. The Vice-Chair will select between 3 and 6 posters to be summarized orally&lt;br/&gt;each day in this time slot. Full examination of all posters will be conducted in each&lt;br/&gt;afternoon's poster session. A final report will be prepared and submitted to the National Science Foundation.</AbstractNarration>
