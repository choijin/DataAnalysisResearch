<AbstractNarration>A series of experiments that provide an understanding of how to control and optimize the extent of intermolecular hydrogen bonding that occurs in a multi-component polymer system are proposed.  DMR supported research has demonstrated that miscible blends containing a liquid crystalline polymer (LCP) and an amorphous polymer can be created by optimizing the extent of intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the two species.  The physical, engineering, and thermodynamic parameters of miscible LCP/amorphous matrix will be determined using small angle neutron scattering, its phase decomposition process monitored by time-resolved light scattering, and its engineering properties (tensile, strength and flow properties) measured by standard techniques.  The effect of LCP rigidity on the ability to form miscible blends will be examined to probe the universality of the ability to induce miscibility in LCP/amorphous polymer blends by optimizing intermolecular interactions.  The impact of controlling and optimizing the extent of intermolecular interactions on the properties of polymer nanocomposites will also be studied.  This will be accomplished by correlating the dispersion of single carbon nanotubes and layered silicates in a multi-component polymer mixture to the level of hydrogen bonding between the two components.  The completion of this set of experiments will furnish critical information that will define the limits of the optimization of hydrogen bonding between two components in a multicomponent polymer mixture to improve its dispersion and properties and define crucial parameters that will enable the design and production of robust multicomponent polymer systems, including true molecular composites and nanocomposites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this work will come from the experience of Science teachers from a public High School when they spend four weeks in a university lab contributing to this project, obtaining hands-on laboratory experience and training in polymer demonstrations.  The teachers will utilize this experience in their classroom to introduce high school students to polymers and research.  This research will also be disseminated to a broad range of audiences by the development a public outreach webpage called "The Fact of the Matter" to educate the public regarding the contribution of materials to technological advances.  Further impact will result from the completion of neutron scattering experiments at the National Institute of Standards and Technology as well as Oak Ridge National Laboratory where the students participating in this project will acquire hands-on experience in a multi-user facility and develop the next-generation of neutron users to insure the continued health of these National facilities.  Finally, Current collaborations and interactions with industrial and/or government laboratories will expedite the transfer of the guidelines and fundamental understanding garnered from this project to commercial viable technologies that will benefit society.  The results of this project will provide critical guidelines that will ultimately enable the rational design of multicomponent polymer mixtures (blends and nanocomposites) that can be used to create materials with a broad range of targeted properties for an enormous range of technological applications including the next generation of extraordinary structural, flame resistant, and/or thermally stable materials.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
