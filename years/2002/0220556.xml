    <AbstractNarration>The American Association of University Women (AAUW) Educational Foundation is producing a summary of what has been learned from projects funded by NSF and the AAUW Educational Foundation from 1993 through 2001.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both organizations have funded research and demonstration projects in education, particularly science, mathematics, engineering, and technology education, that increase the participation of girls and women, and provide equal access to learning. The research team will summarize what is found in a number of areas, including gender differences in math and science skills and performance, differences among girls due to ethnicity and race, successful approaches that engage female students, factors that influence girls and women to pursue study in these fields, critical junctures for female SMET majors in higher education, and determinants to persistence at the graduate level. The study will use findings, evaluation results and accounts of innovative efforts reported in 175 projects funded by NSF and 200 projects funded by AAUW Educational Foundation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The published synthesis of findings and results will be disseminated widely to education policy makers, teachers and administrators via AAUW's publishing and marketing programs.</AbstractNarration>
