<AbstractNarration>This SETAC-sponsored Pellston Workshop, Use of Sediment Quality Guidelines (SQGs) and Related Tools for the Assessment of Contaminated Sediments is the latest in a series of SETAC-sponsored workshops to examine the state-of-the-science of different assessment tools and to provide recommendations for improving assessments of sediment quality and ecological risks. This workshop will focus on the issue of how best to integrate information derived from multiple chemical and biological lines of evidence in sediment quality evaluations. These lines of evidence, which are developed through the application of different assessment tools, often include chemistry-based sediment quality guidelines (SQGs). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Invited participants will explore the scientific underpinnings of five critical questions about sediment quality assessment. Participants will be organized into five technical workgroups, each focused on one of the following questions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. What are the scientific underpinnings and uncertainties associated with SQGs?&lt;br/&gt;2. How well do SQGs represent the potential for effects or no effects observed on&lt;br/&gt;aquatic biota?&lt;br/&gt;3. How can SQGs be used in one or more frameworks to assess sediment&lt;br/&gt;contamination?&lt;br/&gt;4. How should other assessment tools that are available for evaluating sediment&lt;br/&gt;contamination be used in combination with SQGs?&lt;br/&gt;5. What are the assessment and management options for addressing particularly&lt;br/&gt;complex sediment systems?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Steering Committee will guide pre-workshop technical  activities, assign discussion-initiation papers, and facilitate the workshop. The proceedings of the workshop will then be published in a peer-reviewed book and distributed by SETAC.</AbstractNarration>
