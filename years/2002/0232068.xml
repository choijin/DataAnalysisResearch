<AbstractNarration>     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I researches a commercial software application for personal computing devices. This commercial software application for personal computing devices is called the AIR (Atmospheric Information Remote). Its purpose is to provide consumers with an accurate, convenient and inexpensive way of measuring air pollution in their locality. AIR devices are used by people with atmospheric sensitivities. People with atmospheric sensitivities are children under 14 years old, people with asthma, heart disease or chronic respiratory disease, and the elderly. The AIR device protects the health of people with atmospheric sensitivities by letting them know when to go indoors or otherwise shelter themselves from the effects of nearby polluted air.&lt;br/&gt;     The research objective of this SBIR Phase I project is to define the information infrastructure needed to support the commercial delivery of the AIR application. Defining the information infrastructure involves detailing the specifications of each component within the information infrastructure. Some of these components exist, such as personal computing devices. Some do not exist, such as project specific software. The results of the component specification detail is a design document. This design document determines the feasibility of further research and development based on marketability and profitability.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
