    <AbstractNarration>PROPOSAL NO.: 0230505&lt;br/&gt;PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Patty, Thomas&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION NAME: University of Tennessee Chattanooga&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: Bridges to Engineering Science: Teaching Teachers (B.E.S.T.T.)&lt;br/&gt;NSF RECEIVED DATE: 06/04/2002 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of Tennessee at Chattanooga is designing a coordinated, comprehensive&lt;br/&gt;program to increase the number of students entering engineering fields in the targeted&lt;br/&gt;Tennessee/Georgia area. By including and impacting both pre-service and in-service&lt;br/&gt;teachers at grades K-12, this program, Bridges to Engineering Science: Teaching&lt;br/&gt;Teachers (B.E.S.T.T.), has the potential to affect the over 115,000 students in grades K-&lt;br/&gt;12 in thirteen school systems in Tennessee and Georgia identified as potential partners.&lt;br/&gt;The program will include a partnership between the Colleges of Engineering and&lt;br/&gt;Education; interaction among faculty and students of the colleges and the thirteen&lt;br/&gt;targeted school systems; development of high quality, self contained, apparatus based&lt;br/&gt;engineering science experiments and curriculum units which meet the education system&lt;br/&gt;goals and educational standards; development and dissemination of teaching materials on&lt;br/&gt;hands-on, age appropriate, engaging engineering science units for grades K-12; special&lt;br/&gt;targeted inclusion of groups currently under-represented in engineering; and formative&lt;br/&gt;and summative assessment at all stages of the project.</AbstractNarration>
