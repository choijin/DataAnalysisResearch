<AbstractNarration>0227919&lt;br/&gt;Bordeaux &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is to Sinte Gleska University to support the activity described below for 24 months.  The proposal was submitted in response to the Partnerships for Innovation Program Solicitation (NSF 02060).&lt;br/&gt;The partners include Sinte Gleska University (Lead Institution), The Rosebud Sioux Tribe, Global Sciences and Technology Corporation, and Earth Satellite Corporation. The goals of the program include developing and implementing a curriculum in geospatial information technology that is focused on the natural and cultural resource information needs of tribal governments.  The program creates an academic program that is focused on the cultural and land management information needs of Native American communities.  This academic program provides training in geospatial technology, and increases the level and quality of science and math education in Native schools. A series of workshops for tribal elders will help ensure that the development of the proposed curriculum will be relevant to and will address real operational needs of the Tribes.  In addition, the program is developing a business plan for a geospatial services enterprise that will serve indigenous communities, federal and state agencies, and will ultimately be able to compete successfully for geospatial services work for public and private sector clients worldwide. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the program is to create a self-sustaining Native American business that provides the skills to manage land resources with the initial focus on Native American communities and government agencies. Remote sensing and geospatial services that provide real time agriculture weather and storm information will be made available to Indian Nations throughout North America. The model will be made available for other indigenous communities. Unemployment and underemployment are widespread, and self-sustaining enterprises are rare among the Native Americans in this region.  The geospatial industry exports work in foreign countries, and this program is designed to provide trained workforce to keep these jobs in the U.S. The creation of new jobs, training for future employees plus providing a service to Native American communities to give them tools to help them manage their land will have a significant impact on the region.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
