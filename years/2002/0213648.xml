    <AbstractNarration>This research project is concerned with social and spatial change in large cities in developing nations. The research will examine trends of social and spatial polarization in residential areas of Accra (Ghana) and Mumbai (India). This will involve extensive fieldwork in both cities, with support from local universities, and employ site reconnaissance, interviews, census data analysis and residential mapping, residential surveys and focus groups. The main hypothesis in this study is that policies of economic liberalization in both cities have encouraged fundamental changes in urban land use and in urban labor markets. We expect to find increasing spatial differentiation of residential areas with greater contrasts in terms of types of residential developments and in terms of the socio-economic status of their residents. The choice of Accra and Mumbai as case studies is based on a number of critical elements that they have in common: their location in poor regions; their role as gateway cities; their colonial histories; their post-colonial experiences in terms of national and global phases in their countries political economy. This project builds on a previous NSF-funded study of the changing corporate geographies of Accra and Mumbai.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study is important theoretically because it helps to correct a bias in urban studies toward cities in the West and in more developed regions of the world economy. It will promote understanding of the social and spatial effects of liberalization and of corresponding trends of globalization in major urban centers in the developing world. As such, the study will contribute to more general theories of economic globalization. From a practical point of view, the research is significant because it will provide information about the changing geography of inequality in these cities. While rapid urban growth in the less developed world is a well-known phenomenon, little is known about the emerging human geographies of these cities. Trends of social and spatial polarization affect community development and local politics and also have ramifications for urban sustainable development and for urban planning and management. The results of the research will help illuminate the possible social and political risks of current trends and will make recommendations regarding sustainable social and spatial development of cities in developing nations.</AbstractNarration>
