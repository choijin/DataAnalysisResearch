<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Information Infrastructure for the Ocean Research Community&lt;br/&gt;M. R. Abbott OSU&lt;br/&gt;T. M. Powell&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Information Technology Infrastructure  (ITI) Plan to Advance Ocean Sciences report was completed in January 2002 as the result of a community planning process sponsored by NSF and the Office of Naval Research (ONR).  The report focused primarily on the needs for computing to support the modeling, data analysis and visualization needs of ocean researchers.  The report also noted the long-term needs for access to local ITI at ocean research institutions.  Recent community meetings have emphasized the continuing needs for high performance computing services that can be delivered through local, distributed sources in addition to centralized systems such as supercomputer centers.  Several activities are proposed to complete the ITI planning for ocean sciences.  The first activity will be a 25-35-person workshop to focus on the local, distributed facilities needs and to suggest innovative solutions. These findings are a compliment and extension to the existing report.  The second activity will institute a Scientific Steering Committee (SSC) to initiate further planning for implementation of the recommendations in the report.  The SSC will work in conjunction with federal agency initiatives, especially at NSF, to insure that infrastructure recommendations are science-driven.  To facilitate the above activities, a small planning group will be formed to organize the workshop and to select the initial members of the SSC; once the SSC is functional the planning groups duties will be assumed by the SSC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
