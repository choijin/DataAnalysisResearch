    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Phase II project is directed toward optimizing and scaling up fabrication of exchange coupled Fe/ceramic nanocomposites for high performance soft magnetic applications. In Phase I, Inframat Corporation took pioneering steps to develop Fe/ceramic magnetic nanocomposites, which resulted in significant improvements over microsized ferrites including higher saturation magnetization and lower power loss. The design of the Fe/ceramic nanocomposite is based on an exchange coupling effect between neighboring nanoparticles, where Fe nanoparticles are uniformly distributed within an insulating ceramic matrix. Successful Phase I efforts have provided the scientific and technological groundwork for further magnetic nanocomposite technology advancement in Phase II. The proposed Phase II program scales-up the Fe/ceramic nanocomposite technology performed in Phase I. Emphasis is on rapid commercialization of nanocomposite cores. Key Phase II milestones include (1) scale-up of the demonstrated chemical synthesis into pilot-scale production, (2) demonstration of prototype cores having desirable magnetic properties through exchange coupling, and (3) demonstration of high performance prototype DC-to-DC converters using the exchange coupled magnetic nanocomposite cores.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phase II participants include Ceramic Magnetics, UConn, Villanova Univ., Georgia Tech, and a converter specialist, Colonel William McLyman. Ceramic Magnetics has pledged $75,000 cost share to the Phase II and will carry a $250,000 follow-on funding.</AbstractNarration>
