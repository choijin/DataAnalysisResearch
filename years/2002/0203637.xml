    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT DMS- 0203637&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of this proposal is to continue our research on the topics below using &lt;br/&gt;techniques such as complex analysis, spectral theory, non-linear analysis and &lt;br/&gt;ergodic theory: i) Spectral theory of the Laplacian on functions and forms - connections &lt;br/&gt;with ergodic theory. ii) Global injectivity theorems. iii) Topology of umbilics. &lt;br/&gt;iv) The generalized Hilbert theorem. Topic i) is a collection of problems coming from &lt;br/&gt;(and relating to) spectral and ergodic theory, dynamics, vanishing theorems and the &lt;br/&gt;topology of manifolds of non-positive curvature. Topic ii) is an outgrowth of our efforts &lt;br/&gt;to understand embeddedness of minimal surfaces. It centers on the problem of &lt;br/&gt;finding conditions for a local diffeomorphism between non-compact manifolds to be injective.&lt;br/&gt;This type of question arises in areas of mathematics as diverse as algebraic geometry and &lt;br/&gt;mathematical economics. Our methods here come from geometry, topology and global analysis. &lt;br/&gt;Topic iii) is a classical problem in differential geometry namely, understanding the &lt;br/&gt;topology of umbilical singularities. The plan is to continue studying this problem as a &lt;br/&gt;question about the blow-up of certain hyperbolic partial differential equations. &lt;br/&gt;Topic iv) is also a classical problem, dealing with isometric immersions of hyperbolic &lt;br/&gt;spaces. As in iii), we plan to approach this question as a blow-up problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In our approach to research, starting with the earlier work on minimal surface theory, &lt;br/&gt;we have always sought to achieve a balance between technique and creative mathematics. &lt;br/&gt;This proposal is full of problems and ideas coming from diverse areas, such as spectral &lt;br/&gt;theory, dynamical systems, hyperbolic equations, algebraic and Riemannian geometry. &lt;br/&gt;We have already contributed to all these questions. Given the variety of topics, we would &lt;br/&gt;like to believe that this proposal advances the "internal" conversation of mathematics. &lt;br/&gt;On the other hand, the work on Global Inversion is potentially of interest to applied &lt;br/&gt;disciplines, since it addresses the question of solvability of systems of non-linear &lt;br/&gt;equations.</AbstractNarration>
