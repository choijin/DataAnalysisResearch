<AbstractNarration>Computer predictions of phenomena on large or global scales, for example&lt;br/&gt;weather or climate forecasts, need to compromise between accuracy of the &lt;br/&gt;predictions and available computing resources. It is therefore a grand&lt;br/&gt;scientific challenge to derive global climate  models which are reliable &lt;br/&gt;and trustworthy. Exploiting certain geophysical balances, such as &lt;br/&gt;geostrophic balance (due to earth rotation) or hydrostatic balance &lt;br/&gt;(due to the shallowness of the ocean and atmosphere) geophysicists derive&lt;br/&gt; reasonable, yet less complex, balanced models. It is therefore essential to &lt;br/&gt;justify rigorously the  validity of these models, for the relevant spatial&lt;br/&gt;and time scales. The focus  of the proposed project is on the analytical,&lt;br/&gt;statistical and numerical properties of solutions to nonlinear ocean &lt;br/&gt;dynamics models and turbulent sub-grid models. The first aspect of this &lt;br/&gt;project is to: show existence, uniqueness and continuous dependence on &lt;br/&gt;initial data, to some of these reduced geophysical models. In particular, &lt;br/&gt;a two-layer zonal jet model, a planetary geostrophic ``thermocline'' model, &lt;br/&gt;the lake equations with degenerate varying bottom topography and the &lt;br/&gt;two-dimensional primitive equations. This is the first and the most essential &lt;br/&gt;step in validating the derivation of these  models. In order to justify the &lt;br/&gt;long-time behavior of fluid dynamical models, one has to compare the statistical &lt;br/&gt;properties of their attracting invariant sets, rather than compare individual&lt;br/&gt;solutions. To do so, it is necessary to focus on models which include some &lt;br/&gt;mechanism of dissipation. This project addresses questions related to the asymptotic &lt;br/&gt;derivation of these models and the effect of numerical dissipation on their &lt;br/&gt;solutions, which include boundary layer analysis. The second aspect of this&lt;br/&gt;project is to: derive new large-eddy simulation models, the so-called alpha-models, &lt;br/&gt;in the context  of the  two-layers geostrophic zonal jet models. The alpha-models &lt;br/&gt;are asserted to reproduce the right energy spectrum for a wide range  of large &lt;br/&gt;scales. It is proposed to investigate  this claim using rigorous analytical tools. &lt;br/&gt;It is also proposed to perform computational tests on the newly derived two-layers &lt;br/&gt;geostrophic zonal jet alpha-model to verify the above assertion. Furthermore, &lt;br/&gt;it is proposed to explore the implementation of the alpha-models approach as &lt;br/&gt;sub-grid models. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The grand challenge in climate prediction is that the mathematical equations &lt;br/&gt;governing the ocean and atmosphere dynamics, are too difficult to study &lt;br/&gt;analytically, and still prohibitively expensive computationally. Indeed, &lt;br/&gt;it is well established, based on physical grounds and collected experimental &lt;br/&gt;data, that atmospheric and oceanic turbulent flows involve a broad spectrum &lt;br/&gt;of spatial and time scales. This in turn  makes them inaccessible  to the most &lt;br/&gt;powerful  and state-of-the-art computers. However, due to the rotation of the &lt;br/&gt;earth and other geophysical situations, such as the shallowness of the oceans &lt;br/&gt;and the atmosphere - in the sense that they are much wider than they are deep - &lt;br/&gt;geophysicists take advantage of certain geophysical balances to derive simplified&lt;br/&gt;balanced models. The first theme of this project is to: establish existence &lt;br/&gt;and regularity of solutions to some of these nonlinear reduced models. This is&lt;br/&gt;a crucial step  in justifying the derivation  of these models and their&lt;br/&gt;consistency with the physical observations for the relevant length  and time &lt;br/&gt;scales. Furthermore, in global climate prediction one is interested in the &lt;br/&gt;long-time statistical features of the climate. The second theme of this project &lt;br/&gt;is to develop a systematic approach for deriving and studying  new averaged &lt;br/&gt;models, in the context of ocean and atmosphere dynamics, which are reliable in &lt;br/&gt;reproducing the correct long-term statistics.</AbstractNarration>
