    <AbstractNarration>Bristol Community College's (BCC) Department of Computer Information Systems in a partnership with the Department of Computer and Information Science at University of Massachusetts Dartmouth (UMD) is developing a fully articulated computer science transfer program. Course alignment and professional development activities for two-year college faculty, as well as recruitment of high school students and adult graduates, are major activities. Special outreach efforts to women and minorities are also being implemented. Retention activities for community college students in the first two years and for students transferring are planned. A formal articulation agreement and a seamless pathway from high school to community college to university is being established.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Six computer science courses at the community college level are being aligned so that students may transfer, without loss of time or added expense because of non-transferable courses, into UMD's computer science program. Three new courses are being developed: Introduction to Computing Systems, Computer Organization and Design, and Software Specification and Design. BCC faculty, as well as other invited faculty are participating in professional and curriculum development activities for adopting these courses. Three other courses have being adopted and are being shared with other invited community college faculty. An intensive plan for professional development is being developed, including inter-institutional workshops, consultations, and professional meetings. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to insure a true 2 + 2 + 2 seamless pathway from high schools to community college to university, strategies for outreach, recruitment, and retention are planned. The Bristol Tech Prep liaison is going to assist in outreach and implementation of early start activities for teachers, students, and parents. These activities are designed to motivate and prepare students for placement in the computer science program. Strategies for retention at the college and university levels include tutoring and mentoring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program design includes plans for developing tangible products to be shared with participating faculty at BCC, UMD, and other community colleges. These products include videotaping of the six courses, three intensive faculty-to-faculty courses and three courses in the classroom, in order to provide community colleges with a two-year professional and curriculum development strategy for instituting an articulated transfer program from the A.S. degree in computer science to the B.S. degree in computer science.</AbstractNarration>
