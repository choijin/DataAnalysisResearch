<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Lineberger will conduct research in negative ion photoelectron spectroscopy, time resolved photodissociation spectroscopy, and time resolved photoelectron spectroscopy. Systems to be studied include biradical and triradical (e.g., 1,3,5-dehydrobenzene anion) species; complex biradical and clustered radical species; and anion complexes for the investigations of transition state spectroscopies and time resolved spectroscopy. A Negative Ion-Neutral-Positive Ion (NeNePo) technique will be developed to investigate the evolving structure of complexes along a reaction coordinate. Ongoing studies of energy flow and caging dynamics in size-selected anionic clusters will be continued, with extensions to include asymmetric chromophores, triatomic chromophores, and mixed solvents, in order to provide deep new insights into their dynamics.  Studies of time resolved dynamics in cluster ions will be extended from diatomic chromophores to triatomic species. This work will include work on prereactive complexes where photoexcitation can stimulate chemical reaction. Here the emphasis will be on photoexcitation that results in significant charge redistribution in the cluster complex, affording a direct look at solvent reorganization processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research deals with fundamental problems of reaction chemistry. The goal is to obtain new insights into the structure and reactive processes of chemical intermediates and solvated ions. The research will be conducted with internal and external collaborators as well as with  postdoctoral research associates and graduate students. The postdocs and students gain valuable experience in one of the forefront areas of physical chemistry in preparation for advanced studies or employment in industry, academia, or government laboratories. An active outreach program is conducted for the recruitment of the next generation of scientists and to bring the excitement of chemistry to high school and college students as a contribution to the development of a scientifically educated citizenry.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
