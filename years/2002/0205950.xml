    <AbstractNarration>The grant provides partial support for a 3-day workshop on real-time logistics with 40-50 participants meeting in Marina Del Rey, California, April 26-28, 2002. The idea is to address the opportunities and research challenges posed by the recent emergence of practical and economic GPS and other real time information sources about the status of pick-up and delivery trucking. Real-time communication is revolutionizing the logistics world by making practical a host of new information and control possibilities. Several research presentations will be provided, along with breakout sessions to discuss research priorities. The workshop would be jointly hosted by the University of Southern California and the University of Arizona, and funded by Department of Transportation sources in addition to the NSF and the universities.</AbstractNarration>
