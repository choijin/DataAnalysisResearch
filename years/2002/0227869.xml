    <AbstractNarration>0227869&lt;br/&gt;Prasad &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is to the Florida International University to support the activity described below for 24 months. The proposal was submitted in response to the Partnerships for Innovation Program Solicitation (NSF 02060).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Partners&lt;br/&gt;The partners include Florida International University (Lead Institution), Baptist Health Systems of South Florida, Beckman Coulter, Inc, Bioheart, Inc, Boston Scientific Corporation, Cardis (Johnson &amp; Johnson), IDEXX Laboratories, Inc, Medtronic Peripheral Vascular, Miami Cardiac and Vascular Institute, Miami Children's Hospital, Mt. Sinai Medical Center, Scion Cardio Vascular, Scion International, Inc, Syntheon, LLC, and The beacon Council.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program establishes a permanent infrastructure for entrepreneurial and technology transfer activity at Florida International University with a focus on the biomedical industry. The infrastructure provides a venue for faculty and students to engage industry to transfer their developmental projects to commercialization. The region has a balanced mixture of large and small entrepreneurial corporations in the medical device and pharmaceutical industries that rank in the top 13 in the nation. In addition to commercialization of the research and development output of the university, an activity that will create economic wealth and new jobs, the activities supported by this award will educate students in biomedical engineering for the workforce for the regional industry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The biomedical industry is growing very rapidly with large investments of venture capital. South Florida has established this industry as a top priority for economic growth. The goal of this proposal is to provide the workforce to enable the industry to grow in the region. The creation of new jobs will have a significant impact on the region. Florida International University currently ranks in the top 20 in graduation of Hispanic and African American engineers in the nation. In addition, the population of the region is high in underrepresented groups. Hence, the award broadens the participation of underrepresented groups in the technological and economic enterprise of the region.</AbstractNarration>
