<AbstractNarration>This project integrates recent search developments in ad hoc netorks into mainstream computer science and electrical engineering curricula.  It explores students to challenges posed by this emerging class of systems, improving studets' exposure to future infrastructures by developming real world ad hoc networking test-beds and deployment platforms, and permits educators at other U.S. institutions to do the same by sharing the system infrastructure and educational materils developed for this project.  Specifically, the project transforms several undergraduate and graduate level courses in computer systems to address the challenges posed by wirless, mobile and embedded networks of computers that form transient alliances in ad hoc networks.  This project transforms classes in networking, databases, operations systems, adaptive systems to integrate pervaive, ubiquitous, ad hoc networking and sensor networks.  A three-tiered approach benefits both current classsroom instructions as well as ongoing research on ad hoc network, and involves: 1) The development of software and courseware infrastructure necessary to build, use and evaluate system services for ad hoc networkss in a classroom setting. 2) Deployment of the critical mass of equipment to field a large, physical test-bed.  This network consists of mobile computers, ranging form sensors and pocket-sized information appliance through hand-helds to laptops.  Equipped with a wireless networking card, and multi-purpose sensors such as camera, these machine provide a real physical test-bed on which system services are evaluated for ad hoc networks. 3) Collection of information from the deployed test-bed on application communication pattersn, mobility models, and observed link characteristics.  This information can be used to carry out better-informed simulations of ad hoc networks.  This grant impacts computer challenges the nation is facing, it results in innovative research on operating systems, database and telecommunications, and it generates course materials and define infrastructure that will allow the project to be repeated elsewhere in the country</AbstractNarration>
