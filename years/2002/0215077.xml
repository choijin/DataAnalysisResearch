<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims at developing a novel low-cost method for the preparation of Multi-Walled Carbon Nanotubes (MWCNT) for Field Emission Displays (FED) applications. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are characterized by high aspect ratio and small radius of curvature at their tips. This structural property, together with high electrical conduction, chemical inertness and mechanical strength makes them promising emitters for field emission flat panel displays. CNTs have been conventionally prepared by high-pressure, chemical-vapor-deposition processes, but these approaches have serious limitations owing to high cost of production. Recently suggested alternative methods of CNT preparation include plasma activation and catalytic growth, but they are limited by low yields or metal contaminations. In this Phase I effort, Materials Modification, Inc. proposes to synthesize carbon nanotubes from readily available raw materials by combining a pyrolysis and chemical process. The CNT thus produced will be chemically pure since no metal catalyst is used in the process and any side-products formed are in vapor state and will not contaminate it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Potential commercial applications include display aided flat bedded control panels, all types of touch screen facilities, flat panel monitors for both professional and entertainment displays, and naval and air surveillance systems.</AbstractNarration>
