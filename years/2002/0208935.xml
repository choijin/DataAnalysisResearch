<AbstractNarration>In concept learning, the learner is typically given a sample of instances&lt;br/&gt;labeled according to some unknown target concept. The learner?s task is to&lt;br/&gt;construct a hypothesis that is a good approximation of the target in a&lt;br/&gt;reasonable amount of time. Building concept learning systems has become an&lt;br/&gt;important research area due to the ever-increasing need for analyzing huge&lt;br/&gt;amounts of stored data. Although many efficient algorithms were constructed for&lt;br/&gt;learning various classes of concepts, these concept classes are extremely&lt;br/&gt;simple. Further, numerous hardness results seem to suggest that learning more&lt;br/&gt;expressive concept classes is extremely difficult.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two research directions have evolved in an effort to address the difficulty of&lt;br/&gt;learning more expressive concepts. One is to construct multiple classifier&lt;br/&gt;systems (MCS) and the other is to consider the possibility of actively&lt;br/&gt;interacting with the environment (a.k.a. active learning). Currently, due to&lt;br/&gt;the success of the Adaboost algorithm, theoretical research on MCS (and in fact&lt;br/&gt;machine learning in general) tends to focus rather narrowly on ensemble&lt;br/&gt;methods. Similarly, active learning research has been concentrated on the use&lt;br/&gt;of membership queries, and to some extent the teaching model. Other types of&lt;br/&gt;MCS and active learning that may lead to more intelligent learning systems have&lt;br/&gt;not been well studied. A good understanding of how to build more sophisticated&lt;br/&gt;MCS and exploit other possibilities of extracting information from the&lt;br/&gt;environment will move us one step closer to achieving the original intent of&lt;br/&gt;machine learning, which is to automate the knowledge acquisition process. This&lt;br/&gt;proposed research will investigate complex multiple classifier and active&lt;br/&gt;learning systems so that the learning of difficult concept classes becomes more&lt;br/&gt;tractable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
