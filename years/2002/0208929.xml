<AbstractNarration>Given a metric space, that is a finite set of points with&lt;br/&gt;distances between them, there are several classical&lt;br/&gt;minimization problems that are hard to solve exactly.  A&lt;br/&gt;prime example is the traveling salesman problem (TSP),&lt;br/&gt;where we want to find a cyclic tour visiting all the&lt;br/&gt;points with minimum total distance.  These problems arise&lt;br/&gt;in a wide range of applications such as manufacturing and&lt;br/&gt;communications network design.  In the worst case it is&lt;br/&gt;NP-hard to solve these problems even approximately, that&lt;br/&gt;is with relative error better than some constant threshold.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent results show that these problems are easier in&lt;br/&gt;metric spaces that often arise in practice.  In particular&lt;br/&gt;if the distances are geometric, or if they are given by&lt;br/&gt;shortest paths in a simple graph (such as a planar graph),&lt;br/&gt;then the TSP and similar problems have approximation&lt;br/&gt;schemes.  These schemes run in polynomial or&lt;br/&gt;quasi-polynomial time, with the exponent depending on the&lt;br/&gt;desired relative error.  The main techniques include&lt;br/&gt;separators, spanners, and dynamic programming. In&lt;br/&gt;particular a spanner is a subgraph of a given graph, whose&lt;br/&gt;shortest path metric is a close approximation of the&lt;br/&gt;original. In various graph families we can find spanners&lt;br/&gt;with a useful tradeoff between the total weight and the&lt;br/&gt;relative error.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research continues the development of these&lt;br/&gt;techniques, in particular seeking better spanner&lt;br/&gt;constructions and possibly some useful lower bounds.  One&lt;br/&gt;goal of the project is some progress on two unsolved&lt;br/&gt;variants:  the geometric case in the presence of&lt;br/&gt;obstacles, and the graphical case in the presence of many&lt;br/&gt;extra ``Steiner'' points.</AbstractNarration>
