<AbstractNarration>PROPOSAL NO.: 0230000&lt;br/&gt;PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Brady, Tim&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION NAME: Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: Project 2020&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project 2020, an Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University (ERAU) engineering curriculum&lt;br/&gt;initiative, is a nine-month planning grant the primary goal of which is to create a&lt;br/&gt;curriculum development demonstrator inspired by the Electronic Performance Support&lt;br/&gt;System (EPSS) methodology used in the aerospace industry (Boeing), and adapted to the&lt;br/&gt;university environment. A team composed of members from education and industry will&lt;br/&gt;collaborate to achieve the goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant is the first step in achieving a larger vision defined by these sequential goals:&lt;br/&gt;(1) create a curriculum development methodology inspired by the Electronic Performance&lt;br/&gt;System used in the aerospace industry (Boeing), and adapted to the university&lt;br/&gt;environment, the objective of this planning grant; (2) bring together appropriate cross-&lt;br/&gt;discipline faculty to use the EPSS methodology for development of a curriculum&lt;br/&gt;component such as a course or a semester of courses as a demonstration project; (3) use&lt;br/&gt;the same faculty to conduct a one-semester demonstration project with university&lt;br/&gt;engineering and technology students; (4) measure, assess, and compare the student&lt;br/&gt;achievement and satisfaction of the demonstration group at various intervals to that of a&lt;br/&gt;control group of students engaged in the traditional curriculum using outcomes-based&lt;br/&gt;methodologies; (5) measure, assess, and compare faculty performance, workload and&lt;br/&gt;satisfaction in both groups at various intervals; (6) evaluate the results of the&lt;br/&gt;demonstration project and prepare a report; (7) share the results through workshops and&lt;br/&gt;other media with other universities to encourage and support demonstration and&lt;br/&gt;collaborative projects at those universities; and (8) implement the curriculum concepts on&lt;br/&gt;a large scale across the university and between campuses within the university.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
