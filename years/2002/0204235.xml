<AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Microbial Biology for FY2002.  The fellowship supports training and research on the basic biology of protozoan, microalgal, fungal, archaeal, bacterial and viral species that are not generally considered to be model organisms. Further, it provides opportunities for a recent doctoral recipients to obtain additional training in microbial biology, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of established scientists, and to broaden his/her scientific horizons beyond the research experiences during the undergraduate and graduate training. These fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including foreign locations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research and training plan is entitled "Microarray analysis to discover light-quality regulated genes in the cyanobacteria Fremyella diplosiphon."  Microarrays allow researchers to analyze global gene expression.  Fremyella diplosiphon has an adaptive response to light color called complementary chromatic adaptation (CCA).  However, only three operons have been identified as regulated by light color.  This research uses microarrays of PCR amplified genomic fragments to discover novel genes that are light color regulated and then uses gene-specific microarrays to examine the expression kinetics of these genes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
