<AbstractNarration>PI: Richard Moeckel, University of Minnesota - Twin Cities&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0200992&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;Hamiltonian and Celestial Mechanics&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is devoted to research in the general area of dynamical &lt;br/&gt;systems theory with emphasis on Hamiltonian and celestial mechanics.   Several very &lt;br/&gt;different aspects of the subject will be studied.  Part of the project deals with the special &lt;br/&gt;periodic solutions of the n-body problem arising from central configurations.  It is a &lt;br/&gt;long-standing open problem to determine how many central configurations are possible, or &lt;br/&gt;even if the number is finite.  Techniques from algebraic geometry and computational algebra &lt;br/&gt;will be used to attack this question.  A second part of the project involves the &lt;br/&gt;construction of isolating blocks in the phase space of the three-body problem.  It is known that &lt;br/&gt;it is possible to find simple, explicit isolating blocks at the collinear Lagrange points &lt;br/&gt;of the restricted three-body problem.  These blocks can be used to study the complicated &lt;br/&gt;invariant set nearby.  The project is to carry out such a construction near the &lt;br/&gt;collinear central configuration of the unrestricted three-body problem.  Here the &lt;br/&gt;dimension of the phase space is higher and the geometry is much more complicated.  A final part &lt;br/&gt;of the project is concerned with understanding the mechanism of Arnold diffusion for &lt;br/&gt;Hamiltonian systems. The approach taken here is based on the construction of an invariant &lt;br/&gt;Cantor set of annuli and subsequent analysis of the resulting dynamics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gravitational n-body problem remains an active topic for mathematics &lt;br/&gt;research three centuries after Newton proposed it.  Over the years it has been a &lt;br/&gt;stimulus for the development of new mathematics of wide applicability.  It is the classic &lt;br/&gt;example of a nonlinear mechanical system and its solutions include orderly cyclical &lt;br/&gt;motions, multi-body collisions, and irregular, chaotic behavior.  The simplest &lt;br/&gt;solutions are the rigidly rotating orbits arising from the central configurations.  &lt;br/&gt;Central configurations are special arrangements of the masses such that the gravitational &lt;br/&gt;forces can be exactly balanced by centrifugal forces when the configuration rotates.  Although &lt;br/&gt;these solutions are dynamically very simple, the problem of finding or even counting the &lt;br/&gt;central configurations turns out to be very difficult when there are four or more masses &lt;br/&gt;involved.  Part of this project is about how to deal with very complicated algebraic problems &lt;br/&gt;such as this, perhaps using the help of computers.  The central configurations are &lt;br/&gt;important landmarks which provide a starting point for further analysis.  It turns out that &lt;br/&gt;there are many other interesting solutions near the simple, rigidly rotating ones.  One &lt;br/&gt;way to trap and study these nearby orbits involves the construction of so-called &lt;br/&gt;isolating blocks. The geometry of these blocks provides qualitative information about the &lt;br/&gt;solutions inside and can also form the basis of numerical methods for approximating these &lt;br/&gt;solutions. Finally, there is the problem of understanding chaotic dynamics in &lt;br/&gt;mechanical systems and how such behavior can lead to large-scale instability.  Instability in &lt;br/&gt;celestial mechanics can give rise to such phenomena as the slow drifting of the orbital &lt;br/&gt;parameters of planets or asteroids.  It also occurs in a variety of other mechanical systems.  &lt;br/&gt;This phenomenon of Arnold diffusion is only partially understood at present.  The new &lt;br/&gt;approach which will be pursued here seems promising but much work remains to be done before &lt;br/&gt;it can be applied to complex systems like the n-body problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
