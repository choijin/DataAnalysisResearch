<AbstractNarration>SES-0241427&lt;br/&gt;Ivan Szelenyi&lt;br/&gt;Yale University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The grant provides funding for the PI to host a planning workshop to develop a collaborative research project on "Firm-level Gender Inequalities in Transitional Societies.  Intra-firm level analysis is necessary to answer some of the most pressing questions about merging social inequalities in post-state socialists countries.  The resultant project will propose to use cutting-edge techniques tp complete firm level analysis that can address the issue of whether and how men and women are allocated into different job categories and what effect this  allocation has on earning.  The major goal of the research is to better understand the mechanisms behind such processes, which will increase our knowledge of the causes and consequences of occupational segregation by gender and gender wage gap in both transitional societies and advanced market economies.  Research on the effects of gender as an ascriptive category on labor market chances could guide future research in the area of gender stratification, occupational mobility and labor market inequalities.  A project on firm-level gender inequalities would also inform labor policy aimed at reducing discrimination in hire, promotion, and wage setting.  The workshop will include invited scholars from the post-state socialist region, as well as experts in the fields of gender inequality and intra-firm analysis.  During the workshop participants will explore country-specific data availability, as well as methodological and theoretical challenges of completing a comparative research project on the topic.  The objective the workshop is to develop a collaborative comparative research agenda on firm level gender inequalities in transitional societies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
