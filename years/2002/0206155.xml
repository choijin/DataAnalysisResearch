<AbstractNarration>Project PEERS builds on the PACTS program for minority middle school and high school students in the District of Philadelphia.  It is designed to offer a citywide model for service learning in environmental research and public engagement that meets the promotion and graduation requirements of students at grades 8-12.  The students will meet at the Franklin Institute for a maximum of six hours per week.  During the summers students will attend a six-week intensive program (including five mornings per week for three and a half-hour sessions on environmental science workshops, laboratory and online research, and webspace/video development).  For two afternoons a week students will conduct research at the Centennial Lake Research site. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has three components to service learning:  science learning and research, community service, and public engagement. The project will engage approximately 300 students, 150 of whom will complete the district requirements for service learning.  An additional 2,000 students and adults will participate in the activities.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
