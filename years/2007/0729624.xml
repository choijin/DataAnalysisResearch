<AbstractNarration>This award provides financial support for sixteen travel grants directed at scientists fro lesser developed countries to attend the next IAPSO General Assembly that will be held in conjunction with the General Assembly of IUGG (International Union of Geology and Geophysics) in Perugia, Italy, on July 2-13, 2007. The general scientific program, and the specific IAPSO one, can be found at http://www.iugg2007Perugia.it  Priority will given to young scientists, and scientists from developing countries and the former eastern blocks (USRR- Yugoslavia) to attend the Assembly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scientific program encompasses the most recent advances in geodesy, oceanography and marine biology. The dynamic nature of our planet naturally creates interactions of life within the oceans, the oceans themselves and the continents and many of the symposium sessions cover interdisciplinary themes. Below is listed just a small sample of the significant symposia on the 2007 assembly to be held:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our Changing Planet &lt;br/&gt;Global Earth Observing Systems&lt;br/&gt;Our Understanding of Climate Change&lt;br/&gt;High-Performance Computations in Geosciences&lt;br/&gt;Our Changing Climate: A Global Policy Issue&lt;br/&gt;Ocean Circulation and contributions from new satellite missions&lt;br/&gt;Global sea-level change: Altimetry, GNSS and tide gauge measurements&lt;br/&gt;Satellite Observations: Products and Applications&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The funding is important to allow students and young scientists to have direct interchanges with senior scientists and provides a forum for interchanges between the supported scientists with those from developed countries. Furthermore, the informal discussions outside the formal sessions have significant values, allowing for interactions one-to-one and for the establishment of scientific collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
