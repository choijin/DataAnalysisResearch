<AbstractNarration>GRADUATE TEACHING FELLOWS IN K-12 EDUCATION&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PROPOSAL #: 0742483&lt;br/&gt;PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Catherine Ueckert&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION: Northern Arizona University&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: Biotechnology Integration Opportunities for Teacher Education and Content (BIOTEC)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Biotechnology Integration Opportunities for Teacher Education and Content (BIOTEC) will enhance inquiry-based science teaching while expanding the interdisciplinary preparation of graduate students. Biotechnology powerfully integrates scientific knowledge with knowledge generated through scientific research, while providing a context to explore the reciprocal relationship between technology and science.  The biotechnology theme will add relevance and interest in STEM concepts in K-12 classrooms (specifically grades 5, 7, &amp; 9).  Existing cyberinfrastructure will be used to reach teachers and students in remote Navajo reservation schools.  Project goals are to:  1) establish, strengthen, and sustain partnerships between GK-12 teachers, STEM Fellows, the Translational Genomics Research Institute (TGen), local school districts, schools on the reservation, and NAU researchers; 2) develop and implement professional development opportunities for GK-12 teachers and Fellows; and 3) determine the effectiveness of partnering schools, teachers, students, and Fellows across rural and urban contexts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Teacher and Fellow teams will develop the content and skills to engage K-12 students in appropriate biotechnology laboratories.  Classroom teachers will serve as teaching mentors for the Fellows. The Fellows will convey the purpose of scientific research and how it provides the foundation for improving our choices about personal and community health. These experiences will enhance the Fellows as researchers, collaborators, and future teachers. Students will experience scientific inquiry and become aware of careers in science, biotechnology, and technology support services.  It is expected that all participants in BIOTEC will gain a better understanding of scientific research and how it affects our understanding of the world.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    All participants in BIOTEC gained a better understanding of scientific research and how it affects our understanding of the world around us, as well as the reciprocal relationship between science and technology. The BIOTEC project examined the research regarding climate change, genetically modified organisms, genomics, and the Next Generation Science Standards. The partnership with Translational Genomics Research Institute (TGen)  increased teacher and student awareness of  the role of science in policy, ethics, and other aspects of modern life.  Teachers and students increased their understanding of bioinformatics, next generation sequencing, microarrays, and genomic research; and became aware of cutting-edge science, and the process that takes biotechnology research from the lab to human applications.  The Fellows helped to increase the K-12 teachersÆ understanding of science and improved teachersÆ skills in biotechnology. Specifically K12 teachers have learned how to perform DNA extractions, electrophoresis, and many other research techniques.  Teachers developed skills for helping students address scientific questions in a "real time" atmosphere which helped to make the school curriculum more meaningful.  As a result of the BIOTEC program K12 teachers increased their utilization of inquiry in their lessons and their understanding of and improved skills in life science and technology.    The classroom teachers served as mentors for the Fellows in lesson planning, lab preparation in K12 settings, classroom communication, and the importance of different learning styles.  The Fellows gained confidence as teachers, enhanced their communication skills, and increased their understanding of effective teaching methods. The Fellows had many achievements and successes.  One Fellow was a Fullbright scholar, six were ARCS scholars, and nine were selected as IGERT Fellows.  In addition many papers were written, scholarhsips awarded, and academic/research positions acquired.  Students experienced the "excitement" of research through the GK12 FellowÆs research, the process of scientific inquiry, and developed an enhanced understanding of the nature and methods of science. Students engaged in multiple activities that focused on observations, questioning, data collection and analysis.   Scientific research became exciting and a means to deepen students' understanding of scientific concepts.  The BIOTEC project reached isolated, rural schools and underserved populations, namely two schools on Native American reservations (Jeddito and White Cone High School). Reservation students benefited from access to college students that included minorities and women as well as awareness of careers in science, biotechnology, and technology.  The university has strengthened partnerships with northern Arizona schools. The sustainability portion of the grant is providing the University an opportunity to sustain the partnerships with Flagstaff Unified School District as well as schools located on the Navajo reservation.
