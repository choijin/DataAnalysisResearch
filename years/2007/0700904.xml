<AbstractNarration>This project deals with two broad classes of problems. The first&lt;br/&gt;concerns varieties of commuting matrices and jet schemes, and arises&lt;br/&gt;from algebro-geometric interpretations of an open problem in&lt;br/&gt;commuting matrices.  The other concerns division algebras, and&lt;br/&gt;arises from the classical question of crossed products, and as well,&lt;br/&gt;from recently discovered applications of division algebras to coding&lt;br/&gt;theory.&lt;br/&gt;In the first class of problems, the PI, Sethuraman, wishes to study&lt;br/&gt;various varieties defined by the condition that certain matrices&lt;br/&gt;commute, such as varieties of commuting pairs, of commuting triples,&lt;br/&gt;and of commuting pairs in the centralizers of fixed matrices. The&lt;br/&gt;idea is to gain insight into three generated commutative matrix&lt;br/&gt;algebras. Jet schemes of commuting pairs of matrices arise naturally&lt;br/&gt;in these considerations, as do jet schemes of determinantal&lt;br/&gt;varieties.  In the second class of problems, Sethuraman wishes to&lt;br/&gt;study certain generically defined symbol division algebras of prime&lt;br/&gt;exponent and index various powers of the prime to determine if these&lt;br/&gt;are crossed products.  The generic nature of the symbol algebra&lt;br/&gt;makes this a significant object to study.  In a different direction,&lt;br/&gt;Sethuraman wishes to continue to study applications of division&lt;br/&gt;algebras to wireless communication, including determining large&lt;br/&gt;subgroups of units in orders in division algebras, and the&lt;br/&gt;construction of orthogonal lattices inside number fields for&lt;br/&gt;appropriate trace forms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The problems considered in this proposal arise from algebra and&lt;br/&gt;algebraic geometry.  There are two kinds of problems studied here:&lt;br/&gt;one where the motivation comes from within mathematics, and the&lt;br/&gt;other where, very significantly, the motivation comes from&lt;br/&gt;wireless communication.  The PI has had a successful collaboration&lt;br/&gt;with engineers where he was able to utilize certain abstractly&lt;br/&gt;defined mathematical objects (``division algebras'') to solve a very&lt;br/&gt;practical telecommunications problem.  The synergy appeared most&lt;br/&gt;unexpectedly, and has led to a very fruitful body of results in the&lt;br/&gt;field.   In addition to this work with engineers, it is to be noted&lt;br/&gt;that the PI teaches in a primarily undergraduate institution, with a&lt;br/&gt;large immigrant population, where he has guided several&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate and masters level students on research projects in&lt;br/&gt;mathematics. Some of these students will go on to be school&lt;br/&gt;teachers. He proposes to continue working with students on research&lt;br/&gt;projects.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
