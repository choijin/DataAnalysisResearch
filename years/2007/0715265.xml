<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;17 August 2007&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:  0715265&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution&lt;br/&gt;PI: A. Suchy&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal as submitted requested eight Shipboard Scientific Support items for the R/Vs Oceanus, Knorr and Atlantis, including equipment required by the United States Coast Guard (USCG) and the International Maritime Organization (IMO).  WHOI is requesting an upgrade of voice and data communications equipment, which will improve science transmission of data as well as improve ship operations.  The upgrade to the Closed-Circuit TV system on Knorr will provide a capability to monitor the various areas on the ship for science, safety and security.  WHOI will participate in the fleet test of the new thermal imaging units.  This capability goes beyond that of radar and provides the navigator with ?vision at night, in fog and in smoke?.  In addition, WHOI is requesting safety modifications/upgrades to support the deep submergence vehicle Alvin operations from the R/V Atlantis.  The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution will do a group purchase for the required Voyage Data Recorders and distribute the units to the 8 large research vessels.  The Oceanus, Knorr and Atlantis will receive the requested Class D fire extinguishers through the Safety Equipment group purchase being done by Harbor Branch Inst. of Oceanography.  All of the above items have some element of improving safety on the WHOI operated vessels.  Safety equipment benefits all users of the ship.  Doing a group purchase of safety items provides standardization of equipment from one ship to another and thus increases user familiarity with life saving equipment.  It should be noted the R/Vs Knorr and Atlantis are USCG inspected and must meet the USCG requirements for safety of life at sea. The WHOI requested equipment will support scientific operations and data collection in the Atlantic and global oceans.  The number of missions supported by these ships averages around thirty-five per year. The Oceanus, Knorr and Atlantis are integral to the Institutions public outreach program and supports several educational and public outreach events during the year through the use of vessels open-house, student training at sea, and web-based projects.      &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
