<AbstractNarration>Graduate Teaching Fellows in K-12 (GK-12)&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal: # 0742544&lt;br/&gt;PI: Jeffrey Kidder&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Colorado-Boulder&lt;br/&gt;Title: Graduate Teaching Fellows in Ethnically Diverse Classrooms: A Collaborative Model for Impacting Science and Learning in Boulder County, Colorado Public Schools&lt;br/&gt;NSF Supported STEM Disciplines : Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science, Environmental Science, Geology, Mathematics, Physics&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project falls largely under the thematic heading of knowledge transfer and curriculum development and enrichment. The project will focus on effective delivery, integration, and extension of FOSS science kits targeted to elementary and middle school students. An ecology/computing science theme is integrated into the elementary FOSS modules; at the middle-school level, fellows will collaborate with classroom teachers to impact science teaching and learning in the classroom.  Outside of the classroom fellows? engagement is through&lt;br/&gt;informal science clubs with a research project focus. It is expected that the fellows will serve two years in the project ? one year at the elementary level and one at middle school level, so that each teaching fellow will have experience at both levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit of this project is in the value of a collaboration involving university science content specialists, inquiry-based science educators, and classroom teachers in changing the university and school culture for science education and for promoting increased student achievement.&lt;br/&gt;Anticipated outcomes of the proposed program include: enhanced teaching and communication skills of the fellows; development of students who are motivated and excited about science, mathematics, engineering and technology (SMET) with increased knowledge and understanding of SMET subjects; collaboration of teachers with graduate students in designing learning experiences for their students and incorporating new ideas, activities, and resources into their curricula; opportunities for teachers to learn hands-on, inquiry-based approaches to teaching; and the development of a model of school-college collaboration that has relevance and merit for national dissemination.&lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the proposed project will be to provide a model of school-college collaboration that has merit for replication throughout the school district and in school districts across the nation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
