<AbstractNarration>This project aims to design and study metal-oxide organic frameworks with multifunctional properties. The possibility of finding unique physical properties in these compounds is the goal of the research. Metal-oxide organic frameworks will be constructed from metal-oxide chains cross-linked by organic anions as a large class of solids that possess the properties usually associated with porous solids. Metal-oxide organic frameworks are of special interest because they provide a unique platform for the study of dimensionality and size effects on magnetic, optical and dielectric properties.  They are inherently multi-functional in that they combine the extended properties of the oxide component such as conductivity, magnetism, dielectric behavior, and optical properties with the properties of the organic species used to link the oxide chain or layer and the pore space that results.  The research program will provide cutting-edge cross-disciplinary education aimed at training and developing scientists suitably equipped to contribute to academia and the advanced technology industries being based on the development and use of new materials. The program also aims to integrate diversity and research excellence into the workforce.&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;Recent advances in materials synthesis have led to the discovery of a large class of new hybrid organic-inorganic compounds with applications in catalysis and in processes for the selective separation of chemicals. A good possibility of finding unique physical properties in these compounds is expected because the compounds combine the characteristics of the inorganic component such as conductivity and magnetism with those of the organic species used to link the inorganic parts together and the pore space that results.  The combination of properties may lead to useful devices such as sensors for toxic gases. The research program will provide cutting-edge cross-disciplinary education aimed at training and developing scientists suitably equipped to contribute to academia and the advanced technology industries being based on the development and use of new materials. The program also aims to integrate diversity and research excellence into the workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
