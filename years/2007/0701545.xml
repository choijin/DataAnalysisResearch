<AbstractNarration>On some Nonlinear Elliptic Equations &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract of Proposed Research&lt;br/&gt;Yanyan Li&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is to continue earlier studies on the compactness of solutions to the Yamabe problem, and on the existence of solutions to a very general fully nonlinear version of the Yamabe problem. The PI also proposes to study, in collaboration with Luis Caffarelli, multi-valued solutions to the Monge-Ampere equations in order to understand behavior of a metric generated by a multi-valued solutions to the Monge-Ampere equations near the vertex of a Y-shaped singularity in 3-dimensional space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Many questions in (Riemannian) geometry can be formulated as questions about the properties of certain associated nonlinear partial differential equations and their solutions. These formulations have often proved to be the means to prove very general geometrical theorems. The results often depend on the dimension of the manifolds and other geometrical invariants. Under this award, a number of specific conjectures and problems of this type will be investigated.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Partial differential equations arise naturally in physics, engineering, geometry, and many other fields, and they form the basis for modeling many phenomena in the physical world.  The particular class of "nonlinear  elliptic equations'' is especially important from this perspective.  For instance, such equations turn up in the study of composite materials. They also turn up in the study of conformal geometry.  Our completed research work under the support of this project contributes  to a basic understanding of  nonlinear  elliptic equations, thereby providing scientists and engineers with sharpened insight into various physical processes and ultimately enhancing the quality of, say, consumer products manufactured from composites.  In our work  on conformally invariant fully nonlinear elliptic equations, we have developed methods and techniques of depth and of wide applicability. For instance, after establishing general Liouville type theorems for solutions on the  entire Euclidean space  and axisymmetry results for solutions  on a punctured Euclidean space, we have introduced a method in establishing  gradient estimates of solutions of conformally invariant  equations, either elliptic or degenerate elliptic, through a blow-up novel technique and an application of the above mentioned Liouville type theorems. The above mentioned result on axisymmetry of solutions to conformally invariant nonlinear equations on punctured spaces has also played a crucial role in our recent work  on Harnack inequalities and Bocher-type  theorems for conformally invariant  fully nonlinear degenerate elliptic equations and on compactness of solutions for a fully nonlinear Yamabe problem under a lower Ricci curvature bound. Our work in partial differential equations from composite material has led to deeper understanding in the study of systems of elasticity. In our work on partial differential equations  from composite material, we have obtained  optimal estimates of the strain tensors when fibers in fiber enforced materials become very close.  One student has received his Ph.D. degree in May 2013, under my supervision. I currently have two  Ph.D. students. I have given a topics course on partial differential equations from fluids to help graduate students and postdocs  in their research. I co-organize the Nonlinear Analysis Seminar at Rutgers, and co-organize a Joint Princeton-Rutgers Seminar on Geometric PDEs. In addition, I co-organize  a weekly student seminar at Rutgers. I believe that the student seminars have helped students and postdocs  to find  research problems and to be exposed to mathematics of importance.  I have worked closely with graduate students so that students can be trained effectively.         Last Modified: 08/01/2013       Submitted by: Yanyan Li]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
