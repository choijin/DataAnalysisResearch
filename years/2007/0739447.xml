<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;Proposal:0739685 PI Name:Sedwick, Peter&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title: Collaborative Research: Quantifying the Effects of Iron and Light on&lt;br/&gt;the Growth of Diatoms from the Ross Sea, Antarctica&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences (BIOS), Inc.&lt;br/&gt;Abstract Date: 04/08/08&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: In much of the Southern Ocean, iron and irradiance are thought to&lt;br/&gt;exert major controls on the timing and location of blooms of the two major phytoplankton&lt;br/&gt;groups, Phaeocystis antarctica and diatoms. Recent numerical modeling studies have&lt;br/&gt;simulated the broad-scale features of algal biomass and species composition in the&lt;br/&gt;southern Ross Sea, by prescribing a higher iron requirement for the growth of diatoms&lt;br/&gt;relative to P antarctica and by allowing higher growth rates by P. antarctica under low&lt;br/&gt;irradiance. However, there are large uncertainties associated with the parameterizations&lt;br/&gt;used in these models, particularly with regard to phytoplankton iron parameters, which&lt;br/&gt;are typically assigned static values. Results of recent laboratory experiments with&lt;br/&gt;colonial P. antarctica suggest that the iron requirement of this species can be relatively&lt;br/&gt;high, and appears to vary strongly as a function of irradiance. In this project, the&lt;br/&gt;investigators will use laboratory experiments to quantify the iron requirements of diatom&lt;br/&gt;species that are representative of open-water, ice-edge and sea-ice environments of the&lt;br/&gt;southern Ross Sea, including Thalassiosira gracilis, Pseudo-nitzschia subcurvata,&lt;br/&gt;Fragilariopsis cylindrus and Navicula glaciei. The experimental data will be used to test&lt;br/&gt;a number of hypotheses concerning the effects of iron availability, irradiance and UV-B&lt;br/&gt;exposure on growth rates, production of dimethylsulfoniopropionate and dimethylsulfide,&lt;br/&gt;cellular pigment composition, and the relative uptake of macronutrients. In addition, the&lt;br/&gt;investigators will conduct preliminary "algal competition experiments", in which the&lt;br/&gt;growth of mixed assemblages containing both diatoms and colonial Phaeocystis&lt;br/&gt;antarctica will be examined, as a function of iron and irradiance, with and without UV-B&lt;br/&gt;exposure.&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: The research will provide quantitative information that is required to&lt;br/&gt;construct robust, mechanistically-accurate numerical models of Southern Ocean&lt;br/&gt;ecosystems and biogeochemistry. This project also will make educational contributions&lt;br/&gt;at several levels, through the direct involvement of graduate and undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;students in laboratory research, and through planned outreach activities aimed at K-12&lt;br/&gt;students and the general public, including lecture presentations in Bermuda and South&lt;br/&gt;Carolina, and the development of web materials in consultation with a group of K-12&lt;br/&gt;science teachers.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
