<AbstractNarration>In this research supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, Professors  Buratto, Bowers, and Metiu and their groups will prepare, characterize, and test three new types of nanoscale catalysts, having one feature in common: very small, isolated, well-defined, catalytically active sites.  They will prepare and study (a) very small Aun and Agn mass-selected clusters supported on oxide, (b) very small mass-selected, binary clusters such as PdmAun supported on oxides, and (c) very small, mass-selected oxide clusters supported on oxides.  A variety of techniques will be used, in a concerted manner, to study these important catalytic processes: model catalytic systems will be prepared by depositing mass-selected clusters on oxide surfaces to ensure atom-by-atom control of catalyst size; all samples will be prepared and studied in ultra-high vacuum by surface science techniques (AES, XPS) as well as by STM/ AFM before, during and after the catalytic chemistry; and density functional theory (DFT) will be used to calculate the structure of the clusters, their XPS spectrum and their chemical activity. Through the work proposed here they will develop a detailed understanding of the catalytic chemistry of these materials and find out how this chemistry depends on size, composition and the nature of the substrate.  While the focus of the research is on the catalytic activity of specific nanoscale catalysts, there is a high probability that the results will be applicable to other systems.  In addition, it is hoped that the concepts developed through this research will help optimize important industrial processes using these nanoscale catalysts and provide insight into the discovery of new nanoscale catalytic materials.&lt;br/&gt;The research funded by this grant will be interdisciplinary.  Graduate students will interact continuously with three different research groups, will have daily contact with other outstanding scientists, and will acquire hands-on experience in a large number of techniques of surface science, gas-phase chemistry, scanned probe microscopy, and high level theory.  The research will provide a valuable opportunity for graduate education, found in very few places in the world.  Researchers supported by this grant (including PIs) will also be active in outreach to K-12 schools in the Santa Barbara area to present a tutorial on an atomistic view of heterogeneous catalysis and to show an atomically-resolved picture of our model catalyst systems.  This will be included in the currently active outreach program in the chemistry department at UCSB.  A series of lectures on catalysis by nanostructures will be developed and included as part of a course in nanoscience currently taught in the materials chemistry curriculum. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes for NSF CHE-079489  A large number of industrial processes use nanometer-size clusters (both metal and metal oxide) supported on oxide surfaces to perform reactions that would not take place, or would be commercially unsuccessful if performed on the bulk material.  In research supported by this grant Profs. Michael T. Bowers, Horia Metiu and Steven K. Buratto of the University of California, Santa Barbara have utilized state-of-the-art experimental and theoretical methods to study the catalytic activity of well-defined nanocluster catalysts in exquisite detail and have further enhanced the understanding of the catalytic chemistry at the atomic level.  In order to carry out this research, we have designed and constructed a unique, highly versatile apparatus which allows us to produce mass-selected nanoclusters of both metals (Aun, Agn, Pdn, Vn; n is known) and metal oxides (VxOy; x and y are known) in the gas phase and then deposit these size-selected nanoclusters onto a clean surface of rutile TiO2(110) in ultra-high vacuum (UHV).    These well-defined nanocluster catalysts were then characterized using the normal array of surface science methods and, in addition, we utilized UHV scanning tunneling microscopy (UHV-STM) to image the size and shape of the nanoclusters with atomic resolution.  By comparing our UHV-STM images with structures calculated using density functional theory (DFT) we were able to determine the exact binding site of the nanocluster on the surface, the position of all the atoms in the nanocluster relative to the surface and the binding energy of the nanocluster to the surface.  The chemistry of our size-selected nanocluster catalysts was then probed in UHV using temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and temperature-programmed reaction (TPR) spectroscopy.  We deposited, for the first time, mass-selected Vx and VxOy clusters on rutile TiO2(110)-(1&times;1) in ultra high vacuum (UHV), imaged the resulting cluster-decorated surfaces with UHV-STM and compared the images with DFT.  The comparison allowed us to build a structural model of the various vanadium and vanadium oxide particles on TiO2(110) at the atomic level.  In addition, we showed that H2O interacts with VO adsorbed on a TiO2(110) surface by combination of STM, TPD and DFT.  We found that the pre-adsorbed VO clusters enabled H2O molecules to be adsorbed at room temperature to the TiO2(110) surface, anchored by the VO and a binding energy of 1.09 eV according to DFT.  Perhaps the most interesting thing regarding water adsorption to the VO-decorated surface is that it is unique.  Water does not bind at room temperature to any of the other vanadium or vanadia clusters that we have studied (V1, V2 or VO2). This effect is an illustrative example of how the chemistry of the supported metal oxide depends on the composition of the cluster even to the point where every atom counts.  We have studied the catalytic activity of our very small VxOy mass-selected clusters supported on single crystal TiO2(110) surfaces in the oxidative dehydrogenation of methanol to formaldehyde.  We do not observe formaldehyde production from the bare, oxidized TiO2(110) surface or the VO-covered TiO2(110) surface, suggesting that neither of these surfaces is catalytically active for methanol oxidation.  If, however, we oxidize the VO-covered TiO2(110) surface by heating to 540K in 2x10-6 torr of O2 the surface becomes catalytically active.  It is also possible to oxidize deposited V atoms or deposited VO2 clusters in the same way to produce a catalytically active surface with a formaldehyde signal similar to that observed for oxidized VO.  It is interesting that V, VO and VO2 are not catalytically active, but can be made catalytically active by post oxidation.  Theory predicts that for isolated vanadium oxide clusters on the surface, the most thermodynamically stable form and the active catalyst is VO3. This prediction is consistent with our results so far sinc...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
