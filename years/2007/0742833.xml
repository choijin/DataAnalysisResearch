<AbstractNarration>This project will investigate the mechanisms that create behavioral differences in responsiveness to testosterone.  These differences exist at multiple levels even in a single species, including behavioral function, the size of muscles, and parts of the nervous system that generate the behaviors.  For example, in green anole lizards, this hormone facilitates reproductive behaviors in males more so than in females, and within males to a greater degree in the breeding than during the non-breeding season.  Testosterone also increases the sizes of some reproductive structures, but not others, and among those it affects, the response is greatest during the breeding season.  Experiments are designed to test the ideas that these differences in anatomy and behavior are due to one or more specific factors, including the availability of a priming hormone, estradiol, in the brain, and the expression of one or more of four specific genes.   Thus, behavioral, anatomical, hormonal and molecular approaches are used to enhance the understanding of what determines whether and to what degree a hormone will act.  This work will provide novel information on this basic biological phenomenon, which is not yet sufficiently understood, in part because the lizards to be used provide a uniquely large set of structures and functions across which the information can be carefully integrated.  Since very little work of this kind is conducted in reptiles, it will also provide a new comparative, evolutionary perspective.  The research is conducted by students at multiple career stages: undergraduates, graduate students and postdoctoral students, under direct mentorship of the Principal Investigator.  At present, all of these individuals are women, thus impacting future generations of scientists and these woman, in turn, will be role models for other women in the neurosciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Steroid hormones are critical for reproduction across vertebrate species.  Testosterone, in particular, regulates masculine behaviors; often a seasonal rise in the level of this hormone will activate courtship and copulation as well as induce changes in related neural and peripheral morphology and the biochemical function of the brain.  In some cases, differences between the sexes and seasons is affected by more than just available levels of testosterone.  In addition, the specific mechanisms through which testosterone exerts these functions are not fully clear.   The studies in this funded project were designed to elucidate factors contributing to differential responsiveness to testosterone in anole lizards.  Among other mechanisms, the experiments investigated relative levels of the receptors which confer activity to both testosterone and one of its primary metabolites, estradiol.   They also targeted co-activators of these receptors, which facilitate their function.  Finally, the potential changes in levels of the receptors and coactivators due to circulating hormone levels were investigated.  A variety of effects of sex, season (breeding vs. non-breeding season) and hormone manipulation were detected across these molecules, which contributed to our understanding of sex differences and seasonal changes in their expression across the brain and peripheral reproductive structures.  However, a full understanding of the regulation of responsiveness to testosterone requires further evaluation.  Undergraduate and graduate students, as well as postdoctoral researchers participated in this work.  They learned concepts and skills associated with the scientific questions, and were mentored in various aspects of career development.    Members of the laboratory have also engaged in outreach programs in local elementary schools, a museum, library, and science fairs with the goal of getting children, particularly girls, excited about the questions we are addressing and the scientific process more generally.
