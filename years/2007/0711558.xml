<AbstractNarration>Brittle fault zones undergo continual wear of fault surfaces during slip, which&lt;br/&gt;leads to a continuous variation in fault surface roughness and a progressive increase in&lt;br/&gt;the thickness of the fault gouge zone with net slip. The dynamic changes in gouge zone&lt;br/&gt;features may affect fault frictional strength, stability, and earthquake characteristics.&lt;br/&gt;Although previous field, laboratory, and numerical studies have made significant&lt;br/&gt;progress in investigating the geometrical and physical properties of fault gouge zones and&lt;br/&gt;their effects on fault zone frictional and mechanical behavior, these results still provide&lt;br/&gt;limited understanding of the complete process of gouge zone development under a wide&lt;br/&gt;range of geological settings, and how these materials might affect the earthquake cycle.&lt;br/&gt;Recent modifications to the Distinct Element Method (DEM), including addition&lt;br/&gt;of interparticle bonding and breakage, allows us to model the fracture process of cohesive&lt;br/&gt;rocks, and makes it possible to directly observe gouge accumulation and modification,&lt;br/&gt;mimicking natural fault zone deformation. 2-D DEM simulations of gouge evolution&lt;br/&gt;have successfully reproduced many observations in the field and laboratory, yielding&lt;br/&gt;interesting findings that have not been reported in previous gouge zone studies. These&lt;br/&gt;include stages of gouge zone development and their dependence on shear displacement,&lt;br/&gt;normal stress, and rock strength. These encouraging results suggest the feasibility,&lt;br/&gt;necessity, and importance of improving numerical models and extending the current&lt;br/&gt;studies into the future.&lt;br/&gt;This proposal describes a program to simulate the dynamic processes of gouge&lt;br/&gt;zone evolution, focused on constraining the relationships between gouge thickness, grain&lt;br/&gt;size distribution, shear zone strength, and surface roughness. We will use much larger&lt;br/&gt;assemblages that will allow a wider range of surface and particles sizes and geometries,&lt;br/&gt;and conduct these simulations in parallel on the new Rice Cray XD1 supercomputer.&lt;br/&gt;Results of these numerical experiments will help in interpreting observations of more&lt;br/&gt;complex natural faults, leading to an improved understanding of fault zone processes.&lt;br/&gt;The work will support training of a postdoctural associate, undergraduates, and provide &lt;br/&gt;enhanced 3D codes of fault gouge evolution to the community. Understanding how fault zones&lt;br/&gt;deform can help improve understanding of how faults slip and thus earthquake hazards.</AbstractNarration>
