<AbstractNarration>Teresa V. Orenic, Principal Investigator&lt;br/&gt;Proposal 0749574, "Generation of morphological diversity among the legs of the Drosophila adult."&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Animals and plants are complex structures composed of myriad cell types organized into tissues, organs and organ systems.  How this organization is generated during embryonic development, a process called pattern formation, is a central issue in the field of developmental biology.  To address this issue, the mechanisms that control development of the nervous system of the adult fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, will be investigated.  Drosophila is a model system that has provided much insight into the genetic and molecular basis of animal development.  The specific focus of this project is on a genetic and molecular characterization of the function of a member of the Hox gene family, which encodes proteins that have a general role in generating the body plan of all animals, from flies to humans.  Although Hox gene function in development of some organs has been extensively investigated, little is known about the function of these genes in development of the nervous system.  This research will provide insight into this issue, which is of key importance to human health, since the genetic and molecular mechanisms controlling development are conserved between Drosophila and vertebrates.  Furthermore, disrupted function of Hox genes is associated with human genetic disorders and cancers.  Hence, detailed genetic and molecular studies of the role of these genes in Drosophila development have and should continue to provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying human development and genetic diseases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research will be conducted at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC).  UIC is an urban campus with a diverse student population. Both minority and nonminority undergraduate and graduate students have and will participate in research in the P.I.'s laboratory. Other efforts to broaden the impact of the P.I.'s research include visits to local elementary schools to give presentations on genetics and DNA, and judging of local science fairs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The body plan of most animals includes repeated structures, such limbs, vertebrate and digits, which are similar in form, but have distinguishing features that adapt them for specific functions.  In animal embryos, common mechanisms are utilized to control development of repeating structures, raising the question of how differences among them are generated.  It is known that in most animals, including humans, a group of genes, called the homeotic or Hox genes, function to modify the mechanisms that control development of repeating structures to produce variations among them. This work addressed the regulation and function of a Hox gene called Scr, which generates variations in patterns among the legs of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster.  Drosophila is ideally suited as model system to investigate the function of Hox genes due to features such as a short life cycle and the availability of many genetic and molecular tools specific to this system.   Additionally, the genes and proteins that control development in Drosophila, including the Hox genes, are conserved in humans, have similar functions in development and Hox gene mutations are associated with human developmental disorders and diseases.     Development requires precise spatial and temporal control of gene expression, the process through which information encoded by the DNA that comprises a gene is used to make a gene product, an RNA or a protein. Drosophila leg development is controlled by networks of proteins that function to regulate expression of genes, such as the Hox gene, Scr.  Our previous studies have shown that Scr expression and function is required for development of a group mechanosensory organs that are found specifically on one of the three leg pairs of the Drosophila adult, the T1 legs.  The research supported by this grant focused on understanding the function of Scr in sense organ development and on identifying the proteins, in particular signaling proteins or transcription factors (TF), and DNA elements (enhancers) that control Scr expression in regions of the T1 leg that will give to the T1 leg-specific sense organs. We identified multiple signaling pathways and transcription factors that control Scr expression along the three legÆs three axes.  For example, we determined that the conserved Distal-less and Dachshund TFs are essential for activating Scr expression, while the Engrailed TF turns off Scr gene expression to define the limits of its expression domain.
