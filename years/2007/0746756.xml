<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kevin M. Folta&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number IOS-0746756&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In plants, light is commonly recognized as the driving force of photosynthesis. However, light has another important role as an environmental signal, informing the state of the plant's immediate surroundings.  Plants maintain a set of sensitive sensors that monitor ambient light, adjusting plant form and function to best meet the prevailing conditions. In this way plants continually adapt to the changing environment, ranging from changes in gene expression to large-scale re-orientation of leaves and stems. These various responses develop in response to different light qualities, mainly red and blue light.  However, green light has historically been shown to have minor effects that contribute to this process.  Over the past several years research has demonstrated several specific effects of green illumination that are contrary to those affected by red or blue light. This project seeks to complement and expand ongoing efforts in photomorphogenesis (light mediated plant development) by further characterizing green light responses in the model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana.  Preliminary data show an effect on chloroplast response to red or far-red light, the rate of flowering, stem elongation, shade avoidance symptoms and a suite of other visible changes. The activities herein carefully characterize these physiological processes to great resolution, pinpointing the timing and context of green light contributions to plant growth. A photobiological component attempts to describe the specific light qualities that define the light sensor, helping to guide candidate gene studies. Finally a genetic approach analyzes the potential mechanisms that transduce the green light signal. These activities will guide discovery of green light sensing components and aid the characterization of an additional system that controls plant growth and development. These experimental objectives are complemented by an ambitious graduate student driven outreach component that brings the principles of photomorphogenesis to the K-12 classroom.  Selected classrooms will receive an LED-based light system, along with seeds and mutants to characterize for light responses. The data will be reported to www.respondingtotherainbow.com, a website housing the information and data relative to this project. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

Many say that the chlorophyll in the leaves absorbs blue and red, and green is just reflected to our eye, that's why plants appear green.   However, there is a lot of data from the 1960s that shows that green light can have specific effects, and our laboratory has characterized some of them in seedlings.  It is also possible to test the effect of green light and green light sensing systems in the plant by using LED light.  LEDs emit precise colors, so it is possible to test how plants respond to specific light qualities alone and in combination. We found something truly curious.   We would expect that if more visible light was applied to plants, they would grow as if they were in brighter conditions. That's not what we see with addition of green light. As showin in Figure 1, it is clear that more green light makes the plant take on a look like it is in the shade. This is typified by leaves that point up, and the petiole (the narrow "leaf stem") elongates.  This is done in nature so the plants can reach above neighbors.   This finding is highly counterintuitive. More light leads to an increasingly shaded response.    The work then went on to understand the genes that play a role in the response.  We were able to show that the known red, blue and far-red light sensors were not required for the response. That means there is another recenptor that is needed to sense the green light.    Another published paper showed the interaction between red, blue and green light in seedling development.  The results showed that green light was only relevant when blue and red light signals were very low. This means that green light is tuning growth under low light conditions.   We also learned that green light could induce processes that mimic a response to very dim blue light.  That's no surprise, as even good LEDs have tiny amounts of blue light.  We showed that a common blue light receptor called phototropin could make seedlings grow in counterintuitive ways at very low intensiities.    In our Broader Impacts we illustrated these principles to many classrooms and other demonstrations usign NSF-funded LED light sources.  These are still in use years later and are currently in use in science fair projects and classrooms.  Their availabiltiy has led to additional projects that teach children about the role of light in plant growth and pigmentation.   Overall the project taught us a lot about the spectrum and how different components shape how plants grow and develop.  The work expands our understanding of plant biology, but also informs design of artificial environments for plant growth, such as those used in space, or in vertical farms now popular in abandoned city buildings.  The work also trained two graduate students in photobiology and science communication.           Last Modified: 10/14/2017       Submitted by: Kevin M Folta]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
