<AbstractNarration>The objective of the program is to provide an opportunity for eight carefully selected undergraduate students to learn firsthand the nature of mathematical research. The participants will conduct independent&lt;br/&gt;investigations, under the guidance of experienced researchers, on problems in combinatorics and number theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Duration: mid June - mid August 2008-2010; Stipend: $3550.&lt;br/&gt;Allowances: Travel up to $500; living expenses $1500; cost of on-campus apartment housing.&lt;br/&gt;Deadline for applications: mid  February each year.&lt;br/&gt;Exact dates and more information is available at the program web page.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.</AbstractNarration>
