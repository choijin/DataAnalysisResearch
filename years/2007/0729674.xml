    <AbstractNarration>ECCS-0729674&lt;br/&gt;R. Linke, IEEE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this proposal is to broaden the participation of student presenters at the 18th Annual Workshop on Interconnections within High-Speed Digital Systems. The purpose of the Workshop is to determine the interconnection requirements of emerging and future computer and communications systems and to disseminate information about state-of-the art optical and electrical interconnection technologies at the component, packaging, and systems level. The workshop is "invited talks only", attended by experts in electrical and photonic interconnects. Through this format student poster presenters are given a chance to be in close interaction, learn from and showcase their own work to the top experts in the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To achieve a broader impact on young scientists, in this project proposal, travel support is requested for student participants from the U.S. The highly interdisciplinary and interactive format of this Workshop also offers a great educational benefit to student participants training them to provide the next generation of high performance interconnection solutions and to learn to think creatively in a team environment (in one of the problem sessions of our workshop, discussing the workshop problem statement with top experts in the field). The travel support will particularly help bring the diversity to the student body at the workshop, by enabling students from remote states like Puerto Rico and Hawaii, and also minority colleges to cover part of the travel cost to Santa Fe where the workshop is located.</AbstractNarration>
