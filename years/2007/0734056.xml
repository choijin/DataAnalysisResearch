<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: This project will impact the capacity of the formal education community to act as a vehicle for female students to enter careers in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). An Extension Services Group (ESG) of gender equity in STEM research and practice experts will provide consulting and professional development services to state extension agent teams. State Teams will include: education professionals that provide technical assistance, professional development and pre-service education to high school and community college administrators, faculty and staff; community-based organizations (CBO's) serving women and girls in the state; and leaders of statewide professional organizations committed to involving females in secondary and postsecondary STEM education. It is the conscious intent of the composition of the State Teams to include both formal and informal educational partners in an attempt to bridge and connect the efforts being made in both arenas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Throughout the project's life, thirteen State Teams will be trained to provide extension services to local education (LEA) and CBO staff to implement an institutional change process. The institutional change process includes five steps: 1) Analyze existing data; 2) Identify root causes; 3) Choose best strategies; 4) Implement selected strategies; 5) Evaluate. The ESG's training for State Teams will include (1) an annual seminar where best practices will be shared and State Teams will receive training in the institutional change process and research-based strategy implementation; (2) professional development webcasts on data analysis for program improvement, effective strategies, exemplary programs, "how to" topics, and equitable instructional strategies using Generating Expectations for Student Achievement (Graymill Consulting, undated); (3) a web-based Virtual Learning Community where the National Advisory Board, the ESG, State Teams and local educators can form common-interest-based learning communities and chat rooms, network electronically via a listserve, post relevant documents, archive webcasts, and participate in online courses and tutorials; (4) on going consulting with State Teams by ESG consultants. The ESG will compile existing comprehensive research literature reviews and identify and evaluate exemplary projects, research-based learning tools, pedagogical approaches, and service or support programs into a Best Practices Handbook to be used by State Teams for effective extension services with local educators. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Training State Teams to provide extension services that support the institutional change process will lead to the implementation of strategic solutions that are supported by research and adapted to each institution's situation. The process is focused on training State Teams to work with local educators to systematically examine and understand what is causing barriers for females to participate in STEM Career Cluster programs and the related academic STEM courses. The process will ensure that State Teams will invest time and effort in providing consulting, professional development and technical assistance that implement improvement strategies that will achieve results. The ESG is committed to disseminating the projects results through its extensive national networks.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The National Alliance for Partnerships in Equity Education FoundationÆs (NAPEEF) STEM Equity Pipeline&trade; works with teams of high school and college partners to implement a data driven decision making program improvement process (the Program Improvement Process for Equity in STEM - PIPESTEM&trade;) focused on increasing the participation of women and girls in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) related programs of study at the high school and community college level.   NAPEEF believes that if women, underrepresented minorities and persons with disabilities were prepared to work in STEM careers in proportion to their current workforce engagement, high-tech labor demands could be met, US global competiveness would improve, global challenges could be better addressed, and womenÆs economic power would increase, leading to stronger families and communities.   Since 2008 the STEM Equity Pipeline has been providing high quality professional development, technical assistance and consulting at the national, state and local level.
