<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to use coordinated turbine control to maximize the energy that a wind farm extracts from the wind.  The approach is to develop a simulation model of the aerodynamic interaction among turbines on a wind farm and then to design an advanced controller to increase overall wind farm energy capture.  The controller will then be tested using the simulation model.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the research includes both the simulation model development and the controller development.  Many tools exist that allow for testing controls on individual turbines, but the contribution of the simulation model in this research is to provide a test bed for wind farm controllers.  The energy-maximizing controller will be designed, tested on the simulation model, and compared to the baseline uncoordinated wind farm control.  A hybridized combination of Iterative Feedback Tuning and Iterative Learning Control will be used.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;The first, most obvious broader impact of the proposed research is improved efficiency of existing wind farms, which will provide both environmental and economic benefits.  Also, engineering projects with a perceived socially responsible focus help to attract and retain talented young engineering students; young women, especially, tend to be drawn toward socially-responsible fields.  This research, led by a female Principle Investigator, should help in this endeavor by providing research and classroom opportunities.  The project will support a graduate research assistant, and the simulation model will be made available for use in control systems and wind energy courses.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
