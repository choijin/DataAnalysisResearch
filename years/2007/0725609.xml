<AbstractNarration>ECCS-0725609&lt;br/&gt;Marc Achermann, University of Massachusetts Amherst&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;Progress in most photonic devices aims at increased functionality, higher speed, and reduced dimensions. Metal nanostructures represent a novel approach for manipulating light on a sub-wavelength length scale. They allow waveguiding in the form of surface bound optical excitations (surface plasmons) that significantly confine light. Moreover, they exhibit morphology controlled resonances that lead to strong field enhancements and non-linear effects. A team at UMass Amherst will establish a femtosecond photon scanning tunneling microscope for studying propagation phenomena of ultrafast plasmon pulses in metallic nanostructures with simultaneous femtosecond-scale time and nanometer-scale spatial resolution. Important insight into dispersion properties of both passive and active plasmonic devices will be gained. Structures of interest include passive components (waveguides, dividers and mirrors) and active devices (modulators and amplifiers) that will be fabricated by combining metal nanostructures with semiconductor nanocrystals. With this project the UMass team will provide essential information for the design and development of metal nanostructures with well-designed properties that enable their integration in nanoscale functional optical devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact: &lt;br/&gt;Understanding plasmon propagation in metal nanostructures is a prerequisite for implementing such structures into plasmonic devices. The focus of this program is the investigation of ultrafast plasmon propagation and dispersion properties of test structures that are highly interesting for plasmonic circuits and opto-electronic technologies and can even affect other technologies, for example optical biosensors. The findings could result in sensors with increased sensitivities enabled by new sensing schemes that take advantage of field-enhancement effects in plasmonic nanostructures. The collaborative research will involve graduate and undergraduate students who will be introduced to the fascinating world of femtoseconds and nanometers concurrent with UMass educational program in nanoscience and nanotechnology. As part of this program, the UMass team will provide an introduction to research to talented minority undergraduates of those population groups currently underrepresented in science, technology, engineering or mathematics fields.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
