<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;Oomycete plant pathogens, such as those from the genus Phytophthora, cause destructive diseases of an enormous variety of crop and non-crop plant species. Forests and native ecosystems have been devastated by broad host range Phytophthora species such as Ph.cinnamomi and the newly emerged pathogen of California's oak forests, P. ramorum. The potato pathogen Ph. infestans was responsible for the Irish potato famine in the 19th century. Superficially, Phytophthora pathogens resemble fungi, but they in fact belong to a group called oomycetes that are most closely related to algae such as kelp and diatoms. Hence conventional fungal control measures often fail against these pathogens. Since these organisms have evolved the ability to attack plants independently of other pathogens such as fungi, they may have developed novel means of attacking their hosts. This project, which will also be funded by the USDA/CSREES, will create a comprehensive genetic resource for oomycete pathogens by creating a high quality DNA sequence of the soybean pathogen Phytophthora sojae. The Ph. sojae sequence will be integrated with a draft sequences for five other oomycete pathogens, Ph. ramorum, Ph.infestans, the pepper and cucurbit pathogen Ph. capsici, the downy mildew Hyaloperonospora parasitica, and the broad host range opportunistic pathogen Pythium ultimum. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will greatly advance understanding of the genetics, biochemistry, evolution and pathology of this destructive group of pathogens and will facilitate the development of improved disease control measures. A network of predominantly undergraduate institutions will be involved in interpreting the genome sequences, providing exciting opportunities for undergraduates to experience the excitement of exploring the cutting edges of biology.</AbstractNarration>
