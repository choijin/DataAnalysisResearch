<AbstractNarration>The asymmetry term affects nearly every macroscopic property of the neutron star.  A long-term goal of the proposed program is to extend current understanding of the density dependence of the nuclear asymmetry energy to higher densities.  In doing so, understanding of the macroscopic properties of neutron stars deeper into the core of the star will be achieved.  The program combines multiple approved experiments with development of apparatus for future measurements via an international collaboration.  By the end of the program period, a number of problems pertaining to the density dependence of the asymmetry term of the nuclear equation-of-state (EOS) at densities equal to the nuclear saturation density and below will have been solved.  In addition to this, the measurement of the high-density (greater than normal nuclear density) behavior of the asymmetry term of the nuclear EOS will be approached.  This program will be integrated with a strong international collaboration to establish high-level experimentation at world-class facilities to explore the isospin dependence of the EOS at densities greater than and less than the nuclear saturation density.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several strong collaborations will be engaged in this research; these are existing collaborations with the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory, the National Astronomical Observatory in Mitaka, Japan, Washington University in St. Louis, and RIKEN in Tokyo, Japan.  The proposed program provides training for students (graduate and undergraduate) in an environment that integrates research and teaching.  At any given time during the program, at least one undergraduate and one graduate student will be employed.  Students will be expected to participate in the experimental program at all levels including construction of apparatus, participation in large-scale experiments, and data analysis.  This training will contribute to the next generation of physicists in a field important to radiation detection, education, American competitiveness, and national security.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Neutron stars are sometimes thought of as the largest atomic nuclei in nature.  Their densities range from nearly that of terrestrial lead on the surface to as much as ten times the density of atomic nuclei in the center.   They are held together by gravity, and they are supported by nuclear forces.  Since they are almost entirely neutrons, they consist of what is known as very asymmetric nuclear matter.  Thus, the forces that keep them from collapsing into black holes is a special term in the nuclear force equations known as the asymmetry term.    This "asymmetry term" has been studied experimental using collisions between atomic nuclei.  How protons and neutrons are emitted in these collisions tells us something about the magnitude of the asymmetry term.  Currently, our experimentation has been limited to the low density region, which is relevant for the top kilometer of the neutron star, which is about 10 km in diameter.  However, we are currently planning experiments to now study neutron-rich nuclear matter at higher densities.  In doing so, we probe deeper into the neutron star.  For densities less than normal nuclear density, we found that the forces that cause nuclear matter to maintain equal numbers of neutrons and protons is relatively strong.  However, at higher densities that are relevant to neutron stars, this relationship may reverse (if the trend that we think exists continues).  If this is true, then neutron stars may be smaller than originally thought, as they will only become so large before collapsing into black holes.  During the course of this project, roughly seven undergraduate physics majors have been employed.  Several of these have already gone on to graduate school.  At least four graduate students have also worked on this project.  One of these has received a M.S. in physics, and the other has received a Ph.D.    In addition, several community outreach activities have been engaged.  These include tours and field trips for local high-schools and elementary school students in order to get them excited and enthusiastic about science and careers in science.  These informal outreach activities have been very successful.  Finally, an easy-to-understand summary of one of the primary experiments performed in this project can be found at:   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbts8xLuD-4       Last Modified: 06/19/2011       Submitted by: Michael A Famiano]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
