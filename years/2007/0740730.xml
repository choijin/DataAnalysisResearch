    <AbstractNarration>This STTR Phase I research proposal will develop novel Nanocomposite Cathode Materials (NCM) that will significantly improve the performance of Lithium-Sulfur (Li/S) batteries in terms of cycle life. The superior properties of the proposed NCMs will be achieved via formation of stabilized sulfur nano phases in a conductive matrix. During this project the company will prepare the novel NCM electrodes via a low-cost approach. The NCMs will be structurally characterized and the nanocomposite electrodes will be electrochemically evaluated. The proposed technology will result in lighter, smaller, more powerful, safer, and cost-effective rechargeable lithium-based batteries that will have a great impact on the performance of commercial and military devices and equipment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Lithium (Li) / Sulfur (S) battery is a promising power source for many civilian and military applications due to the extremely high energy density, low-cost, and low environmental impact. However, the performance of the current batteries is hampered heavily by their poor cycle life and fast capacity fade due to the poor electrochemical stability and low electrical and ionic conductivity of the current sulfur electrodes. The potential for commercialization of a rechargeable battery with good performance, safety, and manufacturability is extremely high. The market includes cell phones, video cameras, laptop computers, tools, and other consumer products.</AbstractNarration>
