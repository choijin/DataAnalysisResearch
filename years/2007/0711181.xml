<AbstractNarration>The age and uplift history of the Sierra Nevada are currently the subjects of geologic debate The goal of this research project is to characterize the landscape evolution of the central Sierra Nevada over a time period of tens of millions of years by using Cenozoic volcanic and sedimentary rocks in order to determine linkages of volcanism and faulting to tectonic events through a three-fold research effort. First, detailed mapping, sedimentary facies analysis, and dating of Tertiary strata preserved in paleochannels are being used to understand the evolution of the central Sierran landscape and how it compares with that of the rest of the range. These paleochannels had their headwaters in central Sierra Nevada, and material within them was transported westward to the present-day Sacramento Valley. Strata preserved in these paleochannels provide a record of uplift and re-incision events that can be linked to tectonic processes. The research project will test the idea that three episodes of Cenozoic uplift may have occurred in the central Sierra and the timing of these may correspond to the: (1) onset of arc magmatism about15 million years ago, (2) onset of Basin and Range faulting about10 million years ago, and (3) arrival of the triple junction about 6 million years ago. Second, structural mapping and dating of volcanic-volcaniclastic and intrusive rocks are being used to determine the inception age of range-front faulting in the central Sierra Nevada, its nature, and whether it proceeded continuously or episodically. Much of the present-day to Quaternary displacement between the Sierra Nevada block and the rest of the Great Basin is being taken up along the western edge of the Walker Lane belt (an approximately 150 km wide complex system of dominantly right-lateral strike slip faults that currently accommodates about 20-25% of the Pacific-North America plate motion) in the range-front faults of the Sierra Nevada. Third, Neogene volcanic and intrusive rocks centers in the central Sierra Nevada are bieing investigated to understand the paleogeographic and tectonic evolution of the Tertiary Ancestral Cascades arc. In particular, the project will explore the idea that three phrases of volcanism may have occurred in the ancestral Cascades arc of the Sierra Nevada: at about 14-15 million years ago, 9-10 million years ago, and 6-7 million years ago.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sierra Nevada is the longest and tallest mountain chain in the coterminous U.S. It has also long been considered to be among the youngest, with uplift through Late Cenozoic tilting of a rigid block about faults along its eastern margin. More recent research, however, has proposed a more complex uplift history for the Sierra Nevada, and some have argued that the range is very old. Additionally, the Sierra Nevada is considered the prototype of a fundamental process in mountain building, accomplished by foundering of lithosphere into the Earth's mantle (root delamination). This research project will provide new data that will contribute to the understanding of this important mountain range and help resolve some of these controversies. Furthermore, results will inform the history of faulting in a heavily populated area of active seismicity, the Reno-Bridgeport area. Finally, the project will engage students in scientific research and will foster participation of underrepresented groups in the earth sciences.</AbstractNarration>

Regional-scale work supported by this project shows that the leading tip of Walker Lane trantension is marked by large arc volcanic centers sited in trantensional stepovers; these include the ~11.5 &ndash; 9 Ma Sierra Crest - Little Walker volcanic center; north of that, the ~6.3 &ndash; 4.8 Ebbetts Pass volcanic center; and north of that, the active Lassen volcanic center.
