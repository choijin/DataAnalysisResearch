<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Oregon Museum of Science and Industry (OMSI) will create a 5,000 sq ft traveling exhibition designed to engage families with children ages 10-14 with concepts of algebra. Access Algebra will increase visitor awareness of the role of algebra in everyday life and help them to develop algebraic thinking skills. This exhibition will travel to 21 science centers, reaching some 3.5 million visitors on its national tour. It will be accompanied by an Educator's Guide, Family Guide, and complementary web activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Access Algebra incorporates testing and implementation of an innovative model for professional development for museum exhibit, program, and interpretive staff.  It links the exhibition tour to training at each venue designed to increase knowledge of algebra concepts and to develop facilitation skills in family math learning. The package includes workshops, training DVD, printed guide, Math Toolkit, and website support.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project partners include TERC, Oregon State University College of Education (OSU), and Blazer Boys &amp; Girls Club (BBGC).  The BBGC members will participate in exhibit development over an extended (12-week) period, helping to create an exhibition that will engage a target audience of underserved low-income youth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The strategic impact of Access Algebra derives from the development and testing of effective strategies for engaging audiences in exhibit-based informal math learning, along with increasing the capacity of the field for facilitating these kinds of experiences through a new model for professional development.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

Whether it is art, music, or engineering, it takes math to meet these creative challenges.

The evaluation of the Access Algebra project identified a number of promising strategies for engaging visitors in algebra and for supporting parents and other caregivers in their roles as facilitators of their childrenÆs learning.

Youth and families in the target audience were involved throughout the development process. The exhibits team at OMSI worked closely with a youth exhibit development team from a local Boys &amp; Girls Club to develop exhibit ideas and concepts for the overall design of the exhibition.     Independent evaluation of the project found that the exhibition was both educationally effective and entertaining. Ninety percent of children in the target age range engaged in algebraic thinking at the exhibits, and overall 95% of respondents surveyed (and 97% of those in the target age range) agreed that they enjoyed their experience.
