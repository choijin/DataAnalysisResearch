<AbstractNarration>This project will continue work devoted to advancing the chemistry of expanded porphyrins and related macrocycles.  While far less well studied than their naturally occurring analogues (e.g., porphyrins), the chemistry of expanded porphyrins has blossomed in recent years, driven in part by an appreciation that such systems have a role to play in exploring aromaticity effects, generating new cation complexing agents, and anion recognition.  In the upcoming funding period, the focus will be on the synthesis of new systems via both rational and combinatorial methods, the use of oligopyrrolic macrocycles as frameworks for the generation of new organometallic and coordination complexes, and the creation of polymeric arrays.  Applications of the resulting materials in molecular recognition will also be explored. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Professor Jonathan L. Sessler of the Department of Chemistry at The University of Texas at Austin.  Professor Sessler's research efforts revolve around the development and study of new pyrrole-based macrocycles for use in medicine, supramolecular chemistry, coordination chemistry, waste remediation and heavy element research.  The present project as formulated will provide new compounds and methods that will help drive various follow-up applications-related studies associated with drug development, nonlinear optics, materials research, waste remediation, and global sustainability.</AbstractNarration>
