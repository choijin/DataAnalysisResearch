<AbstractNarration>Proposal Title: Collaborative Research: Dispersal Limitation as a Primary Factor in   &lt;br/&gt;Determining Ectomycorrhizal Community Structure   &lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of California-Berkeley   &lt;br/&gt;Abstract Date: 12/04/07   &lt;br/&gt;Ectomycorrhizal fungi are obligate mutualists with temperate forest trees such as pines,   &lt;br/&gt;oaks, aspens, and birch. These fungi provide mineral nutrients to the trees in exchange   &lt;br/&gt;for sugars, and trees require them for growth and survival. Following severe   &lt;br/&gt;disturbance such as forest fires or logging, trees need to reestablish their relationships   &lt;br/&gt;with mycorrhizal fungi in order to survive. Prior work has shown that these fungi arrive   &lt;br/&gt;in an ordered sequence, or "succession", after such disturbances. A new model is   &lt;br/&gt;proposed to explain this observed pattern through differences in spore dispersal and   &lt;br/&gt;competitive interactions among mycorrhizal fungi. Four key predictions of this model   &lt;br/&gt;concerning limitations to aerial spore dispersal and effect of tree root density on fungal   &lt;br/&gt;competition will be tested through a combination of field sampling and manipulative   &lt;br/&gt;growth-chamber experiments. The broader impacts of this work are that it will help us   &lt;br/&gt;understand an essential biotic process necessary for tree establishment, and will build a   &lt;br/&gt;foundation of basic ecological knowledge for an important group of understudied   &lt;br/&gt;organisms. Training of graduate and undergraduate students will be an important   &lt;br/&gt;component of this research. In addition this work takes advantage of its location within   &lt;br/&gt;Point Reyes National Seashore by feeding back into management decisions within the   &lt;br/&gt;park and through outreach efforts directed towards public education.   &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award examined how communities of ectomycorrhizal fungi change over time.  We found that the changes in community structure and diversity can be linked to both environmental conditions and interactions amongst the fungi themselves.  It apears that following disturbance, certain fungi are well adpated to living in environments with low root density and limited competition.  As the forests begin to recover, however, those early species are replaced species that are more successful colonizers in areas of high root density and stronger competition.  Our results indicate that, similar to larger organisms such as plants, there appears to be a tradeoff between competition and colonization among ectomycorrhizal fungi.  Future reseach further examining this trade-off in other systems will be important for better understanding the dynamics of belowground fungal communities as well as how forests to respond to disturbance.  The research conducted in this award involved a large number of undergraduate students.  Many have gone onto successful graduate school careers in science.  In addition, the award involved collaboration with high school teachers to develop ways of exposing K-12 students to microbial ecology.  Presentations of the research have been given in multiple venues including professional and amateur societal meetings as well as 10 publications in peer-reviewed journals.
