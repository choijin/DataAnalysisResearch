<AbstractNarration>Research over the past 20 years has shown that trait differences acting after copulation but before the fusion of sperm and egg nuclei, often termed postmating, prezygotic trait differences, play a primary role in reducing gene exchange between populations within a species and between closely related species. The genetic basis of these trait differences is poorly understood and thus, constitutes the primary goal of Marshall and Howard's research plan.  Specifically, the proposed research focuses on identifying the seminal fluid and sperm proteins that differ, whether in abundance or structure, between closely related ground cricket species that are isolated by postmating, prezygotic trait differences.  Once identified, gene silencing technology will be used to evaluate the function of each protein and its influence on preventing or reducing fertilization between species.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Barriers to fertilization have been intensively studied in the Allonemobius socius complex of crickets, providing an excellent model for evaluating the genes and proteins that underlie successful fertilization.  Understanding the genetic basis of fertilization incompatibilities between populations and species can provide insight into a wide-range of topics, including the development of infertility within species (including humans) and the role of sexual selection and sexual conflict in driving the divergence of fertilization proteins.  The project provides training for undergraduate and graduate students and outreach to K-12 schools.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[             What makes species different or one population different from another?  This is a basic question in biology that has many applied consequences for our everyday lives.  For example, many insect species can destroy crops, negatively affect livestock, or carrier diseases that harm Humans.  However, most species of insect are not pests and are needed for healthy crops and global environments.  So, how do we determine which species are pests and which are beneficial or which populations are causing harm and which ones are not?                 The answer to these questions can be found in studying the genetic basis of what defines a species or a distinct population.  More simply, we can use genetic differences to determine which things are or are not different species or to distinguish which populations are causing harm.  To understand these genetic differences, we also have to understand the traits that they influence.  For example, do the genetic differences result in them living in different environments, feeding on different food, or having different reproductive behaviors?  Ultimately, if can identify the genetic differences and traits that define a pest species, and make it different from other species, we can develop ways to control or manage that species.              One of the most fundamental traits in all of life is reproduction.  Moreover, one of the most common ways in which different species are isolated from one another is the inability of males and females from different species to produce offspring.  With this in mind, the main goal of this research was to identify reproductive genes that are different between species and determine if those differences decreased a maleÆs ability to successful fertilize a female or induce her to lay eggs.  We focused on two closely-related species of cricket that are only isolated from one another by these kinds of reproductive traits.  These species provide a nice model because no other kinds of traits or genetic differences contribute to them being different species.  Therefore, if we can understand the genetics of reproductive differences in these species, then we can gain knowledge of genetic differences that influence and control successful reproduction in insects.              Over the course of this research, we found that of the hundreds of reproductive proteins produced by males, only a few dozen are different between species.  However, these differences are sufficient to keep these species from producing many hybrid offspring despite frequent matings and living in the same habitats.  Moreover, we identified one male protein that controls a maleÆs ability to induce a female to lay eggs.  This result is particularly important as this same protein appears to occur in all insects thus making it a potentially new mechanism to control insect populations.  Lastly, the genetic differences we found control traits that range from egg-laying induction to activating sperm once they are in the female reproductive tract.  Therefore, these results not only point to the kinds of traits that define species but provide a wide range of novel control mechanisms that would be species specific &ndash; thus providing an avenue to affect the target pest species, but not other species, if implemented as a control strategy.              As for broader impacts, several undergraduate students and graduate students were trained during this award.  Also, four middle school science teachers were trained how to study genetic differences and how to design these types of experiments.  These teachers also developed curriculum and labs using these techniques that they can do with their sixth to eight grade students.  The hands on experience these teachers gained in my lab will translate into hundreds of middle school students being exposed to genetic research and the importance of such techniques in our everyday lives.
