<AbstractNarration>The Ecological Society of America's project, Strategies for Ecology Education, Development and Sustainability (SEEDS), is designed to increase the participation of underrepresented undergraduate students in the ecological sciences. Annually, the project allows up to 60 students to participate in two intensive field trips lasting 4-7 days, and a SEEDS leadership meeting.  At least one of the field trips will be at an NSF supported Long-Term Ecological Research site. These activities together offer opportunities for students to be exposed to high level field research, as well as to develop practical leadership and project development skills. SEEDS research fellows are also supported to present their preliminary research results at annual leadership meetings. Additionally, SEEDS will develop a program to inform and refer underrepresented students to available principal investigators who obtain REU supplements from NSFs Division of Environmental Biology. The Society will work with program officers in the Division to develop this strategy, which will include listings and searchable databases of REU supplemental opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Exposure to ecological research and subsequent research experience is vital for undergraduates in their decision to pursue a career in science. PIs of the Division?s REU supplements face a major challenge in recruiting underrepresented students. This project will increase the awareness and participation of underrepresented students in ecological research opportunities. Through follow-up SEEDS support, the project will enhance the experience of mentoring among PIs and nurture more students along the ecological career pathway. Over time, SEEDS program activities will foster a more diverse scientific community within environmental biology and help increase the diversity of perspectives and ideas.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Diverse People for a Diverse Science  The SEEDS program &ndash; Strategies for Ecology Education, Diversity and Sustainability  &ndash;  was developed by the Ecological Society of America (ESA) in response to the severe underrepresentation of minorities in ecology. Diverse People for a Diverse Science is the programÆs motto.     Broadening and Nurturing Participation in Science  With funding from the National Science Foundation, SEEDS sponsored 288 undergraduate students from diverse cultural and ethnic backgrounds to nine (9) ecological field trips to field stations around the country, five (5) Leadership Meetings and three (3) half-day field trips between May 2008 &ndash; April 2014. A total of 383 opportunities were filled across these activities.    Of the 288 students, 33% participated in more than one activity, reflecting the nurturing aspect of the SEEDS program as students are invited to move into more advanced levels of engagement. It also served the 2012-2013 cohort of four SEEDS Undergraduate Research Fellows.  SEEDS won the 2006 Presidential Award for Excellence in Science, Mathematics and Engineering Mentoring (PAESMEM).     Impacts of SEEDS  Through the SEEDS program, many students have developed an understanding of the scientific process; gained information about the wide range of career options in ecology and related fields; and confidence in themselves to pursue these careers where they previously had not considered.  The SEEDS program has also developed a community where minority students see others who are just like themselves, passionate about ecology and the sustainability of the world. Before the SEEDS I felt [I was] the only one who had the questions about graduate school, about how [it] is to be in the real world. Now, after it, I feel this is my career and is not easy, requires work and compromise, but it is possible to succeed in the ecology field.  I definitely enjoyed being in the field and conducting our own plant transects. After compiling our data and reaching a conclusion, I felt as if I had finally put the full scientific method to work.  Connecting with other like-minded individuals, inspiration for my future, solidification of my career goals.     The Future of Ecology &ndash; Bridging Science and Society  The SEEDS Leadership Meetings in particular helped empower students to see themselves as the future of the ecology profession and become actively engaged in bridging science and society. Participants are students nominated by faculty advisers from the growing network of autonomous campus ecology chapters affiliated with the SEEDS program, the SEEDS Undergraduate Research Fellows and other students who have shown leadership potential.     Developing Perspectives and Skills to Tackle Real World Issues  Between 2009 and 2014, the Leadership Meetings focused on Action Ecology, Multidisciplinary and Multimedia approaches, Stewardship and Citizenship, intersection of Science and Policy, Recovery and Prevention of Environmental Disasters and Food Security, Food Justice.  A whole generation of scientists are being nurtured in skills beyond field research.  SEEDS students understand the value of the applications of science, the importance of developing skills in policy, media and communications and the ability to engage diverse stakeholders. Already on their own campuses, SEEDS students are leading community projects and education activities. SEEDS students are learning to apply evidence-based science to environmental issues in their communities.  They are also organizing workshops, field trips and symposia at the ESA annual meetings to disseminate their vision, experiences and findings to the scientific community.      A Professional Society Preparing a Creative Workforce  Through SEEDS, ESA is playing a critical role as a professional society in meeting the challenge of promoting the relevance of the ecological sciences to diverse communities and the development of a workforce that embraces diver...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
