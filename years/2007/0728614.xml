<AbstractNarration>This project is increasing the number of professional chemists and biochemists by (1) educating high school students on opportunities in chemical sciences through a number of seeding the pipeline events designed to stimulate interest in the chemical sciences, (2) providing financial support for approximately 48 financially needy students who intend to make chemistry their career, and (3) providing a strong support network for the students during their college career. Recruiting efforts are focusing on a consortium of partner schools having a high proportion of financially needy, minority and first generation students. The project is awarding scholarships of up to $3,000 per year to approximately 30 students majoring in the Chemical Technology Program at two-year regional campuses and up to $7,500 per year to approximately 18 chemistry or biochemistry majors on the main campus. Students on the regional campuses will either complete an A.A.S. degree in Chemical Technology or transfer to the main campus to complete a 4-year degree program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this work lies in its attention to the pipeline issue in science education and the workforce. It is benefiting economically disadvantaged students, many of whom are likely to be from groups that are underrepresented in the sciences. It takes advantage of already established programs at the institution that have excellent track records of minority recruitment.</AbstractNarration>
