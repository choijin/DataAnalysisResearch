<AbstractNarration>2010 Arabidopsis/AFGN Collaborative Project: "An exemplary calcium signaling network in plant abiotic stress responses"&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;US-PI: Sheng Luan, University of California at Berkeley, USA&lt;br/&gt;German-PI: Jorg Kudla, Universitat Munster, Germany&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The calcineurin B-like calcium sensors (CBLs) and their interacting protein kinases (CIPKs), collectively named CBL-CIPK network.  URL where the public can get information on the project: &lt;br/&gt;http://www.uni-muenster.de/Biologie.Botanik/agkudla/kudla.html&lt;br/&gt;Definition of Determining the Function: Recent studies by the investigators uncovered a new family of Ca2+ sensors (CBLs) that target a family of protein kinases (CIPKs), establishing a novel paradigm for Ca2+ signaling in plants. The Luan-Kudla collaborative research supported by NSF and DFG has established an extensive CBL-CIPK network that functions in a number of signaling pathways including responses to abiotic stress, nutrient sensing, and ABA responses. This  research seeks to perform a systems analysis of the mechanisms and functions of CBL-CIPK interaction network and its contribution to the integration and decoding of various calcium signals during abiotic stress responses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The functional analysis results will be shared through the webpage above and publications as the results come along.  Significance: Almost all signal transduction processes in plants involve Ca2+ that serves as a vital second messenger. Understanding how Ca2+ mediates the cellular responses triggered by myriad environmental signals is one of the most important goals for plant biologists in years to come. Besides shedding light on the molecular basis for plant tolerance to environmental stress factors, this research will produce insights into calcium signaling mechanisms with relevance for all eukaryotes, provide novel tools for protein-protein interaction, mutant analyses, and cell biology research in plant biology.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: In addition to contributing to the body of fundamental science, this research will impact society as well as education. The findings made in this research can be applied to crop improvement via ongoing multi-national collaborations in the Luan laboratory. This research is designed to improve the nutrient uptake and stress tolerance of crop plants especially rice that serves as a model for cereals. The research will have an additional effect on undergraduate and graduate education through major courses the PI teaches at Berkeley and through independent research programs in PI's laboratory. The NSF project will also enhance ongoing efforts focused on local high schools to encourage minority students to obtain a higher education and enter biology. Furthermore, the US-Germany collaboration will provide a critical platform for training students and postdocs in international collaboration, a crucial component of education in today's global village atmosphere.</AbstractNarration>
