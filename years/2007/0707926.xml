<AbstractNarration>Yip&lt;br/&gt;0707926&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The investigator concentrates on the mathematical&lt;br/&gt;investigation of surface diffusion, which is a fourth order&lt;br/&gt;geometric evolution.  This motion law is a very useful model in&lt;br/&gt;materials science for phase boundary motions, which appear in&lt;br/&gt;thermal grooving, grain boundary migration, sintering, and many&lt;br/&gt;other instances.  Even though the model was proposed by Mullins&lt;br/&gt;in the 1950s, analysis and understanding of the model is still&lt;br/&gt;far from complete, due to the lack of sufficient mathematical&lt;br/&gt;tools.  Many issues such as existence of solutions, their&lt;br/&gt;qualitative behaviors, and singularity formations are still wide&lt;br/&gt;open.  The project analyzes surface diffusion from a variational&lt;br/&gt;approach, which has proved to be quite versatile for many similar&lt;br/&gt;motion laws.  Questions to be investigated include approximation&lt;br/&gt;and construction of solutions, the analysis of crystalline facet&lt;br/&gt;motions, and the understanding of solutions exhibiting&lt;br/&gt;self-similarity structures.  The outcomes can benefit both the&lt;br/&gt;mathematical and materials science communities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The use of mathematics in the modeling and analysis of&lt;br/&gt;materials science phenomena has become more and more important,&lt;br/&gt;in particular with the current continued outgrowth of&lt;br/&gt;nanotechnology.  The properties of real materials very often are&lt;br/&gt;linked to the presence of inhomogeneity and defects such as phase&lt;br/&gt;boundaries and triple junctions.  Successful understanding of&lt;br/&gt;these structures, especially their dynamical response behavior,&lt;br/&gt;requires intricate mathematical tools.  This project aims to&lt;br/&gt;introduce new mathematical techniques to study phenomena of&lt;br/&gt;surface diffusion that have been proposed and experimentally&lt;br/&gt;observed for a long time, though many questions remain unsettled. &lt;br/&gt;The scientific merit of the project includes a better&lt;br/&gt;understanding of the materials and their response under various&lt;br/&gt;external environments.  The project also provides an excellent&lt;br/&gt;opportunity for interdisciplinary research and educational&lt;br/&gt;activities that can tie together mathematical and engineering&lt;br/&gt;sciences, and graduate students are involved in the work. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
