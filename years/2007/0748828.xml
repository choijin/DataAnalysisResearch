<AbstractNarration>Nonlinear dynamics has historically played a fundamental role in explaining diverse and&lt;br/&gt;complex atomic processes, a role which in turn has stimulated numerous theoretical&lt;br/&gt;advances in classical and quantum chaos. This trend continues as advances in atomic&lt;br/&gt;and optical techniques provide an unprecedented level of control and precision for&lt;br/&gt;experimental studies of chaos in atomic systems. For example, the time evolution of&lt;br/&gt;highly localized initial states (e.g. ultrashort optical pulses, Rydberg wavepackets, and&lt;br/&gt;localized ensembles of ultracold atoms), can be measured as they evolve and disperse&lt;br/&gt;within a chaotic potential, thereby probing the detailed fractal structure in the chaotic&lt;br/&gt;phase space. Such precision tools, however, highlight a fundamental deficiency in&lt;br/&gt;theoretical nonlinear dynamics; there exists no general framework (in the sense of&lt;br/&gt;symbolic dynamics) capable of classifying the diversity of chaotic behavior exhibited by&lt;br/&gt;transport in real physical systems.&lt;br/&gt;The focus of this proposal is twofold: (i) It will exploit new advances in chaotic dynamics&lt;br/&gt;to motivate, guide, and interpret experiments capable of probing chaotic phase space&lt;br/&gt;with unprecedented resolution. These include the chaotic transport, ionization, and&lt;br/&gt;control of Rydberg wavepackets as well as the elucidation of novel chaotic pathways for&lt;br/&gt;the mixing and loss of ultracold atoms in optical traps. (ii) It will develop a nonlinear&lt;br/&gt;dynamics toolbox that can extract an accurate (symbolic dynamics) model for the&lt;br/&gt;structure of chaotic transport in Hamiltonian systems with two degrees of freedom. This&lt;br/&gt;model can be made arbitrarily precise, even for systems exhibiting a mixture of chaos&lt;br/&gt;and regularity. The prior success of ?homotopic lobe dynamics? in describing phase&lt;br/&gt;space transport will serve as a key ingredient of this program. Finally, recognizing the&lt;br/&gt;natural topological extension of homotopic lobe dynamics to higher dimensional spaces,&lt;br/&gt;this proposal will address the challenge of chaotic transport in more than two degrees of&lt;br/&gt;freedom, for which far fewer techniques currently exist.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Classifying chaotic trajectories  Regular, well-behaved mechanical systems are epitomized by the periodic motion of the planets or the regular ticking of a pendulum clock.  However, most mechanical systems are not regular, but are chaotic, having wild and unpredictable trajectories.  Such chaotic systems exist on the scale of our solar system (asteroid dynamics) down to the scale of atoms (electron dynamics).  Much is still unknown about such systems, including a general technique to classify the varied behaviors chaotic trajectories may exhibit.  One of the main successes of this project was the development and implementation of a technique for classifying chaotic trajectories in systems with two degrees of freedom; such systems include, for example, the motion of an atomic electron in applied electric and magnetic fields.  These two-degree-of-freedom systems are difficult to characterize, in part, because their motion can be both chaotic or regular, depending on the initial conditions of the system.  We developed a theoretical foundation (called homotopic lobe dynamics) to classify such trajectories through symbolic labeling.  We also devised a way to partition a system's behavior into qualitatively distinct states.  Finally, we developed a computational toolbox (in Matlab) that automates this classification and partitioning scheme on the computer.  One application that this toolbox can achieve is the labeling and computation of periodic motion of chaotic systems.  Such periodic motion is the starting point for numerous applications in dynamical systems theory and in quantum mechanics.  Turnstile ionization: theory and experiments  Under appropriate conditions, the ionization of an atom occurs via chaotic dynamics.  Such conditions occur, for example, when a highly excited atom is subjected to a series of electromagnetic pulses.  We proposed, and theoretically demonstrated, that this ionization would occur via a chaotic mechanism called a "phase space turnstile".  The turnstile is, in essence, a kind of "trap door" that promotes an electron from a bound to an unbound state.  Collaborating with the atomic research laboratory of Barry Dunning at Rice University, we demonstrated that this turnstile mechanism can be seen experimentally in real potassium atoms.  The turnstile geometry was clearly imprinted on the time-dependence of the ionization behavior.  Importantly, this means that by tailoring the turnstile geometry, one can exert control over the ionization process.  Escape of Bose-Einstein condensates from a chaotic trap  In collaboration with Boaz Ilan, we numerically studied the escape of a small cloud of ultra-cold (technically, Bose-condensed) atoms from a chaotic trap.  The atomic cloud sloshed around in the trap, exhibiting the expected chaotic behavior.  Since the trap had a "hole" in it, some atoms would leak out, creating a very complex time-dependence to the leakage.  We saw fractal structure in this time-dependence, as well as quantum interference effects.  (Fractals are geometric patterns with detailed, fine-scale structure visible at all levels of resolution as one zooms in on the pattern.)  Importantly, we found that attractive interactions between the atoms not only suppressed the quantum interference but also enhanced the fractal resolution.  Reaction fronts in fluid flows  The chaotic dynamics seen in atomic systems is a general phenomenon seen in many other systems, including the motion of fluids like water; this is an indication of the interconnected nature of nonlinear dynamics.  In this spirit, our study of chaos in atomic systems led to a study of chaos in the dynamics of reaction fronts growing outward within a flowing fluid.  This work was inspired by a collaboration with Tom Solomon, an experimental physicist at Bucknell University. Our main achievement in this work was the identification of new geometric structures, called burning invariant manifolds, that form one-way barriers to reaction front p...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
