<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;This proposal focuses on the nonperturbative properties of supersymmetric gauge theories using results from type IIA string theory/M-theory, IIB string theory/supergravity, and Dijkgraaf-Vafa matrix models. The research focuses on the property of 3 and 6 space dimensional branes (membranes) that exist in 10 dimensional Supergravity theories. In order to more thoroughly understand Dirichlet-branes in nontrivial gravitational and B-field backgrounds,  the PI  proposes to characterize the spectrum of D-branes in certain two-dimensional N = 2 superconformal coset model (Kazama-Suzuki) backgrounds, and to establish an isomorphism between the boundary states of certain pairs of models known to be equivalent as bulk theories. The PI also proposes to identify the precise M-theory configurations that correspond to certain four-dimensional N = 2 supersymmetric gauge theories and to use these to compute nonperturbative corrections to the prepotentials of those theories. The PI also plans to employ matrix model techniques to study nonperturbative aspects of the four-dimensional N = 2 supersymmetric gauge theories described above.   The PI has had great success in involving undergraduate students at Bowdoin in research. As part of his research, he will supervise investigations of two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory, an exactly solvable model, with undergraduate students &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant has supported research that is part of an on-going effort by the world-wide community of theoretical elementary particle physicists to develop mathematical models to explain the nature and behavior of the smallest constituents of matter (elementary particles).  More specifically, this research has aimed at achieving a deeper understanding of, and at developing more efficient mathematical tools for calculating the predictions of, existing models of quarks and gluons called "gauge theories."  A second goal of this research has been to demonstrate the existence of heretofore unexpected links between gauge theories on the one hand, and theories that describe the behavior of gravitons, the particles responsible for the force of gravity, on the other.  One of the goals in studying these models is to calculate "scattering amplitudes" which are used to find the probabilities of various events that can occur in an experiment.   Because of the great difficulty in calculating gauge theory scattering amplitudes involving a large number of particles, or to high precision, it is often advantageous to work with modified models, such as the "N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory." While this model is in some ways more complicated than ordinary gauge theories -- e.g. many more particle are involved -- it is also more highly constrained because of the additional symmetry, and therefore easier to calculate with, but still has many features in common with ordinary gauge theories.  A number of findings have resulted from this grant.   One of them is the development of a newer, more efficient way of computing scattering amplitudes of large numbers of particles in N=4 supersymmetric gauge theory.   This method, called the "supersymmetric MHV vertex expansion" is a modification of the previously-developed "MHV vertex expansion" method.  When computing gauge theory scattering amplitudes to high precision, one often encounters a difficulty known as an infra-red divergence, due to the fact that the theory predicts the creation of an infinite number of very low energy gluons in a scattering process.  There are known methods (called "infra-red regulators") for taking into account and removing these divergences, which obscure the underlying physics involved.   Several papers that resulted from this grant involve the further development of a newly-introduced infra-red regulator, known as the "Higgs regulator," for the calculation of both scattering amplitudes and another quantity of interest in N=4 supersymmetric gauge theory (known as the form factor).  Some other findings resulting from this grant are the discovery of several unexpected relations between the so-called "subleading color" amplitudes of N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory, and scattering amplitudes in a modified theory of gravity called "N=8 supergravity theory."  While on the face of it, these two theories are very different, one of the hints that led to the uncovering of these new relations is that both types of scattering amplitudes have similar infra-red divergences.  All of the findings of this project have been communicated to the larger particle theory community in the form of papers published in refereed journals and seminars delivered at other universities.
