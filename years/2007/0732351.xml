<AbstractNarration>Under the direction of Dr. Lawrence G. Straus, Elisabeth Stone will conduct archaeological research to complete her PhD dissertation at the University of New Mexico.  This project focuses on understanding early uses of plant-derived fibers and hides, which rarely preserve over long time periods to be recovered by archaeologists.  To overcome this difficulty, analysis will focus on bone and antler tools - such as needle and awls - used to produce fiber and hide industries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Upper Paleolithic (~40,000 - 12,000 years ago) is the time period at the end of the last Ice Age during which anatomically modern humans spread through Europe.  Much is known about the stone tools, hunting patterns, and symbolic behavior of these populations.  However, there has been less study of the dietary role of plant foods or the production of "perishable technologies" such as hide-working, basketry, cordage production, or weaving, partially due to the minimal preservation of such materials.  Study of modern populations and archaeological sites with extraordinary preservation of organic materials indicates that perishables regularly constitute a large, varied, and important class of material culture.  Hides and plant fibers can be used to create utilitarian objects for storage, transport of resources, or clothing and shelter.  Additionally, clothing, basketry, and weaving are often used as vehicles for the expression of individual and cultural identity.  These factors suggest that a lack of knowledge about the range of organic technologies in the Upper Paleolithic significantly hinders the achievement of a holistic understanding of human lives during this period.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project introduces a new methodology aimed at elucidating questions about perishable technologies through a study of the tools used to manufacture them.  Needles first appear in Western Europe ~20,000 years ago; awls are present from the earliest Upper Paleolithic levels.  The use of bone needles and awls has been documented in many contemporary and historic cultures.  Microscopic patterns of wear accumulated through use on such tools will be studied.  Experiments will simulate such wear in a controlled environment.  These two bodies of data will be used as standards to assess wear found on archaeological tools from Northern Spain dating to between 20,000 and 12,000 years ago.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will contribute to Upper Paleolithic archaeology, but also has broader impacts.  Public interest in archaeological research entails a responsibility to present a holistic view of all prehistoric people.  Efforts will be made to present the research proposed here in nonacademic venues such as museums and schools.  The student (Stone) has completed a graduate minor in Museum Studies focused on the incorporation of archaeological and anthropological research and concepts into local high school curricula.  She has designed high school curricula on a wide number of anthropological topics and taught a class for high school teachers seeking to incorporate archaeology into science classrooms and is well-prepared to work with museum professionals and high school teachers and administrators.  This emphasis on community education and outreach will be maintained as she completes her dissertation and continues her career.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
