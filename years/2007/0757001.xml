<AbstractNarration>This project features academic institutions partnering with local community based organizations to increase the number of students graduating with an associate's or bachelor's degree in the sciences or mathematics. At its heart are faculty at a four-year institution who are collaborating with colleagues at a local community college to facilitate student transitions from the two-year institution into a broad range of majors in the sciences and mathematics at the baccalaureate institution. Project activities include a non-residential summer bridge program and a summer research experience, complemented by monthly academic year meetings and faculty-to-student and student-to-student mentoring. The bridging program is designed to mitigate weak academic preparation and issues related to transitioning to the university setting from impoverished/rural communities. The authentic research work provides peak experiences that carry students through the challenges of meeting academic standards. A learning community with a strong thematic center ("Building a Better Environment") provides a point of convergence for diverse scientific interests and highlights the value of interdisciplinary research. The assessment process includes formative and summative evaluation strategies, with particular emphasis on measuring changes in student perceptions and attitudes. Dissemination processes include an array of presentations and publications in both public and academic arenas. The project's intellectual merit lies in its strong programmatic activities that provide unique new opportunities in teaching, research and scholarship that benefit students, faculty, and the participating institutions alike. Evaluation of the project centers on developing evidence of the efficacy of the approach as a model for regional application, where more partnerships of 2- and 4-year institutions are arising as a means to offset the economic barriers to higher education. The project's broader impacts are felt through its creation and enhancement of networks and partnerships for research and education, as well as the professional development of participating faculty. The project is also leading to a better-prepared, more flexible and demographically representative workforce, with consequent economic impact in the northwest Ohio region.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Faculty at Bowling Green State University and Owens Community College collaborated, from 2008-2016, to create the Science Engineering &amp; Technology Gateway Ohio program (NSF DUE-STEP 0757001). The overall goal was to recruit, retain, and graduate more science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) majors. This contributes to an area of national need, namely, shortfalls in the availability of a suitably qualified STEM workforce.   SetGo provided a combination of summer academic bridging (4-week) and authentic research (10-week) experiences for students entering the STEM disciplines at either institution, along with monthly enrichment activities (Art of Science Community; ASC) and cascading mentoring by faculty and their graduate students throughout the academic year.  Student participation rates were high. ASC gatherings averaged 62 attendees (range 31-118), with a cumulative 1579 participants over the life of the program. Total unduplicated students impacted were 730, 114, and 200, in the ASC, academic bridge, and summer research experiences respectively. Virtually all instructional faculty in the College of Arts &amp; Sciences participated in the enrichment activities at some point, and close to 40% volunteered as research mentors in the summer program.   This strong student engagement and high faculty buy-in resulted in large increases (56%) in the number of STEM students transferring from the community college to the 4-year school. Evidence suggests that the mentoring and social support at ASC gatherings were especially important in driving these changes and countering feelings of isolation, particularly for women and minorities. There were accompanying increases in overall STEM retention (94% vs 74% in a control group that was matched for age, sex, ethnicity, ACT scores, and major). Students in the summer research program performed better in subsequent semesters than did non-participants, achieving higher Term and Cumulative GPAs. They excelled outside the classroom too, co-/authoring an average of 15 presentations each year at major national and international conferences, and at least 16 peer-reviewed publications to date. This academic success accelerated graduation by approximately 1-year, and exceeded institutional graduation rates in STEM, as well as overall 6-yr graduation rates for the state of Ohio, and the US as a whole.   The combination of academic-, social-, and financial support structures within the SetGo program provides a blueprint of best-practices for institutions wishing to significantly increase student success in the sciences, boost STEM graduation rates, and develop in students the qualities and skills needed for professional success in the STEM workforce or graduate programs.
