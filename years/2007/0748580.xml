<AbstractNarration>Dr. Andrea Lommen (Franklin and Marshall College) will conduct a focused effort toward detecting burst sources of gravitational radiation as well as continuing work in the area of stochastic gravitational wave background detection.  Burst sources of gravitational waves include eccentric black hole binaries, cosmic strings, and production of super massive black holes.  The activities Dr. Lommen will undertake to address these primary goals will yield a number of additional scientific results. These include increased understanding of the interstellar medium, increased understanding of constraints on populations of various gravitational wave sources such as binary massive black holes and cosmic strings, increased number of known pulsars, increased precision in timing pulsars, improved solar system ephemerides, and improved limits on the energy density of the stochastic gravitational wave background.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In conjunction with her research, Dr. Lommen will engage undergraduates through modeling of binary systems, computing their waveforms, and performing weekly monitoring of the pulsar data as it comes in from telescopes located all over the world.  Because this work will be done in conjunction with a number of international collaborators, it will serve to introduce Franklin and Marshall undergraduates to astronomy and to a global network of astronomers in general, and to gravitational wave detection in particular. There will also be a liaison between US and Australian high schools in a program where the high school students from both countries will learn to conduct remote observations in their classrooms on an on-going basis at the Charles Sturt University Observatory in Bathurst, NSW, Australia.  The program will also host a research/teaching postdoctoral fellow.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project created a substantial mentorship and outreach program, now called the Astronomical Remote Command Center (ARCC) at Franklin and Marshall College (F&amp;M) in which an average of 20 undergraduate students per year lead teams who conduct observing sessions monthly at two of the worldÃ†s largest radio telescopes:  The Arecibo 300-m Telescope and the Green Bank Telescope.   Over the course of the grant, the outreach program involved hundreds of high school students, who participated in astronomical activities led by F&amp;M students.  In addition to the 20 students per year who participated with the ARCC program, another 4 students per year participated directly in research involving gravitational waves.  Most attended a meeting of one of the major pulsar timing array collaborations funded by the award, and many conducted full-time summer research supported by the award.  Scientifically there were two major results, Joseph Simon, who worked with the group over the course of the grant, published results that showed that the gravitational wave sky is unlikely to be isotropic, and that we should consider optimizing our experiment in certain directions.  Secondly, Brian Christy, a postdoc who worked with the group, published results that have made a substantial influence on the field. In Christy et al (2014) we show that in order to maximize the detection of gravitational waves from single sources, the telescope time should all be spent on a small collection of the best pulsars, rather than distributed among a large quantity of not-so-good sources. This has already changed the observing scheme of NANOGrav.          Last Modified: 10/03/2014       Submitted by: Andrea N Lommen]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
