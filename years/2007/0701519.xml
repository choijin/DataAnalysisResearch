<AbstractNarration>The University of Arizona (UA) is partnering with the Center for Identification Technology Research (CITeR) at West Virginia University (WVU) to create a second research site that focuses on deception and credibility assessment. This will strengthen CITeR by complementing the center's research on identification and authentication by bringing together faculty, industry, and government agencies with interests in detecting deception, identifying individuals who pose security threats, and developing tools for assessing individual credibility. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The urgent need to better understand deception and its detection was unassailable long before 9/11 brought into high relief national security threats posed by terrorist plots and deceptions. The daily reporting of fraudulent business practices, political chicanery, telemarketing scams, internet predation, and identity theft has only served to reinforce the need for concerted attention to this critical and multifaceted topic. Yet at present there is little coordination of effort among government agencies or in the academic community to address issues related to identification of deception. Moreover, the topic begs for a multidisciplinary approach, so that technical expertise can be integrated with rigorous social science research to derive solutions and detection tools. CITeR-UA addresses these needs by assembling a multidisciplinary, multi-institutional collaboration among researchers and graduate students whose skills and interests intersect with those at CITeR-WVU. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;UA is uniquely equipped to lead the deception and credibility aspect of this effort with its state-of-the-art DOD-funded Deception Detection Laboratory for conducting experiments and its Integrated Multimedia System with terabyte server for capturing, editing, storing, and analyzing multimedia data.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ NSF Grant #0701519   Formation of CITeR-UA to Add Deception and Credibility Assessment to the Center for Identification Technology Research  Project Outcomes Report (POR)  The urgent need to better assess the credibility of information and its sources, and to detect deception was unassailable in government and industry circles long before 9/11 brought into high relief national security threats posed by terrorist plots and deceptions. The daily reporting of fraudulent business practices, political chicanery, campus cheating scandals, telemarketing scams, internet predation, and identity theft has only served to reinforce the need for concerted attention to this critical and multifaceted topic.  Employing  a multidisciplinary approach, so that technical expertise could be integrated with rigorous social science research to derive solutions and detection tools, the Center for Identification Technology Research has been a pioneer in developing and validating various tools and instruments used to assess the credibility of people, information and systems.

Also investigated have been interviewing protocols and coordinated interaction patterns (e.g., synchrony) between interviewer and interviewee intended to elicit reliable behavioral, psychophysiological and verbal indicators.

Broader Impacts  The IU/CRC CITeR-UA Center has broadened participation of underrepresented groups in three ways: The PI is a woman; subjects for the proposed experiments were diverse, so results generalized to broader populations; and the postgraduate, graduate and undergraduate research assistants included women and minorities who have had exceptional opportunity to acquire both social science research methods and technical backgrounds in information systems and computer sciences.  The multi-disciplinary approach to graduate education that was fostered by the addition of CITeR-UA has been a hallmark of UAÆs research programs over the last decade. Past practices of student exchange and visits across laboratories were continued as part of the new center. No other programs in the country offer this blend of research and education related to identification, deception, and credibility, making CITeR-UA unique in its contribution to science infrastructure.
