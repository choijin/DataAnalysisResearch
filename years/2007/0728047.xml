<AbstractNarration>This project is providing scholarships for full-time financially eligible students majoring in the physical sciences, engineering, computer science, environmental science, biotechnology, bioinformatics, or mathematics. The overall goals are to expand enrollment, reduce economic barriers, and increase student retention and transfer. The Science &amp; Technology Scholarship Program provides students with a challenging and supportive program that prepares them for transfer to four-year institutions. Selection criteria include grades, a student essay, and letters of recommendation. Scholarship recipients have opportunities to participate in cultural experiences, career exploration and planning, internships, and community service projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This project is developing the support network needed for student retention and success in science and technology majors. The college has an organized team to support the students, including learning community support from peers, a program advisor, faculty mentors, and an expanded tutoring program. The students in the learning community are being tracked for a minimum of four years to determine the time required for completion of the four-year degree. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This scholarship program is helping to produce graduates in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields to help alleviate the shortage of well prepared personnel needed by the high technology industries located in central Maryland. The program includes a recruitment plan to attract women, minorities, and persons with disabilities with the potential for success in the identified fields.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
