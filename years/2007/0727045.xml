<AbstractNarration>The traditional image of Southern Ocean circulation between Australia and Antarctica illustrates the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), a dominant belt of eastward transport with a comparatively weak adjacent westward flow. The relatively weak westward flow is part of an anticyclonic, or counterclockwise, circulation north of the ACC and a cyclonic, or clockwise,  circulation south of the ACC. Recent imaging developed from the World Ocean Circulation Hydrographic Program suggests that a strong cyclonic gyre exists, representing a newly discovered general circulation feature in a remote and unexplored region of the Southern Ocean. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oceanographers from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute will install a 6-mooring array of current meters and a subsurface profiling float across the Antarctic continental slope to map the circulation of this newly discovered cyclonic gyre. In addition, scientists will use moored profilers to monitor the flow of the dense plume of water associated with the ACC that sinks along the continental slope and joins the descending limb of the Meridional Overturning Circulation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Findings from this study will resolve uncertainties about the nature of the general circulation in the Southern Ocean and enhance our understanding of the global meridional overturning system. This project will also impact climate change research by allowing scientists to combine the proposed measurements with high-resolution numerical modeling to improve the performance of coupled climate models. Funding from this proposal will support the development of an early-career scientist, as well as potential research and training for a UK-based PhD student. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[       The Antarctic continent is separated from the other southern continents and sub-continents by the Southern Ocean.  The dominant ocean current of this domain is the eastward-flowing Antarctic Circumpolar Current, whose strength is comparable to the better-known Gulf Stream, Kuroshio and Agulhus Currents in other oceans.  The Southern Ocean between Australia and Antartica is about 3000 km wide, and this Antarctic Circumpolar Current flows through the Australian sector near 50&deg;S.  Hydrographic measurements in this sector suggested that there could be a second strong current to the south of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current: a clockwise circulation gyre comprised of additional eastward flow near 60&deg;S, a belt of westward flow along the continental slope of Antarctica near 67&deg;S, and a "western boundary current" flowing northward along the east flank of the Kerguelen Plateau (near 85&deg;E).  This gyre was an inferred circulation, a hypothesis, because the nature of hydrographic measurements is such that while one can estimate some aspects of circulation system patterns and strengths from measurements of water properties alone, confirmation and constraint of strength of circulation elements requires a more direct measurement of flow.  This experiment set a moored array of current meter instrumentation over the Antarctic continental slope (near 115&deg;E) that yielded a two-year duration record of direct current measurements and confirmed and quantified the westward flow component of the gyre.  A separate array measurement of the western boundary current component of the gyre by Australian and Japanese colleagues has also been made, so the quantitative documentation of the gyre structure is advancing.
