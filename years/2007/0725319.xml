<AbstractNarration>The 2007 IEEE INFOCOM Conference on Computer Communications will be held in Anchorage, Alaska, USA from May 6 to May 12, 2007. This preeminent technical conference is the primary venue for presenting new research results in the area of computer communications, and is widely attended by researchers and practitioners in the field. Attending conferences such as INFOCOM is of paramount importance for the development of graduate students. Participants have the opportunity to present their  work, attend panel and keynote sessions, and interact with hundreds of others performing leading-edge research in the field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: This proposal requests funding to support approximately sixteen graduate students in the  United States to attend this premiere conference. The travel awards will target graduate students, in particular, women and under-represented minority students, since attending conferences is an important part of their educational experience, and they often have limited travel funds. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
