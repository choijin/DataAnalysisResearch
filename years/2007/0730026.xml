<AbstractNarration>Proposal Title:  Molecular Modeling of Ion Transport and Separation in Nanochannels&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:  CBET-0730026&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Sohail Murad&lt;br/&gt;Institution:   University of Illinois Chicago&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of the proposed research are to understand the general details of ion transport and the essential structural and dynamic characteristics for transport of charged particles through a nanochannel under passive, pressure-driven or electric field driven conditions, so as to improve controllability and selectivity. Biological ion channels are themselves nanofluidic devices; however, the level of complexity present in such channels obscures the properties that are the basic essentials of an ion-selective nanochannel.  Ion permeation of nanochannels will be studied as a general phenomenon, starting with the simplest model for a nanochannel and increasing the complexity of the model in a stepwise manner by adding attributes that will permit answering some of the questions that are being asked about nanofluidic devices.. Simplified pore models permit investigation of the primary characteristics of a conduction pathway: the shape, radius, and length of the pore, the chemical (hydrophobic or hydrophilic) nature of the pore wall surface, its surface roughness and flexibility, the presence and distribution of surface charges, the presence of an external electric field. &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: Recent advances in the fabrication of confined fluidic systems such as nanoscale lab-on-a-chip devices and nanofabricated pores raise fundamental questions about ion transport in nanochannels. Solvent slip along the hydrophobic walls of the carbon nanotube is controlled by fluid-wall interactions. Investigation of such slip flow behavior and other characteristics of flow in nanotubes can be vital for generating the high throughput rates required in nanofluidic devices employing carbon nanotubes. In addition similar issues play an important role in transport processes in biological membranes, and cellular functions.  This research will provide training for undergraduate and graduate students and will prepare highly skilled technical personnel with broad knowledge encompassing engineering, chemistry, biology, and nanotechnology. The PIs have been actively participating in the WISEST (Women in Science and Engineering System Transformation) program at UIC and will continue those activities through this grant.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
