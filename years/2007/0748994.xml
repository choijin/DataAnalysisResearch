    <AbstractNarration>Proposal No: 0748994&lt;br/&gt;PI: Anthony Zador&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports the preparation and sharing of computational neuroscience data as part of an exploratory activity aimed at catalyzing rapid and innovative advances in computational neuroscience and related fields. The data to be shared in this project are intracellular (whole-cell patch) recordings obtained in vivo from visual, auditory, somatosensory, and motor areas of the neocortex by the laboratories of Judith Hirsch, Anthony Zador, Michael DeWeese, and Michael Brecht. These data include not only spikes but also membrane voltages or currents generated by synaptic connections and intrinsic membrane channels. In addition to providing data, the investigators will develop tutorial materials describing recording methods, stimulus paradigms, and issues relevant to the interpretation of intracellular recordings. It is anticipated that this pooled data set will be useful for those wishing to study a particular sensory modality as well as those who hope to understand common features of neocortical function. It will also be of great value for the development of new methods of data analysis.</AbstractNarration>
