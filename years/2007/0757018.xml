<AbstractNarration>In this Step type 2 project, the investigators are examining evidence for educational pathways to STEM careers using several different sources of national survey data.  They are studying how high school course taking, test scores, and type of school attended is related to later career choice in college.  They are examining the diversity of preparation for college for students of different backgrounds, the connection between STEM degree attainment and college credits and early college performance, and they are examining the connection between work experience during undergraduate years and STEM labor force entry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers are using well-known national longitudinal survey data of high school and college students as well as conducting a new survey of students.</AbstractNarration>
