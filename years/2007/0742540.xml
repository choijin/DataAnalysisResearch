<AbstractNarration>GRADUATE TEACHING FELLOWS IN K-12 EDUCATION&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PROPOSAL #: 0742540&lt;br/&gt;PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Dean Livelybrooks&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION: University of Oregon&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: Intra-state Partnerships for Improved, Sustainable K-12 STEM Instruction in Remote Schools&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of Oregon GK-12 project establishes state-of-the-art, inquiry-driven science curricula in rural eastern and central Oregon schools. The UO chemistry and physics PhD students chosen annually to be GK-12 Fellows will each be assigned to an elementary or middle school to serve as a ?scientist-in-residence,? hosted by their school community for three, two-week-long stays each year. They will co-teach science kits alongside classroom teachers with a goal of sustained use of kit curricula. This embedded professional development for teachers, with the GK-12 Fellows as content experts, will serve as a statewide model. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GK-12 Fellows work with curricula experts at UO and teachers at their assigned schools to integrate language arts and math instruction within the science curricula. In addition, Fellows lead hands-on science kit curricula classroom activities and develop supporting curricula conceptually related to their research. The project will seed the development of regional infrastructure to restock the science kits and ensure cost-efficient use of materials via inter-classroom and inter-school sharing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three benefits of this program stand out as uniquely important. First, it establishes articulated K-8 science curricula, allowing learning to be correlated from one grade to the next, resulting in students better prepared to study science in high school. Second, the program seeks to counter the trend of ?science instruction displacement? by Fellow-piloted integration of age-appropriate math and language arts instruction within inquiry-based science lessons. Third, the program seeks to test a ?remote model? whereby universities play significant roles in improving instruction at remote schools. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Overview: The University of Oregon Materials Science InstituteÆs GK-12 Science Outreach Program is a powerful agent for change working on several levels to sustainably improve science education in Oregon, including:  Providing      valuable, classroom-embedded professional development in physical science      to Oregon K-12 teachers;  Introducing      children to scientists as a role models to expand and encourage their      interest in science;  Fostering      in PhD students an interest in K-12 education and education policies;  Developing      in PhD students the communication skills necessary to engage and inform      the general public.    Building new partnerships between schools, school districts, Education Service Districts (even those far from the UO) and the University.   Problems Identified: Working closely with teachers and school administrators, we first identified key targets for enhancing K-12 science education, including: school-situated (æclassroom-embeddedÆ) professional development for teachers in the sciences; facilitation of the use of high-quality, inquiry-based curricula; and providing scientist role models for students. Further analysis found that, while there are many available options for inquiry-based science curricula, the adoption and sustained, effective use of inquiry-driven materials is limited by teacher inexperience and non-existent or underdeveloped regional facilities for commonly purchasing, maintaining, and restocking classroom materials.  Finally, the recent adoption of Common-Core State Standards in Math and Language Arts, followed by OregonÆs adoption of the Next Generation Science Standards, has overloaded educatorsÆ capacities to adjust to new standards and teaching styles.  This has resulted in the unwelcome trend of slowing and serializing adoption efforts so as to put science and engineering last in the queue. All of these problems are magnified in small and/or rural school districts.  Program Structure and Impact: Since 2003 the MSI GK-12 program has placed biology, chemistry and physics Ph.D. students in classrooms to co-instruct inquiry-driven hands-on science curricula alongside K-12 teachers in Lane, Deschutes, Jefferson, Sherman, Wheeler, Umatilla, Morrow, and Union Counties.  The program has provided fellowships each year for 8-15 Ph.D. students. GK-12 Fellows are assigned to a participating elementary or middle school, sometimes residing in UO-remote, rural communities, and serving as æscientists-in-residenceÆ to support instruction using state-of-the-art science and engineering curricula.  Since its inception the program has worked with 87 elementary and middle schools in 22 Oregon school districts, training 601 teachers and teaching more than 10,000 school children. Fellows in the classroom serve to increase student enthusiasm for science and engineering by promoting analytical thinking and hands-on learning.  Indeed, studies in the Hermiston and Pendleton School Districts demonstrate that two or more ædosesÆ of GK-12 scientists-in-residence can increase student science state test scores.  The University of Oregon MSI GK-12 program has helped develop three regional STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) centers&ndash; collaboratives spanning K-12 service districts by which school districts commit to regionally-harmonized purchases of STEM instructional materials and agree to join the consortia for kit refurbishment, delivery, and on-going professional development. This resolves the issue of materials falling into disuse due to the lack of a coordinated restocking strategy, and provides economies of scale that reduce curricula costs. These consortia serve as loci for UO graduate student outreach experiences, collaborative professional development, and the conversations necessary to improve science instruction.  Further, situating university research programs broader impacts within a given STEM center provides for purchase and sustained use of high tech. equipmen...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
