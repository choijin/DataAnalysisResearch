<AbstractNarration>****NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****&lt;br/&gt;Recent advances in semiconductor technology have facilitated the realization of a host of new electronic devices with ever-decreasing dimensions.  Handheld pocket computers (palm-tops), ultra-thin cell phones with internet, iPods, iPhones and micro-cameras are a few examples that exploit and adopt the advances in the technological development. However, as the typical component dimensions approach the nanometer scale, further miniaturization becomes increasingly difficult. It is believed that any further improvement in device functionality will require a transition from the conventional electronics to an altogether new regime known as "Spintronics." While the electronic devices utilize the charge of electrons, the typical spintronic devices exploit both charge as well as the spin (a magnetic attribute) of an electron. Because of this additional attribute, spintronic devices are expected to be faster, smaller and consume less power than the conventional charge-based electronic devices. However, the spintronic devices can not be fabricated simply by making use of the simple semiconductors. The practical realization of spintronic devices heavily rely on the development of two new classes of materials namely, Dilute Magnetic Semiconductors (DMS) and Dilute Magnetic Dielectrics (DMD). These materials make it possible to utilize the electron's spin in addition to its charge. Though a significant amount of work has been performed on DMS materials, very little has been done on DMD materials. This CAREER project will be focused on discovering new families of DMD materials that potentially can lead to innovation in spintronics. Educational program will develop numerous opportunities for graduate, undergraduate and k-12 students and teachers. Summer program will provide k-12 teachers more reasons to teach science with contagious enthusiasm in the classroom. Proposed work on introducing science and engineering to minority students will have meaningful societal impact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;**** TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****&lt;br/&gt;The integrated research and education goal of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project at the University of Utah is to discover new families of Dilute Magnetic Dielectrics (DMD) that will lead to innovation in Spintronics and to communicate materials science and engineering to a wider audience through science exhibits, lab-integrated courses, and hands-on activities. The most critical step in the functioning of a spintronic device is the injection of spin-polarized carriers at the ferromagnet-semiconductor interface. Recent studies have shown that dilute doping of semiconductors or dielectrics with magnetic atoms can provide an enabling breakthrough in achieving high spin-injection efficiency. This has led to an extensive effort exploring the possibility of inducing room temperature ferromagnetism in several systems. Most of the work in this field is still focused on dilute magnetic semiconductors. Little work has been performed on DMDs.  This project will start an extensive research program to explore the possibility of inducing room temperature ferromagnetism in Rare Earth Oxide based high-k dielectrics by dilute doping of transition metal elements. The educational component of this project will disseminate the fundamentals of materials science and engineering to a wider audience. The following specific tasks will be performed: (i) developing interactive materials science exhibits for the Utah Science Center Museum, (ii) initiating a summer research program for k-12 teachers and students, (iii) and creating a collaborative and interdisciplinary environment for undergraduate and graduate research. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
