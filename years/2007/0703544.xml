<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY: This award will expand the current work on polymers, which entails the fabrication of conducting and non-conducting polymer nanofibers via electrospinning or by the interfacial polymerization technique. Devices and sensors based on the use of these polymer nanofibers will be fabricated and tested. In addition, charge transport at nanofiber junctions, viz. junctions formed when two nanofibers overlap will be studied. Nanofibers of any polymer have a large surface to volume ratio. Because of their large surface area, they have the potential to be used in the fabrication of low power, supersensitive and fast response sensors. A range of experiments have been proposed using different instruments that will help in the complete characterization of the electronic devices and sensors using electrospun polymer nanofibers and of crossed polymer nanofibers. The approach to making polymer nanofibers via electrospinning is unique as it does not use templates or other cumbersome methods. The award encompasses polymer science, nanoscience and electronics and is multidisciplinary giving students a sound and direct research experience that will help them in graduate school and in job searches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY: Devices and sensors based on polymer nanofibers will be fabricated and tested. Since nanofibers have a large surface area they are very sensitive to the environment making it possible to detect minute amounts of gases very quickly. The small size of the devices and sensors imply comparatively low operating voltages and thus have the advantage of low power consumption. In addition, polymers are light weight, flexible and cheap to manufacture, hence this award has economic advantages. This award is directed at helping undergraduates with the goal of motivating them toward graduate school. Some of the experiments will be modified to be included into the course curriculum thereby integrating research and education. Finally, the majority of the students affected are minority students and this proposal will enhance their participation in the scientific arena. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
