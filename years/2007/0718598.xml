    <AbstractNarration>Donna E. Fernandez&lt;br/&gt;Proposal No. IOS-0718598&lt;br/&gt;Title: Interactions between MADS-domain floral repressors in the photoperiod pathway.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The time at which a plant flowers depends both on external factors, such as light and temperature, and internal factors, such as the age and condition of the plant. Information about these factors is fed into a complex network of positively- and negatively-acting molecular regulators, which control the switch from formation of leaves to formation of flowers. The MADS-domain proteins AGAMOUS-LIKE15, AGAMOUS-LIKE18, and SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP) have been identified as negatively-acting regulators in this network through genetic analyses in Arabidopsis. Genetic and molecular studies will be performed to define how these factors contribute, both individually and collectively, to the regulatory network. This work will give insight into the nature of regulatory complexes that control flowering, their mechanism of action, and interactions between them. These insights will add to the understanding of the molecular basis for control of developmental processes, with potential implications in many areas ranging from reproductive biology to disease development and crop yield. The project will provide training opportunities for several young scientists at the undergraduate and graduate level.</AbstractNarration>
