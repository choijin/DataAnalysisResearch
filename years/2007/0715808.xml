    <AbstractNarration>Plant populations such as wild rice typically undergo oscillations or boom-and-bust cycles. Ecological theory predicts that any delay in delivery of limiting resources to a population will cause it to oscillate. Previous modeling and experimental work has demonstrated that slow decay of wild rice shoot litter indeed causes oscillations in live populations, by delaying nutrient availability during the growing season. But roots decompose even more slowly than shoots, so allocation of growth to roots to obtain nutrients may exacerbate these oscillations. This study will examine the factors that control root, shoot, and seed production, and how they both depend upon and change nutrient availability. The experimental results will be used to improve a computer model that simulates growth and yield of wild rice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besides being ecologically interesting, wild rice is an important staple and sacred food for members of Minnesota's Ojibway (Chippewa) tribe. The Ojibway tribe manages over a dozen wild rice lakes in northeastern Minnesota for wild rice production in as natural a manner as possible. This research will involve close collaboration with tribal biologists of the Fond du Lac band of Ojibway. Students will be recruited from the tribal community college to assist in this work. This will show tribal students the potentials of a career in the environmental sciences.</AbstractNarration>
