<AbstractNarration>This project on Studies of Nuclear Reactions and Structure will&lt;br/&gt;support  fundamental research in experimental nuclear physics and the&lt;br/&gt;training of Ph.D. students for service to the nation in forefront&lt;br/&gt;scientific research, education, homeland defense, national security,&lt;br/&gt;and enhancing economic competitiveness. At the John D. Fox&lt;br/&gt;Superconducting Accelerator Laboratory at Florida State University,&lt;br/&gt;the new RESOLUT rare ion facility will allow the study of the&lt;br/&gt;reactions and structure of nuclei far from stability which are&lt;br/&gt;critical to astrophysics and the interpretation of observations made&lt;br/&gt;by the new astronomical observatories.  Our unique beams of 14C will&lt;br/&gt;allow us to study how the most fundamental property of nuclear&lt;br/&gt;structure, the shells, changes with increasing imbalance in the&lt;br/&gt;proportion of neutrons to protons.  The home  laboratory is also an&lt;br/&gt;ideal hands-on training ground for Ph.D. students&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other nuclear structure studies will be carried out at international&lt;br/&gt;facilities such as Gammasphere at ATLAS and the National&lt;br/&gt;Superconducting Accelerator Laboratory.  Other components of our&lt;br/&gt;research program include leading efforts at the Relativistic Heavy Ion&lt;br/&gt;Collider to study a new form of matter that existed a fraction of a&lt;br/&gt;second after the Big Bang and at CB-ELSA in Bonn, Germany to search&lt;br/&gt;for previously unseen excited baryon resonances.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant has funded the operation and much of the basic research at the John D. Fox Superconducting Accelerator located on the Florida State University campus in Tallahassee for 3 years.  Some of the highlights of the program include the completion and operation of the RESOLUT rare ion facility to allow the study of short-lived rare atomic nuclei which play an important role in astrophysics.  For example, the lowest spin 0 proton capture resonance in 26Si  was identified.  This determined the astrophysical conditions under which this resonance creates an effective path for 26Si nucleosynthesis in stars accreting material from companions.   RESOLUT was also used to locate new excited states in exotic 8B (only 10B and 11B are stable) which were predicted by ab-initio and no-core shell model calculations, but never before seen.  This information helps to test and refine the theoretical calculations which are based the fundamental nucleon-nucleon force.  Measurements performed at the FoxLab have shown that the 14N(e',neutrino)14C(alpha,gamma) cycle plays a much smaller (if any) role in the life cycle of helium accreting white dwarf stars than was previously assumed in astrophysical calculations.  A study of neutron-rich 31Si and 34P has revealed 1,2 and even 3 neutron excitations into the next higher fp shell.  Theoretical calculations with the shell model and an adjusted interaction can reproduce the 1 neutron excitations, but cannot reproduce the 2 and 3 neutron ones, pointing the way to improve the interaction for more neutron-rich nuclei encountered in astrophysics.     An FSU analysis of J/Psi nuclear modification factor data from the PHENIX detector at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider in d + Au collisions at mid-rapicity, when combined with other PHENIX data at forward rapidity, has shown that the observed J/Psi suppression at mid- and forward-rapidity in Au + Au collisions can be accounted for by cold nuclear matter effects.   An FSU-led review of the "Experimental Status of Glueballs" has concluded that, although certainly contributing to meson dynamics, the overall evidence for glueballs is very weak.  (Glueballs are theoretically proposed particles consisting only of the nuclear force particles called gluons.)       Another major goal of the FoxLab is the education of undergraduate and graduate students.  A total of 9 persons whose research was supported on this grant received the Ph.D. degree during the grant period.  All of these graduates found immediate employment in basic nuclear research, homeland security, and nuclear medicine.  The grant also supported the Ph.D. research of other graduate students who will graduate in the next year or so.  The grant supported the part-time research of about 10 undergraduate students.  This helps motivate them to continue studies in the advanced sciences.  A number of these students have already received the B.S. degree at FSU and are now involved in Ph.D. studies at other universities around the U.S.  Members of our research group have been involved in science outreach by presenting lecture-demonstrations in K-12 schools, judging science fairs, and organizing Open Houses on the FSU campus featuring tours of the FoxLab, hands-on demonstrations, etc.          Last Modified: 07/03/2012       Submitted by: Samuel L Tabor]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
