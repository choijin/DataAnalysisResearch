<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to synthesize new materials consisting of alkali or alkaline earth metals, transition metals, and chalcogens such as sulfur or selenium  through ion exchange (from mono- and divalent halide salts as well as molten organic acids), reductive and oxidative intercalation/deintercalation (both chemical and electrochemical), and novel methods that will induce exfoliation, all to be completed under inert conditions.  This work feeds into ongoing collaborations to explore the activity of these materials as catalysts for photo-oxidation and hydrodesulfurization.  In addition, a central component of this project is the development of methods to increase the awareness and appreciation of solid state chemistry in both the undergraduate curriculum and in the community. Undergraduate students will be employed to spearhead a "family science night" at local schools involving the use of interactive experiments to promote the importance of solid materials.  Courses in the chemistry curriculum will additionally be modified to incorporate new equipment and resources highlighting innovations in solid state chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sulfur and selenium-based materials are extremely important as catalysts, semiconductors, and optical materials.  These compounds, known as chalcogenides, have unique structural properties which make them interesting candidates as reactants for chemical synthesis.  We will pursue strategies to predictably synthesize new materials from interesting starting compounds, such as potassium-nickel-sulfides (K2Ni3S4, for example) using a catalog of mild chemical techniques.  This work feeds into ongoing collaborations to explore the activity of these materials as catalysts for environmentally important applications such as the removal of sulfur impurities from fuels.  In addition, a central component of this project is the development of methods to increase the awareness and appreciation of chemistry in both the college curriculum and in the community. Undergraduate students will be employed to spearhead a "family science night" at local schools using interactive chemistry experiments to remind children that science is fun, fascinating, and exciting.  Additionally, underrepresented minority students at local community colleges will be recruited to begin undergraduate research at a university setting through a coupling with an existing Senior Discovery Corps program.  Courses in the chemistry curriculum will likewise be modified to incorporate new equipment and resources highlighting innovations in solid materials study.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ An understanding of synthesis methods applicable for producing solid materials with specific properties is essential for technological and scientific development.  Small changes in the composition or structure of a material can have profound effects on its properties, such as its ability to catalyze chemical reactions.  In this study we investigated ways in which structures can be gently modified as a means to tune the structure.  This approach is quite different from that used to synthesize most solid state materials, an approach typically requiring the use of extremely high temperatures.  By conducting reactions at low temperatures 'unstable' (and very interesting!) structures may be trapped, which would otherwise remain unobserved.  We focus here on structures containing the elements sulfur and selenium (collectively called chalcogenides) since these elements notoriously rearrange in structures during chemical manipulation.  We incorporated all of the low temperature synthetic tools that have been developed over decades: solid state electrochemistry (using current and potential to control the chemistry, a method which led to the invention of the lithium ion battery), ion exchange chemistry (exposing a material to species that can be traded for one of its components, used routinely to industrially modify clays), and photochemistry (using light to initiate a chemical reaction).  Among our many findings we were able to show that ion exchange chemistry can allow the retention of order in a material which is typically disordered (through the synthesis of a layered form of NaLaSe2 from KLaSe2).  We found that the removal of atoms from a structure using electrochemistry can be used to generate a material that has entirely lost its original order, significantly from the compound with the same chemical formula synthesized at high temperature (as shown in the synthesis of LiNaMnS2 from Na2Mn2S3).  We have shown that light in conjunction with acetone and isopropanol (nail polish remover and rubbing alcohol) can be used to synthesize nanoparticles of zinc sulfide, and example of a class of materials called quantum dots, which are used in displays due to their interesting optical properties.  Interestingly, much of the rigidity and stability that was assumed for the structures of study is lacking, even at room temperature.  In study after study we observed that atoms move through metal sulfides and selenides readily, changing the material into one which lacks order or turning into an entirely different structure altogether.  We uncovered far more mysteries than we solved, paving the way for research far into the future.   We additionally initiated an ongoing regional after-school science program for elementary school students entitled "Family Science Night."  This program is entirely focused on hands-on scientific experiments (with a materials emphasis).  Experiments are themed and parental involvement is highly encouraged in order to promote a positive perception of science at home.  These events are hosted by faculty and college students at elementary schools throughout the region, and thousands of children have participated.
