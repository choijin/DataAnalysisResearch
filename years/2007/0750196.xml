<AbstractNarration>This award by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry program (with co-funding from the Cellular Systems Cluster of the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences) supports Professor Christine Keating and her group at Pennsylvania State University for constructing models of biological cells based on biologically relevant polymers and intracellular environments.  The work aims to shed light on the possible role(s) of fundamental macromolecular chemistry in intracellular organization and biochemical microcompartmentation, exploring the possibility that these simple physical phenomena can lead to complex cellular behaviors such as differentiation and asymmetric reproduction.  This is accomplished by characterizing aqueous protein and polyanion solutions as synthetic cytoplasms, and by using these new polymer systems to understand primitive routes to cell polarity and asymmetric cell division. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Potential long-term implications include the possibility of designing drugs to target critical aspects of intracellular organization, as a complement to current methods based on enzyme active sites.  Additional outcomes include advances in bioseparations and in the encapsulation of large drug molecules such as proteins in vesicle delivery vehicles.  Students are trained at the interface of chemistry, materials science, and biology - an area of increasing importance for the future of medical and environmental science in the U.S.  Outreach at the K-12 and undergraduate levels includes: (1) hosting a K-12 teacher each summer, (2) participation of undergraduate students in the research both during the summers and during the academic year, starting as early as the freshman level, and (3) partnering with existing outreach programs organized by on-campus groups including the Women in Science and Engineering (WISE) summer camps for high school girls. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The focus of this project was to construct experimental models for the cytoplasm of biological cells.  Although the interior of living cells was long thought of as a simple solution containing enzymes, nucleic acids and organelles, it is now known that cellular interiors are highly organized, and that the cytoplasm itself is an important participant in cellular processes.  Understanding the physical and chemical mechanisms by which cytoplasm impacts cellular processes is important to cell biology, medicine, and biotechnology.  We prepared very simple experimental models of cytoplasm in which hypotheses can be tested without the staggering complexity of living cells.  Key properties of the cytoplasm captured in our model systems include: (1) high concentrations of "background" macromolecules, (2) compartmentalization, and (3) dynamic reorganization of molecules between compartments and of the compartments themselves.  The model cytoplasm developed here was based on aqueous solutions of two polymers that formed a phase system in which two aqueous phases coexist, each enriched in one of the polymers.  When proteins or nucleic acids are added to this system, they become concentrated into one of the phases (i.e., compartments) by partitioning.  We studied the cytoplasm mimic both inside cell-sized lipid membrane vesicles and in bulk solution.  Bulk studies demonstrated that compartmentalization of protein enzymes or ribozymes in aqueous phase compartments led to greatly increased local concentration and local reactivity.  We were able to increase overall reaction rates and to control spatially where the reactions occurred.  Membrane-encapsulated cytoplasm mimic studies demonstrated several types of behaviors normally associated with living biological cells, including: loss of symmetry to form polarized model cells with different protein composition at the two poles, sorting of lipid membrane domains to match up with complementary interior aqueous domains, in the absence of specific binding interactions, and asymmetric fission of model cells to form nonidentical daughter vesicles that contained different protein compositions and different lipid compositions.  These findings point to fundamental physicochemical processes that can occur in crowded polymer solutions, and that may underlie or have preceded the complex biochemical and genetic processes that regulate these processes in living cells.      Graduate students, undergraduates, and K-12 teachers participated in this project.  One undergraduate student wrote and defended a thesis for an Honors degree from PSU.  A second graduate student earned an M.S. degree based on her research on this project.  Two doctoral theses were granted to students working on this project; additional graduate student doctoral degrees are in progress.  Several teams of K-12 teachers developed inquiry experiments as part of a summer research experience in which they worked in the InvestigatorÆs laboratories and were mentored by the Investigator and by graduate students.  The teachers brought their projects back to their classrooms the following academic year and performed the inquiry experiments with their middle- and high school students.  Additionally, both the principal investigator and many of her graduate students were involved in a number of K-12 and community outreach activities to broaden interest in science.
