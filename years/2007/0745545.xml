<AbstractNarration>Plants are exposed to many environmental stress signals. Generally they have efficient strategies for self-defense and protection. However, this efficiency may be compromised when plants are exposed to multiple stresses at the same time. Plants are not able to defend themselves effectively against certain pathogens while being attacked by insects and vice versa. The investigator has shown that the CSN5 protein operates as part of a molecular switch that determines whether defense responses to insects or pathogens will be activated. Another component of this mechanism is a MAP kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway that relays signals generated by insects and pathogens. This project will employ a molecular-biochemical approach to analyze how CSN5 regulates defense responses through interactions with MAPK pathways. This will uncover mechanisms that ?decide? what kind of defense responses will be activated. CSN5 plays a fundamental role for plant defense responses. This discovery is novel and this research project is aimed at identifying novel mechanisms of stress signal transduction which result in resistance to pests. Broader impacts. The outcome of the proposed research has the potential to provide novel strategies for generating multistress-resistant crop plants, but will also raise caveats regarding manipulation of signaling networks which may increase resistance to one pest but decrease resistance to another. The project will provide training opportunities in plant molecular biology for a postdoctoral research associate, graduate and undergraduate students. The investigator will also continue to recruit students from underrepresented groups and provide research opportunities for high school students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
