    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project focuses on the goal of developing a general approach to a simulation tool for tissue interaction for a variety of surgical training scenarios that meet the training needs of many constituencies. The key to open surgery simulation is accurate mechanical behavior of tool tissue manipulations with real-time interactivity. User experiences must reflect real-life activities. The proposed approach will achieve this by combining widely used computational mechanics simulation code and games physics code to produce a training system that can produce both accurate and interactive surgical simulation experiences. The overarching goal is to develop a general approach to simulating tool tissue interaction for a variety of surgical training scenarios that meet the training needs of many constituencies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Coupled with the broader use and greater simulation complexity of open incision surgery, professional organizations that oversee surgical training and certification are looking toward simulation to meet the increasing challenges. Users of the technology developed with this research will include surgeons, surgical students, and members of other professions that perform physical interventions on the human body. Potential buyers of the technology will include medical schools, medical simulation centers, and hospitals. The use of simulation for technology intensive open surgical procedures will have the effect of improving the quality of surgical training, thus improving and standardizing surgical practice and reducing errors.</AbstractNarration>
