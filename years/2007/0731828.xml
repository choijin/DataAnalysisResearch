<AbstractNarration>This project focuses on the role of self-regulated&lt;br/&gt;learning (SRL) in students' understanding of science with hypermedia. SRL is&lt;br/&gt;emerging as a significant issue in educational and psychological research. SRL is an active, constructive process&lt;br/&gt;whereby learners set goals for their learning and then attempt to monitor,&lt;br/&gt;regulate, and control their cognition, motivation, and behavior in the service&lt;br/&gt;of those goals. SRL is guided and constrained by both personal characteristics&lt;br/&gt;and the contextual features of the environment (Pintrich, 2000). The focus of&lt;br/&gt;SRL research over the last three decades has been on learners' academic learning&lt;br/&gt;and achievement and has progressively included emphases on cognitive strategies,&lt;br/&gt;metacognition, motivation, and task engagement (for a recent review see Paris &amp;&lt;br/&gt;Paris, 2001). The broad scope of SRL appeals to educational researchers who seek&lt;br/&gt;to understand how students become adept and independent in their educational&lt;br/&gt;pursuits. Whether SRL is viewed as a set of skills that can be taught explicitly&lt;br/&gt;or as developmental processes of self-regulation that emerge with experience&lt;br/&gt;(within a domain, topic, or task), teachers can provide information and&lt;br/&gt;opportunities to students of all ages that will help them become strategic,&lt;br/&gt;motivated, and independent learners. There are, however, several theoretical and&lt;br/&gt;empirical issues that need further research before practical classroom&lt;br/&gt;implications can be put forth. How do students' regulate their own learning when&lt;br/&gt;using a hypermedia environment to learn about complex science topics? Which&lt;br/&gt;processes related to self- and co-regulation do student pairs and teachers use&lt;br/&gt;during collaborative learning of complex science topics with hypermedia? What&lt;br/&gt;kinds of instructional conditions are more effective in fostering SRL? How can&lt;br/&gt;science teachers provide information and opportunities to students of all ages&lt;br/&gt;that can help them become more strategic, motivated, and independent learners?&lt;br/&gt;Can SRL be taught explicitly as a set of skills or is it a developmental process&lt;br/&gt;that emerges from experience (within a task, topic, or domain).This NSF Career project will explore these&lt;br/&gt;questions through research that forges new directions in the area of students'&lt;br/&gt;self-regulated learning of two complex science topics (the circulatory system&lt;br/&gt;and ecological systems) with hypermedia environments (CircSysWeb and RiverWeb).&lt;br/&gt;In doing so, the research goals will be: (1) To scale-up research on&lt;br/&gt;self-regulated learning across developmental levels and contexts; (2) To examine&lt;br/&gt;the role of self- and co-regulation during individual and collaborative learning&lt;br/&gt;with hypermedia environments; (3) To examine the effectiveness of&lt;br/&gt;co-construction of goals (between teacher and students) during learning of&lt;br/&gt;science with hypermedia environments; (4) To examine the effectiveness of&lt;br/&gt;strategy instruction training in fostering students' self- and co-regulated&lt;br/&gt;learning with hypermedia; and, (5) To examine the effectiveness of adaptive&lt;br/&gt;web-based hypermedia environments in detecting, modeling, and fostering&lt;br/&gt;students' self- and co-regulated learning of science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
