<AbstractNarration>The research combines interdisciplinary study in geology, paleontology, and biology, using stable isotope and radiocarbon analyses, to examine how climate change and resource utilization have  influenced population distribution, movement, and diet in penguins during the mid-to-late Holocene.  Previous investigations have demonstrated that abandoned colonies contain well-preserved remains that can be used to examine differential responses of penguins to climate change in various sectors of Antarctica.  As such, the research team will investigate abandoned and active pygoscelid penguin (Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo) colonies in the Antarctic Peninsula and Ross Sea regions, and possibly Prydz Bay, in collaboration with Chinese scientists during four field seasons.  Stable isotope analyses will be conducted on recovered penguin tissues and prey remains in guano to address hypotheses on penguin occupation history, population movement, and diet in relation to climate change since the late Pleistocene. The study will include one Ph.D., two Masters and 16 undergraduate students in advanced research over the project period. Students will be exposed to a variety of fields, the scientific method, and international scientific research.  They will complete field and lab research for individual projects or Honor's theses for academic credit. The project also will include web-based outreach, lectures to middle school students, and the development of interactive exercises that highlight hypothesis-driven research and the ecology of Antarctica. Two undergraduate students in French and Spanish languages at UNCW will be hired to assist in translating the Web page postings for broader access to this information.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This was a 5-year project funded by the Antarctic Sciences (ANT) program with a no-cost extension to 31 Aug. 2015. The primary objectives in this study were to sample tissues (feathers, eggshell, etc.) from active and abandoned pygoscelid penguin colonies in Antarctica, and to use these tissues to assess dietary shifts in the past as well as variations in diet and mercury exposure among living populations.  The occupation history and movement of penguins with climate change since the last ice age also was investigated.  Tissue sampling was accomplished over four field seasons in the Antarctic Peninsula and Ross Sea regions.  Stable isotope (&delta;15N and &delta;13C) and mercury analyses were completed on these tissues at the University of Saskatchewan and the University of North Carolina Wilmington.  In additional, Chinese collaborators collected and analyzed sediment samples from active and abandoned penguin colonies to assess bio-elements in the soil due to penguin activities.  Tissue samples from abandoned colonies, were excavated from small test pits (1x1 m2 or 50x50 cm2) with the pits then backfilled, with any surface vegetation replaced, at the end of the excavations to minimize environmental disturbances.   This project has been highly productive and has resulted in 35 publications (eight with Chinese colleagues) in peer-reviewed journals that are directly or partly related to this research and 34 presentations at professional meetings, seminars, conferences and public events. These publications document modern penguin diet and niche partitioning, analyses of prey remains, penguin occupation history in the Antarctic Peninsula and Ross Sea over the past 10,000+ years, and tests for dietary shifts in relation to the krill surplus hypothesis that states that penguins switched to krill as their main prey only ~200 years ago.

The project investigators also interacted with approximately 600 elementary and high school students via classroom presentations, web based question/answer sessions, and online blog postings while in Antarctica from 2008 to 2013.
