<AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY 2007.  The goal of the fellowship is to increase the participation of minority scientists at the postdoctoral level and to prepare them for positions of scientific leadership in US science. To attain this goal, the fellowship provides opportunities for postdoctoral training and research of the highest quality to recent doctoral recipients.   It is expected that Fellows supported through these fellowships will play important roles in training of the future workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research and training plan is entitled "Comparison of the mode of action of two host-selective toxins."  Pyrenophora tritici-repentis is the fungus that causes tan spot in wheat.  It synthesizes host-selective toxins that act as virulence factors. Ptr ToxA activity is dictated by protein internalization into host cells whereas the mechanism of Ptr ToxB (ToxB) action is unresolved. Whether these toxins access the plant cell similarly is being investigated by: (1) determining effects on the cell wall-plasma membrane-cytoskeleton continuum; (2) comparing effects on basic plant defense responses; and (3) identifying the site of action of ToxB.   The sponsoring scientist for this fellowship is Lynda M. Ciuffetti at Oregon State University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The training objectives include learning techniques in biochemistry and cell biology for the Fellow who is experienced in plant molecular biology.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
