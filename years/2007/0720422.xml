<AbstractNarration>This project will investigate the effects of strong solar wind driving on Earth's magnetosphere. Strong driving produces a variety of responses including isolated magnetic substorms, sawtooth injection events, and steady magnetospheric convection (SMC). These response modes are associated with magnetic storms which usually exhibit frequent substorms during the main phase, but sometimes have no substorms, or simple activations, or random substorms, or substorm sequences. It is likely that the particular response mode depends on the state of solar wind and/or the state of the magnetosphere. It is possible that sudden fluctuations in the solar wind trigger a transition from one mode to another.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary objective of this project is to define the state of the solar wind and the magnetosphere during each response mode. The instantaneous state of a variable is represented by a dynamic cumulative probability distribution (cdf) calculated from ensemble arrays with events as rows centered at a significant fiducial time such as the start or end of a storm main phase, or the beginning of a specific response mode. A broad window is advanced across the array in epoch time and data from all events are used to calculate the time variations in the cdf relative to the reference time. The state of the solar wind or magnetosphere is defined by a collection of contour maps of the cdfs for different important variables. A secondary objective is to represent the coupling between the solar wind and common measures of magnetospheric activity using local linear filters. These filters are calculated with a novel technique that determines the linear impulse response function at the center of a broad time window advanced across the ensemble arrays. The filters are represented by maps of the response function as a function of epoch time, and time series such as filter area. Systematic changes in the response should be evident as changes in the size or shape of the prediction filter. The third objective is to determine the importance of solar wind triggers in initiating or ending specific response modes. Large lists of solar wind dynamic pressure pulses and interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) changes will be associated with lists of magnetospheric response changes such as substorm onset and sawtooth injection onsets. Results will be portrayed by joint and marginal probability distributions with variable time delay of trigger and time delay of onset relative to preceding southward turning of the IMF.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will advance understanding of the physical processes responsible for changes in the magnetosphere's response to changes in the solar wind.  The new results will increase the accuracy of space weather forecasts in terms of the type of response expected and quantitatively through the creation of time dependent prediction filters. The results will provide guidance to numerical modelers of solar wind coupling. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide an opportunity to combine the experience and data resources of two major research groups at UCLA in America and the St. Petersburg State University in Russia.  The U.S. group will use statistical analysis of long time series while the Russian group will perform detailed studies of specific events. AT UCLA this project will provide an opportunity for several young research scientists, graduate students, and undergraduates to be involved in space weather research. Additionally, the project will make the database that will be created available to the space physics research community.  This will be done using the NASA funded Virtual Magnetospheric Observatory.</AbstractNarration>
