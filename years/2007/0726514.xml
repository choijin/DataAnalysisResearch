<AbstractNarration>"Theoretical Foundations for Reliable Computing in Unreliable Mobile ad hoc Networks"&lt;br/&gt;Nancy Lynch, MIT CSAIL&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is developing theoretical foundations---formal models, complexity measures, abstract problem definitions, algorithms, and impossibility results---to explain what can and what cannot be computed reliably in realistic, unreliable mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). The long-range goal of this work is to provide guidance for building high quality, reliable, high performance applications for such networks.  Motivating applications include data management, communication, and coordination (e.g., of people, robots, or vehicles).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The assumed MANET model consists of a collection of mobile nodes, moving according to specified constraints.  A special ``real world'' component provides the mobile nodes with approximate information about the current time and their own locations.  Nodes communicate using local wireless radio broadcast, subject to realistic message delivery constraints.  A ``contention manager'' component encapsulates strategies such as exponential backoff, advising nodes about when they are likely to be able to transmit successfully.  A ``collision detector'' component provides (possibly unreliable) information to each node about messages that it might not have received.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some problems being studied arise directly from MANET applications.  &lt;br/&gt;Others describe abstractions that are intended to simplify the task of writing applications, such as leader and cluster management services, group membership services, location services, and virtual networks.  The need for reliability arises from reliability requirements of the applications and from the need for abstractions with clear guarantees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results being sought are:&lt;br/&gt;(1) Definitions of realistic MANET models.&lt;br/&gt;(2) Definitions of application and abstraction problems with strong reliability requirements.&lt;br/&gt;(3) Efficient algorithms and corresponding impossibility results for these problems.&lt;br/&gt;(4) Integration of individual algorithmic results to yield end-to-end guarantees for high-level problems in terms of the basic MANET model.</AbstractNarration>
