    <AbstractNarration>Integrative, Hybrid and Complex Systems&lt;br/&gt;Ian F. Akyildiz&lt;br/&gt;Georgia Institute of Technology&lt;br/&gt;Cross-layer Communication Module for Ultra Wide Band Based Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The availability of inexpensive hardware, such as complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) cameras and microphones that are able to capture multimedia content from the environment, has fostered the development of wireless multimedia sensor networks (WMSNs). WMSNs consist of wirelessly-connected devices that allow retrieving video and audio streams, still images, and scalar sensor data. The realization of WMSNs requires the sensor network paradigm to be rethought in view of the need for mechanisms to deliver multimedia content with a predefined level of quality of service (QoS). In view of these challenges, the objective of this project is to develop a novel cross-layer module for multimedia traffic in WMSNs. Several key elements will be investigated to provide QoS and to exploit the correlation that is present in WMSNs. The architecture of WMSNs will be first developed. Then, a cross-layer controller unit, which enforces network layer QoS support, will be developed. To capture the correlation present in WMSNs, a theoretical framework will be developed. Based on this framework, an application-aware cross-layer module will be developed, with the goal of establishing routes between correlated nodes to enable in-network processing and further improve the energy efficiency of the network. Our communication module will deliver QoS to heterogeneous applications in WMSNs by combining cross-layer interactions among functionalities handled at different layers of an ultra-wideband (UWB) protocol stack with correlation-aware multimedia processing techniques, which will be used to reduce in-network the amount of data to be transmitted according to application requirements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research has the potential to impact wireless multimedia sensor network research and technology. Topics on wireless multimedia sensor networks with ample input from the research will be introduced in two classes taught by the principal investigator at Georgia Tech. The project will support two graduate students. The development of a cross-layer protocol suite in the context of a simulator will serve as an evaluation platform for future researchers. The results from the proposed work will be published in conferences and journals.</AbstractNarration>
