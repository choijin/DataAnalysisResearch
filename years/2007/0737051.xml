<AbstractNarration>Engineering - Electrical (55)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project, a collaboration effort  between University of Texas at Austin and University of Texas-Pan American, is developing laboratory experiments with learning materials on wind turbine technologies and wind power system for undergraduate-level engineering courses. These materials are intended for use in a stand-alone dedicated course in wind energy and power systems or as a component in a more general power systems course.  The project team is using the principles of How People Learn with challenged-based learning methods to achieve a better learning experience. Each experiment is formulated and presented as a challenge. Students then pursue the challenge systematically by going through each learning phase, i.e., generating ideas, viewing it from multiple perspectives, researching and revising, testing, and going public. Materials developed with this approach are creating and promoting effective learning environments characterized with knowledge-, learner-, assessment-, and community-centered learning dimensions. The laboratories encompass computer simulations and hardware laboratory experiments of wind turbine technologies and wind power system operations. The inclusion of both types of experiments facilitates transferability, adaptation, and dissemination of the materials to other universities. Evaluation efforts are using an assortment of techniques (i. e, surveys, focus groups, interviews, and student product analysis) to determine the students' perceptions about the material effectiveness and changes in their understanding and interest.  Dissemination involves website posting, conference and journal presentations and papers, and a targeted effort to reach a half a dozen other schools with large power systems programs.   Broader impacts include the dissemination of the material, strengthening and propelling the emerging wind power industry, and focused efforts on Hispanic students.</AbstractNarration>
