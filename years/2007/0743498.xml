<AbstractNarration>Large outbreaks of native bark beetles (Dendroctonus spp.) are occurring throughout coniferous forests of western North America, from western Alaska to the U.S. Southwest and are believed to be related to climatic warming. In Colorado more than 270,000 hectares of lodgepole pine forests have recently been infested by mountain pine beetle (MPB) (D. ponderosae), which has led to widespread public concern about increased fire hazard following beetle kill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research addresses four key questions about interactions of wildfire, outbreaks and climate and their potential cross-scale feedbacks in subalpine forests in northern Colorado. 1) How does climatic variation at seasonal, annual, and multi-decadal time scales affect the initiation and spread of MPB outbreaks across complex landscapes? 2) How does the landscape heterogeneity created by prior disturbance by fire affect the risk and/or spread of subsequent disturbance by MPB outbreak across complex landscapes? 3) How does the landscape heterogeneity created by prior disturbance by MPB affect the fuel hazard and risk of wildfire across complex landscapes? 4) How do context-specific contingencies between climate and the landscape affect the initiation and spread of wildfire and MPB outbreaks?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will examine possible feedbacks between wildfires and bark beetle outbreaks across different spatial scales and under varying climatic conditions. The research and associated outreach will improve understanding of the influence of beetle kill on future fire risk, which is of broad current interest to resource managers, the fire mitigation community and the public living in the bark-beetle affected areas. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Large outbreaks of native bark beetles (Dendroctonus spp.) are killing millions of trees in coniferous forests of western North America, from Alaska to the U.S. Southwest and are raising important questions about their causes as well as their implications for future conditions of these ecosystems.  This research addressed three questions about the interactions of wildfire, forest attributes, and outbreaks of mountain pine beetle (D. ponderosae) in relation to recent climate variability in subalpine forests in northern Colorado.                           1) How does climatic variation at annual and multi?decadal time scales affect the initiation and spread of MPB outbreaks across complex landscapes? To investigate potential drivers of the current MPB outbreak, we compared broad-scale spatio-temporal patterns of MPB activity in lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) and ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) from 1996 to 2010 in Colorado and southern Wyoming with regional weather fluctuations, and then tracked the annual meso-scale progression of the epidemic in lodgepole pine with respect to weather, topographic, previous MPB activity, and forest stand attributes. Warm temperatures and annual precipitation favorable to beetle populations showed high regional synchrony across areas of both pine species, suggesting habitat interacts with weather in synchronizing MPB populations. Spatio-temporal analyses identified multiple, disjunct locations of incipient MPB activity (epicenters) in lodgepole pine, which overlapped an earlier 1980s MPB outbreak, and suggests a regional trigger (drought) across this homogenous forest type.  Negative departures from mean annual precipitation played a key role in subsequent spread of MPB outbreak. Initial development of the outbreak was also associated with lower elevations, greater dominance by lodgepole pine, stands of larger tree size, and stands with higher percentage canopy cover.  After epidemic levels of MPB activity were attained, MPB activity was less strongly associated with stand and weather variables.      2) How does the landscape heterogeneity created by prior disturbance by fire affect the risk and/or spread of subsequent disturbance by MPB outbreak across complex landscapes?  We investigated how time since the last stand-replacing fire affects stand susceptibility to MPB outbreaks in these forests.  We hypothesized that at a stand-scale, young post-fire stands (&lt; c. 100&ndash;150 years old) are less susceptible to past and current MPB outbreaks than are older stands. We used tree-ring methods to date the post-fire origins and history of MPB outbreaks in 23 lodgepole stands in northern Colorado.  Stands were affected by MPB outbreaks in the 1940s/50s, 1980s and 2000s/2010s.  Susceptibility to outbreaks generally increased with stand age (i.e. time since the last stand-replacing fire).  However, this reduced susceptibility of younger post-fire stands was most pronounced for the 1940s/50s outbreak, less so for the 1980s outbreak, and did not hold true for the 2000s/10s outbreak. Younger stands may not have been less susceptible to the most recent outbreak because (1) after stands reach a threshold age of &gt; 100&ndash;150 years, stand age does not affect susceptibility to outbreaks, or (2) the high intensity of the most recent outbreak reduces the importance of pre-disturbance conditions for susceptibility to disturbance.  Future increases in wildfire activity create stand structures that are likely to reduce the future extent or severity of MPB outbreaks.      3) How does the landscape heterogeneity created by MPB outbreaks affect the fuel hazard and risk of wildfire across complex landscapes?  Using empirical fuels data we modeled potential fire behavior across a gradient of wind speeds and moisture scenarios in Green stands compared to stands in three stages post-MPB attack (Red [1-3 yrs], Grey [4-10 yrs], and Old-MPB [~30 yrs]). MPB killed 50% of the trees and 70% of the basal area in Red ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
