<AbstractNarration>This is a proposal for a one-day conference on algebraic geometry, to be held at Brown University, Providence, RI, on June 2, 2007.&lt;br/&gt;It will focus on the current, exciting developments in mathematics whose origin goes back to the work of David Mumford. It is expected that 80-120 participants will attend the conference, including 45-60 postdocs and graduate students. Some participants of a workshop on vision and neuroscience in honor of David Mumford, at Newport, RI on June 1, 2007, will also attend the conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mumford's work helped shape a huge swath of algebraic geometry. There are many broad fields which remain dominated by his influence to this very day.&lt;br/&gt;There will be five colloquium-style lectures in this conference, each giving an account of our present state of understanding in one area of algebraic geometry, and present the fascinating open problems that remain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The five speakers and their topics are:&lt;br/&gt;(i) V. Alexeev (University of Georgia): geometric invariant theory, stability of algebraic varieties, stability of vector bundles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(ii) I. Krichever (Columbia University):  characterization of Jacobian varieties among abelian varieties (the Schottky problem).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(iii) M. Rapoport (University of Bonn): moduli of abelian varieties and p-divisible groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(iv) V. Shokurov (Johns Hopkins University): the classification of higher dimensional algebraic varieties, and the finite generation of the canonical ring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(v) U. Tillmann (Oxford University): the topology of the moduli space of curves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By bringing together people who work in diverse areas, as well as graduate students and early-career researchers, we hope to promote progress and innovation in these important fields. Considerable broader impact is expected:&lt;br/&gt;the conference will provide a forum for young researchers to discuss their work with senior scientists, and for pure mathematicians to exchange ideas with vision scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference is also supported by the Clay Mathematics Institute.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
