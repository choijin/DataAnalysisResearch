<AbstractNarration>Observations show substantial variations in the intensity of both tropical and midlatitude-summertime deep convection (e.g., thunderstorm activity) that are not well explained by established measures of the atmosphere's instability based on simple principles. These classic treatments address properties of undiluted parcels of air ascending from a uniformly heated flat surface relative to their surrounding environment to determine the maximum updraft intensity and height achieved by convective clouds. This research will employ model calculations capable of resolving multiple factors influencing such clouds to better understand and quantify the role of variable mid-level atmospheric moisture, heterogeneity in surface heating, and surface orography (i.e. sloped and elevated terrain) in determining their vigor. Resulting improvements in simplified representations of these intricate effects (termed "parameterizations") will ultimately improve global climate models. The primary cloud-resolving numerical system used in this exploration will be the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, which will be supplemented by more idealized calculations to help understand departures of convective cloud vigor from that predicted by simple parcel theory and to more fully disentangle cause and effect. This strategy will involve carefully designed groups (ensembles) of WRF model runs to systematically explore changes in cloud behavior as a function of key environmental factors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this work rests on advancing our basic understanding of moist buoyantly-driven atmospheric convection through a hierarchy of conceptual and numerical models, which will allow researchers to develop and test basic hypotheses concerning factors that control the vigor and heat transport properties of convection, and ultimately the role of such clouds as a form of "turbulence" within the global atmospheric circulation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of this work will include contributions toward more accurate simulations of local/regional weather and global climate, as well as means to more reliably anticipate expected changes in convective activity in the presence of climate change. Training of an undergraduate student in basic elements of design and operation of cloud-resolving models (suitable as an introduction to a chosen career in meteorology for that student) and enhanced exposure of public school students to science through the "DEMOS" program (a Yale University undergraduate organization that does outreach in the surrounding area) will be additional impacts of this effort.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The specific goal of the NSF funded study was to better understand why continental convection is so much stronger than maritime convection. Differences in moisture (convective available potential energy &ndash; CAPE), aerosols or topography do not appear to be large enough to account for the observed differences in convective severity over land compared with oceans. For example, updraft speeds in continental storms are consistently stronger by about an order of magnitude than maritime storms. We propose that this variation in updraft speed is the primary reason why lightning is ~10 times more likely to occur over land than over water.  The majority of studies of tropical convection have focused  on the following causes of convective vigor variations; thicker continental boundary layers leading to fatter updrafts that entrain less and thus lose less buoyancy to dilution, the influence of humidity, Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE) or aerosols (i.e. microphysics).  In contrast, our research study has shown that the primary reason for stronger updrafts is surface heterogeneity. Certain æresonantÆ horizontal heating length scales (i.e. hot spot size or width of heated patches) dynamically force strong updrafts. In other words, we find that dry boundary layer dynamics (0-2 km) plays a major role in determining the vigor of deep moist convective updrafts (5-15 km).  Our research employed a combination of cloud resolving numerical models, satellite observations and analytical models to confirm our hypothesis that strong continental convection is mainly attributable to size of surface heating and that the contributions of sounding differences, boundary layer thickness, or aerosols are negligible.  An offshoot from our studies of deep convection was a paper  on shallow dry convection which examined the role of constant or varying surface heating on the propagation of density currents or sea breezes. We found that as the ground is heated over the day, the speed of a sea-breeze will grow non-linearly as more and more cool sea air is fed over the ground to the  head of the density current. This increases the horizontal temperature gradient across the head accelerating the current.   Outcomes of this research include 4 papers in peer reviewed journals and one in a general audience non-peer reviewed magazine. In addition, movies of simulations  of  atmospheric convection developed in this research were used in undergraduate classes to show the students some state of the art mesoscale atmospheric modelling.   The broader impacts of this work include contributions toward more accurate simulations of local/regional weather and global climate, as well as offering a means to more reliably anticipate expected changes in convective activity in the presence of climate change.
