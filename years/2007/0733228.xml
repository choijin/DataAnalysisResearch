<AbstractNarration>Building on previous ITEST funding, the PI is designing and developing a set of curriculum materials centering on a revised version of the NSF funded TekBot robotics platform developed by Oregon State University. Having added to the TekBot, a new robot, called NUBot is being developed by the Technology Development Corporation of the Peter Keitit Institute of the University of Nebraska. These robots are substantially less expensive, than most major commercial kits and use off the shelf parts from local electronics suppliers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The leadership team creates materials for grades 5-8 that address and assess STEM concepts through a robotics curriculum. The curriculum addresses STEM standards through such documents as the NCTM Focal Points and the Atlas of Science Literacy. There are three problem based ways in which students can use the TekBot: building, moving, and programming. The intent is to scale up to a cyber-infrastructure that supports the national distribution and implementation of the curriculum. The cyber-infrastructure provides for summer workshops, distance education, a means of permitting teachers to identify lesson plans based upon their educational objectives, and an internet on call technician as means of teacher professional development.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The Silicon Prairie Initiative for Robotics in Information Technology project (SPIRIT 2.0) focused on developing an interactive online curriculum for the teaching of middle school mathematics and science topics using educational robotics. The project has shown very positive results related to field tests of student STEM-concept learning and interests, as well as increased teacher knowledge in problem-based learning, robotics, and STEM concepts. Thirteen refereed publications have resulted to date for showcasing these results, including significant contributions to a 2012 international book called Robots in K12 Education: A New Technology for Learning.  The SPIRIT projectÆs intellectual merit lies in the development of its replicable curriculum model and open-source robotics platform for teaching mathematics and science concepts using educational robotics at the middle school level.  The educational robotics platform developed is relatively flexible, inexpensive, and expandable and is called the CEENBoT (Computer and Electronics Engineering Robot).  It is now being produced routinely by a University of Nebraska startup company (CEENBoT Inc.) which was also established as a direct outcome of the project.  The CEENBoT robotics platform itself includes the capability to be programmed in many different ways for students, including by use of a TI Graphing Calculator, an Application Programming Interface (API) or an open-source Graphical Programming Interface (GPI), which allows for a diversity of programming options that can control numerous add-on devices to the robot, such as sensors and cameras.  The open-source environment of the CEENBoT platform allows the students to find new parts from commercial hobby stores or electronics outlets, and to use their own creativity in platform expansion.  The SPIRIT project has also established a wide array of instructional materials and assessments supporting this open-source platform for STEM learning.    For its broader impacts, the SPIRIT project has also now directly supported intense professional  development activities for more than 500 mathematics and science  teachers (primarily middle school) in educational robotics, in extended  multi-day workshops, that have also led to some very creative ideas for  the teaching of STEM concepts and topics.  Many  of these SPIRIT teachers have even started their own educational  robotics courses, programs or after school programs at their local  schools, based on their positive experiences with the project.   In support of these impacts, the SPIRIT project has also held five different annual Nebraska Robotics  Expos, that have directly engaged more than 10,000 youth in educational  robotics competitions and showcase events.  This impressive event was even showcased in 2013, by public television, and that video can be accessed at:  http://www.nelovesps.org/watchnow?TN=PROJECT-20130226111910  The SPIRIT project has also contributed more than 300 comprehensive educational robotics modules, which have been developed, as well as tested and refined by SPIRIT teachers for instructional delivery within an interactive cyberinfrastructure that is also linked to specific released standardized test questions in mathematics and science for assessment.  The lesson cyberinfrastructure for the SPIRIT 2.0 Project includes an innovative modular lesson design, that partitions lessons into five components, including A - asking questions, E &ndash; exploring learning, I &ndash; instructing learning, O &ndash; organizing learning, and U &ndash; understanding what has been learned.  Lessons can be easily searched and combined by a teacher, along with a variety of classroom assessments that can be used to create a tailor-made sequence of activities for classroom learning.  Each of the lessons is also professionally illustrated and even includes humorous content-related cartoons that further provide insight into STEM concepts.
