<AbstractNarration>The objective of this career development plan is to investigate new&lt;br/&gt;probabilistic methods for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM)&lt;br/&gt;that will improve the precision and scale of robotic mapping in ocean&lt;br/&gt;science.  The proposed methodology will scale to multiple&lt;br/&gt;heterogeneous vehicles, allow for extended exploration over long time&lt;br/&gt;durations and over multiple spatial scales, and be robust to the&lt;br/&gt;challenging limitations of the underwater environment. Many land/air&lt;br/&gt;SLAM methods are largely inapplicable underwater because of (a) a lack&lt;br/&gt;of point features of unstructured seafloor, and (b) the rapid&lt;br/&gt;attenuation of electromagnetic, optical, and acoustic radiation in&lt;br/&gt;comparison to land, air, and space.  The proposed multi-vehicle&lt;br/&gt;multi-scalar SLAM navigation framework overcomes these challenges by&lt;br/&gt;fusing information from three disparate technologies: 1) real-time&lt;br/&gt;vision-based seafloor navigation, 2) inertial navigation systems, and&lt;br/&gt;3) acoustic modem-based communication, to create a flexible navigation&lt;br/&gt;framework that allows for inter-nodal ranging and data sharing among&lt;br/&gt;heterogeneous nodes.  By leveraging the perception and localization&lt;br/&gt;capability of neighboring vehicles via a (low-bandwidth) distributed&lt;br/&gt;estimation framework, the proposed methodology will provide a&lt;br/&gt;cooperative navigation framework that will yield improved precision&lt;br/&gt;and scale in underwater robotic mapping for ocean science.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
