<AbstractNarration>This research asks, "What is the cyber-equivalent of a fingerprint -- that staple of forensic investigation in the physical world?"  If one is able to identify users forensically by their "fingerprints" in cyberspace, what would correspond to the familiar loops, whorls and minutiae of physical evidence?  It is hypothesized that just as a person may be identified by his handwriting, or by his manner of expression in prose, so may a person be identified by his typing style -- the particular rhythm of a user's keystrokes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The approach being investigated is keystroke dynamics, the use of precise keystroke timings as a mechanism for building unique user profiles for differentiating among users.  Goals of the work are to determine whether keystrokes can be used to identify/authenticate users in two-factor authentication protocols, whether user keystroke patterns can be used to thwart insider attacks, and whether keystroke habits are sufficiently distinct to show who issued a command or typed a document.  The work will develop the science, methodologies and techniques to answer such questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of the project are expected to provide a basis for substantial increases in on-line security in applications such as web-based financial transactions, two-factor authentication in various domains, and questioned-document forensics.  The involvement of students, minorities, jurists and lay people in the scientific process will raise community awareness regarding computer forensic techniques, and will provide a foundation for rigorous experimental science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[This project concerned the use of whatÆs called a behavioral biometric.  The biometrics with which we are most familiar are physical biometrics, such as fingerprints or iris scans; fingers and irises are parts of your body that, in general, donÆt change, and are unique to each individual.  Contrary to physical biometrics, behavioral biometrics look at ways in which you behave, that also donÆt change, and are also said to be unique to individuals.  Gait, or the way you walk, is one example of a behavioral biometric; we all know someone who walks in an odd manner, and from the walking style we can tell who it is, even at a distance.  A new behavioral biometric, typing rhythm (also called keystroke dynamics), concerns the unique ways that you strike the keys on a typewriter or computer keyboard as you send email or write documents or even just log in and enter your password.  Each different person tends to have a different typing rhythm, and if these rhythms are unique to individuals, then your typing behavior could be used as a way to identify you at, say, login time; your typing style could serve as your password, because no one but you could type it as you do. The project had three primary goals: (1) determine whether people can be distinguished from one another on the basis of their typing rhythms; (2) establish a basis for applying rigorous scientific/experimental methods to keystroke analysis, as well as to analogous areas of computer science; and (3) make improvements in the basic understanding keystroke typing rhythms as biometric indicators. Our best result for matching a person to his/her typing rhythm was 99.97% correct. We discovered that there are many factors influencing keystroke behaviors used as biometrics.  The computer-based clock used to time keystrokes needs to be more accurate than the typical clock in a Windows machine; more accurate clocks do exist, and when theyÆre used, there are fewer recognition errors when matching typing rhythms to individual people.  There are many ways of matching people to typing rhythms, using algorithms called classifiers.  The open literature suggests that neural nets are the best classifiers for keystroke rhythms, but an even-handed evaluation of a range of classifiers had never been done.  Our work evaluated 17 different classifiers in a controlled environment, and found that a random forest classifier is best.  For anomaly detection (for determining that a typing rhythm does not belong to a particular person), the best detector uses a measure called scaled Manhattan distance, which is a very simple metric that performs unexpectedly better than more complex metrics do. We also discovered that passphrases work better as typing-rhythm biometrics than passwords do, primarily because of their greater relative length (20-30 characters, but ones that are easily typed, taking only 4-5 seconds); their error rate is about 64% less than for short strings.  The particular contents of the passphrase matter little; the success rate is about the same, irrespective of what the passphrase is. We found that error rates in matching typing rhythms to individuals were influenced by several factors &ndash; the matching algorithm itself, the amount of training or enrollment data available, the details of how someoneÆs typing rhythm changes over a short period of time (called concept drift), and the amount of practice someone has at typing a particular set of letters or words.  While most investigators focus on the matching algorithm for reducing error, we found that the matching algorithm is much less a factor than the mere variation within individuals, suggesting that reducing such variability would go farther toward making typing rhythms a reliable biometric than would changes in matching algorithms. One implication of our work lies in having fashioned a rigorous and highly scientific way of approaching the problems of finding and matching patterns in typing rhythms.  This scientific approach, c...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
