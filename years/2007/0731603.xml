<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the URM program at Arkansas State University (Research Internships in Science of the Environment- University Program, RISE-UP, is to produce highly competent undergraduate students who successfully enroll  and complete graduate degrees in the biological sciences.  Specifically, RISE-UP seeks to increase access and opportunity for students traditionally under-represented in the biological sciences. Students will be engaged in their first college year in a series of activities dedicated to fostering the following learning outcomes: Problem Identification Skills, Problem Characterization Skills, Communication Competency (oral, written, and technological), Research Skills, and Analytical Skills. Within their first year in the program students will be engaged in meaningful research that leads to presentation at national/international conferences and to publication of their research findings in the peer-reviewed scientific literature.  Using an apprentice model, faculty mentors will be engaged in life-long mentorship of undergraduate students in the classroom, research setting and beyond the undergraduate degree. Students participating in RISE-UP will complete their undergraduate degrees and successfully enroll in a research-based graduate program in the biological sciences. To realize these objectives, students will become members of one of 4 collaborative cross-disciplinary research teams.  Each team is led by a senior faculty member with significant experience mentoring undergraduate researchers and consists of 3-5 mentors who are focused on a research project that leverages University strengths in the agri-environmental and molecular biosciences.  The research focus of these four groups are: Evolution of Streams through Urban and Rural Landscapes, Molecular Diagnostics &amp; High-throughput Technologies, Nanotoxicology and Metabolite Identification.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Arkansas State University URM provided research opportunities to high school and undergraduate students who are members of underrepresented minorities.  In the process we interacted with high school teachers, parents, family members and friends of these students which increases their knowledge of science and of the importance of research as well as information about career and training opportunities for their students, children and community members.     By identifying, recruiting and training high school students who are members of underrepresented minorities this project increased their interest in pursuing STEM degrees and careers in science.  By providing a supportive peer group and specialized training and educational opportunities this URM enhanced participantsÆ access to educational opportunities thereby increasing the likelihood of participants eventually earning the advanced degrees necessary to a career in science. Undergraduate and High School student participants worked with their mentors and other undergraduate and graduate students on research projects focused on questions covering a range of disciplines&mdash;from environmental chemistry to tropical fish ecology. During the funding period 40 URM research fellows working with 21 faculty mentors were supported. 15 of these students have graduated, 12 with degrees in STEM majors, 3 are enrolled in graduate programs, 2 are engaged in research careers and 4 others have applied or soon will apply to graduate degree programs. 21 of the fellows are currently enrolled in undergraduate programs, all but one of them is in a STEM major.

Nine of the high school students continued to participate in the URM as undergraduates.

Student researchers also participated in larger biweekly research group meetings--depending on their research interests, either in the Plant Biotechnology Research group or in the Animal Research Group meeting.

Nine URM students were fellows in the ASU McNair Achievement program. In addition to a large number of science seminars (many hosted by URM mentors) available to participating students (http://www2.astate.edu/a/scimath/science-seminars-series.dot ), training and enrichment seminars were held in conjunction with the ASU McNair Achievement Program and ArkLSAMP.

The College of Science and Mathematics established a living and learning community for 50 STEM students (http://www2.astate.edu/dotAsset/211624.pdf ).  The URM and its emphasis on undergraduate student research was a key ingredient of this effort.  The URM provided partial support to 9 different URM fellows who lived in the community.     By developing linkages to other programs and institutes we were able to greatly expand the number of student participants and mentors during the funding period.  We also increased the opportunities available to student researchers to interact with their peers, with mentors who are themselves members of underrepresented minorities and significant exposure to new...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
