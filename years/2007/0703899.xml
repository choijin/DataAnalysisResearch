<AbstractNarration>This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program supports the NSF Inorganic Chemistry Workshop organized by Professors Craig Hill at Emory University and Andreja Bakac at Iowa State University.  Modern inorganic chemistry evolved from the traditional disciplines of organic, solid state and coordination chemistry and has contributed significantly to new directions of growth in these fields as well as virtually every traditional subdiscipline of chemistry. Inorganic chemistry is also serving to dissolve barriers between these subdisciplines, thereby facilitating the potential for new collaborative research. The NSF Inorganic Chemistry Workshop is a unique national academic/industrial/government laboratory forum that brings together a diverse set of participants from all branches of inorganic chemistry.   An effort is made to bring in workers from interfacial areas to encourage new research initiatives.  The format of the Workshop is to bring together small groups of chemists from academia, industry, and private and government research institutes.  The Workshop also assembles researchers from different regions of the US and in different stages of their careers. The Workshop's goal is not to promote the presentation of completed and polished results; rather, the Workshop encourages informal and detailed discussion of investigations in early stages of progress. It stresses emerging ideas, new techniques, and unsolved problems instead of completed results, thereby promoting the maximum transfer of information, suggestions, criticism, and collaborative expertise. This format allows time for both semi-formal talks with ample time for questions and discussion.</AbstractNarration>
