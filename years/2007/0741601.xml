<AbstractNarration>This project will create and study Kids' Survey Network as an exemplar of a new, replicable model of informal learning called an apprenticeship network. The project will develop the data literacy of future learners, workers, and citizens by empowering participants aged 11-14 to develop survey projects to address their own questions about local community issues. Research on the project will illuminate core questions relating to the design and potential impact of the apprenticeship network, including social and motivational dynamics, community and technology-based scaffolding, educational game genres, and conditions of effective use. The project deliverables include four components: (1) a web-based community of practice; (2) a common set of tools; (3) a suite of learning games and tutorials; and (4) structures for tiered, team-based advancement. Tertl Studios LLC and MIT's Education Arcade will develop the learning games, SRI International will conduct the evaluation, leading regional and national informal education organizations will provide test bed sites, and professional survey research organizations will provide technical and volunteer assistance</AbstractNarration>

At the same time, this project demonstrated how substantial contact time in out-of-school settings could translate into high-quality STEM learning characterized by depth, rigor, and conceptual change.  In collaboration with Tertl Studos LLC, the MIT Education Arcade, and SRI International, TERC created kidsurvey.org.

KSN was developed through work with 5 afterschool programs at 12 sites in 4 states (MA, CT, MI, and CA) in which 19 KSN teams of 4-15 learners were formed. Typically KSN was offered 90-120 minutes once a week for 10 weeks.  Overall, KSN has demonstrated its potential as an effective on-ramp to data literacy, offering enjoyment and intellectual challenge. Kids saw survey projects as "hard fun": Kids liked taking, making, and seeing others respond to their surveys. As they advanced in KSN, they recognized the hard work involved in a high-quality survey project. KSN games were compelling: Kids spent hours playing KSN games like Space Chase, persisting through failures in attempts to advance levels (Rowe, et al., 2011). KSN participants became more data-literate: Pilot studies showed that some KSN participants understood data literacy concepts and skills better and became more interested in survey research. Early results showed statistically significant gains in their data literacy skills including understanding surveys are guided by a purpose and accurately interpreting survey results and plots. Later results on pre-post assessments were of the same size as earlier results, but not statistically significant due to the smaller number of participants.
