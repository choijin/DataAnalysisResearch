<AbstractNarration>Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research considers the question of what constitutes identities in cryptography. Typical  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; examples of identities include a person's name and social-security number, or fingerprint/iris-scan,  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; or address, or a (non-revoked) Public-Key coming from some trusted public-key infrastructure. In  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; many situations, however, where the person is located defines his or her identity. For example,  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; we know the role of a bank-teller behind a bullet-proof bank window not because he shows us his  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; credentials but by merely knowing his location. One of the questions that this research focuses  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; on is the following: is it possible to have the "geographical position" of a device take part in &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  defining the set of credentials this device has? What are the new possibilities in terms of what  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; can be achieved in this setting? First, this research examines the central task in this setting,  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; i.e., securely verifying the position of a device. Despite much work in this area, our preliminary  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; findings show that in the "vanilla" (i.e., standard) model, the above task of secure positioning is  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; impossible to achieve.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This research focuses on a different model: to study the proof of position in the bounded storage  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; model (i.e. where we assume some bound on the total memory of the adversary). In this setting,  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; this research aims to achieve various tasks including secure positioning, position-based key exchange,  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;and more general position-based secure functionalities. The broader impact of this project is to first id&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;entify various flaws in previous attempts; second, to propose a new framework where rigorous proofs &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;are in fact possible; third, to open this important area of research for further study by putting &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;it on solid theoretical foundations. The overall aim of this project is to develop a principled &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;approach to position-based cryptography, to define key problems, and to establish both impossibility &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;results and new frameworks that are provably secure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
