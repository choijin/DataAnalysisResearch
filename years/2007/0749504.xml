<AbstractNarration>This project links two important cellular processes that were previously thought to be unrelated in plant systems: epigenetic regulation of gene expression and lipid signaling. The studies follow up on the recent discovery that the Arabidopsis ATX1, encoding a protein involved in chromatin modifications, specifically binds the lipid phosphoinositide 5-phosphate (PtdIns5P) in vitro and the two control a shared set of target genes in vivo. The long-term goal of this project is to fully characterize this novel ATX-PtdIns5P signaling pathway. The studies are aimed at gaining insights into the mechanics of the signaling mechanism, into its functioning in vivo, and at identifying other participants of the pathway. A major focus will be on studies of two Arabidopsis proteins from the myotubularin family, which, by virtue of their biochemical activity can produce the ligand, PtdInd5P.  Although myotubularins are highly conserved in the evolution of eukaryotes and play important roles in animal systems, nothing is known about myotubularin activities in plants. Plant cells provide an attractive and convenient model system to study myotubularin function at the molecular, cellular, and organismal levels. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project activities will also positively impact human resource development in Nebraska through the direct training of young scientists at the undergraduate, graduate and postgraduate level. Several small colleges in rural Nebraska supply our classes and laboratories with enthusiastic and motivated undergraduate students. In addition to UNL students, two undergraduate students from Doane College will be trained every summer. The recruitment of students from underrepresented groups will be emphasized and these students will be encouraged to consider a career in biology. Additional impacts include the development and instruction of a graduate level Developmental Genetics/Epigenetics course (BIOS910) designed to survey and to critically synthesize current topics in epigenetics.</AbstractNarration>
