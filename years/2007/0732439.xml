<AbstractNarration>A primary goal of this project is to understand species distributions in the types of communities found at the hydrothermal vents of the East Lau Spreading Center. A species? fundamental ecological niche is defined by its tolerance to abiotic conditions, with the realized niche constrained by negative inter-specific interactions, but also expanded by positive inter-specific interactions. In hydrothermal vent ecosystems the ultimate source of energy and food for the metazoans is the vent fluid, which is emitted from spatially limited areas on the sea floor. As an ecosystem, vents are somewhat atypical in that gradients of primary productivity are positively correlated with gradients of ecological stressors that include toxic chemistry and high temperatures. The resultant strong bottom up controls on species distribution at vents interact with a variety of positive and negative biological interactions to constrain the realized niche of each species. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To meet the goal of this research, the collaborating investigators will use a combination of laboratory studies, analyses of in situ observations and measurements, and manipulative experiments. To define the potential (fundamental) niches of the key, symbiont-containing fauna, they will conduct shipboard experiments in pressurized respirometers and determine their thermal tolerances and preferences, tolerances to high sulfide and low oxygen levels, and determine which sulfur species are used and released by each. In order to define the realized niches of the major fauna they will analyze spatially correlated in situ biological community and hydrothermal fluid physiochemical data. In order to understand the mechanisms that drive the differences between the fundamental and realized niches of the key fauna, they will conduct a series of in situ manipulative experiments to characterize both positive and negative interactions among the foundation species. This proposal will continue a macrobiological component of the Integrated Studies at the Ridge 2000 Lau Basin study site. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to maintaining the high level of public and secondary school outreach activity typical of these scientists, this project will be integrated into the Ridge 2000 GLOBE education program: ?From Local to Extreme Environments (FLEXE).? These scientists will host a member of the FLEXE team on each research cruise and support a graduate student to work with the educator team on the interpretation of the environmental data and imagery collected for development of new GLOBE protocols. This project will also support inter-disciplinary training of at least 5 graduate students, through summer cross-training among labs, and provide research opportunities for 6-10 undergraduate students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Hydrothermal vents, at the bottom of the ocean, are the link between the earthÆs interior and the deep sea.  There are three areas at vents: the hot focused flow commonly seen as black smokers, the plume of particles that arises from these vents and that disperses into the ocean, and lastly the diffuse flow low-temperature areas near hydrothermal vents. The latter supports life via chemosynthesis as the hydrogen sulfide (and other reduced chemical compounds) emanating from the sub-surface is oxidized with bottom water oxygen through bacterial mediation to fix carbon dioxide and produce biomass. The biomass is readily seen as tubeworms, snails, mussels, clams and other organisms. These areas are oases at the bottom of the dark ocean. Image 1 shows that mussels (Bathymodiolus brevior) surround one species of snail (Ifremeria nautilei), which in turn surrounds a second species of snail (Alviniconcha spp.).  In this collaborative study, researchers from the University of Delaware collected temperature and chemical data for 40,000 time points and locations at the Eastern Lau spreading center to understand why snails and mussels reside in apparently separate zones in diffuse flow waters.  The mean and median data (Image 2; note direction of the arrows) indicate that the organisms generally live in an increasing temperature and H2S regime in the following order: mussels (Bathymodiolus brevior), one species of snail Ifremeria nautilei then a second species of snail Alviniconcha spp.  The average and median O2 data for these organisms follow an inverse order from the temperature and H2S. The snail, Alviniconcha spp., has the ability to reside in waters that exhibit very low oxygen conditions (microaerophilic) about half the time based on median O2 data and the detection limit of the sensor. This ability indicates that these snails can live under what we would call æextreme conditionsÆ.  Also, our group has shown that a significantamount of foolÆs gold or pyrite is emitted from the hot black smoker hydrothermal vents at the bottom of the ocean as nanoparticles, which have a diameter that is one thousand times smaller than that of a human hair (Image 3 shows a hydrothermal vent with an insert of an electron micrograph showing nanoparticles of pyrite). Fool's gold consists of iron and sulfur as iron disulfide, FeS2. It is not something miners of the California gold rush in the 1840's wanted when they were looking for gold. However, fool's gold released from hydrothermal vents is as good as gold for bacteria and plankton, which need iron as a micronutrient for growth.   Although iron is a common element on land, it is present in extremely low dissolved concentrations in the ocean. Because pyrite nanoparticles are so small, they will not settle out and fall to the ocean bottom. Also foolÆs gold does not rapidly react with oxygen to form oxidized iron ("rust") at seawater pH. As pyrite travels from the vents to the ocean interior and toward the surface ocean, it will "time release" iron to areas where iron is depleted so that organisms can assimilate it, then grow. The latter can affect atmospheric oxygen and carbon dioxide levels.  The results indicate that hydrothermal vents are a continuous source of much needed iron in the form of foolÆs gold and are an ongoing iron supplement for the ocean much as "Geritol" is for humans.  Also, other research demonstrated how fast all these organisms can take up and use hydrogen sulfide for growth and survival.  The organisms were placed in specially designed high pressure containers and given a ædietÆ of oxygen, carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide as chemical sensors monitored the changes in concentration. This research grant has provided quantitative understanding of the role that hydrothermal vents have on the biology existing in the deep ocean and on the emission of iron and other elements.
