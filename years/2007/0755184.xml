<AbstractNarration>This 10-week summer REU Site program is part of the Quality of Life Technology (QoLT) Engineering Research Center (ERC).  The vision of the QoLT ERC is to transform the lives of people with reduced functional capabilities due to aging or disability through intelligent devices and systems.  The QoLT ERC is a unique partnership between Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and the University of Pittsburgh (Pitt), integrating CMU's strength in the design, implementation, and technology transfer of intelligent systems, and Pittsburgh's strength in health sciences and aging research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary objectives of the QoLT REU program are to transform undergraduate students from dependent to independent thinkers, give them a sense of accomplishment and exposure to potential end-users, and provide experience on projects designed to address real-world problems with systems-level engineering efforts.  Participants will be engaged in cross-disciplinary research in QoLT to gain an understanding of how to relate functions (physiological, physical, social and cognitive) to the design of intelligent devices and systems that aid and interact with people.  The undergraduate students' educational experience will be enhanced by field trips to QoLT testbeds and seminars.&lt;br/&gt;Recruitment efforts will be targeted to students who come from institutions with limited research opportunities, minorities and students with disabilities. The participants will conduct leading research that has direct effects on peoples' lives. This program has the potential to increase the number of undergraduates who are well-prepared for graduate studies and professional careers in QoLT.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
