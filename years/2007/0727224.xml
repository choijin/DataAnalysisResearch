<AbstractNarration>Fire is an important management tool in the farming and pastoral systems of western Africa.  Environmental scientists and policymakers consider biomass burning to be an important source of greenhouse gases and aerosols like nitrous oxide, methane, and carbon dioxide.  Africa dominates the geographical distribution of fire events globally, accounting for about 40 percent of all fires, and the continent is believed to account for 30 percent of all biomass burning emissions worldwide.  Recent changes in land use and land cover related to the expansion of cotton, tree crops, and livestock rising have led to changes in burning regimes, however.  A burning regime refers to the timing, intensity, and frequency of fires.  The most notable change is in the timing of burning, as fires are set earlier in the dry season by herders.  These early fires are less intense due to high moisture levels in plants and soils.  Early fires are not as destructive to vegetation, which results in more trees in the landscape.  Less intense fires also produce fewer gas and aerosol emissions into the atmosphere.  This doctoral dissertation research project will investigate the impacts of biomass burning on global climate change in the light of social, economic, political, and biophysical processes at the local and regional scales in Cote d'Ivoire.  The doctoral candidate will examine trends in savanna burning regimes, analyze the nature and direction of land cover change over the period 1975 to 2008, and assess the Ivorian savanna ecosystems contribution to the global greenhouse gas production.  Field research techniques and remote sensing methods will be used to address the questions raised in this study.  Surveys and interviews with farmers and herders will be conducted to solicit their perceptions of any changes in burning practices and to gain their perspectives and reasons for setting fires at certain times and places.  Vegetation transects and the analysis of satellite images for four years (1975, 1985, 1995, and 2007) will reveal trends in vegetation cover and the spatial and temporal distribution of burning.  Biomass burning experiments will be conducted throughout the burning season to estimate the amount of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrogen oxides and ozone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will contribute to the scientific literature on global climate change by providing a more accurate assessment of the production of key greenhouse gases at the local and regional scales. The investigators will consider burning regimes and differentiated savanna landscapes in the evaluation of greenhouse gas emissions associated with biomass burning in Cote d'Ivoire.  The data will furnish new estimates of the type and amount of biomass burned and gases emitted.  This knowledge will result in the calculation of new coefficients that are commonly used in global climate change models.  By scaling up from the local to the regional scale, this research should help fill an important gap in current global climate change research.  This research will contribute to the fire policy debates in which savanna ecosystems dynamics are not well understood, especially the impacts of fire on vegetation and greenhouse gas emissions.  The study's results will yield badly needed data on greenhouse gas and aerosol emissions in Cote d'Ivoire that can be used to inform Ivorian environmental policies.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.  This award is jointly funded by NSF's Office of International Science and Engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
