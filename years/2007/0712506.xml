<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will assess the viability of an imaging spectrometer based on a novel monolithic anamorphic design. This approach will reduce part count and assembly costs while maintaining excellent performance and stability, thereby providing a fundamental value advantage over existing technology. Optical and mechanical modeling will be performed to determine component tolerance requirements and the trade space between performance and cost. Additionally, key questions on the proposed design and lithographic fabrication will be addressed with well-defined proof-of-concept experiments. Performance requirements will be guided by the needs of two potential end users who have indicated a strong interest in the technology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technology developed under this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will help expand the application of spectral imaging to new areas for which it is currently not cost effective. The proposed technology will provide detailed spectral and spatial information. A primary target application will be color measurement, which will benefit from the additional spectral information for more accurate color measurements. Other possible markets include the traditional machine vision market, which can leverage existing expertise using spatial information, and the low-cost spectrometer market, which can leverage expertise in using spectral information. The color measurement, machine vision, and low-cost spectrometer markets are all substantially larger than the current spectral imaging market and provide a large potential commercial market. Potential societal impacts include improved quality control of raw materials, food, and finished products, and improved sorting of wastes. Because the proposed monolithic anamorphic spectral imaging system can readily be engineered to meet a wide range of cost and performance requirements, scientists will be able to explore new applications for spectral imaging. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
