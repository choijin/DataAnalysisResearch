    <AbstractNarration>The American Statistical Association (ASA) will use this NSF award as a travel grant for United States participants to attend the 56th Session of the International Statistical Institute (ISI) in Lisboa, Portugal from August 22-29, 2007. The ISI meeting includes the meetings of the Bernoulli Society, International Association for Official Statistics (IAOS), International Association for Statistical Computing (IASC), International Association of Survey Statisticians (IASS), and the International Association for Statistical Education (IASE). Thus it is an umbrella meeting with a wide range sessions with applications of interest for thousands of statisticians. The travel grants will provide partial support to defray transportation costs for individuals selected from institutions and non-profit associations. An emphasis of the award is to encourage and provide the opportunity for younger statisticians, as well as statisticians from disadvantaged groups, to participate in the meeting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Participants will be notified of the availability of the travel grant through Amstat News, a membership publication of the ASA, and on the ASA Home Page on the Internet. Notices will be provided to university and college departments to encourage younger statisticians to apply for the travel grant. A review and selection committee will be established to review the applications and select grantees. The committee will be comprised of four or more ASA members and will convene at the ASA office in Alexandria, Virginia. Special consideration will be given to statisticians who have recently received their Ph.D.'s and to women and minorities.</AbstractNarration>
