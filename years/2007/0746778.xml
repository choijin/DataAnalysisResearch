<AbstractNarration>Labate&lt;br/&gt;0746778&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator develops, implements, and applies a new&lt;br/&gt;multiscale representation method for multidimensional data.  The&lt;br/&gt;proposed shearlet approach encompasses the mathematical framework&lt;br/&gt;of affine systems and, to date, is the only method able to&lt;br/&gt;combine optimal sparsity (few coefficients to compute), fast&lt;br/&gt;transforms through the power of multiresolution analysis (fast&lt;br/&gt;computation) and full mathematical justification and framework&lt;br/&gt;(great flexibility and versatility).  The sparsity of the&lt;br/&gt;proposed shearlet representation is a direct consequence of its&lt;br/&gt;genuinely multidimensional multiscale character, and its fast&lt;br/&gt;implementation a consequence of its affine mathematical&lt;br/&gt;structure.  The project is organized into three main directions&lt;br/&gt;of investigation, with several specific goals.  First, the&lt;br/&gt;mathematical framework underpinning the shearlets is investigated&lt;br/&gt;to set the foundation for the construction and analysis of&lt;br/&gt;optimally sparse multidimensional representations.  Next these&lt;br/&gt;representations are applied to the decomposition of functions&lt;br/&gt;spaces and operators.  More specifically, the shearlets are used&lt;br/&gt;as building blocks of anisotropic function spaces.  This step has&lt;br/&gt;significant implications in approximation theory, in the study of&lt;br/&gt;Fourier integral operators, and for various nonstandard&lt;br/&gt;regularity spaces associated to partial differential equations. &lt;br/&gt;Third, shearlets are applied to problems from image processing&lt;br/&gt;and image analysis.  Specifically, improved algorithmic&lt;br/&gt;implementations are developed and applied to image denoising,&lt;br/&gt;edge detection and shape recognition.  Tests are conducted on&lt;br/&gt;biomedical data to address specific application-driven problems,&lt;br/&gt;including geometric reconstruction of neuronal morphology from&lt;br/&gt;confocal images and neuronal classification. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the past twenty years, multiscale methods and wavelets have&lt;br/&gt;revolutionized signal processing and stimulated an impressive&lt;br/&gt;amount of research in mathematics and engineering.  In fact,&lt;br/&gt;wavelets provide optimally efficient representations of&lt;br/&gt;one-dimensional data and have fast numerical implementations.  As&lt;br/&gt;a result, wavelets are successfully employed in a number of&lt;br/&gt;strategic applications, including the new FBI fingerprint&lt;br/&gt;database and JPEG-2000, the new standard for image compression. &lt;br/&gt;In spite of their remarkable success, wavelets are far from being&lt;br/&gt;optimal in general.  Even though they outperform other&lt;br/&gt;traditional methods, they fail to capture intrinsic geometrical&lt;br/&gt;features of multidimensional phenomena.  For instance, they do&lt;br/&gt;poorly at dealing with features such as the edges of an image or&lt;br/&gt;the boundary surfaces of a solid object, and, as a consequence,&lt;br/&gt;they are unable to handle efficiently the ever larger&lt;br/&gt;multidimensional data sets which are required by many modern&lt;br/&gt;applications.  By contrast, the approach addressed in this&lt;br/&gt;project is truly multidimensional and opens the door to a new&lt;br/&gt;generation of highly efficient methods for the storage,&lt;br/&gt;transmission and processing of data.  The applications arising&lt;br/&gt;from this research facilitate technological advances in sensitive&lt;br/&gt;applications such as remote sensing, medical diagnostics, data&lt;br/&gt;transmission and classifications, video surveillance, and storage&lt;br/&gt;of data. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
