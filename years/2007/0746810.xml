<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;ECCS-0746810&lt;br/&gt;Nian Sun, Northeastern University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to investigate novel magnetoelectric composite films and explore their applications in integrated RF and microwave magnetoelectric devices. The approach is to use the spin spray plating, which has been demonstrated to produce high quality microwave ferrite films at low temperatures and at a low cost. The strong magnetoelectric coupling and the many recent breakthroughs in magnetoelectric composites comprising both ferri/ferromagnetic and ferroelectric phases have made this area extremely exciting. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Low-temperature processing of the magnetoelectric films is critical in order for them to be used in integrated circuits which have tight temperature control. This project proposes to investigate novel spin-spray synthesis methods for magnetoelectric films at a low temperature of 80~90?aC. These magnetoelectric films will be characterized at different length scales and across different frequency bands, which will be applied in novel integrated RF/microwave magnetoelectric devices. This project will lead to a whole new area of spin-spray deposited magnetoelectric films and novel integrated tunable magnetoelectric devices for RF/microwave integrated circuits. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Spin-spray deposited magnetoelectric films will lead to new functionalities on integrated circuits that ferroelectric or magnetic materials alone do not possess, and will have great impacts on many industries and on society. The education plan includes establishing the Magic of Magnetism program for the Museum of Science, Boston; and an extensive K ~ graduate education plan including graduate and undergraduate education, research experiences for undergraduates, high school students and teachers, emphasizing participation of underrepresented groups, particularly women and minorities.</AbstractNarration>
