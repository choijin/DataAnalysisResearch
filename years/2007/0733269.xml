<AbstractNarration>The American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) proposes a two-year exploratory project to develop ecology curriculum resources for teachers of grades 7-9. The project proposes to advance understanding of basic science and fundamental ecological principles and support schools in achieving national and state ecology standards; to use engaging media to disseminate scientific research in ecological testing, geographic information systems, and biodiversity using the scientific and educational expertise of the AMNH and other institutions; to compare the efficacy of using local, regional, and national environmental case studies for learning ecological principles; and to be inclusive of underrepresented groups through  AMNH's  extensive outreach and dissemination channels to teachers, students, and families, and through recruitment of educational collaborators. The project will use media such as Science Bulletin Snapshots to engage students with current research and to foster scientific understanding and civic engagement. Through the environmental case studies, students will learn to develop hypotheses, analyze scientific data, and make conclusions. To address the objectives, the project will create inquiry-based case studies to situate several central ecological principles, as determined by national and state standards, into the context of environmental issues. The case-based problem-solving activities, that allow students to discover connections between environmental issues and daily life, explore the interaction of ecological principles with environmental issues, and transfer their knowledge of ecological principles to the context of other environmental issues, will be created.</AbstractNarration>
