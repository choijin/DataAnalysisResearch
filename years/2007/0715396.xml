<AbstractNarration>QuarkNet is a national program that partners high school science teachers and students with particle physicists working in experiments at the scientific frontier. These experiments are searching for answers to fundamental questions about the origin of mass, the dimensionality of spacetime and the nature of symmetries that govern physical processes. Among the experimental projects at the energy frontier with which QuarkNet is affiliated is the Large Hadron Collider, which is poised at the horizon of discovery.  The LHC will come on line during the 5-years of this program.   QuarkNet is led by a group of teachers, educators and physicists with many years of experience in professional development workshops and institutes, materials development and teacher research programs. The project consists of 52 centers at universities and research labs in 25 states and Puerto Rico. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is proposed that Quarknet be funded as a partnership among the ESIE program of EHR; the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities and the Elementary Particle Physics Program (Division of Physics), both within MPS; as well as the Division of High Energy Physics at DOE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit  QuarkNet is a teacher professional development program that partners teachers and students with U.S. particle physicists participating in experiments at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, Batavia, Illinois; the CERN Laboratory, Geneva, Switzerland; at the Sanford Underground Research Facility, Lead, South Dakota; and in non-accelerator/astrophysics experiments. QuarkNet teachers gain valuable research experience and learn to use inquiry-based teaching methods enabling them to teach basic introductory physics concepts in a context that students find exciting. The concept and program of QuarkNet is rooted in and borne of several issues confronting research in the field of experimental particle physics:  Typically, experiments are of long duration, with extensive lead times, construction periods and data collection and analysis periods. Experiments are easily several decades long from inception to execution to publication.  A well-trained, enthusiastic workforce of scientists and technical personnel (in significant numbers) is needed to carry out effectively such experiments. Experiments range from several hundred to several thousand participants.  Proponents of scientific and technical proposals to the National Science Foundation and other governmental agencies must identify, plan for and carry out a significant effort in education and outreach as a component of their programs. Recent events nationally and internationally underscore the urgent need to attract young people to scientific and technological careers and to train them well.  QuarkNet was proposed and established to provide a coherent response to these and other issues, and to develop a national community of researchers and educators working together on frontier scientific research. QuarkNet is rooted in best practices of professional development and science education. QuarkNet is based on a classroom vision where teachers create constructivist learning environments that provide students with opportunities for an in-depth engagement in science. Teaching strategies emulate closely the way scientists build knowledge through inquiry. Students develop scientific knowledge and habits of mind by working alongside scientists to make sense of the world using real experimental data. QuarkNet brings teachers into the research environment where they can experience how science is done and provides a sustained forum where scientists and teachers can work together to support instructional change. To facilitate classroom change, QuarkNet develops and supports the professionalism of teachers and provides access to a variety of online instructional resources including raw datasets and primary sources, and to manipulative, interactive and physical materials.    Broader Impacts  During this grant period, QuarkNet has supported 55 centers and the development of instructional resources that enable teachers to engage their students in particle physics that at an appropriate level to inspire and motivate students to learn physics.
