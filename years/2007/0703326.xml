<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit: Using TintoÃ†s Model of Retention as a theoretical framework, NCLSAMP programs have consistently and successfully addressed the challenges of preparing a diverse STEM work force. NCLSAMP efforts towards advancing knowledge and understanding within STEM fields have included professional development for faculty, staff and students, and the adaptation and implementation of high impact practices proven to increase retention among underrepresented racial minorities and female STEM majors. Student training and development were essential components of the NCLSAMP program, and provided opportunities for professional and social skill development. Workshops were designed to enhance studentsÃ† academic experience, and facilitate their transition into graduate school or the STEM workforce. NCLSAMP model elements include:   summer bridge  peer study groups and tutoring in gatekeeper courses learning communities academic advising  academic enrichment  research experiences  conferences Internships career awareness GRE preparation, and graduate school preparation      The NCLSAMP model encompasses activities in support of participants from pre-college (summer bridge) through graduate school. During this project, more than 1600 Level I (funded) students participated in high impact activities, a 2% increase. While this is incremental, it provides evidence of progress towards our goal of increasing the number of URM who complete STEM degree programs. Summer bridge activities provided students an opportunity to gain advanced instruction in STEM gateway courses, and strengthen their competencies in these subject areas prior to the upcoming academic year.  852 students participated in summer bridge activities held at NCLSAMP institutions. Peer study groups addressed challenges in required STEM gateway courses.  Participation in this activity averaged 539 for both Level I and Level II students.  In 2011, NCA&amp;T piloted a two-year STEM Living Learning Community, with the goals to assist students in achieving academic success, provide STEM career exploration, and successfully retain students, both at the university (85%) and in STEM (80%).  30 incoming freshmen participated and included majors in Engineering, Biology, Computer Science, Chemistry, Applied Mathematics, and Industrial Technology. Of the 30 students, 29 (97%) returned to the university, and 97% of the returning students were retained in STEM majors, thus, exceeding projected goals. Undergraduate research, a major NC-LSAMP program activity, provided early exposure to a graduate environment. Guided research was facilitated by STEM faculty and graduate students, and assisted students in developing both a deeper understanding of their course material, and presentation skills.

Livermore national  laboratories, through collaboration with the US Department of Education, and UNC-Pembroke participated in the Native American and Pacific Islander Research Experience for Undergraduates (NAPIRE) in Costa Rica. Over 800 participants were supported to attend over 60 conferences and symposia. Students also engaged in professional development workshops and seminars designed to promote self-efficacy and identity as future scientists and engineers, and several received financial support for GRE preparation.  The quality of faculty engaged in NCLSAMP has also been critical to the success of program. An average of 136 faculty have engaged with students; over 27% of have earned full professorship, 34% associate, and 30% are at the assistant rank. Faculty and staff were supported to participate in professional development activities to increase their knowledge and skills, contingent upon available funds and alignment with program ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
