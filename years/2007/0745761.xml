<AbstractNarration>Dr. Munagala will develop theoretical models for the problems of&lt;br/&gt;uncertainty and imprecise information in computing and communication&lt;br/&gt;systems such as wireless sensor networks and grid computers, and&lt;br/&gt;design algorithms and policies to ameliorate their impact on system&lt;br/&gt;performance, thereby leading to more effective larger-scale&lt;br/&gt;deployments of such systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He will also develop algorithms for computing dynamic information&lt;br/&gt;acquisition strategies in uncertain environments, that jointly&lt;br/&gt;optimize the cost of acquiring more information, together with the&lt;br/&gt;gain from exploiting the information to enhance system&lt;br/&gt;performance. This class of problems falls within the larger area of&lt;br/&gt;stochastic control theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is well known that computing and storing the optimal control&lt;br/&gt;policies (or strategies) needs exponential time and space. However, in&lt;br/&gt;the scenarios that Dr. Munagala will investigate, the system can&lt;br/&gt;tolerate certain suboptimality in the quality of planning decisions,&lt;br/&gt;but the real requirement is that the policies be extremely lightweight&lt;br/&gt;to compute and execute. This motivates the formulation and design of&lt;br/&gt;computationally efficient approximately optimal policies for an entire&lt;br/&gt;gamut of fundamental control theoretic problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will draw upon his expertise in approximation and online&lt;br/&gt;algorithms to develop new insights to address important theoretical&lt;br/&gt;questions in stochastic control theory, with emphasis on information&lt;br/&gt;acquisition and exploitation problems. In contrast with techniques&lt;br/&gt;developed in the AI and operations research communities, the solutions&lt;br/&gt;developed will have provable performance guarantees, in addition to&lt;br/&gt;being efficient to implement. The novel algorithmic principles&lt;br/&gt;emerging from this project will lay the foundations for developing a&lt;br/&gt;fresh theory of approximate stochastic control.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
