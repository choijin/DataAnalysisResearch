<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;This award to QEM will provide technical assistance to junior faculty at minority?serving institutions and eligible underrepresented minority faculty at other institutions to enable them to participate more successfully in the NSF?s Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program.  Minority faculty have an essential role in the production of baccalaureate degree recipients of under-represented groups in STEM disciplines as well as in the disproportionate production of minority college graduates who pursue graduate degrees. Consequently there will be the broadening of participation, and enhancing diversity within the Foundation?s programs as a vehicle to achieve the objectives of the America Competes Act.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Importance of the Project to Advancing Knowledge and Understanding  "The Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program is a Foundation-wide activity that offers the National Science Foundation's most prestigious awards in support of junior faculty who exemplify the role of teacher-scholars through outstanding research, excellent education and the integration of education and research within the context of the mission of their organizations." With CAREER awards, NSF provides five years of support for the early career development activities of those teacher-scholars who are "most likely to become the academic leaders of the 21st century." Yet, faculty at minority-serving institutions (MSIs) have received less than 3 percent of all CAREER awards since 2002. Increasing the pool of "teacher/scholars" with more faculty from MSIs can make a vital contribution to the NationÃ†s knowledge and understanding of science, transform the scientific workforce, and attract more minority students to Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) careers.     The Quality Education for Minorities (QEM) Network received NSF support to provide technical assistance to broaden participation in the CAREER Program. QEM conducted annual technical assistance workshops to increase the participation and competitiveness of junior faculty at minority institutions and minority junior faculty at non-minority institutions in the CAREER ProgramÃ†s annual competitions. With limited resources available at MSIs, financial support for the participation of eligible early career STEM faculty was provided. Under the current project, from 2008-2011, QEM conducted four annual CAREER workshops for 279 faculty participants from 97 institutions.     Qualifications of the Organization  Under the leadership of President Shirley McBay, the QEM Network was established in 1990 as a non-profit organization in Washington, DC, dedicated to improving education for minorities throughout the Nation. The QEM Network works with minority and non-minority individuals, organizations, and institutions to help coordinate and energize efforts to improve the education of minorities, particularly in STEM. With the assistance of experienced STEM consultants and evaluators, QEM provides technical assistance and follow-up support to faculty at MSIs and minority faculty at non-minority institutions for a range of NSF programs that provide support for STEM research, major equipment, education, and faculty leadership development.     Creative Innovative Approach  Through both plenary and discipline-focused breakout sessions, the QEM CAREER two-day workshops provided detailed information on preparing the various components of CAREER proposals as well as individualized advice and feedback to each faculty participant on his/her proposal ideas. The workshop agenda topics emphasized the importance of developing and articulating a clear and rigorous research question, a well-conceived research design, and a compelling education component as well as the evaluation of CAREER project outcomes. This approach helped to ensure that all participants were actively engaged and received expert advice on their CAREER proposal project summaries from NSF CAREER Program Officers, QEM senior staff, and consultants with many yearsÃ† experience at MSIs.     ParticipantsÃ† Evaluation of the Conference  At the conclusion of each workshop, participants completed a Workshop Evaluation Questionnaire to rate the usefulness of the sessions and to indicate whether the workshop met their expectations. Consistently, the overwhelming majority of the participants rated the CAREER Workshops overall as excellent or very good; and reported that the workshop met their expectations.     Focus on Broadening Participation of Underrepresented Groups  Example: Of the 69 participants attending the February 2010 workshop, 43 (62%) responded to a follow-up survey regarding their submissions and information sharing activities and 22 ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
