<AbstractNarration>CBET-0756359, Dames&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The goal of this one-year project is to measure the thermal conductivity of graphene: a sheet of carbon that is only one atom thick.  Although graphene is well-known as the building block of graphite, it was not until 2004 that individual sheets of graphene were successfully isolated.  Since then, graphene has generated tremendous interest for both fundamental and applied reasons.  On the fundamental side, the electrons in graphene exhibit some unique behaviors that are more like light than normal electrons in metals or semiconductors.  On the applications side, graphene is a very good electrical conductor which can also tolerate extremely high currents, making graphene an exciting candidate to transform the post-silicon microelectronics era.  In analogy to its cousin, the carbon nanotube, graphene is also thought to be a very good thermal conductor, which would also be a great benefit for microelectronics, as well as thermal management applications.  However, this important property has not yet been measured.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the proposed work is to provide the first experimental measurements of the thermal properties of this unique and important material.  By studying the thermal conductivity as a function of temperature, the number of layers, and the electron concentration, this work will resolve conflicting theoretical predictions and lead to a deeper understanding of graphene?s remarkable electronic and thermal properties.  This study is potentially transformative to our fundamental knowledge because the properties of a sheet that is only one atom thick may be quite different than familiar bulk materials, or even ?conventional? nanostructures such as nanowires and thin films.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research may be expected to have major impacts on society if graphene replaces silicon in next-generation microelectronics.  This project will also help support two different research groups, in physics and mechanical engineering, leading to a stimulating exchange of ideas and skills across disciplines as the two graduate students collaborate.   The results obtained will be disseminated widely in journals and at conferences, and incorporated into three classes taught by the principal investigators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
