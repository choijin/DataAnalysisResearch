<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objective:&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this proposal is to request travel funds from NSF to enable students from other institutions, as well as teachers from K-12 and community colleges to participate in the 25th anniversary of the Microelectronics Engineering Department.  RIT will hold this anniversary function in Rochester NY on may 14-16, 2007.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) is organizing this workshop to look back at the impact they have made in educating the workforce for the microelectronics industry and developed a research agenda that involved undergraduate and graduate students actively.  The purpose of this workshop is to recount the highlights of the RIT program in the last quarter of a century and to explore and discuss the challenges that lie ahead in education and research and training of the workforce for the next 25 years.  Technical sessions will provide futuristic vision along and beyond the ITRS.  The sessions will include plenary talks by industry, academic and government leaders and by RIT faculty, alumni, and students who are engaged in cutting edge research, development and manufacturing.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:&lt;br/&gt;The Semiconductor Technology workshop will coincide with the 25th anniversary Microelectronics Engineering Conference at RIT and will provide great visibility and encouragement to our alumni and future prospective students. The conference aims to be student focused and will emphasize their partnership in research.  Graduate and undergraduate student, members of the faculty form universities, community colleges, and distance learning students will participate.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
