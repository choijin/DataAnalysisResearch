<AbstractNarration>This award is funded by the Divisions of Chemistry and Biological Infrastructure at NSF. The University of Wisconsin - Oshkosh REU Site will select nine students every summer to participate in research projects with faculty mentors in the area of proteomics and functional genomics. Diverse, interdisciplinary research projects in microbial physiology, plant biology, plant physiology, plant biochemistry, molecular parasitology, vertebrate vision physiology, environmental microbiology, cell and developmental biology, virology, and comparative genomics are offered. Students will become familiar with, and have full access to, state-of-the-art instrumentation housed within the Proteomics and Functional Genomics Core Facility at UW Oshkosh.  A 2-week lab course will provide students with the necessary set of basic skills to succeed in their research projects. Communication skills of students will be honed through student presentations of their results and participation in research group meetings, professional development seminars, and journal clubs.  Additional activities will be included to ensure group cohesion and collegiality. The specific objectives of this REU Site are to: 1) provide undergraduates with practical experience in the timely and powerful methodologies that define the frontiers of life science research today, 2) increase the global competitiveness of tomorrow's life science workforce by augmenting the number of undergraduates trained in essential techniques in proteomics and functional genomics, 3) increase numbers of members of underrepresented groups pursuing careers in advanced biological research, and 4) foster development of diverse, collegial research communities of aspiring scientists.  Interested students should visit http://reu.uwosh.edu, or contact Dr. Todd Sandrin (920-424-1104 or sandrin@uwosh.edu).</AbstractNarration>

The mean response of cohorts from 2008 to 2012 to this statement was 4.68.

Regarding home institutions of student participants, 68% of participants were from PUIs, 18% from 2-yr institutions and 14 %) from PhD granting institutions.  As our assessment data demonstrate, our REU Site appears to be having significant and positive impacts on the abilities of students to clearly discern whether to pursue a career in scientific research. .
