<AbstractNarration>The 2007 Rustbelt RNA Meeting will be held October 19-20, 2007 in the Lodge at Deer Creek State Park &amp; Resort in Mt. Sterling, OH. The intellectual objective of the meeting is to provide an inexpensive, high caliber, interdisciplinary meeting for RNA researchers in the Midwest. The field of RNA structure, function, and processing is growing at a rapid pace and RNA has been shown to be intimately involved in many important biological phenomena beyond its obvious prominent role in transcription and translation.  At the same time the methods used to study RNA are becoming more and more diverse ranging from synthetic and physical chemistry over biochemistry, genetics, and biophysical approaches all the way to computational methods. Consequently, research groups need a forum where they can hear and discuss new results and techniques in all areas of RNA research that can result in furthering an individual lab's aims. The size and organization of the meeting has proven to be an excellent environment for active discussions between research groups, including those between PIs, between PIs and trainees as well as between trainees themselves. Such interactions are more difficult at larger national meetings. The Rustbelt RNA meeting was established in 1999 and is the major Midwest regional meeting of RNA researchers, attended by participants including principal investigators (PIs), postdoctoral fellows, graduate, and undergraduate students from both research intensive and primarily undergraduate institutions in Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, Kentucky, and Pennsylvania, as well as farther away (Delaware). Based on attendance in previous years, approximately 170 participants are expected in 2007.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact. The main broader impact of the rustbelt RNA meeting is in trainee and junior faculty development. The conference traditionally  emphasizes trainee participation and features graduate and undergraduate student participation, from institutions ranging from large research intensive universities to small, primarily undergraduate colleges. In addition to offering opportunities for interactions with PIs and other trainees, the RRM provides invaluable experience presenting research in an educational and supportive atmosphere. Importantly, trainees account for the vast majority (about 90%) of both poster and oral presentations. Such presentations instill confidence in the trainees and inspire trainees in the audience to present their results orally in the future. To encourage the speakers further, prizes are awarded for outstanding trainee presentations. Finally, the meeting is an excellent forum for junior PIs to showcase their emerging research programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
