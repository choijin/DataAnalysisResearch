<AbstractNarration>Articulatory inversion is the problem of recovering the sequence of&lt;br/&gt;vocal tract shapes that produce a given acoustic utterance. &lt;br/&gt;Articulatory representations are useful for automatic speech&lt;br/&gt;recognition, speech production research, language therapy, and&lt;br/&gt;language learning. Articulatory inversion is a hard problem because&lt;br/&gt;different vocal tract shapes can produce the same acoustics, yet the&lt;br/&gt;articulatory trajectory must obey the mechanical constraints of the&lt;br/&gt;human vocal tract. Other examples of inversion problems over a&lt;br/&gt;sequence, which share the multivalued nature of the mappings and the&lt;br/&gt;existence of constraints, are: the recovery of facial gestures&lt;br/&gt;associated with a speech utterance; the inverse kinematics of a robot&lt;br/&gt;arm; and the recovery of 3D motion from video.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project approaches articulatory inversion from a machine learning&lt;br/&gt;standpoint, based on a framework introduced by the PI. The&lt;br/&gt;low-dimensional manifold in articulatory-acoustic space is represented&lt;br/&gt;in a probabilistic way by a density model estimated from data&lt;br/&gt;(recorded using a microphone and electromagnetic articulography). &lt;br/&gt;Multivalued mappings are explicitly represented by the modes of&lt;br/&gt;conditional distributions of this density, and the articulatory&lt;br/&gt;trajectory is disambiguated using a continuity constraint.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project introduces new problems in dimensionality reduction,&lt;br/&gt;density estimation and regularization (such as multivalued regression&lt;br/&gt;and graph-learning from noisy data), and new models and algorithms. &lt;br/&gt;The expected results of this work are: performing basic research in&lt;br/&gt;machine learning, and introducing mapping inversion problems to&lt;br/&gt;research and education; improving articulatory inversion (for which&lt;br/&gt;code will be made freely available); and advocating data-driven&lt;br/&gt;approaches in speech production research and education.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
