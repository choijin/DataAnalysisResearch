<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;Interdisciplinary (99) Students with learning disabilities (LD), who are deaf or hard of hearing (D/HH), and those who are learners of English language (ELL) face significant communication barriers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) undergraduate courses; their cognitive, linguistic, and perceptual characteristics impede learning these classes. This project is addressing these barriers by providing to students notes produced with the Tablet C-Print Pro software recently developed at the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), specifically for use in STEM courses. The notes, distributed electronically to all students in class, include text and graphic representation of class lecture and discussion.  The project is comparing learning gains in classes, (matched for course content and instructor), in which C-Print notes are provided in contrast to classes in which the notes are not provided. The project is also assessing the benefit of C-Print notes for four groups of students: (a) LD, (b) D/HH, (c) ELL, and (d) those who do not have difficulty comprehending spoken English. Innovation and knowledge yielded by the project can improve student learning in a variety of STEM areas, especially learning by groups that have difficulty comprehending material in STEM courses. Distribution of C-Print notes to all students will contribute to broadening participation and success in STEM courses by underrepresented groups, including individuals with disabilities and ELL students and increase the likelihood of becoming a STEM major. Students who do not face these communication challenges may also benefit from the technology.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
