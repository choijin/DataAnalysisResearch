<AbstractNarration>AST-0707713&lt;br/&gt;Darling&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Jeremiah Darling of the University of Colorado will investigate a number of research avenues enabled by the absorption of cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons by intervening formaldehyde (H2CO) in both low and high redshift galaxies.  The chief goal is to build the foundation required to use H2CO as a unique and powerful tool to study the star formation history of the Universe, the evolution of galaxies, and the formation mechanism of hydroxyl megamasers, and to make precise measurements of cosmological parameters.  Formaldehyde is a tracer of high-density gas, which is tightly correlated with star formation, so H2CO surveys will be limited by the star formation rate, independent of redshift or dust extinction.  H2CO surveys are also mass limited.  H2CO absorption against the CMB can likely be used as a standard ruler to measure cosmological parameters far beyond the distance limit set by galaxy clusters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research project includes building a scientific foundation for ground-breaking work with the Expanded Very Large Array (New Mexico) and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (Chile), training new astronomers to use these upcoming facilities, creating synergy between astrophysical and laboratory studies of molecules, and creating opportunities for new directions in education, outreach, and mentoring.  Future radio astronomers and astrochemists will benefit from these, and from the frequent contacts with molecular structure researchers, which will be a necessary part of this study.</AbstractNarration>
