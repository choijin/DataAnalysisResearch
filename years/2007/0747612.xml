<AbstractNarration>This award by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program and the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) to Professor Rory Waterman of the University of Vermont and State Agricultural College addresses catalytic methodologies used to form bonds between phosphorus and other main-group elements. The research has particular relevance due to the importance of phosphorus-containing molecules in biology, fine chemicals (including chiral phosphine ligands), polymers, and materials science. Specifically, the research will investigate zirconium-mediated reactions that catalytically activate phosphorus-hydrogen bonds to form new molecules in useful and selective ways. Catalytic reactions that build phosphorus-element bonds are quite rare yet, but with a greater understanding of the fundamental processes that govern these bonds, new catalysis reactions are envisioned which will improve selectivity and afford novel products. Through a Project SEED program established by the PI at the University of Vermont, economically disadvantaged and underrepresented minority high school students will be encouraged to participate in summer research alongside University of Vermont graduate and undergraduate students. The PI will also develop a new general chemistry course directed at educating undergraduates in civic science literacy with the goal of reducing the difference in understanding practical science between science and non-science majors.</AbstractNarration>

The overarching goal of the project has been to discover and understand chemical reactions that more efficiently utilize phosphorus as this is a limited resource and an element essential for agriculture and health. Catalysis is a method to facilitate chemical reactions that is more efficient or "green" than conventional routes. Zirconium was chosen as the element to facilitate these reactions as it is relatively abundant and underutilized in industrial processes.  Investigations under this award considered three different reaction types: dehydrocoupling or the forming chemical bonds by loss of hydrogen, a synthesis of phosphaalkenes or molecules featuring carbon&ndash;phosphorus double bonds, and hydrophosphination or the net addition of phosphorus and hydrogen across carbon&ndash;element multiple bonds.
