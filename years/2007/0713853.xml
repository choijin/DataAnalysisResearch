<AbstractNarration>Claflin University, through funding from the HBCU-UP program, seeks to investigate the following questions: (i) How can high-risk mathematics courses deter students from majoring in STEM; (ii) What is the effect of success in mathematics to attrition rates in STEM; (iii) Can a research-intensive curriculum contribute to a career in STEM? (iv) Does the Claflin University curriculum meet criteria for exemplary mathematics and science teacher preparation?  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Claflin's HBCU-UP project, Building Successful Models for Research and Inquiry Based Learning and Teaching, is a comprehensive project that seeks to improve mathematics competencies at the undergraduate level; prepare and train a research-based student population to be competitive for graduate school and/or the research workforce; and to improve mathematics and science teacher preparation through extending the interface between research and pedagogy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The activities planned for addressing the questions and achieving the objectives of the project are based on research in STEM education.  Claflin will implement supplemental instruction in Calculus I, building on current success in College Algebra, Pre-Calculus, Chemistry and Physics, where they have seen decreases in failure rate of 10% - 15%.  They will also utilize mathematics software and a MathLab to provide additional online support for the students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the enhancements aimed at student success, Claflin is also focusing on developing a research-based curriculum and building an interdisciplinary research infrastructure, especially in the area of Bioscience Technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An innovative aspect of Claflin's HBCU-UP project is its plan to build an exemplary model for science and mathematics teaching.  They will focus on mathematics education majors at the secondary level, and early, elementary and middle education majors.  For these students, a new Special Topics in Science and Mathematics Education course will be developed.  Claflin aims to make this course a model for the nation in STEM teaching.  The 4-week summer course will incorporate instrumentation, inquiry-based learning, molecular modeling and on-line delivery methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University has assembled a distinguished and experienced group of faculty to lead this project, and is expected to go a long way toward answering the questions posed.</AbstractNarration>

Objective 1: To improve mathematics competencies at the undergraduate level.  SI was utilized for the following high-risk courses: General Chemistry, College Algebra, Precalculus and Physics.

Table 1 shows the reduction in failure rates over a 12 year period for chemistry, mathematics and physics courses.  In a follow-up study, we tracked over 85% of students in the Pre-Calculus course in order to investigate their performance in upper-level mathematics courses.24 The same students who previously received SI and Math Lab passed upper level mathematics courses i.e. Calculus I &amp; II, Discrete Math, Statistics and Probability, at a higher rate (10%) than non-SI students.

Objective 3: To extend the interface between research and pedagogy in improving mathematics and science teacher preparation. The Pre-Service Teacher Institute offered a new course "Special Topics in Science and Mathematics Education" for undergraduate students who intended to become a K-12 teacher majoring in early childhood, elementary, middle or mathematics education. The outcome of the course was increased proficiency in teaching science and mathematics. The institute included a summer component and Saturday workshops. Students participated in workshops that incorporated instrumentation, inquiry-based learning, modeling and on-line delivery methods such as Chem3d, and CaseNex.

The program participants were administered a Teacher Confidence Assessment (Table 3). Questions addressed the confidence of an average of thirty (30) program participants each year in the areas of content knowledge, pedagogy, and the teaching and learning environment. Of the twenty-six (26) questions, thirteen (13) questions were related to content knowledge in mathematics, science, or mathematics and science, and nine (9) pedagogical questions, and four (4) teaching and learning environment questions.
