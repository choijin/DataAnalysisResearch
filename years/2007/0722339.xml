<AbstractNarration>Lab-centric instruction is a substantial extension to the widely advocated use of supervised closed labs as a required part of the course. In lab-centric courses, lecture and recitation time is traded wholly or in large part for supervised, structured labs that become the primary resource for student learning. Berkeley has offered lab-centric instruction in CS1 and CS2, and instructors have observed numerous benefits over and above those claimed for lab-augmented instruction. The vision is to significantly expand the use of lab-centric instruction into all CS courses (especially upper division) and academic settings. We propose a three-year project with the following goals. 1.  Assemble a diverse team of leaders in communities related to lab-centric instruction: CS curriculum, pedagogy, teacher education, digital repositories, and educational technology.  2. Evaluate the state of lab usage and barriers to adoption of lab-centric formats in courses across the range of higher-educational instructional contexts.  3. Create an online space to support the growth and functioning of the lab-centric community. 4. Recruit instructors to develop and refine a small number of lab-centric segments for inclusion in upper-division CS courses, and to evaluate the effectiveness of the supporting tools and materials for this development and wider community interaction. 5. Provide outreach for the lab-centric community and the online center and dissemination of the project results through a variety of educational forums. The Berkeley lab-centric courses appeared particularly to benefit students traditionally underrepresented in CS courses. Extension of these results to other institutions through the efforts of the proposed community would have a significant impact on CS education. Lab-centric materials should be readily sharable, and therefore contribute greatly to educational infrastructure. We will provide broad outreach and dissemination to instructors, and encourage leaders to pursue new, related avenues of research. The benefits of lab-centric instruction should be extensible to lab instruction in other science and engineering disciplines, encouraging collaboration and cross-fertilization between community members and educators in these outside disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Summary  Lab-centric instruction trades lecture time for more supervised hands-on lab work. Instead of playing a secondary role to in-class lectures, the lab sessions are the primary resource for student learning.    We proposed to build a community around lab-centric instruction. We have made the following progress:   a growing group of high-school teachers using lab-centric instruction for the Advanced Placement Computer Science A course; several curricula for students ranging from college level to junior high; implementation of a curriculum editor and the community support environment; two research studies documenting the value of lab-centric instruction and the techniques that can be integrated into lab-centric instruction.   What is lab-centric instruction?  Lab-centric instruction is based on the generally accepted premise that programming students learn more by doing programming than by listening to lectures. It swaps lecture time for hands-on supervised lab time. Lab activities are delivered online; they include typical programming tasks, experimentation, collaboration (both on- and offline), and several types of assessment. Our lab-centric courses are primarily blended&mdash;delivered at least partly in situations where the students and their instructor are in the lab room together&mdash;but can be used in a distance learning environment as well.     Lab-centric courses have numerous benefits over traditional instruction, including:  a wider variety of activities, including embedded assessments and collaborations; opportunities for instructors to engage students in targeted tutoring to counter confusion as it forms; a much enhanced ability to detect previously unrecognized misconceptions; a cooperative and relaxed classroom climate in which student learning is the main focus; evidence of enhanced performance, especially among CS students traditionally at risk.   Community building  We proposed to form a community around lab-centric instruction. This presented several challenges. Our best success has come in the context of an online Advanced Placement Computer Science course, which we developed under the sponsorship of U.C. College Prep. (This piece of the University of California system commissions online courses intended to prepare students for the various Advanced Placement examinations.) Two high school teachers, supported by RET grants, helped to polish and evaluate the curriculum in their own AP CS courses. Their reactions were extremely positive. This year, they are using the UCCP curriculum again, together with seven other instructors from various parts of the country. All are using the online curriculum in lab-centric style.  Curriculum development  We developed and tuned two new lab-centric courses, a sophomore/junior machine organization course, and an introduction to programming in Scratch for junior high school students. These expanded the existing range of lab-centric courses available at the start of the grant period. The variety of curricula makes it easier for a prospective instructor to adopt the lab-centric format.  Our curricula are available for the popular open-source learning management system Moodle.  Tools   We developed the PACT curriculum editor and community support system. PACT can interact directly with courses developed and deployed in Moodle. This capability is unique and opens the door for our community to appropriate and share materials in unprecedented ways.  PACT provides authoring conveniences never before seen in Moodle development environments with tools for sharing design knowledge and lab-centric curricula. These features allow for rapid creation and iteration over course designs while ensuring that the best ideas will quickly reach the designs of other community members.  The PACT authoring system is thoroughly integrated with our community portal.  This website provides community support features that have all been augmented to allow for discussion of particular curricular se...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
