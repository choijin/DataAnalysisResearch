<AbstractNarration>The wide diversity of species found in ecological communities provides numerous ecosystem services to humankind.  Yet scientists are only beginning to understand what factors maintain the diversity seen in plant communities.  What keeps the fastest growing, most competitive plant from driving other species extinct?  For a century, ecologists answered this question with "niche differences", where plant species differ in key ways that allow them to minimize competition.  For example, different plants may take up water from different soil depths.  Recently however, ecologists have come to recognize that species need not differ to coexist.  In fact, identical species co-occur for long periods of time in mathematical models, raising an alternative hypothesis for coexistence.  The principle investigators of this proposal have developed a novel framework for determining whether species differences underlie the biodiversity seen in plant communities.  This framework relies on the fact that 'niche differences' give species advantages when they drop to low density, decreasing their probability of extinction and increasing diversity.  The investigators will assess whether California annual plant species living on serpentine soils experience such advantages when rare. In so doing, they assess the role that niche differences play in maintaining diversity in this unique and diverse habitat.  The broader impacts include the training of graduate students at two universities, the development of ecological teaching modules, outreach to students from underprivileged schools, and increased understanding of a habitat of conservation concern. The research will be among the first experimental studies addressing the role that species differences play in controlling biodiversity.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Research funded by this proposal has demonstrated the importance of niche differences between species, differences in how they interact with the physical and biotic environment, for the maintenance of species diversity in natural communities.  Understanding how multiple plant species, all competing for the same handful of limiting resources, coexist is one of the greatest challenges for modern ecology.  While ecologists have long documented species differences thought to facilitate coexistence, and termed these niche differences, there has been little if any direct evidence demonstrating that niche differences maintain diversity in natural communities.  By combining population models and field experiments, this project showed that species diversity erodes rapidly without the stabilizing effect of niche differences, and that many more species are maintained in communities when niche difference are permitted to operate.  The research further showed the population dynamic signature of niche differences in natural communities- that species have higher population growth rates when rare than when common, and uncovered the species interactions that contributed to this result. While generating this knowledge, the project helped train two postdoctoral researchers now faculty at leading North American universities, one graduate student, and six undergraduate or recently graduated ecology researchers.  The project also generated material for an online and open access science education website and lectures in undergraduate courses.  Finally, for a society that values species diversity for functional, economic, and aesthetic reasons, the research provides fundamental insights into how that diversity is maintained.
