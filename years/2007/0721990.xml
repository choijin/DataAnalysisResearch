<AbstractNarration>Current Internet network controls are realized by an ad hoc&lt;br/&gt;combination of protocols, automated configurations, and manual&lt;br/&gt;configurations. This ad hoc environment makes it difficult to provide&lt;br/&gt;concrete behavioral assurances. Moreover, the entire system might&lt;br/&gt;exhibit harmful emergent behaviors that are difficult to anticipate,&lt;br/&gt;test for, debug, or correct.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The architecture for the future Internet should thus eliminate the&lt;br/&gt;current ad hoc practices and start from a clean slate. This project is&lt;br/&gt;developing a new architecture in which each network control function&lt;br/&gt;is realized as an application that runs on top of an operating&lt;br/&gt;platform. The operating platform provides crucial abstractions,&lt;br/&gt;interfaces, and services to allow applications to effect changes in&lt;br/&gt;the underlying network nodes, to enable the composition and concurrent&lt;br/&gt;executions of multiple applications, and to provide protection&lt;br/&gt;mechanisms to guard against potentially harmful actions of&lt;br/&gt;applications. Intellectual challenges such as scheduling,&lt;br/&gt;synchronization, inter-application communication, resource&lt;br/&gt;multiplexing, and operational invariant protection for the new breed&lt;br/&gt;of network control applications are being investigated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This project directly addresses a key challenge for&lt;br/&gt;future networks, namely network manageability.  Problems in network&lt;br/&gt;manageability affect the health of the networks we depend on, &lt;br/&gt;and they affect the manner in it is possible for innovation and &lt;br/&gt;economic growth to occur with these networks. Our new approach to &lt;br/&gt;manageability, the operating platform architecture, can potentially &lt;br/&gt;stimulate a market for a variety of 3rd-party network control applications. &lt;br/&gt;Finally, this project provides particularly exciting opportunities &lt;br/&gt;for the training of undergraduate and graduate students because they &lt;br/&gt;develop applications in a fundamental way, but addressing high-impact &lt;br/&gt;current issues.  We expect to diffuse the findings from this project &lt;br/&gt;into cutting-edge courses on network management.</AbstractNarration>
