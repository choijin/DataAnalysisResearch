<AbstractNarration>Dr. Donald Walter, Ms. Jennifer Cash, and Dr. Daniel Smith at South Carolina State University (SCSU) will partner with Dr. Steven Howell and scientists at the National Optical Astronomy Observatory (NOAO) as well as Dr. Mark Leising and scientists at Clemson University (CU) in a partnership to be known as POCA (A Partnership in Observational and Computational Astronomy).  Through a multi-faceted program they plan to use the partnership as a means to fill the pipeline of African-American students pursuing advanced degrees in science, and particularly, astronomy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Archival data will be used to relate the periods of RV Tauri stars to several physical parameters, which help shape these objects into useful distance indicators in the Local Group.  The partnership will also participate in a world-wide network studying gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglow and a study of primordial lithium abundances.  Additionally, they will use narrow-band H-alpha photometry to search for short-period, tidally locked binaries in the Galactic Halo. Finally, some of the group will use data from the Very Large Array and the Green Bank Telescope to investigate the role of magnetic fields in star formation.&lt;br/&gt;       &lt;br/&gt;SCSU is a Historically Black College/University with 96% of the student population being African-American. Undergrads at SCSU and grad students from CU will take part in all of the proposed research.  The opportunities for student research will exist year-round, and graduate students will be encouraged to become mentors to undergraduates.  The program is also intended to boost the research foundation at the university by mentoring not only SCSU students but also faculty members.  The program will also reach non-science majors through inquiry-based astronomy labs, and outreach programs will be used to share the science with the public and K-12 community. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award, entitled "A Partnership in Observational and Computational Astronomy (POCA)", made possible collaborative research and educational activities among South Carolina State University (SCSU, a Historically Black College/University (HBCU)), the National Optical Astronomy Observatory (NOAO) and Clemson University (CU). The mission of POCA was to develop an effective, long-term partnership that combined the strengths of the three institutions to increase the scientific and educational output of all the partners with special emphasis on enhancing diversity in the field of astronomy.  That mission has been accomplished over the past 7.5 years and the three institutions continue to collaborate with each other even though the initial award has ended.     The Broader Impact of this project was to increase diversity in the field of astronomy by (1) strengthening the educational and research program in physics and astronomy at an HBCU, specifically SCSU; and (2) increasing the number of individuals from underrepresented groups that engage in astronomical activities and earned degrees in astronomy and related fields.       Item 1 was achieved by involving the three physics faculty members at SCSU in a variety of activities with scientists at the partner institutions including authorship of peer reviewed publications, training and use of ground-based telescopes at Kitt Peak National Observatory and successfully competing to obtain observing time on NASAÆs space-based observatory Kepler.  Additionally, the SCSU faculty members and their students in collaboration with scientists at NOAO, CU and other institutions gave presentations at national conferences and created educational products such as laboratory and web-based activities.     The success of Item 2 above was through supporting students in programs at SCSU, CU and other institutions.  The POCA project assisted individuals with the completion of 2 Ph.D. degrees with 2 more currently in progress, the completion of 5 M.S. degrees with 3 more currently in progress and the completion of 19 B.S. degrees while 8 more are currently in progress. Almost all of these individuals were from groups that have historically been underrepresented in astronomy and physics including African-Americans, Hispanics, Caucasian females and students with disabilities.     The Intellectual Merit of the work from this project included publications that helped develop a better understanding of magnetic fields in galaxies at radio frequencies, pulsating stars known as Semiregular red giants that are near the end of their life and other types of peculiar stars that display highly unusual chemical and physical properties including R Coronae Borealis, XX Ophiuchus and novae. The development and distribution of inquiry-based, laboratory exercises and web-based activities has helped numerous students and teachers better understand the field of cosmology.  These activities in education, research and outreach continue among the participants and will further advance the field and the public perception of these topics past the end point of this award.
