<AbstractNarration>In the late 1970s, hydrothermal vents, characterized by caustic chemistry, hot temperatures, and high pressure, were discovered as oases of life in the deep sea.  Here, ancient and unusual microbes, capable of extracting energy from volcanic rather than solar energy, were found to be the basis of this archean ecosystem.  In the late 1980's, direct examination of water samples revealed that viruses were extraordinarily abundant within the global ocean.  Subsequent research now indicates that viruses are the most abundant life form on Earth, estimated to number 10 to the 31st power (1 followed by 31 zeros) individuals.  And, only in the past year, it was discovered that DNA viruses comprise the largest pool of uncharacterized genetic diversity in the biosphere.  The central objective of this research program is to explore the abundant, but largely unknown, assemblages of viruses within the hostile environments of deep-sea hydrothermal vents.  Because viruses can significantly alter the biological characteristics of their microbial hosts, in some cases changing benign bacteria into pathogens, it is possible that viruses at the deep-sea vents are intimately involved in assisting microbial life cope with the challenging conditions of deep-sea hydrothermal vents. &lt;br/&gt;Data from this research will expand on-going efforts to describe the full extent of genetic diversity on Earth.  DNA sequence data from this project will reveal thousands of new genes and protein groups and possibly entirely new viral clades (families) existing at the vents.  Outreach and education efforts during the project will include all levels of science education.  The team will use an internet-based interactive education program designed to involve thousands of elementary and middle school students in the daily scientific progress of the oceanographic field expedition to the vents.  Short course workshops conducted in San Diego and in Delaware will train young scientists in the use of microbial DNA sequence data for environmental science. Finally, PhD students and postdoctoral fellows will be trained for the interdisciplinary world of environmental microbiology.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
