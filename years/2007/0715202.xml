<AbstractNarration>IIS-0715202&lt;br/&gt;Thomas Finholt&lt;br/&gt;University of Michigan&lt;br/&gt;$25,008 - 12 mos&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;DOCTORAL COLLOQUIUM: Third International e-Social Science Conference&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a 12-month standard award to support a Doctoral Colloquium program at the Third International e-Social Science Conference to be held in Ann Arbor, MI (October 7-9, 2007). This will bring together 20 dissertation stage doctoral students in the field of e-social science for one day of talks and interaction with 4 faculty members selected from among distinguished social science researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The focus of the Doctoral Colloquium will be the students' doctoral dissertations. These represent state-of-the-art research in the field of social science and e-social science. The Doctoral Colloquium provides both an opportunity for these projects to be shaped through intellectual exchange as well as communicating the character of the work to a key group of young scholars. In addition, the Colloquium will help spread ideas about e-social science within the US.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;The Doctoral Colloquium will bring together the best of the next generation of social science and e-social science researchers. This allows them to create a social network both among themselves and with several senior researchers, which will play a major role in their professional development. The diversity of Colloquium participants (nationality, scientific roots, methods), will broaden students' horizons at a critical stage in their education. As this is the first time the eSS conference has been held in North America, it offers a special opportunity for American students who have not been able to afford participation in the prior European conferences.</AbstractNarration>
