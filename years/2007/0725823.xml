<AbstractNarration> &lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to develop tools for understanding and improving the reliability and performance of interdependent power and communication systems during catastrophic events such as hurricanes. The approach is to use probabilistic modeling of the heterogeneous, interdependent infrastructure, power and telecommunication systems. Analytical and simulation approaches for analyzing reliability, survivability, and performance of these critical systems during catastrophic events will be developed. These tools will allow probabilistic prediction of the performance of these systems during natural catastrophes; efficient allocation of critical resources for improving survivability; developing techniques for failure localization; and fast recovery and system restoration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will significantly advance the state of the art by developing analytical and probabilistic models of the performance of realistic interdependent power and communications systems. The state of the art will also be advanced by developing analytical and modeling approaches for large-scale common-cause failures that may lead to the simultaneous failure of multiple links and nodes in power and communications systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide tools that can be used by government agencies and private utilities to minimize the impact of loss of power and communications on both immediate post-event emergency response and longer-term economic and social recovery. The project will thus benefit the life, security and economic well being of people.  The results will also be integrated into two inter-disciplinary courses. Underrepresented student groups will be targeted for student recruitment. In addition, an undergraduate researcher will be recruited through a new program with Houston Community College, a minority-serving institution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
