<AbstractNarration>NONTECHNICAL ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This NSF project addresses the fundamental physical processes that give rise to novel collective phenomena and self-assembled nano-structures. The materials known to exhibit these collective phenomena are the strongly correlated electron transition metal oxides (TMOs). The understanding of these phenomena will not only enhance our knowledge of basic science, but also gives us the ability to design materials with novel and predictable properties. Specifically, the experimental program integrates neutron scattering experiments with lab based materials efforts, aimed at the fundamental understanding of the spin and lattice excitations in TMOs such as electron-doped high-transition-temperature (high-Tc) superconductors and layered manganese oxides. The objective of the program is to explore and understand the microscopic origins of various phases in the TMOs using neutron as a probe. Neutron scattering experiments will be performed mostly at the newly upgraded high-flux isotope reactor (HFIR) at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. However, the project will also utilize other world-class facilities in the U.S. and Europe when similar capabilities are unavailable at HFIR. The impact of this research program will include the training of the next generation of neutron scatters and elucidating the nature of the exotic properties of the TMOs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This NSF project addresses the dominant new scientific theme of our time, the fundamental and practical importance of understanding complex, self-organizing behavior exhibited in transition metal oxides (TMOs). The objective of this research program is to explore and understand the microscopic origins of various phases in the TMOs using neutron scattering as a primary tool. Specially, the project will focus on electron-doped high-transition temperature (high-Tc) superconductors and layered colossal magneto-resistance (CMR) manganese-oxides. For high-Tc superconductors, the project will investigate the nature of the interplay between magnetism and superconductivity. For CMR manganese-oxides, the project will focus on understanding how the microscopic spin/lattice dynamics determine the bulk magnetic and transport properties of these materials. Neutron scattering experiments, the core part of this research program, will be performed mostly at the newly upgraded high-flux isotope reactor (HFIR) at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). However, the project will also utilize other world-class facilities in the U.S. and Europe when similar capabilities are unavailable at HFIR. The impact of this research program will include the training of the next generation of neutron scatters and elucidating the nature of the exotic properties of the TMOs. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
