    <AbstractNarration>Title: Doctoral Dissertation Research: Prisoner Reentry: Understanding the Parolee's Experience&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: Sara Steen, University of Colorado at Boulder&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 0703468&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;This dissertation research examines how women experience the challenges and make sense out of returning to their communities after spending time in prison. Although prisoner reentry, the process by which prisoners are returned to society, has long been part of the criminal justice conversation, this long-standing discussion is now taking on new importance. More offenders are coming out of prison than ever before, as a result of our society's increased reliance on imprisonment, resulting in ever-larger numbers of individuals experiencing the reentry process. Current research on reentry tends to focus on what factors predict successful reintegration back into the community as opposed to understanding and contextualizing the experiences of former prisoners as something that is shaped by other social actors, their own community, and their own perceptions of their experiences. Additionally, few researchers have focused on women's reentry experiences. Therefore, the main research questions of this study include: (1) How do women experience the reentry process? (2) How do women on parole experience the stigma of being a former prisoner? (3) What does it mean to be "successful" in the reentry process? To answer these questions fifty women who release onto parole in eastern Colorado will be interviewed at least two times. The first in-depth semi-structured interview occurs as soon as possible after the participant is released onto parole while subsequent interviews are conducted between three and six months later with women who remain in the community. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This dissertation research will advance knowledge on several fronts: within the field of sociology by expanding on classical work focused on stigma; within the field of criminology by deepening the information available on reentry; and finally, for practitioners and government officials who are grappling with what has been defined as the "reentry problem." This research also has several broader impacts. First, women's and prisoner's voices have historically been silenced; this research provides a forum for these voices and their stories to be heard. Additionally, this research occurs in collaboration with the state Department of Corrections and multiple community agencies designed to meet the needs of former prisoners. Hence, this project enhances partnerships across the field of academia, the criminal justice system, and the community. Finally, the findings of this research will be presented to the DOC in order to provide information that can inform policy and programming in order to better meet the needs of women who reenter the community via parole.</AbstractNarration>
