<AbstractNarration>The pathways leading to the indolic amino acid tryptophan are of critical importance because tryptophan is required in animal and human diets and because indolic compounds are used as intercellular signals in plants and animals.  In addition, indolic pathways reside at the interface of primary and secondary metabolism and function as a node in dynamic metabolic processes that may be predictive of the metabolic status of individual cell types. The objective of this project is to demonstrate the potential of metabolite quantification or profiling methods (metabolomics) to provide insight at the single cell level into the cellular and metabolic consequences of disrupting genes involved in tryptophan biosynthesis. This approach will answer important questions about differences in metabolism between cells that are in close proximity to one another, but which differ in their origin, function or ultimate fate.  The project will take advantage of approaches that have been effective when applied to cell-specific transcript profiling, namely sorting of cells with fluorescent protein-tagged fusion proteins in specific cell types, and will apply them to targeted metabolite profiling on a submicro-scale.  Tryptophan biosynthesis is an excellent metabolic pathway for such studies not only because the pathway exists at the interface between primary and secondary metabolism, but also because increased tryptophan levels are a potentially valuable crop plant trait and a target for metabolic engineering for animal and human health. A project website (http://www.auxin.org) will detail the specific objectives and progress of the project, including metabolite profiling data.  Mutant lines will be deposited at the ABRC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The major objective of this project is to advance the methodology of metabolomics (metabolite quantification) at the tissue and cellular levels to the point that it is routinely available to the broader plant community as part of the functional genomics toolbox.   The PIs will develop a workshop to disseminate metabolomics methods to the broader scientific community.  This project will train postdoctoral fellows, who will be well-positioned to continue the development and application of metabolomics as a genomics tool. The project will interface with on-going activities to recruit and train members of underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed activities meet the goals of the 2010 Project by addressing a recognized need to focus on metabolite profiling in order to characterize the localizome, that is, information about gene and protein expression patterns and metabolite concentrations and flux at the organ, tissue, cellular and/or subcellular levels in the living plant. As noted in the 2010 Project mid-course assessment, knowledge of small molecule biology in Arabidopsis is not only fundamental for a holistic understanding of plant biology, but also in the context of plants as a source of food for both humans and animals as well as sources of pharmaceuticals.  As an essential amino acid, tryptophan biosynthesis is broadly relevant, and the approaches developed will allow the study of any metabolite network in plants.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project was a collaborative proposal between the Cohen lab (UMinn), Normanly lab (UMass/Amherst), and the Celenza lab (Boston University).  This report covers outcomes from the award to the Celenza lab. The overall objective of this 2010 Project was to develop targeted, quantitative metabolomics methods with cellular and subcellular resolution.  This project focused upon determining, at the cellular and subcellular level, the metabolic consequences of genetic disruption and dysregulation of tryptophan (Trp) biosynthesis using Arabidopsis.  Trp biosynthesis is an exemplary metabolic pathway not only because of its location at the interface between primary and secondary metabolism, but also because an increase in its levels is a potentially valuable crop plant trait relevant to metabolic engineering for animal and human health.  1) To aid in identifying Trp-metabolizing tissues, full-length fluorescent reporters for the CYP79B2 (At4g39950), CYP79B3 (At2g22330), ASA1 (At5g05730), TSB1 (At5g54810), TSB2 (At4g27070), and TSBLIKE1 (At5g38530) genes were created.  In addition, promoter-only reporters were constructed for CYP79B2 and CYP79B3. Transgenic plants carrying these reporters have been constructed and are currently being analyzed for use in cell type specific metabolite profiling and studying the spatial and temporal expression patterns of these genes.  2) A number of mutants were characterized to assess dysregulation of Trp metabolism.  Because Trp biosynthesis likely interacts with IAA and other Trp metabolite production, the role of Trp biosynthetic genes was analyzed.  Mutations in two Trp synthase alpha subunit genes [TSA1 (At3g54640) and TSAlike (At4g02610)] and three Trp synthase beta subunit genes [TSB1 (At5g54810), TSB1 (At4g27070) and TSBLIKE (At5g38530)] were examined.  Various higher order mutant combinations were constructed and these as well as the single mutant were profiled for indolic metabolites.  Findings to date indicate that TSB1 is the most important beta subunit, but that the other two beta subunit genes contribute to overall Trp synthase activity.  Double mutant combinations between tsb1 and either of the other two beta genes are less healthy than tsb1 alone.  We have not been able to construct a beta subunit triple mutant or a alpha subunit double mutant suggesting that these combinations are lethal.  These results are being prepared for publication.  3) While not part of the original aims of this grant, a mutant called iss1 (indole super sensitive) was identified as having an important role in aromatic amino acid metabolism and thus was cloned and analyzed further.  The iss1 mutant was found to accumulate ten-fold higher indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) compared to wild type and display growth phenotypes consistent with elevated IAA, a plant growth hormone.  The iss1 mutant also affects other aspects of Trp metabolism as well as secondary metabolism of phenylalanine and tyrosine suggesting a general role in aromatic amino acid metabolism.  The ISS1 gene was cloned and identified as At1g80360, an uncharacterized aminotransferase.  Aromatic amino acid aminotransferase activity was demonstrated for heterologously expressed ISS1 protein.  These results are being prepared for publication.  4) During the course of this project, two PhD students, one technician, and four undergraduate summer interns were supported in part by this award.  In addition aspects of this project were incorporated in Boston University undergraduate laboratory course.  For example, the laboratory course helped created transgenic reporter constructions describe above in section 1.       Last Modified: 01/17/2013       Submitted by: John L Celenza]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
