<AbstractNarration>The rise of the Tibetan plateau has profoundly changed the Earth's atmospheric&lt;br/&gt;circulation and climate. For this reason, it has been the prime site to understand the link&lt;br/&gt;between tectonics and climate change as well as the processes of continental collision.&lt;br/&gt;There are several competing hypotheses for the rise of the Tibetan plateau: a rapid and&lt;br/&gt;broad increase in the elevation of the plateau, an expansion of the plateau by&lt;br/&gt;continuous viscous flow of lower crust, or an expansion of the plateau by sequential and&lt;br/&gt;localized shear between coherent crust and mantle blocks. At the center of the&lt;br/&gt;competing scenarios is the question whether the plateau has grown upward en masse&lt;br/&gt;or outward over time. The best place to address this question is the northeast Tibetan&lt;br/&gt;plateau, where the plateau is at a nascent stage with features and dynamic processes&lt;br/&gt;in the crust and shallow mantle that are keys to the understanding of the mechanisms&lt;br/&gt;that may have operated for the entire Tibetan plateau.&lt;br/&gt;This collaborative project between U.S. and Chinese institutions acquires seismic data&lt;br/&gt;from the northeast Tibetan plateau. The research includes detailed studies to image the&lt;br/&gt;crust and mantle structures in the region, to test the current hypotheses against seismic&lt;br/&gt;observations, and to develop new models that integrate seismic observations and other&lt;br/&gt;geological constraints. The research also includes focused studies to analyze regional&lt;br/&gt;earthquake activity, which helps to mitigate earthquake hazards in one of the&lt;br/&gt;seismically most active areas in the interior of a continental plate.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We have worked on this project to understand how continental plateaus grow and evolve over time.  Our primary tool to investigate this process is subsurface imaging using seismic waves.

The second stage of this work is to develop subsurface images of the crust and upper mantle beneath this region. These images help us understand the thermal and rheological state of the earth and thus this tells us about how the plateau has evolved over time.  My approach has been to try and focus on the lithospheric mantle beneath the northeastern Tibet using multiple methods to image the lithospheric structure.  This inolves measuring both the speed of different waves and how these waves attenuate.  When we see good agreement between the different models we can start to believe that we have measured something robust about the subsurface.  In general we have found that the northeastern corner of the Tibetan plateau is quite hot in the subsurface with possible some amount of partial melt being present in the uppermost mantle.  This would suggest that the hot and more bouyant upper mantle is helping to uplift the plateau.  The origin of the hot uppermost mantle is still being debated but we have several candidates ranging from strain heating to tectonic removal of the mantle lithosphere.
