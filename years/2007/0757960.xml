<AbstractNarration>Funds from this grant will be used to support our group's efforts in the projects in nucleon structure and in tests of fundamental symmetries. In the first year, we will be completing data analysis from the G0 experiment in which parity-violating electron scattering is used to determine the contributions of strange quarks to the proton's charge and magnetism. Later in the grant period we will participate in an experiment that uses muon pair production to probe the distribution of antiquarks in the proton (FNAL experiment E906). This latter measurement addresses a number of unanswered questions about the nonperturbative QCD structure of the proton, such as the degree of charge symmetry in proton's internal structure and the role of antiquarks in ground state properties of free and bound nucleons. Our group is also participating in experiments that use precision measurements of neutron beta decay to test fundamental symmetries. The broader impact of this group's research is primarily through providing outstanding research opportunities for both graduate and undergraduate students. Students are exposed to nuclear physics concepts, get hands-on experience developing hardware, make significant contributions to the experiments, and have the opportunity to visit and participate in programs at major national laboratories.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This NSF grant has supported research in experiments to better understand the fundamental nature of the particles that make up the majority of the visible matter of the universe, the protons and neutrons that are responsible for the nuclei of chemical elements, the matter that makes up stars, planets, and ultimately, us.  The first half of the grant period was spent completing a decade-long initiative to use a very subtle interaction of an electron with a proton (through the "weak" force) to help pick apart various contributions to the protonÆs charge and magnetism from their even smaller internal constituents, the quarks and gluons that are the most basic building blocks of the strong force.  We scattered spinning electrons from a proton, measuring very small (part per million) differences in detector count rate as the spin of the electron was reversed (30 times a second). This project, called "G0" and which was carried out at Jefferson Laboratory in Newport News, VA, is now complete and has produced high precision results on the contribution of strange quarks to the protonÆs charge and magnetism.  During the period of this grant, our group joined a new effort at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL), which is still ongoing (now known as "SeaQuest").  This project is focused on measurements of how antiquarks move about within protons and neutrons, and uses the unique capabilities of FNALÆs high energy proton beam.  The quarks within the proton beam interact with anti-quarks in a deuterium target and annihilate each other, creating pairs of muons, particles that are insensitive to the strong force. This process is known as Drell-Yan.  The distribution and abundance of these muon pairs reveals the motion of antiquarks in the target. A series of early experiments showed a flavor asymmetry in the abundance of light quarks, strongly suggesting that the relatively simple "perturbative" picture of gluons splitting into quark-antiquark pairs is insufficient and that a more complicated, correlated picture is required.  This experiment will push the measurements further and with higher precision into the region where this distinction between these two pictures will be more distinct. During the period of this grant, the work has been devoted to design, construction, and implementation of the apparatus, with one test run completed in 2012.
