<AbstractNarration>Ahluwalia&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0753092&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The investigators organize an annual conference on Frontiers&lt;br/&gt;in Applied and Computational Mathematics (FACM) on the campus of&lt;br/&gt;the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) in Newark, New&lt;br/&gt;Jersey.  The conferences include the significant participation of&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate and graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and&lt;br/&gt;junior faculty.  The FACM conference series has been organized&lt;br/&gt;over the past four years by the Department of Mathematical&lt;br/&gt;Sciences and the Center for Applied Mathematics and Statistics at&lt;br/&gt;NJIT and is partially funded through an NJIT Strategic Initiative&lt;br/&gt;Plan.  The conference has become a leading forum for the&lt;br/&gt;dissemination of research in applied and computational&lt;br/&gt;mathematics and applied statistics.  The three year conference&lt;br/&gt;plan for 2008-2010 is as follows: FACM '08 is a large (250-300&lt;br/&gt;participants) general meeting in applied mathematics, involving&lt;br/&gt;in particular mathematical biology, fluid dynamics, wave&lt;br/&gt;propagation, and applied probability and statistics.  FACM '09&lt;br/&gt;and '10 are smaller (125-150 participants) focused meetings on&lt;br/&gt;mathematical biology and fluid dynamics, respectively, which are&lt;br/&gt;areas of focus in the Department. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     This conference series brings together mathematicians,&lt;br/&gt;statisticians, physicists, engineers, and biologists to share&lt;br/&gt;results of their research in applied and computational&lt;br/&gt;mathematics and applied statistics.  The broader impacts are that&lt;br/&gt;significant cross-fertilization takes place during and after the&lt;br/&gt;conferences between researchers in different disciplines who&lt;br/&gt;utilize the methods of applied mathematics, statistics and&lt;br/&gt;numerical computation.  For students and postdocs, this is a&lt;br/&gt;major learning experience that helps them with future&lt;br/&gt;presentations and research.  For many of these students, such a&lt;br/&gt;local research conference is their first exposure to high quality&lt;br/&gt;research being undertaken at other research institutions.  This&lt;br/&gt;exposure helps students strive to emulate the quality of these&lt;br/&gt;research activities.  Past FACM conferences have an excellent&lt;br/&gt;record of participation of women and underrepresented minorities,&lt;br/&gt;and special efforts are made to continue this trend. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
