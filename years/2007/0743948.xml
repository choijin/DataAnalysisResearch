<AbstractNarration>0743948&lt;br/&gt;Greenshields&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is for a U.S.-Egypt Workshop entitled "International Workshop on Supercomputing Applications in Climate Sciences and Remote Sensing" to be held in Cairo, Egypt March 17-19, 2007.  The organizers are Drs. Ian Greenshields, Reda Ammar and Sanguthevar Rajasekaran, all from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Connecticut and Dr. Ayman El-Dessouki from the National Authority for Remote Sensing and Space Sciences in Cairo, Dr. Salwa Nasser from the Electronics Research Institute in Cairo, and Dr. Atef Sherif, Mechanical Engineering Department, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt. The Workshop will focus on the synergy between climate scientists and computational scientists as it relates to the study of the climate of the Middle East. In particular, the Workshop will study the synergy between climate scientists engaged in large-scale simulations of the climate of the Middle East and computational scientists interested in the algorithmic aspects of such simulations, with particular attention paid to parallel algorithms and Grid computing. Participants will include invited scientists, in climate and computational sciences, from the US and countries in the Middle East, including Egypt, Jordan and Lebanon.  Dr. A. El-Dessouki is in a national leadership position in Remote Sensing and Climate Sciences as they impact Egypt; Dr. S. Nasser brings expertise in parallel and grid computing; and Dr. A. Sherif who brings expertise in space sciences.  It is expected that a minimum 14 other climate and computational scientists from throughout the Middle East will be participants in the Workshop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit:  The Workshop' will cover the synergy between climate scientists involved in large-scale simulations of the climate of the Middle East and computational scientists involved both in the study of algorithms as they relate to such large-scale simulations (especially parallel algorithms) and in the use of the modern Grid computing paradigm to establish long-term collaborative working relationships between US and Middle Eastern climate scientists and computational scientists. In addition to the intellectual exchange between climate and computational scientists, the Workshop will allow for establishing three Working Groups in the areas of a) Computational Support for the Study of Climate Sciences and Remote Sensing in the Middle East; b) Collaborative Support for Climate, Remote Sensing and Computational Scientists studying the Middle East (US/Middle East Climate Grid); c) Planning Support to extend the collaborative outcomes of the Workshop to the wider Middle East.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: The establishment of on-going working groups is expected to catalyze further interaction between US and Middle Eastern climate/computational scientists. The workshop will have a dedicated session on education, and it is expected that graduate student exchanges to occur between the US and the Middle East.  The long-term prospect of a US-Middle Eastern Climate Grid can be a prototype for other Grid collaborations in disciplines other than climate sciences.&lt;br/&gt;This project is being supported under the US-Egypt Joint Fund Program, which provides grants to scientists and engineers in both countries to carry out these cooperative activities. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
