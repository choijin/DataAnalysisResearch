<AbstractNarration>ALGORITHMS, COMBINATORICS AND GEOMETRY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Knowledge of mathematics and combinatorics is crucial to the design of combinatorial algo-&lt;br/&gt;rithms. Conversely, questions or concepts arising in the applications sometimes give rise to&lt;br/&gt;interesting mathematical problems, or can be used to solve mathematical problems. Hence,&lt;br/&gt;any type of interaction between the discrete mathematics and the computer science commu-&lt;br/&gt;nities is beneficial to both groups and must be encouraged.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of North Texas in Denton will host a workshop focusing on algorithms, com-&lt;br/&gt;binatorics and geometry. The workshop would focus on the mathematical and algorithmic&lt;br/&gt;problems arising from combinatorial and geometric structures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is anticipated that the talks would introduce a broad range of fundamental and recent re-&lt;br/&gt;sults which would be of interest to the advanced and beginning researchers in combinatorics,&lt;br/&gt;combinatorial and computational geometry, computational biology, geometric graph theory,&lt;br/&gt;topology, theoretical computer science and graph drawing. It is further anticipated that the&lt;br/&gt;workshop would bring together advanced researchers, as well as graduate students in many&lt;br/&gt;areas of discrete mathematics and computer science and engineering, and hence foster and&lt;br/&gt;facilitate collaboration and joint research among different communities. To disseminate the&lt;br/&gt;knowledge presented at the workshop and to assess its impact, a special issue of a journal&lt;br/&gt;will be selected for possible publication of a collection of the papers that relate to the main&lt;br/&gt;theme of the workshop.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
