<AbstractNarration>The University of Virginia's Blandy Experimental Farm will host 10 students per year in an 11-week program in Field Biology, with an emphasis on Ecology and Evolution. The goal is to provide students with a full view of research science from the first ideas that lead to testable research questions, through the critical process of developing a research proposal, on through the rigors of field research, data analysis, and presentation. The program aims to improve students' understanding of research science and strengthen their abilities and confidence in public presentation. The program seeks to build a diverse, cooperative student community in which students learn as much from each other as from their mentors. The main research areas include plant population biology, plant-insect interactions, pollination biology, ecosystem ecology, conservation, invasive species, science education, aquatic ecology and applied insect ecology. In addition to participating in research projects, students attend weekly seminars given by visiting scholars, and take advantage of the numerous biological and cultural opportunities in northern Virginia. Blandy Experimental Farm is an ecological field station (not a farm) at the northern edge of the Shenandoah Valley. It is rural in character, but not isolated: it lies within 10 miles of the Shenandoah River, the Blue Ridge Mountains, and the Appalachian Trail, and only 60 miles from Washington, DC. Students are chosen based on their prior academic performance, recommendations, and interests. Information is available at http://www.virginia.edu/blandy/ReuWebPage/HomePage.php or by contacting Dr. T'ai Roulston at tai.roulston@virginia.edu.</AbstractNarration>
