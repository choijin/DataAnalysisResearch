<AbstractNarration>Biological nitrogen fixation provides about half of the metabolically accessible nitrogen in nature, which is a fundamental basis of life on earth. This is carried out at ambient conditions from abundant atmospheric dinitrogen by a fascinating metalloenzymatic machinery. This project aims to address some of the fundamental questions about the structure and molecular mechanism of this machinery that remain unanswered despite decades of past research. The approach has the potential to contribute significantly to the design of functionally analogous biomimetic systems for agricultural and chemical technological use. A set of physical-chemical parameters will be established that is required for the activation and reduction of the N-N triple bond in dinitrogen at iron-sulfur cluster-based compounds. The chemical composition of the unknown interstititial ligand at the active site cofactor center of the Mo-containing nitrogenase metalloenzyme will be determined. Building on the above two tasks, an in silico, virtual chemical model of the metalloenzyme active site will be created, which is a long needed tool for probing the intimate molecular details of substrate binding, proton, and electron-transfer, substrate activation and transformation, and product release processes. These will be achieved by employing an innovative combination of the multi-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopic technique and a range of computational methods. Due to the complex nature of the above tasks, the research will be carried out in a multidisciplinary environment involving biochemists and enzymologists, spectroscopists, inorganic and computational chemists that will provide a unique environment for scientific discovery and student training at undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral levels.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The main scientific achievement of the project will be the specific understanding of how ligand/protein environment and cluster composition can influence the structure and reactivity of heterometal substituted iron-sulfur clusters with relevance to nitrogen fixation. This knowledge will be incorporated into a computational model of the nitrogenase active site that looks and acts in silico like the real metalloenzyme in vitro. The methodology developed is likely to impact research efforts toward the catalytic mechanism of other iron-sulfur containing metalloenzymes. As part of student training, the principal investigator's students will learn the fine details of metalloenzymatic and biomimetic sample preparations from collaborators.  Conversely, the principal investigator will train the collaborators' students in synchrotron science, physical inorganic chemistry, and computational chemistry. The research activities and scientific insights will be disseminated via peer-reviewed journals, conferences and meetings, and electronically via the research group's website.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The research and educational activities were organized around the employment of combined theoretical, experimental, and synthetic approaches to eliminate the uncertainties in the composition and structure of the catalytic active cluster (FeMo-cofactor) of nitrogenase. The nitrogenase is a metalloenzyme that is responsible for dinitrogen uptake and its conversion for a bioavailable form of ammonia. Despite decades of experimental and computational work, the exact composition and charge state of FeMo-co was not known, until our comprehensive computational modeling, which identified that the unknown central ligand of nitrogenase must be carbide, and the cluster oxidation state is 2-electron more reduced than previously described in literature (Figure 1). It is remarkable that these conclusions were based on computational chemistry modeling that are now being supported by independent crystallographic and X-ray spectroscopic measurements.  With the composition and charge state now defined, we developed a molecular-level model for the Thorneley-Lowe kinetic model for biological nitrogen fixation (Figure 2), where ever electron and proton is accounted for.  In order to quantitatively evaluate the actual molecular mechanism of biological nitrogen fixation, we mapped out the 4 &Aring; immediate protein environment of FeMo-co (Figure 3) that enabled us to construct a virtual chemical model that not just look like but act like as the real cofactor (Figure 4).  Due to the complex spin and electronic structure of FeMo-co, we evaluated the validity of the virtual chemical modeling approach on a simpler metallocofactor of the galactose oxidase (Figure 5), where a stepwise and systematic mapping of the network of weak interactions resulted a large computational model that is absolutely required for reproducing all available experimental data for the catalytic site in galactose oxidase.  In addition to the science and discovery process, we also conducted a limited computational method development where we developed a generalized ionic fragment merging method to always obtain the correct electronic structure for broken-symmetry calculations, a Matlab-based spin projection code, an automated data reduction protocol for multi-edge XAS-data, and all supporting information to our publications now organized at the research group website.  The project trained three postdoctoral associates, two graduate students, and an undergraduate student in computational chemistry, synchrotron-based X-ray spectroscopic measurements, and chemical synthesis of biomimetic Fe-S clusters. The lead graduate student has successfully defended his Ph.D. dissertation on the subject. The postdoctoral candidates are now in academic positions either as an assistant professor, a research assistant professor, or a staff scientist.

The funding allowed for the PI to develop new graduate courses, design lectures and hands on activities for middle and high school teachers as part of MSSE program, involve Native American students in scientific research, and play chemistry games with a group of home-schooled children.
