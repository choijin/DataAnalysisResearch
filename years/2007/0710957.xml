<AbstractNarration>0710957&lt;br/&gt;Lewandowski&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description: This project supports collaborative research by Dr. John Lewandowski, Department of Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio in collaboration with Dr. with Adel El-Shabasy, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt.  They plan to study the processing and mechanical properties of amorphous metal foil and laminates.  The microstructures and the fracture morphology will be evaluated by optical, scanning electron, and transmission electron microscopy. The main objectives of this work are to characterize and understand the factors contributing to the strength, toughness, and fatigue behavior, with a view towards improving their toughness. A simple technique of self-lamination will be applied using AF163-2K epoxy (produced by 3M Co.) as a bonding material. The toughness of the processed laminates will be determined.  If the self-laminates do not exhibit improved toughness, lamination with another ductile foil material will be considered. Fatigue tests will also be conducted on some of the laminates in order to determine the effects of such lamination on cyclic performance.  The fatigue properties of these materials under fully reversed conditions will be determined using equipment successfully used in the evaluation of the fatigue behavior of thin membranes for the electronics industry.  In addition, tension and notch toughness tests will be carried out on these foils to identify their initial mechanical properties. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual impact:  This project is aimed at evaluating numerous mechanical properties of iron (Fe)-based metallic glass foils, including their strength, fracture toughness, and fatigue behavior using state-of-the-art methods.  Amorphous materials, such as metallic glasses having disordered non-crystallinity, are known to possess unusually high strength, elastic modulus, and microhardness along with superior wear and corrosion resistance, but their tensile ductility and fracture toughness are extremely poor, leading to brittle failures under tensile loading.  The ductility of Fe-based metallic glasses needs to be enhanced for successful engineering applications.  The project can lead to enhancing the ductility through control of microstructures and formation of laminates.  Results should help identify the factors that contribute towards improving properties. Successful completion of various aspects of this work will lead to increased use of such materials in small-scale structures.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader impact: Metallic glass foils provide an interesting set of properties that may be exploited in various microsystems. These may be subjected to fatigue loading in numerous engineering applications. The ultra-high strength and generally homogenous chemical composition provide the possibility of good resistance to environmental attack and fatigue. However, it is also well known that the fatigue properties of a bulk material cannot be adopted for small-scale structures. Thus, it is not clear how such materials will behave when their dimensions are reduced.  The project dealing with a particular amorphous alloy family that is available in foil form will help in using these materials in many unique applications that require superior mechanical properties. Both collaborating organizations have adequate resources to complete the proposed tasks. The PIs have interacted in past and therefore it is expected that much can be accomplished under this project.&lt;br/&gt;This project is being supported under the US-Egypt Joint Fund Program, which provides grants to scientists and engineers in both countries to carry out these cooperative activities.</AbstractNarration>
