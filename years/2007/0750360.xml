<AbstractNarration>In this proposal the PI will study the force sensing mechanism in a representative of the unicellular organisms: paramecia. Paramecium fights its tendency to sediment exerting a stronger propulsive force when it swims upward than when it swims downward. This behavior indicates that paramecia can sense forces corresponding to pressure differences that are less than 1/10,000,000th of atmospheric pressure. To investigate the unknown source of this sensitive force response the PI will apply forces on paramecia and measuring how the geometry and speed of their swimming trajectories change. The characteristics of their trajectories will reveal their force sensing mechanisms. The methods will employ the intense magnetic fields generated at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory in Tallahassee, Florida. Magnetic fields will also be used to direct and contain the swimming paramecia so that they can study individual swimmers for extended periods of time. In addition to workers in the cell force sensing field, the results will be of interest to the community of scientists interested in cell motility and in particular, low Reynolds number swimming. The proposed experiments will serve as the PhD thesis work for a PhD student at Brown University. It will expose the student to all aspects of experimental research including experimental design, data acquisition and analysis, and results dissemination. The student will develop expertise in biophysics including mechano-transduction in cells and cell motility and this training will augment our nations science and technology base.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Impact:  Paramecia are single celled organisms that swim by beating 1000's of tiny hairs called cilia that cover their bodies.  This coordinated beating enables them to navigate around obstacles, fight their tendency to sediment and propel themselves through murky ponds.  This project provided new insights into how paramecia change their swimming in thicker, more viscous fluids and how they interact with surfaces that they bump into.    The experiments showed that paramecia slow the beating, but not the direction, of their cilia when they swim into a more viscous fluid.  The effect leads them to swim half as fast in a twice as viscous fluid.  A mathematical model relating the beating of the cilia with the motion was developed to get this result.  The result is somewhat surprising because cilia do not slow down in all systems, including some mammalian organs, under these circumstances. Understanding the origins of these differences could be helpful in the fight of diseases caused by ciliary malfunction, like cystic fibrosis.    A second set of experiments, which investigated what paramecia do when they swim into a surface, suggest that paramecia navigate obstacles passively, rather than actively as higher organisms like fish do.  The combination of observations and analysis with a model of the forces acting on a paramecium in contact with a surface led to the following picture.  When paramecia propel themselves headlong into a surface, they simply continue to push, which drives their front end to the side and causes their back end to swing toward the surface.  Eventually the normal swerving that they do as they swim allows them to escape the surface and swim away. To reach this conclusion, it was essential to be able to adjust the collision force between the paramecia and the surface in the experiments.  A novel technique using strong magnetic fields was employed to tune this force.  Surprisingly, when the magnet acted to pull paramecia away from a surface they tended to get stuck while turning at the surface and when the magnet pushed them toward the surface they turned easily at the surface.  These observations were the primary indicators that the paramecia were reacting passively when they encountered surfaces.  They suggest that it is unnecessary for paramecia to adjust their ciliary beating, which can cost extra energy, to navigate around simple obstacles.    Broader Impacts:  The results of this project impact the understanding of ciliary beating, which is a process that occurs in a very wide range of organisms.  Also, the second set of experiments can be useful to others studying the many swimming micro-organisms that interact with surfaces.  This project also served as a platform for training multiple students in techniques in experimental science that can prepare them for later work in high technology industries.
