<AbstractNarration>This project proposes to study research on stochastic processing networks in the heavy traffic&lt;br/&gt;regime. The focus will be on the creation of constructive approximations methods for the performance&lt;br/&gt;analysis questions arising in the area of stochastic processing networks, as well as extending the scope&lt;br/&gt;of the stochastic networks framework to the new domains of applications. The project will pursue a&lt;br/&gt;three-fold goal: extending the applicability of the heavy traffic theory to stochastic queueing networks&lt;br/&gt;operating in the equilibrium (steady-state) regime, creating a performance analysis framework for large&lt;br/&gt;scale call center models in the heavy traffic regime, and creating a general framework for modeling&lt;br/&gt;stochastic queueing processes with shared resources in the heavy traffic regime.&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of the research will have the following important implications. For the&lt;br/&gt;field of stochastic networks in the heavy traffic regime it will make heuristic approaches of analyzing&lt;br/&gt;networks in equilibrium, into a theory and thus making a formal connection between diffusion processes&lt;br/&gt;and the underlying stochastic networks in the equilibrium regime. In the area of large scale call&lt;br/&gt;center models it will provide general and practical methods for the performance of such systems in&lt;br/&gt;the heavy traffic regime, without the restrictive assumptions on the statistical properties of the call&lt;br/&gt;lengths distribution. The state of the art techniques can only handle the special case of exponentially&lt;br/&gt;distributed call lengths. If successful the project will also provide methods for analyzing call centers&lt;br/&gt;in the non-stationary regime, which is the predominant regime of call center operations. The nonstationarity&lt;br/&gt;issue will be addressed by obtaining bounds on the relaxation times of large scale call&lt;br/&gt;center models. Finally, by utilizing a combination of methods, such as the theory of Markov random&lt;br/&gt;fields, a systematic theory of queueing models with shared resources in the heavy traffic regime will be&lt;br/&gt;considered, with a specific goal of constructive performance analysis methods. Stochastic systems with&lt;br/&gt;shared resources appear in a variety of fields, including communication networks, computer systems&lt;br/&gt;and business processes. Yet constructive and general theory of such processes is lacking. The project&lt;br/&gt;will be an important step in the direction of building such a theory.</AbstractNarration>
