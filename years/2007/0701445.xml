<AbstractNarration>The proposal tackles some very difficult yet contemporary problems in collision physics.&lt;br/&gt;Three-body recombination research will be extended to the heavier alkalis (Na, K,&lt;br/&gt;Rb and Cs). A detailed direct comparison of the scattering results when one includes or&lt;br/&gt;excludes nonadiabatic coupling terms and conical intersections will provide new insights&lt;br/&gt;for interpreting observed phenomena. Study of coherently controlled bimolecular&lt;br/&gt;reactions will be extended to include nonadiabatic effects and laser fields. Energy&lt;br/&gt;dependent cross sections will be calculated over a large energy range from ultracold&lt;br/&gt;energies to thermal energies. Threshold behavior and quantum resonances will be&lt;br/&gt;mapped out. The inclusion of electromagnetic interactions will provide cross sections as&lt;br/&gt;a function of laser intensity. The range of laser intensities will be from very weak&lt;br/&gt;intensities to intensities of more than 1012 watts/cm3. Photon-system interactions will&lt;br/&gt;provide a rich enviroment for studying chemical reactions especially at ultracold and&lt;br/&gt;cold temperatures. Time-dependent methods will be developed to watch the flow of&lt;br/&gt;energy among different adiabatic states and regions of configuration space.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The ability to control chemical reactions has immense potential, and is highly sought after by the scientific community. It has received much attention in recent years. To this end, our research has developed new ways to use coherent control to manipulate a reaction process to favor one set of products over another and to create products of a desired kinetic energy or internal state.  In any study of chemical reactions, accurate potential energy surfaces are vital to producing meaningful, worthwhile results, and this is especially true for scattering calculations at cold and ultracold temperatures. We calculated the first accurate, global potential energy surfaces for several electronic states of spin-aligned triatomic lithium.These are of particular interest because they enable precision studies of conical intersections and geometric phase effects.  We presented the most comprehensive calculation to date of the bound states of the spin-aligned lithium trimer. We also presented a new and highly efficient method for calculating these bound states, which is alone noteworthy because of a tremendous increase in efficiency of these normally very expensive calculations.  We are the first research group, as far as we know, to derive the general form of the geometric phase angle and the associated vector potentials for collinear conical intersections. Our Hamiltonian which includes the geometric phase effect, requires no special treatment and can be easily applied to the reactive scattering calculations.
