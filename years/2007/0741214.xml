    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will develop a microreactor system for formation of hydrogen peroxide in water by direct catalytic reaction of oxygen and hydrogen. This approach will overcome limitations that exist in current direct processes, which are not commercially viable. A more efficient and safer reactor system is proposed. Intrinsic attributes of microreactor technology, including exceptional heat and mass transfer rates, and free radical quenching, will allow an efficient, safe, and scalable process to be achieved. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The societal benefits (commercial potential) of this project a "green" process for the formation of hydrogen peroxide in water. The major advantage of hydrogen peroxide over other chemical reagents is the benign by-products that are formed. Hydrogen peroxide is utilized in industrially important processes. Penetration of hydrogen peroxide into industrial processes has been stymied by cost, where a significant fraction of the cost is for shipping of concentrated hydrogen peroxide solutions. The capability to generate low cost hydrogen peroxide on-demand using microreactors will overcome this the shipping expense.</AbstractNarration>
