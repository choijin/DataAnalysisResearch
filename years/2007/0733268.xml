<AbstractNarration>The number of students taking physics in the US is increasing because state requirements and the success of the Physics First and Physics for All Americans movements encourages schools to teach physics in the ninth grade.  Schools that adopt these initiatives must move from a model of teaching academically high performing 11th and 12th grade students to a model that works for all 9th grade students.  The demographic changes and the increased diversity present challenges to physics teachers.  To address this challenge, the traditional professional development model is augmented by an online professional development platform - the Active Physics Teacher Community - that provides just-in-time support for teachers as they are enacting targeted units of the Active Physics curriculum.  Teachers are helped in preparing lessons by providing them with formal instruction related to the lessons they are teaching in the classroom.  In addition, a moderated forum allows teachers to share classroom experiences, successes and questions with other teachers using the same lessons and the same curriculum and to compare their experiences with other teachers who have used the lessons.  Thus teachers are supported both in learning the content and also in representing and formulating the subject in a way to make it comprehensible to others.  The study will be done with teachers in large urban centers using four units of Active Physics.  One unit of Active Chemistry is also tested to determine the generalizability of the professional development model.  In addition, the materials developed and lessons learned are archived in the Active Physics Teachers' Resource Center, a web-based interactive repository to be hosted by the publisher.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Science teachers in need of more effective instructional strategies seek out professional development that can support them in their daily interactions with students.   We created the Active Teacher Communities (ATC) to help high school teachers teaching Active Physics (APTC) and Active Chemistry (ACTC) in three ways: (1) to prepare for each day with formal instruction specifically designed for each dayÃ†s lesson; (2) to share their knowledge, experiences, successes, and challenges with other teachers who are using the same lesson plans and curriculum; and (3) to compare the effectiveness of their teaching with the effectiveness of othersÃ† teaching and modify their strategies accordingly.  Our research on the APTC and ACTC took place between 2008 and 2014. During that time, we first implemented the APTC model in five large, urban districts&mdash;one in the Northeast, two in the South, and two in the West&mdash;before expanding the community nationwide in year four. Throughout the study, we collected data to understand the nature and extent of teachersÃ† engagement with the APTC and ACTC platforms, as well as the challenges and opportunities that affected their use.  The results of our investigation suggest that online professional development (i.e.  APTC and ACTC) can include all five characteristics associated with high quality professional development and improve teacherÃ†s classroom practices. The prepare section of the communities helped all areas of teaching by providing easy access to needed materials and resource; it was particularly helpful for new teachers who initially felt underprepared to teach physics or chemistry. The share and compare sections of the website had a more focused effect on teacherÃ†s teaching: the share section primarily improved teachersÃ† pedagogical approach and timing, while the compare section primarily improved teachersÃ† assessment procedures and expectations.

Why do teachers who have recognized the value of the online professional development site use it infrequently and/or use it to only access materials? To start answering these questions, we will continue documenting how teachers use the APTC and ACTC in subsequent years.  Both the Active Physics Teacher Community and the Active Chemistry Teacher Community are now available to all teachers at no cost and regardless of what specific curriculum they have adopted.
