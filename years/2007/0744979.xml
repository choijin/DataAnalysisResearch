<AbstractNarration>The objective of this project is to investigate adaptations in the peripheral and central nervous systems of the naked mole-rat. Naked mole-rats have an unusual lifestyle in that they combine a fully subterranean existence with extreme sociality, and a proclivity for living in large numbers.  Thus, in their crowded burrows where many animals share a limited air supply, these animals are exposed to the challenges of breathing exceptionally high levels of carbon dioxide and exceptionally low levels of oxygen. Initial studies have revealed that, behaviorally, naked mole-rats are extremely resistant to high carbon dioxide and low oxygen. The goals of the project now are to better understand the underlying mechanisms that make this resistance possible. The project uses a variety of methods including behavioral, electrophysiological, anatomical, and molecular techniques with an emphasis on moving freely between experiments that focus on neural mechanisms and those that focus on natural behaviors.  The project also relies heavily on comparative data from closely and distantly related species that have evolved under different carbon dioxide and oxygen conditions.  The expected impacts of this project include contributing to the understanding of the nervous system in general, and to adaptations to environmental challenges in particular.  Also, the project will develop a new model system for studying the evolution of the nervous system and behavior. The project will provide training opportunities in systems neuroscience for both graduate and undergraduate students.  The project will also enhance laboratory courses in that several laboratory exercises have been developed with these animals.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[      Naked mole-rats have an unusual lifestyle in that they combine a fully subterranean existence, extreme sociality, and a proclivity for living in large numbers.  Spending their entire lives in crowded burrows where many individuals share a limited air supply, these animals have developed an unusual resilience to the challenges of breathing exceptionally low levels of oxygen and exceptionally high levels of carbon dioxide.  During this project, numerous extraordinary features of naked mole-rat neurobiology were revealed that are hypothesized to be adaptations for living under these challenges.  These features include a lack of neurotransmitters in nerves in the nose and respiratory tract that signal pain from irritants like high concentrations of CO2, behavioral insensitivity to these irritants, physiological insensitivity of the lungs to CO2, extreme brain tolerance to hypoxia, reduced intracellular calcium accumulation during hypoxia, and retention of neonatal NMDA channel types that are protective during hypoxia.  Additionally, project personnel participated in sequencing and analyzing the naked mole-rat genome.       In regard to intellectual merit, the project contributed to the understanding of the nervous system in general, and evolutionary adaptations to environmental challenges in particular.  Twenty manuscripts were published during the project (including during a 1.5 year no cost extension).  The project also sparked new collaborations with faculty at the University of Southern California, Harvard, The Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, Washington University in St. Louis, The Free University in Berlin, and The Medical University of Vienna.       In regard to broader impacts, the project had an important impact on science and education in several ways.  The project provided training opportunities for 6 graduate students: four have graduated and three of them are doing post-doctoral work at Emory, Johns Hopkins, and the Medical College of Wisconsin, and the fourth is employed in the private sector.  Two others are still in graduate school.  The project also provided training opportunities for 25 undergraduates interested in systems neurobiology, and in particular students of under-represented groups.  Undergraduates working on the project included 12 women including 4 REU students (one African American, three Latin Americans), as well as an African American and an Hispanic student from UICs Summer Research Opportunities Program for underrepresented students (SROP), and two summer students from the Bridges to the Baccalaureate (B2B) program targeting under-represented groups in Chicago community colleges.  A routine part of the research experience included presenting posters at the UIC Undergraduate Research Symposium and the Chicago Area Undergraduate Research Symposium.  The project also impacted students in the classroom, as the naked mole-rats were directly used in laboratory exercises and independent student research projects in two Biology courses (Animal Behavior and Neuroethology and Cellular Neurobiology Laboratory).  Also, data from the project were integrated into three additional courses (Animal Physiological Systems, Neuroscience Methods, and Neuroscience).  Members of the project also used data from the project to educate the public by acting as Information Specialist volunteers at the Chicago Lincoln Park Zoo, which is a free-admission, city zoo.  The naked mole-rat display drew large numbers of both children and adults and provided a great platform for casual dissemination of information about systems neurobiology focusing on the naked mole-rat as a model.  Finally, because this species has a combination of interesting neurobiological traits, a bizarre appearance (bald and bucktoothed), and an intriguing name (naked), it has attracted attention from the mainstream media, providing a means for bringing neurobiology to the public.
