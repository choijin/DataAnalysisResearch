<AbstractNarration>Computational methods, in particular, those for partial&lt;br/&gt;differential equations, have experienced major developments over the past&lt;br/&gt;thirty years in both algorithmic advances and applications to other fields.&lt;br/&gt;Computational simulation of physical phenomena has now fully joined&lt;br/&gt;engineering experimentation and theoretical/analytical&lt;br/&gt;analysis as the third method of scientific investigation.&lt;br/&gt;As the application problems become ever complicate and challenging,&lt;br/&gt;it becomes more and more difficult or even impossible to solve&lt;br/&gt;these problems by isolated individuals. The magnitude and complexity&lt;br/&gt;of the problems often require various expertise (such as field data&lt;br/&gt;acquisition, modeling, mathematical analysis, computational methods,&lt;br/&gt;computer programming and visualization, and data analysis), hence,&lt;br/&gt;their solutions require persistent collective effort of international&lt;br/&gt;scientific communities of various disciplines. Also, because face to&lt;br/&gt;face interaction is important to effective exchange of ideas and&lt;br/&gt;collaborations, it is vital to bring together researchers with similar&lt;br/&gt;research interests to  conferences of various scales.&lt;br/&gt;To meet the need and to facilitate such an interaction,&lt;br/&gt;the principal investigator (PI), together with colleagues from U.S., China,&lt;br/&gt;and Korea, will organize the ``International Workshop on Computational&lt;br/&gt;Methods in Geosciences", which will be held from July 5-7, 2007&lt;br/&gt;at Xi'an Jiaotong University, China. The requested funding will be&lt;br/&gt;used to support U.S. researchers, in particular, graduate students&lt;br/&gt;and postdocs, to attend the workshop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The anticipated international workshop is expected to contribute&lt;br/&gt;to promoting, enhancing, and stimulating the cross-continental&lt;br/&gt;research interactions and collaborations in mathematical sciences.&lt;br/&gt;Such community-wise research activities often&lt;br/&gt;serve the purpose of enhancing and promoting collaborations&lt;br/&gt;between U.S. and international researchers in mathematical&lt;br/&gt;and applied sciences, which in turn contributes critically&lt;br/&gt;to the course of solving challenging scientific problems&lt;br/&gt;such as flow and transport in porous media, weather prediction,&lt;br/&gt;nano-materials design, genome sequencing and analysis.&lt;br/&gt;In addition, organizing such a workshop in China will&lt;br/&gt;bring prominent researchers from U.S. and Europe working in such&lt;br/&gt;an active scientific research area to Asia, consequently, the anticipated&lt;br/&gt;workshop will do a good service to and have a positive impact on&lt;br/&gt;the international applied and computational mathematics community.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
