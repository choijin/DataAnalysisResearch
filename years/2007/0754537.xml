<AbstractNarration>IIS - 0754537&lt;br/&gt;Title: REU Site: An REU Site in Computer Science and Engineering&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PIs: Miguel A Labrador and Rafael Perez&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of South Florida&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary goal of this REU site is the systematic increase of the graduation rate of undergraduate students as well as the enrollment numbers in graduate school in Computer Science and Engineering. To accomplish this goal, during a 10-week summer session, this REU site offers participating students with state-of-the-art research projects from a wide variety of disciplines in CS&amp;E, including Computer Networks, Data Bases, Data Mining, AI, Digital Image Processing, Pattern Recognition, Location-based Services, Robotics, Software Verification, Security, Distributed Systems, and VLSI design. The program also includes other academic and social activities that provide students with a well-rounded experience and education.  &lt;br/&gt;Additional and unique components of this REU site are the financial support to bring at least one student from a Latin American country every year, the involvement of graduate students in the organization and mentorship processes of the site, and the financial support to extend the REU experience to a limited number of students through the academic year after their summer REU experience. The program emphasizes the enrollment of minority students belonging to groups with significant national population growth rates coming from 4-year universities as well as community colleges. More information about the site as well as past schedules, activities, publications and projects can be found at http://www.csee.usf.edu/REU.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
