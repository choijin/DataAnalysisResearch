<AbstractNarration>Sensor networks are one of the fastest growing network technologies.  At the same time, however, they present new challenges. On the one hand, the sensors are given ambitious tasks of computing global properties using constantly changing and geographically distributed data. On the other hand, the sensors are significantly limited in their storage space, computation power, and communication bandwidth.  To achieve their goals, sensornets need new theoretical foundations that integrate storage, computation, and communication, and enable the sensornet to pull its various resources together and funnel them toward its tasks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to create a formal framework for integrating storage, computation, and communication in sensornets.  The proposed research assimilates three theories (sketching, property testing and network coding), into a synergetic design that greatly improves the communication throughput, while allowing for cheap computation and reduced storage space. Specifically, the proposed research consists of two components:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Network Sketching: a new architecture for sensornets that performs on-demand in-network compression of the data.&lt;br/&gt;This approach enables (lossy) compression of spatially correlated data at multiple sensors; manages network congestion by reducing data resolution as opposed to dropping some of the measurements; and naturally combines wireless network coding with sketching to boost the throughput of the wireless network.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Temporally Coherent Property Testing: a new computational model that extends the theory of property testing to a stream of temporally correlated data.&lt;br/&gt;This new paradigm enables quantifying the complexity of repeatedly checking for a particular property, and reduces the computational needs of sensor networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project outcomes  Research from this award has pushed the boundaries on the best compressive sensing algorithms, streaming algorithms and sub-linear time algorithms.   We mention three results in  particular:  (1) The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is one of the most fundamental numerical algorithms. It computes the frequency representation of an n-dimensional signal in near-linear time. The algorithm plays a central role in several application areas, including signal processing and audio/image/video compression.    In many applications (e.g.,audio, image or video compression), most of the Fourier coefficients of a signal are small or equal to zero, i.e., the output of the transform is (approximately) sparse. In this case there are algorithms that enable computing the non-zero coefficients faster. However, in practice,  the exponents in the runtime of these algorithms and their complex structures limit their applicability to only very sparse signals.    We propose a new algorithm for sparse Fourier transform over the complex field. The key feature of our algorithm is its simplicity: the algorithm has a simple structure, which leads to efficient runtime with low overhead. As a result we are able to extend the range of signal sparsity, for which the algorithm is faster than FFT by one order of magnitude.    (2)  Approximating the similarity of two long strings, files or datasets is a classic problem that underlies many difficulties in processing large datasets in many areas, including biology,  web applications, and text processing.  Although many have attacked the problem, the best previous algorithms for approximating the similarity of two inputs according to the standard edit distance ran in slightly sub-quadratic time.     A series of papers supported by this grant have made the first significant  progress in decades on this important problem,  culminating in nearly-linear-time  approximation schemes which achieve close to optimal approximation factors.  (3) Incredibly fast, constant time sampling based approximation schemes for a  class of sparse combinatorial optimization problems have been given.   Broader impact supported by this grant include course development unifying topics from sparse recovery, streaming computation and sublinear time computation.   In addition, The PIs have given presentations to public school children  based on material from the ``Computer Science Unplugged'' program.
