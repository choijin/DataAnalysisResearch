<AbstractNarration>The Marine Advanced Technology Education (MATE) Center is a national partnership of community colleges, high schools, universities, informal educational organizations, research institutions, marine industries, and working professionals. MATE's mission is to improve marine technical education and increase the number of highly-skilled technical professionals who enter ocean-related occupations.  In this project, the MATE Resource Center for marine technology education is 1) expanding and strengthening academic, industry, and professional society partnerships; 2) supporting institutions interested in developing or improving marine technology programs; and 3) conducting research, synthesizing, and disseminating comprehensive, up-to-date marine workforce information and helping partners align their curricula and programs with workforce needs.  In addition, the MATE Resource Center conducts regional and international ROV (remotely operated vehicle) competitions that simulate the high performance workplace and build academic and industry partnerships. This project also offers faculty development institutes for high school, college, and university educators that focus on marine technology (including submersible technology, with a focus on ROVs; seafloor mapping and data collection; career awareness; ocean observing systems; and the marine applications of GIS) and improving science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education. The national MATE internship program continues in this project, the numbers of underrepresented students participating in the program increases, and MATE products (including curricula, resource books, occupational guidelines, competencies, and procedural guides both in traditional formats and electronically) are disseminated through the Center's web site and www.OceanCareers.com.</AbstractNarration>
