    <AbstractNarration>AST- 0133617&lt;br/&gt;Wesleyan University&lt;br/&gt;Kathryn Johnston&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Johnston is awarded funds to establish a research program in the structure, formation, and evolution of galaxies at Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut. Her approach focuses on using low-surface-brightness features of galaxies as tracers of the gravitational potential. The work will use gravitational N-body simulations to test and understand analytical and semi-analytical models of the formation of these low-surface-brightness features, and develop new methods of interpreting observations. Dr. Johnston's theoretical research group will collaborate with observational groups to carry out the interpretations. The group will also collaborate with cosmologists to place the results on individual galaxies in the broader context of galaxy formation in general. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aspects of the research program will be integrated into the educational mission of Wesleyan University by developing web-based tutorials for beginning research students. These tutorials will subsequently be used as a basis for a course in computational astrophysics that fits naturally into a cross-disciplinary certificate program in computational science currently under development at the university.</AbstractNarration>
