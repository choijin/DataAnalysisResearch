<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Boyer, Don L., PI&lt;br/&gt;Arizona State University&lt;br/&gt;0701998&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Graduate Student Support for the 5th International Symposium on Environmental Hydraulics&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cindy M. Lee, Program Director, (703) 292-5356&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of the support is to provide ten graduate students with the opportunity to attend the 5th International Symposium on Environmental Hydraulics, which will be held at Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, December 4-7, 2007.  The students will present a paper in their research area at the Symposium.  The Symposium will consist of 19 sessions that will cover a broad range of topical areas in environmental hydraulics.  For example, there are sessions on coastal flows, computational environmental fluid mechanics, eco-hydraulics, environmental hydraulics and sustainability issues, paleo-hydraulics and climate change, and urban hydro-systems.  The conveners of the sessions hail from around the world including Spain, Canada, China, New Zealand, France, Russia, and Japan.  A panel discussion titled "Retrospective on the Natural Catastrophes of the Winter 2004-05" will address the Asian tsunamis and hurricanes in Mexico and the US from the perspective of environmental hydraulics.  A workshop "Hydro-Epidemiological Futures" will be held in conjunction with the Symposium.  The students supported by this effort will be exposed to topics that they may not have encountered during their graduate studies.  They will have opportunities to meet and interact with leaders in the field of environmental hydraulics.  Presenting their research results at the Symposium will provide important professional development.  The opportunity to meet their peers from universities across the US and the world will also provide a network valuable to their careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
