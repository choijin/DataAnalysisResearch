<AbstractNarration>The nonlinear underactuated systems represent an important and general&lt;br/&gt;class of problems in robotics which have proven mostly intractable for&lt;br/&gt;analytical and numerical control design paradigms.  Machine learning&lt;br/&gt;approaches to underactuated control, which employ approximations to&lt;br/&gt;make numerical optimal control techniques tractable, will have broad&lt;br/&gt;applications from walking robots to the control of aerial vehicles and&lt;br/&gt;fluid systems. Here we pursue a careful analysis of the algorithms&lt;br/&gt;applied to linear time-invariant (LTI) systems.  This will contribute&lt;br/&gt;fundamental results on the convergence rate of different learning&lt;br/&gt;algorithms, and the design of robot mechanisms and input-output&lt;br/&gt;"features" which maximize the rate of convergence.  Theoretical&lt;br/&gt;results are coupled with experiments on a strongly nonlinear control&lt;br/&gt;problem - a two-link bipedal robot walking over rough terrain.&lt;br/&gt;Acquiring a near optimal feedback policy for this robot would produce&lt;br/&gt;a result that is surprising and compelling (because a simple robot&lt;br/&gt;will be traversing more complicated terrain than has been demonstrated&lt;br/&gt;by any humanoid), but also clear and revealing (because the simplicity&lt;br/&gt;of the robot exposes the fundamental problems in walking and nothing&lt;br/&gt;more).  Both theory and experiment allow us to perform a careful&lt;br/&gt;comparison between machine learning control and more mature control&lt;br/&gt;approaches from modern control.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ One of the first goals of the program was to develop a series of experimental and simulation tools for studying control design for underactuated mechanical systems.  We have developed numerous physical experiments, ranging from the traditional model underactuated systems (acrobots and cart-poles) to simple walking robots (a small compass gait on a boom with prismatic toes and a large free-walking compass gait with onboard computation, an angle bisecting mechanism, series-elastic actuator prismatic toes -- and even a version with pneumatic toes).  These formed the foundation for the major papers/results and careful experimental evaluation for nearly all of the scientific contributions made under this and other programs in my lab for the last 5 years.  Furthermore, this program supported the initial development of what has become a major open-source software infrastructure for simulation, planning, and control of nontrivial robots and underactuated systems: http://drake.mit.edu   A second goal of the program was to develop specifically machine learning approaches to controlling underactuated systems.  We made a number of contributions along this line, most notably policy gradient methods which could be applied to experimental fluid dynamics and which could exploit the Youla-parameterization that is well known in nonlinear control.  However, it became clear to me that our robots do not yet have the "big data" problem -- we're limited by the number of trials we can run on each experimental robot and the fact that every robot is different.  Instead, we focused our optimization effort on (physics-)model-based approaches instead of data-driven approaches.  The development of model-based optimization approaches to nonlinear control during this program was extremely productive and successful.  Most importantly, this led to our exploration of sums-of-squares optimization as a serious tool for stability verification for nonlinear (closed-loop) robot dynamics, and the extensions of this work towards motion planning and nonlinear feedback design.  This includes our LQR-Trees algorithm and a number of derivatives which have won best paper awards at a number of top conferences.   Finally, this program resulted in the development of what has now become a core graduate robotics class at MIT: Underactuated Robotics.  The enrollment in this class started small, but has now grown to nearly 100 students per term, with roughly equal enrollment from Computer Science, Mechanical Engineering, and Aero/Astro.  This course was put online originally on MIT's OpenCourseWare as a video course (also hosted on youtube), and most recently on edX (http://tiny.cc/mitx-underactuated) and has now served 10's of thousands of students all over the world.
