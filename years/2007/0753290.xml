<AbstractNarration>The University of California-Riverside and Stanford University are collaborating to advance development of the Quake-Catcher Nework (QCN), a new distributed network for earthquake monitoring that utilizes 3-axis accelerometers, which have become standard equipment in many laptop computers, and a volunteer community of 'citizen scientists'.  The low cost and small size of these accelerometers enables creation of an inexpensive, dense network that supplements existing seismic networks in the Greater Los Angeles Basin. The network also provides an inexpensive vehicle for promoting geoscience education within K-12 classrooms that provides students with the opportunity to conduct hands-on, inquiry-based investigations.  Networking is achieved through the use of the Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) distributed software processing package, which allows, when combined with the sensor acquisition software, ultra-efficient processing, transfer, and analysis of the seismic data.  Volunteers monitoring the accelerometers send small data packets to the central server when strong new motions are detected; waveform data only uploads when an earthquake is confirmed. This planning grant is being used to finish development of the platform independent version of the QCN computing software; increase the number of volunteers in the network through outreach; complete development of interactive software for use within K-12 classrooms; distribute 200 USB accelerometers and educational materials to K-12 schools; and evaluate data contributed through the network.</AbstractNarration>
