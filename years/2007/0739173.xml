<AbstractNarration>The College of New Jersey proposes a Demonstration Project to broaden participation in computing by exposing Middle School students to the emerging field of interactive journalism. Journalism has undergone a profound shift due to the Internet and now provides a good venue for engaging students who might not see themselves as ?computing types.? Through interactive journalism, these students will have hands-on experience writing, information gathering and analysis, and using digital media, from graphics to still media to animation and video.  Underlying both journalism and the computing disciplines are foundational principles of information access and dissemination, fact analysis, process description, and decision-making for results presentation. Balanced presentations of the journalistic processes and the underlying computational thinking, should engage students and dispel many of the misconceptions they may have about computing careers. In addition, this program will help students navigate the culture of a traditional computing classroom, while improving their academic preparation for entry into existing undergraduate programs. Program activities include a weeklong summer Interactive Journalism Institute, follow on activities through the school year, training for teacher and undergraduate mentors, and outreach to parents. The predicted outcomes include increased skill in core computing concepts, increased awareness of requisite skills for computing careers, and increased enrollment in high school courses that lead to careers in computing.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Introduction  We began in 2007 with a conviction that a larger and more diverse group of young people will be drawn to computing if they and the adults in their lives experience its power as a means of creative expression. Our results support our hypothesis and also suggest promising strategies for supporting teachers in infusing computational fluency across the curriculum. Finally, the project spawned ongoing efforts to apply its lessons to other educational settings.     Background  Prior research established that many students, parents, teachers and guidance counselors believe that computing is only for people who have identified strengths in math and science. However, software development bears similarities to the generative processes in journalism. Further, there is ample evidence that middle school is a moment in many childrenÆs lives when decisions are made that determine their readiness to study computing in college. Thus, we developed a summer institute and after-school program that drew participants from Fisher Middle School in Ewing, NJ, an urban fringe school with a diverse population.     The Interactive Journalism Institute for Middle Schoolers  Our program, dubbed the Interactive Journalism Institute for Middle Schoolers, (IJIMS), consisted of:  Week-long "Interactive Journalism Institute" Special session for teachers the week before Academic year after-school club Teachers as programming and journalism mentors TCNJ students from computer science, interactive multimedia, English and journalism, as tutor-counselors Guest speakers from range of media and computing fields   The Scratch programming language was one explicit tool for introducing the participants to programming. Students learned to create procedural animations that drew upon their reporting and research.  They also learned to conduct interviews, write news stories, shoot and edit video and to export still images from video using iMovie and Windows Movie Maker. Our content management system, CAF&Eacute; (Collaboration and Facilitation Environment) acted as a virtual tool for storing participantsÆ research, supporting the editorial process, and presenting their journalism online while preserving their anonymity.        Results  IJIMS: The teacher-student reporting teams participating in the summer institutes produced two online magazines: FISH ("FisherÆs Interesting Stories Here: http://highered.commandprompt.com/fish) and NEWS (New Ewing Web Stories http://highered.commandprompt.com/news). Each group added content to the site during the following school year. In surveys, most IJIMS participants said that programming was fun, creative and something they could do. They also saw similarities between programming and journalism.     Fisher Middle School: Our initial research protocol called for the creation of a study group that participated in the summer program and after-school club, and demographically similar control group. After the first summer institute, the teachers and students began sharing what they learned with their colleagues in the school, eliminating our control group. Instead, we tracked the dissemination of our tools and techniques through the school. Teachers experimented with Scratch for teaching creative writing, expository writing and presentation skills. A math teacher developed a Scratch-based curriculum that articulated with a language arts class. Students began teaching Scratch to their peers.     In an April 2010, the All School Computer Usage Survey, (N=900) 502 students said they knew about Scratch, although our institutes had directly involved only 60 students.     Learning in community.  The original objectives of our project were to ignite interest in computing by introducing middle school students and teachers to interactive journalism. However, the project staff, Fisher teachers and students became a learning community in which each member had something to learn and something to teach.
