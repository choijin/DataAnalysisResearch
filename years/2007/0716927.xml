<AbstractNarration>Related species share many similarities due to their common ancestry, but also differ in important ways because each may be adapted to a unique environment.  The patterns of differences and similarities among species represent the "structure of biological diversity".  This project seeks to understand the mechanistic details of how this structure develops over time.  Specifically, the PI will examine a group of freshwater crustaceans, amphipods, whose common ancestor invaded North America approximately 8 million years ago, and has since diversified into at least three-dozen species that exist today.  The PI will use DNA analysis to reconstruct the historical pattern of diversification of the species, and use statistical methods to infer how the traits of extant species arose from their ancestors.  A second major component of the project will be a "selection experiment" in which the PI imposes evolutionary pressures on experimental populations of amphipods and monitors the form and rate of change in the species' traits over many generations.&lt;br/&gt; This project is significant because it provides an in-depth understanding of the factors that give rise to structure in biological diversity.  Although we know that the course of evolutionary change is shaped by sets of constraints imposed by the genetic makeup of species, the environmental conditions experienced by species, and other factors, we do not currently have an adequate understanding of how these constraints interact to produce the structure we observe within groups of related species.  This project employs complementary methodological approaches to illuminate this process.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project examined patterns in species diversification of Hyalella amphipods (a small freshwater crustacean) across the United States and Canada.  These crustaceans are key components of lakes, ponds, and marshes, and play a critical role in maintaining stable fish populations.  Additionally, Hyalella amphipods are commonly used as indicators of ecosystem health, and in studies of ecotoxicology.  This project sought to determine the diversity of species in North America, and characterize details of the morphology of the species.  We used DNA sequencing to understand the relationships among the species, and how morphology has changed among the species.  In the course of the study we discovered approximately 50 previously unknown species, making this group one of the most diverse "cryptic species" groups yet identified.  The study also examined some underlying causes of the cryptic diversity within the group, including the role stabilizing selection may play in limiting morphological change among species, and the impact of limited dispersal allowing new species to form over time.  Collectively, the elements of this project provide new understanding of the ecology, behavior, and evolution of these environmentally important organisms.  Undergraduate and graduate students assisted in this project.  Students received training in DNA sequencing, biogeographic software, morphological analysis, and field research.  Two undergraduate students working on the project have now entered research-focused graduate programs in biology.  The project also supported outreach activities for K-12 students and teachers.        Last Modified: 11/02/2011       Submitted by: Gary A Wellborn]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
