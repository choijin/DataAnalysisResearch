<AbstractNarration>Efforts to restore biological diversity and ecosystem services often fail because ecologists lack detailed information on the intricate workings of the ecosystems to be restored. This study combines ecological theory with large-scale restoration for endangered plant species of vernal pools in California. Vernal pools are temporary wetlands that produce large displays of purple, gold and white flowers in the spring. Project investigators will track yearly success of restored plant communities, will conduct greenhouse studies to estimate how seeds stored in the soil affect yearly plant production, and will construct models to project future growth of plant populations. The study is novel in that it combines a long-term field experiment with state-of-the-art mathematical modeling to estimate success of habitat restoration.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study is especially relevant to resource managers and conservation practitioners involved in habitat restoration. The research has societal benefits, since vernal pools harbor many federally protected species and habitat restoration will be a key aspect of their recovery. The project involves training sixth-graders to graduate students, and the research will continue to contribute to conservation and restoration actions for vernal pools in California, including plans generated by regional governments, the US Fish and Wildlife Service and environmental consulting firms. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This research project combines long-term field observations, a large-scale field experiment on habitat restoration, and mathematical modeling to explain the structure and function of vernal pool plant communities in California. The motivation to understand factors driving the assembly and long-term processes in these communities is further fueled by the need for guidance in restoring and maintaining native communities degraded by human activities.     This restoration experiment was initiated in 1999 with the construction of two vernal pool complexes (N=256 pools) at the field site on Travis Air Force Base, California. Pool size and connectivity were varied to support the study of spatial effects on community development, and seeding treatments were applied annual during 1999-2001 to support analyses of dispersal limitation and priority effects in five "focal" native species. Through annual sampling in permanent plots, community development was followed in these constructed pools and in a set (N=10) of naturally occurring "reference" pools within the study site. Key outcomes from this long-term experiment are that 1) Seeding speeds the establishment of native species in restored pools, and also inhibits the invasion of exotic plant species into the pools; 2) The identity and number of species established in pools at the start of the experiment affected the subsequent development of the ecological communities, but this effect persisted only for the first few years of the experiment; 3) Exotic plant invasions are also inhibited by greater depth and inundation of the pools during the winter aquatic phase; 4) An increase in exotic plant species was associated with a decline in native species, particularly following two successive years of unfavorable environmental conditions for the native species; 5) Seeds stored in the soil seed bank are able to emerge given the appropriate environmental conditions and provide opportunity to re-establish aboveground populations of native vernal pool plant species; 6) Restored pools are more likely to harbor populations of native species if they are in close proximity to naturally-occurring reference pools that also harbor large populations of these species.
