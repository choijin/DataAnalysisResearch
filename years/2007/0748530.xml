<AbstractNarration>Technical: This project is to study the synthesis of two types of optoelectronic nanostructures, carbon nanotubes and semiconductor nanowires, and to develop a convergent characterization platform, with a goal of simultaneous electrical and optical characterization with nanometer spatial resolution, nanosecond time resolution, as well as energy resolution. The platform will allow detailed investigation of the relation between nanomaterials synthesis parameters and their physical properties. In carbon nanotubes, the effect of the growth temperature and use of different reactive gases on the diameter, chirality and defect density will be studied. In semiconductor nanowires, Si/Ge nanowires with continuously varying dopant and composition level will be synthesized and their electron band structure will be determined with nanometer scale resolution. In addition, massively parallel characterization of individual nanostructures, for a rapid feedback with good statistical information for optimizing materials synthesis, is planned.&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical: The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science with high technological relevance, and is expected to provide new experimental techniques that could have a major impact on the understanding of electronic and optical properties of nanomaterials. It provides interdisciplinary training for both graduate and undergraduate students in important areas of science and nanotechnology. In addition, the project plans to develop outreach programs that are targeted for high school teachers and journalists, whose understanding of nanoscale science can greatly affect that of students and public in much larger scale, and to develop new courses and a summer school that are designed to engage undergraduate and graduate students in their early career in nanomaterials research.</AbstractNarration>
