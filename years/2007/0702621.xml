Computing infrastructures based on these coarse-grained reconfigurable platforms will be better able to meet the future performance and power demands of embedded applications than traditional processor-based architectures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The potential design space of these large-scale coarse-grained reconfigurable computing architectures is enormous, and efficient, architecture-independent tools will be needed to quickly explore and evaluate the different points in this space for different applications and application domains.  This research project will develop architecture-independent tools that map the intermediate representations of algorithms produced by compilers to coarse-grained reconfigurable architectures comprising a wide range of architectural features.  These tools will rely on integrating scheduling, placement and routing algorithms to perform this mapping.  They will enable the fast exploration of the overall space of large-scale coarse-grained reconfigurable architectures, as well as the impact of specific architectural features and structures.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our research has focused on software support for proposed computational accelerators that are based on "reconfigurable hardware".  The structure of traditional computers is defined when the computer is made, that is, when the computer chip is fabricated. By contrast, the structure of an accelerator that uses reconfigurable hardware can be changed on-the-fly to directly support the computation to be performed at the moment.  This ability to adapt to the needs of a specific computation enables higher performance and lower energy consumption for many important applications.  Our goal has been to design computer-aided design tools that can compile programs automatically to run on these accelerators.  More importantly, these tools are not written for a specific accelerator but for a very general set of accelerators built using reconfigurable hardware.  The tools can be targeted to a new accelerator merely by describing the architecture of that accelerator.  This allows architects to easily explore a wide range of accelerator architectures to find those that have the best performance, lowest cost or lowest power energy consumption.  Our tools comprise a compiler for a high-level language called Macah, a tool for describing the accelerator architecture to the tools, and a set of tools that generate a circuit that implements the program and change the structure of the accelerator to implement that circuit.  We implemented a large number of benchmark circuits using our tools and mapped them to a wide range of accelerator architectures.  We were able to analyze many different accelerator architectures that use different ways to compute, store and communicate values used by a computation.  Using these tools, we explores a large number of different architectural features used by accelerators and were able to identify a combination that gave almost a 10x improvement in performance/cost/energy consumption.  We have published 15 articles, papers and research reports detailing the results of this research.  These papers contain a description and analysis of the algorithms used in our tools, and an analysis of effects of different accelerator architecture features on performance and power consumption.
