    <AbstractNarration>Special Project: Building Relationships with Asia to Foster Research Exchanges and Student Training in Scientific Data Visualization and Modeling&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this project is to build and strengthen relationships with scientists in Asia to foster research exchanges and student training in scientific data modeling, analysis and visualization. This is accomplished by visits to Asia which will allow for 1) concentrated research seminars with already established research collaborators, 2) a series of lectures to promote the topics of data modeling, analysis and visualization in search of new collaborators and student exchanges and 3) workshops to explore the organization of a jointly sponsored east/west conference on data modeling, analysis and visualization to be held in Asia. The analyses, understanding and extraction of knowledge from extremely large and complex data sets is an opportunity with tremendous benefits for all of society. The recent past has seen a good deal of research targeted towards data visualization, but now it is time to emphasize the analysis of data. The techniques of analyzing data used in the past do not scale to the tremendously large and complex data sets of today. World wide collaborations, exchanges and student training enhance the chances for progress in this important area of scientific research.</AbstractNarration>
