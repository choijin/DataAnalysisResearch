<AbstractNarration>This project is providing annual scholarship support for low-income and academically talented students in engineering, technology and computer science programs. In addition to the financial support, several other activities contribute to the project's intellectual merit: i) academic support in the form of supplemental math and science courses, ii) faculty and peer monitoring, iii) student/faculty research opportunities, and iv) attendance at technical and scientific workshops and independent study opportunities. Additionally, scholars are given solid career counseling that includes preparation for graduate schools; service learning opportunities; research and internship employment opportunities in national need areas; and effective employment strategies such as resume writing and interviewing skills. By offering a model for how other minority institutions of higher education can successfully attract and retain students who are pursuing engineering, technology, and computer science degrees, the project is demonstrating its potential for broader impact. The diversity of the institution's traditional applicant pool also guarantees that a diverse set of students is benefiting from the scholarship funding. Finally, the project's web site is providing information about the scholarship program and being used to distribute the educational materials developed in the project such as student research projects, student activities, participating faculties, and project assessment results.</AbstractNarration>
