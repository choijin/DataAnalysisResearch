<AbstractNarration>Solid state chemistry has developed into a discipline combining approaches of inorganic and physical chemistry, physics of condensed matter, nano-science and many other sub-disciplines. Nanoscience and Nanotechnology, Materials Science and Engineering, Condensed Matter Physics, Ceramics and even some Biosciences now draw upon Solid State Chemistry. This multidisciplinary nature of the field and the frequent interactions afforded by the Gordon Research Conferences (GRC) in Solid State Chemistry particularly underscores its importance to the U.S. and international community. The GRC Solid State Chemistry II: Solid State Chemistry for Advanced Materials will bring together scientists, from academic, industrial and governmental research institutions all over the world, who exploit approaches of solid state chemistry for the design, preparation, structure and property characterization of new advanced materials, with both basic scientific interest and high potential for important industrial applications. The 24 speakers representing 8 countries will present lectures in 11 different areas of the field. The intellectual merit of the conference is to allow leading and young researchers to present their latest research results in an open and informal atmosphere. All the participants and those they will interact with subsequently will benefit by the broader impact. The participant's teaching programs,  proposal writing, and public understanding of science activities will benefit from hearing the latest results presented and discussed at this meeting. The GRC conference will provide a beginning of many scientific collaborations and networks that involve young scientists, facilitating their integration into the international scientific community. This aspect of GRC is also very helpful in bringing together diverse and under-represented groups. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Presently solid state chemistry focuses on the synthesis and characterization of new and advanced materials. Most modern technologies depend on frontier materials, such as materials for energy conversion and saving, for fuel cells and batteries, for data storage, for wireless communication, and for catalysis. The new millennium witnesses the growing importance of nano- and bio-solids. The 2007 Gordon Research Conference (GRC) in Solid State Chemistry will bring together solid state chemists from academic, industrial and governmental research institutions all over the world. The subtitle of the 2007 meeting, "Solid State Chemistry for Advanced Materials," implies the emphasis on the preparation, characterization, and properties of emerging materials. This international meeting, with about 50% participants coming from countries other than USA, will provide a beginning of many scientific collaborations and networks that involve young scientists, facilitating their integration into the international scientific community. In addition it provides an excellent forum for younger researchers to meet established scientists in the field and possible opportunities for employment or postdoctoral fellowship in the future. This aspect of GRC is also very helpful in bringing together diverse and under-represented groups. The participant's teaching programs,  proposal writing, and public understanding of science activities will benefit from hearing the latest results presented and discussed at this meeting. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
