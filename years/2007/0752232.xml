    <AbstractNarration>PI and Co-PI: Vicki Lens and Stephanie Matsumura&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Doctoral Dissertation Research: Justice for All? How Race Influences the Intake Process in Juvenile Court&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;0752232&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study will use a mixed method approach to examine if race affects intake decisions in juvenile court. Juvenile courts differ from adult courts by combining elements of social welfare, particularly rehabilitative aspects, with penal concerns. The agents within the juvenile justice system (including law enforcement, intake workers, prosecutors, and judges) are empowered with the discretion to decide what is in the best interest of the child and how a case will be handled. There are several key "decision-points" that determine how a case will be processed. While certain procedural and legal standards serve as guidelines, it is possible that similar cases may have different outcomes. Researchers have found overrepresentation of minority youth in the juvenile justice system. Even when charged for the same type of offense, minority youth are more likely to be formally charged in juvenile court than white youth. Part I of the research design will include a quantitative analysis that uses descriptive, multivariate, and multilevel analyses of the intake outcomes of all juvenile court cases in State X from 2000-2006. The analysis will control for prior offenses, the type of offense, and other demographic variables. Part II includes a qualitative analysis drawn from in-depth interviews with intake officers in State X. The analysis will use a grounded theory to examine the discretionary practices of intake officers and explores the social and organizational ramifications relating to the results found in Part I. The dataset utilized in this study is unique and has not been previously used to examine this issue and the qualitative research is original data. This study will contribute to the existing literature regarding the effect of race in the case processing of juvenile court cases by providing a multi-level analysis. The research will identify any differential treatment of minority youth in the intake process, the possible causes, and suggest change that will promote equal treatment for all youth.</AbstractNarration>
