<AbstractNarration>Three cohorts of eight academically talented, financially needy students majoring in STEM disciplines are being awarded two-year scholarships in the amount of $10,000 annually.  The scholars are being recruited from two student groups, incoming freshman and transfers from Schenectady County Community College - a regional community college that has an articulation agreement with Skidmore.  The institution originated as a women''s college and remains predominately female with women constituting 59% of the student body .  Reflective of the student body composition, women earned 57% of the STEM degrees awarded during the 2001 -2006 period.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Increasing the number of minorities majoring and graduating in STEM disciplines is being emphasized.  The project is building on current programs providing academic support and is fostering a sense of community among students from disparate backgrounds.  Collaboration with the college's Opportunity Programs that address the needs of educationally and economically disadvantaged students is enabling these students to excel.</AbstractNarration>
