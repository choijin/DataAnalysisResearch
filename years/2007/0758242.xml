<AbstractNarration>The International Symposium on the Mathematical Theory of Networks and &lt;br/&gt;Systems (MTNS) has met biennially since 1973 in ten countries spread across &lt;br/&gt;North America, Europe and Asia as a forum for a wide range of topics in mathematical system theory, networks and control theory.  The primary objective of MTNS is to bring together established and new researchers, including advanced graduate students, for the exchange of ideas and the discussion of recent developments in the general area at the border of engineering and mathematics encompassed within the title ?mathematical system theory?.  These areas of focus are of critical importance in the analysis and control of the behavior of complex systems as manifested in nature, science, and industry.  The MTNS meetings provide an opportunity for the global &lt;br/&gt;community of established and beginning researchers in this area to meet with and learn from one another through both formal presentations and informal interactions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The next MTNS Symposium will be held July 28?August 1, 2008 at Virginia Tech &lt;br/&gt;in Blacksburg, Virginia.  This occasion provides a unique opportunity for US graduate students, young PhDs, and others that may have restricted resources to make contact with a vibrant international community of researchers active in research areas related to systems theory.  The objective of this proposal is to secure funding for the financial support of advanced graduate students, recent PhDs,  and members of traditionally under-represented groups (including in particular, women and members of minority groups) so that they might have the advantage of participating in a major international conference which comes to the United States only once or twice a decade. For many of the prospective beneficiaries, this will be a first opportunity to engage in professional &lt;br/&gt;activity beyond their home institutions. For all of them it will be a unique opportunity to present their work to an expert audience and to further their knowledge of the field by interacting with established researchers in both engineering and mathematics - interactions that are crucial to their development as young researchers and educators. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
