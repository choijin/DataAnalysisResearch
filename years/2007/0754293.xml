<AbstractNarration>Hope College (Holland, MI) will host an REU Site each summer for the next 5 years (2008-2012). Students will conduct research on "Environmental Impacts on Biological Systems: From Molecules to Ecosystems," with faculty in the Biology Department. Students will develop a deeper understanding of the integrative nature of biology and of the role of the environment in biological processes and on biological systems.  Students will generate experimental hypotheses, design and carry out experiments, evaluate data, and communicate their results to both scientific and non-scientific audiences. Students will also gain insight into linkages across different scales of biological systems, while conducting research at the level of biological organization in which they are most interested.  Students will learn lab techniques and use of the scientific literature, participate in weekly workshops, discuss ethics in science, and get exposed to various careers in science.  At the end of summer, students are expected to be experts in the background, methods, results and significance of their research work and are prepared to present their work at professional scientific meetings. The goal is to develop students into independent and highly competent young scientists who are well-prepared for graduate study in biology and careers as research scientists. REU students are provided with a stipend, no cost housing, and funds for travel to and from Hope College.  Students belonging to groups underrepresented in the biological sciences are strongly encouraged to apply.  More information is available at http://sharp.hope.edu/, or by contacting the Program Director (Christopher Barney) at barney@hope.edu.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This NSF-REU grant provided funds for an undergraduate summer research program in the biological sciences at Hope College. Over the five years of grant support, 988 non-Hope students and 525 Hope students applied for summer research positions in biology, indicating the value undergraduate students have for summer research experiences and the high level of interest in such positions.  The NSF-REU grant supported 36 students, 17 students from Hope College and 19 students from other institutions.  The non-Hope students came from 16 different colleges and universities in 10 states indicating that the program had a wide geographical impact (from New York to Florida, from North Carolina to Minnesota).  These institutions included community colleges, small liberal arts colleges, and research universities.   Fifty-three percent of the REU students were female and 64% belonged to groups underrepresented in STEM fields such that the REU program helped contribute to the goal of increasing the diversity of the national STEM workforce.    Our program had an emphasis on impacting students early in their college careers and 72% of the REU students had finished either just one or two years of college prior to participation.  These students become part of a community of scholars through weekly meetings, workshops, visits to local research facilities, nature walks, canoe trips and a variety of social activities.  Over the five years of the program, REU students worked directly with 12 Ph.D. level faculty members and with 88 other undergraduate students, 21 high school students and 4 high school teachers.  The projects on which the REU students worked included:  The regulation of a transport protein in nerve cells that plays a role in protecting cells from oxidative damage. The development of a bioinformatics database and program for bacterial metabolism. The role of neurochemicals in connecting reproductive function to nutritional levels. The regulation and function of a vasopressin binding protein involved in cell proliferation. The impact of fungal infection on protecting plants from herbivory by insects. The role of Fer-related-kinase in regulating development. Horizontal gene transfer between a parasitic plant and its host. How seed produced chemicals protect seeds from fungal infection. The impact of neurotoxins on behavior in rats. Identifying cytotoxic genes in a bacteriophage.  Population dynamics of pioneer plant species.  Using gene sequence information to study the evolutionary relationships among plants. The impact of repeated intermittent heat exposure on thirst and kidney function in rats. Regulation of fat metabolism in yeast cells.   The REU students participated in all levels of the research work including becoming familiar with the scientific literature, developing hypotheses, designing the experiments, carrying out the experiments and troubleshooting experimental problems, doing statistical analysis on and interpreting experimental data, and presenting the results of their research.  REU students gave oral presentations of their work at the end of each summer, wrote a research paper on their projects, and presented their projects as posters at the annual Hope College Celebration of Undergraduate Research and Creative Performance.  In addition, the REU students have made 29 presentations of their research at regional and national scientific meetings.   In an end of the summer survey, the undergraduate students indicated that their favorite component of the research experience was working with the faculty members and each other.  Across all 5 years of the project, 92% of the students gave the program an A grade and the remaining 8% of the students gave the program a B grade.  On a 4.0 point scale, the average grade for the program was 3.87.  In addition, on average 96% of the students rated their research project as successful and the students reported that the program impacted their view of what a scientist does (66% of their...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
