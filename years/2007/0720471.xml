<AbstractNarration>This project pursues the vision of a community that shares resources in an open&lt;br/&gt;manner. Similar to today's web publication and discovery of documents, computer&lt;br/&gt;applications, machine cycles, and databases can be announced openly and used by&lt;br/&gt;others worldwide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A big issue in realizing this vision is to create facilities that help manage&lt;br/&gt;the diversity of available resources and adapt them to the users' needs. Thus,&lt;br/&gt;published software modules may be adapted to compose new application programs;&lt;br/&gt;discovered programs may be tuned to the user's platform; distributed&lt;br/&gt;applications may run at high performance, as they adapt to changing bandwidth&lt;br/&gt;and latency characteristics of the target environment. This project develops&lt;br/&gt;such facilities. Building on results of prior NSF support, an adaptive&lt;br/&gt;engine will dynamically improve the performance of distributed computer&lt;br/&gt;applications; it will adaptively compose software modules from components; and&lt;br/&gt;it will support computer applications that roam across discovered machine&lt;br/&gt;platforms. These components are being integrated in the iShare Internet sharing&lt;br/&gt;system, which provides the environment for resource publication, discovery, and&lt;br/&gt;remote use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components of this system are being created in related NSF projects, which synergistically complement the present project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work addresses a fundamental problem in computer system and software&lt;br/&gt;design: optimal design decisions are often impossible because insufficient&lt;br/&gt;information is available at design-time. The adaptive engine moves design&lt;br/&gt;decisions to the time application software executes, when this information becomes&lt;br/&gt;available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is expected to yield significant performance improvements of the&lt;br/&gt;involved compilers, composers, and application software, substantially facilitating the way the involved resources can be shared by the global community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
