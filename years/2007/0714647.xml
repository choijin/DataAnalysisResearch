    <AbstractNarration>The complexity of modern large-scale systems has caused a transition&lt;br/&gt;from a purely perimeter-based defensive model to one where security&lt;br/&gt;mechanisms pervade the infrastructure. However, there has not been a&lt;br/&gt;corresponding evolution in the model under which security policy&lt;br/&gt;operates in such environments: policies must still make independent&lt;br/&gt;decisions using only partial information: just what is known by that&lt;br/&gt;component at the time the decision is made. Thus, security policy must&lt;br/&gt;operate under certain assumptions that often cannot be validated. Such&lt;br/&gt;unchecked assumptions offer a way for attackers to bypass security by&lt;br/&gt;exploiting unforeseen loopholes. Consequently, administrators often&lt;br/&gt;use additional security mechanisms, such as intrusion-detection&lt;br/&gt;systems, that are poorly integrated with each other and with the&lt;br/&gt;explicit system access-control policy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is exploring the use of coordinated security policy&lt;br/&gt;mechanisms in heterogeneous, large-scale distributed environments. The&lt;br/&gt;assumptions on which security policy decisions are based are always&lt;br/&gt;checked against current facts. Changes of these facts are signaled by&lt;br/&gt;events propagated to other security-critical elements. Security&lt;br/&gt;mechanisms become dynamic, allowing for coordinated and continuous&lt;br/&gt;policy re-evaluation throughout the duration of an entity's&lt;br/&gt;interactions with the various components of the system. This model&lt;br/&gt;naturally integrates access control, intrusion detection and other&lt;br/&gt;defensive mechanisms, allowing for the unification of protection and&lt;br/&gt;reaction under the auspices of a common security policy. The result is&lt;br/&gt;a more reliable and robust computing infrastructure that is resilient&lt;br/&gt;to new threats and attacks, and bridge the gap between the&lt;br/&gt;capabilities offered by advanced defense mechanisms and the inability&lt;br/&gt;of security policy to take advantage of them in a coherent,&lt;br/&gt;coordinated manner.</AbstractNarration>
