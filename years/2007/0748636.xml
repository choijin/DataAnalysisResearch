<AbstractNarration>In this proposal Baldridge works on two research strands: The study of the geography problem in 4-dimensions and the study of symplectic 4-manifolds that admit a circle action. The first strand centers on the ``Symplectic Poincare Conjecture,?? a question about whether or not the topological space of the complex projective plane has a unique smooth structure that supports a symplectic form. The second strand centers on a question first posed by C. Taubes: if the product space of a 3-manifold and a circle admits a symplectic form, does the 3-manifold fiber over a circle? Baldridge?s previous work in each strand has formed and influenced his work in the other--the two strands are deeply connected. &lt;br/&gt;The research in this proposal would investigate the following questions related to the conjectures above: (1) Which manifolds with small Euler characteristic admit smooth exotic structures? Which of those exotic structures admit a symplectic form? (2) Are there criteria under which a symplectic 4-manifold is (up to diffeomorphism) uniquely defined by its topological data? (3) What interesting phenomena occur in the geography problem as one gets close to the Bogomolov-Miyaoka-Yau line? (4) Which circle bundles over a fibered 3-manifold admit a symplectic form?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A 3-manifold is a space that locally looks like the familiar space in which we live. If one imagines replacing every point in the 3-manifold with a circle of points in a nice way, one gets an example of a 4-manifold with a circle action. Here `action' means a rotation of the space along each circle. Four manifolds with circle actions have many nice periodic and symmetry properties, which makes them particularly suitable for modeling and testing physical theories. (For example, the space-time universe we live in is an example of a 4-manifold which may have a circle action.) These manifolds are especially useful for modeling if they also have a symplectic structure--a key ingredient in almost all the equations of classical and quantum physics. Baldridge will investigate the shapes of symplectic 4-manifolds with circle actions and of 4-manifolds in general. This investigation is done by constructing new examples of smooth and symplectic 4-manifolds and by distinguishing 4-manifolds from each other by relating invariant features of a 4-manifold to the number of solutions of certain systems of nonlinear partial differential equations on that manifold. In addition to his research work in mathematics, Baldridge will strive to help the next generation of U.S. citizens learn mathematics through his work on three projects. The first project is to complete a comprehensive college curriculum for prospective elementary and middle school teachers. The second is to bring outstanding mathematicians to Louisiana State University to be ``Scholars in Residence?? to interact with participants in a new professional Master?s degree program for teachers. The final project is professional development for teachers in a high-need school district that has the potential to create a replicable model for building high-performing mathematics programs in high-need schools.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The mathematical research in this project involved the topology of spaces related to String Theory in physics, i.e., theories that describe all particle (including gravity) interactions in the universe.   The spaces studied include smooth and symplectic 4-manifolds, 6-dimensional Calabi-Yau manifolds, and embedded knots and links in 3-manifolds.   A 3-manifold is a space that locally looks like the familiar space in which we live. If one imagines replacing every point in the 3-manifold with a circle or line in a nice way, one gets an example of a 4-manifold.  Four manifolds are particularly useful for modeling physical phenomena if they also have a symplectic structure. The PI investigated the shapes of 4-manifolds by constructing new examples and distinguishing them from each other by using invariants of 4-manifolds derived from the count of solutions of certain systems of nonlinear partial differential equations on the manifold.  As part of this grant, the PI    Produced a series of research papers on small symplectic 4-manifolds related to the "symplectic Poincar&eacute; conjecture," including the construction of a symplectic 4-manifold with special properties that is homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic to .   Created a new type of construction called a telescoping triple that was used to fill out much of the remaining geography of simply connected, minimal, closed symplectic 4-manifolds with odd intersection forms.   Wrote a series of papers deriving upper bounds on the minimum Euler characteristic of all symplectic 4-manifolds with a prescribed fundamental group.   Symplectic Calabi-Yau manifolds are symplectic manifolds with vanishing first Chern class.  They were first introduced to study mirror symmetry in physics.  As part of this project, the PI  Introduced a new surgery operation on symplectic manifolds called coisotropic Luttinger surgery that generalizes Luttinger surgery.   Constructed infinitely many distinct symplectic Calabi-Yau 6-manifolds that are not of the form  for  a closed symplectic 4-manifold and  a closed surface.   Mathematicians have long been interested in creating knot invariants.  In some models of the universe, particles are thought of as knotted strings in the visible 3-dimensional space, with invariants of knots giving information about the particles.  One important way to check for an invariant is to show that it does not change under three simple Reidemeister moves of 2-dimensional pictures of knots.  Since its discovery in the 1920Æs, ReidemeisterÆs theorem has helped mathematicians and physicists find and prove many invariants of knots.  The problem with Reidemeister moves, however, is that they are inherently 2-dimensional: it is far more natural to work with knots in 3-dimensional space than work with 2d pictures of them.  The PI proved the first 3-dimensional version of ReidemeisterÆs theorem using a new representation of knots that the PI created called a cube diagram.  The 3-dimensional moves are called cube moves and, importantly, there are only two of them.  In a series of papers, the PI   Described a Heegaard-Floer homology theory for cube diagrams and proved that it was an invariant of knots using cube moves.     Generalized cube diagrams to a representation of knotted tori in  called hypercube diagrams.     Created a new construction of Legendrian tori in  using Lagrangian hypercube diagrams.   The first broader impacts project was the completion of a highly rated textbook series for prospective teachers.  The next project raised the mathematical achievement of students in a high needs school district.  The goal and hope of that project was to use the lessons learned to build a nationally replicable program.  This program was eventually realized by creation of the Eureka Math/EngageNY Math curriculum, a comprehensive PK-12 math curriculum recognized nationally for its adherence to mathematics.  Specifically, as part of the broader impacts, the PI  Created a program that raised K...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
