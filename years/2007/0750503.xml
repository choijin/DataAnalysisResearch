<AbstractNarration>This award by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program supports the work of Professor D. Michael Heinekey of the University of Washington, to develop models for the active site in methylene-tetrahymethanopterin dehydrogenase (Hmd) and other Fe2 hydrogenase enzymes. The coordination of dihydrogen (H2) and its subsequent activation will be investigated using a unique combination of NMR spectroscopy, isotopic labeling studies, and computational predictions. This research will increase the understanding of catalytic hydrogenations - reactions of great practical importance to the chemical industry. Undergraduate and graduate students will gain a variety of skills studying molecules with novel, highly delocalized structures and dynamic properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Hydrogen gas is used in several large scale industrial processes, including the manufacture of nitrogen fertilizers and the refining of petroleum.   In the future, hydrogen may be used as a transportation fuel and as an energy storage medium for intermittent energy generators such as solar and wind installations.     Currently, hydrogen is made from natural gas in an energy intensive process which ultimately produces carbon dioxide.  Utilization of hydrogen in cars or in energy storage depends upon fuel cells, which use platinum metal as a catalyst.   Platinum must be imported (from South Africa).  Even if production is expanded to all known reserves, the world supply of platinum is insufficient for widespread adoption of these new applications.     This research project seeks to understand the interaction of hydrogen with metals, particularly inexpensive metals such as iron and nickel.  Using enzymes found in bacteria as a guide, new molecules containing these metals have been prepared and studied. We have also reported on the preparation of the first example of a dihydrogen complex of cobalt.  Ultimately, it is hoped that this work will pave the way for new ways to generate and utilize hydrogen via the preparation of catalysts not containing platinum.     The research is carried out by a diverse group of undergraduate students, graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in a highly collaborative atmosphere.  The students benefit from a broad training in chemical synthesis, spectroscopy and related fields.  Dissemination of the research is primarily in scholarly journals, but group members have also been engaged in outreach to local high schools, including giving hands on science presentations to high school chemistry classes.  Both the PI and students have given presentations at conferences.  In the summer of 2009 and 2010, a local high school teacher also worked with us and used the results of his research experience in the classroom.
