<AbstractNarration>Project Summary:&lt;br/&gt;Proposal to the National Science Foundation Requesting Supplemental Travel&lt;br/&gt;Funds&lt;br/&gt;Gordon Research Conference, Polymers (West), January 7-12, 2007, Ventura, CA&lt;br/&gt;Jimmy Mays, Chair&lt;br/&gt;Darrin Pochan, Vice-Chair&lt;br/&gt;The Polymers (West) Gordon Research Conference (GRC) seeks to supplement the&lt;br/&gt;available funds for travel support to enhance participation of post doctoral and senior&lt;br/&gt;graduate students at this meeting. This request is for $3,000 for supporting&lt;br/&gt;approximately 6 supplemental travel packages at approximately $500/person. Funding&lt;br/&gt;requests by junior faculty will also be considered provided they can demonstrate no other&lt;br/&gt;source of support for travel to the conference.&lt;br/&gt;Technical Merit: The technical merit of this proposal is to facilitate enhanced&lt;br/&gt;participation of young polymer scientists in a Gordon Conference that addresses several&lt;br/&gt;key areas at the frontiers of polymer science and engineering. The invited speakers are&lt;br/&gt;internationally known, world class experts in their respective areas of polymer chemistry,&lt;br/&gt;physics and engineering, as well as emerging young stars. Having such distinguished&lt;br/&gt;leading experts participate as speakers and discussion leaders is critical to assuring that&lt;br/&gt;the GRC is highly successful. Another criterion that is viewed as an important measure&lt;br/&gt;of the success of a GRC is attendance and active participation of young researchers. For&lt;br/&gt;many of us, including the Chair and Co-Chair of this conference, early career attendance&lt;br/&gt;at GRCs provided scientific stimulation, development of professional relationships, and&lt;br/&gt;collaborations with other scientists that have been important in our professional&lt;br/&gt;development. Our motivation for the present request is to give as many young polymer&lt;br/&gt;scientists as possible the opportunity to experience their first GRC in Ventura next&lt;br/&gt;January. NSF funding is critical to achieving this goal.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The broader impact lies in the cultivation and development of&lt;br/&gt;tomorrow's leaders in the polymer field and related interdisciplinary fields and to further&lt;br/&gt;diversity in the scientific force performing this interdisciplinary research. In keeping&lt;br/&gt;with the past tradition of the Polymers (West) GRC, the Programmatic Themes of this&lt;br/&gt;year's conference cover a range of important and timely topics spanning the range from&lt;br/&gt;polymer synthesis to polymer physics and engineering, including industrial trends in&lt;br/&gt;polymer science. These programmatic themes are Bioactive Polymers, Controlled&lt;br/&gt;Polymer Architectures, Polymers for Microelectronics and Optics, Block Copolymers,&lt;br/&gt;Nanoparticles and Nanotechnology, Bio-Rheology and Gels, Polymers for Energy Needs.&lt;br/&gt;Finally, a new Graduate Research Seminar meeting will be held the weekend prior to the&lt;br/&gt;full Gordon Research Conference that will be fully organized, run, and attended by&lt;br/&gt;graduate students and post-doctoral researchers chosen by Mays and Pochan. This will&lt;br/&gt;certainly lead to increased participation of younger researchers in the interdisciplinary&lt;br/&gt;field of polymer science and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
