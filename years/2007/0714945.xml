<AbstractNarration>The investigators will study new computational techniques with&lt;br/&gt;applications to inverse problems and image analysis. They will seek new&lt;br/&gt;methods that combine variational arguments with ideas from computational&lt;br/&gt;harmonic analysis and partial differential equations in order to overcome&lt;br/&gt;limitations of existing methods. The research will have three objectives:&lt;br/&gt;propose new models for cartoon and texture separation in images by working&lt;br/&gt;with spaces of distributions; propose completely new techniques for&lt;br/&gt;multiscale hierarchical decomposition of images; propose efficient&lt;br/&gt;algorithms for solving inverse problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the proposed research and educational program, computational &lt;br/&gt;mathematics, image processing, as well as more general areas of science and&lt;br/&gt;engineering will benefit. Applications include image analysis, medical&lt;br/&gt;imaging, satellite imaging, material science, and terrain data analysis,&lt;br/&gt;surveillance and inverse problems.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
