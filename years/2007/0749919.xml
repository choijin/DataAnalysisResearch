<AbstractNarration>With the support of the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program, Professor Joseph Dinnocenzo's  proposed research will provide fundamental mechanistic insight into the structures, reactivities, and reaction mechanisms of group 14 cation radical intermediates.  This knowledge will establish a foundation for understanding experimental observations.  The research will also provide the predictive power needed to successfully utilize ion radicals for new chemical processes in synthesis and in materials applications.&lt;br/&gt;The proposal has four primary research goals:&lt;br/&gt;(1)Generate reactive cation radicals of organo-silanes, -germanes, -stannanes, and  plumbanes, and use nanosecond and picosecond transient absorption techniques to elucidate the mechanism(s) for their reactions with nucleophiles.  For nucleophile assisted mechanisms they will apply additional tests, recently developed in the PI's laboratory, to distinguish between concerted and stepwise pathways.&lt;br/&gt;(2)Determine the stereochemical course of nucleophilic substitutions on Group 14 cation radicals using the endocyclic restriction test.&lt;br/&gt;(3)Perform critical mechanistic experiments to test recent molecular orbital calculations in their laboratory that predict reversible nucleophilic substitutions for some organosilane cation radical/nucleophile pairs.  If confirmed, the chemistry may lead to a new experimental method for generating cation radical intermediates.&lt;br/&gt;(4)Investigate the fragmentation mechanisms of oligosilane cation radicals as models for polysilane cation radicals, which have been proposed as reactive intermediates produced during the photolysis of polysilane photoresists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts. Organic ion radical chemistry is still in its infancy in comparison with that of a variety of other reactive intermediates (e.g. carbocations, carbanions, free radicals, and carbenes).  There remains a great deal to learn about ion radical chemistry and its potential applications (e.g. in synthetic and materials chemistry).  History has shown that progress toward such practical goals is facilitated and accelerated by mechanistic understanding.  One of the goals of this proposal is to provide such understanding.&lt;br/&gt; The proposed research will also provide an usually rich educational experience for students.  For example, in addition to learning mechanistic methodologies, students will learn how to synthesize, purify, and spectroscopically characterize compounds.  Students will also receive training in a range of less traditional techniques (transient absorption spectroscopy, time resolved single photon counting, electrochemistry, and modern computational chemistry. This proposal will also benefit undergraduate students and high school teachers through the NSF REU RET summer program at the University of Rochester.  Over the past 10 years, the PI has, on average, hosted 2 summer visitors/year through this program.  Nearly half of these visitors have been from groups underrepresented in science and engineering.  Summer visitors learn through research and through a summer minicourse on photoinduced charge transfer co-taught by the PI.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We discovered that significant up?conversion could be observed in molecular?doped, rigid polymer films, which could be useful in the design of organic light?emitting diodes.  A very simple film format was utilized in which the sensitizer and fluorescence emitter were both molecularly dispersed.  The flexibility of this format facilitated the optimization of upconversion efficiencies.  To our knowledge this is the first reported example of upconversion efficiency in a rigid polymer film.  Upconverted ultraviolet fluorescence was also discovered which, as far as we are aware, is the first observation of upconversion of blue-to-UV light in a polymer film and the first upconversion that does not utilize a heavy metal-containing organometallic sensitizer.  We performed experiments which provided additional support for the formation of bonded exciplexes, which are newly discovered photochemical intermediates.  We expect our conceptual models and our experimental protocols for identifying bonded exciplex formation will aid in the discovery of these novel intermediates in other photochemical systems.  We determined accurate oxidation potentials in solution for a large number of aromatic derivatives which had not been possible to previously measure by electrochemical methods.  The transient absorption methods we developed should be of general use for the determination of thermodynamically meaningful oxidation potentials.  These, in turn, will be valuable for critically testing a variety of thermodynamic and thermokinetic correlations.  Our kinetic work on the equilibration of neutrals and cation radicals to determine oxidation potentials lead to the surprising discovery that the rate dependence on the reaction free energy followed a remarkably simple functional form.  Subsequent work on the charge shift, electron transfer quenching of excited pyrylium cations by neutral donors was found to have a similar functional dependence.  This contrasts with the well-known Rehm-Weller description of excited state electron transfer quenching involving neutral donors and acceptors where a gradual fall?off of quenching rate constant with reaction free energy was reported.  We found serious flaws in the Rehm?Weller formulation of the electron transfer process and in their experimental data which lead to the behavior they reported.  When the problems are corrected, the quenching reported in the famous Rehm?Weller experiments was found to follow the same free energy dependence observed in our experiments.  This finding and our analysis will teach future workers on how properly construct Rehm?Weller like plots so that meaningful results can be obtained.  It seems likely that our work will lead to the reinterpretation of a large body of previously published data which relied on the original Rehm?Weller analysis and approach.  We developed a new mechanistic test to elucidate the stereochemical outcome of nucleophilic substitutions on Group 14 cation radicals that can not be determined by more conventional means because the substitution products are not configurationally stable.  This work provides benchmark data that can be used in the design of new reactions and for testing theoretical predictions.  Our work on the mechanism for the fragmentation of aryltrialkyl stannane cation radical has solved a longstanding puzzle in ion radical chemistry, where formation of the less stable radical was previously observed &ndash; an exceptional result.  We found that the stannane cation radical fragmentations are, in fact, nucleophile?assisted processes.  This mechanism provides predictive power for the design of new experiments and for the rationalization of experimental results.  We demonstrated that disilane cation radical fragmentations are nucleophile?assisted reactions.  Preliminary work has shown that this mechanism is also operative for oligosilane cation radicals.  Oligosilanes are models for polysilanes, which have a number of important materials science a...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
