<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project would address the Earth's most recent mass extinction ever, the K/T boundary, from the perspective of upper Cretaceous to lower Paleocene strata on James Ross and Seymour Islands, Antarctica. Its goal is to refine the magneto and chemostratigraphy for global correlations to determine the extinction's cause. While the K/T event is widely associated with a meteorite impact, there is some evidence that it may have been caused by global climate change. This field area may contain evidence that extinction in the high southern latitudes preceded that in more temperate locales, which would support a climactic origin. The broader impacts of this work include graduate education and dissemination of results through a popular science book. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ One of the most important geological discoveries in the last 30 years was the recognition that a major impact event occurred essentially coincident with the end-Cretaceous mass extinction events, where all of the dinosaurs died about 65 million years ago. The chemical fingerprint of this event has since been discovered near the extinction level at hundreds of localities over the globe, and the impact crater itself was found in central Mexico.  Subsequent work on this interval of time, however, has shown that a gigantic volcanic eruption started in northern India a few hundred thousand years before the impact event, leading to the suggestion that climatic deterioration may have already started the extinction process.  Unfortunately, most sedimentary sequences have an exceedingly slow deposition rate, which means that geologists and paleontologists typically do not have adequate resolution in terms of telling geological time to answer this question.     On the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula, on and around James Ross Island, there is an unusual sedimentary basin that preserves one of the highest deposition rate intervals of the Cretaceous/Paleogene boundary. In particular, Seymour Island has over 1000 m of beautifully preserved, and highly fossiliferous, strata in member 9 of the L&oacute;pez de Bertodano Formation that covers the last few million years prior to this extinction interval.  Past work by previous Antarctic expeditions had located the extinction horizon and impact debris layer, but there were very few other dated horizons in the sequence that could be used as the basis of intercontinental correlation.     A major phase of our work supported by the NSF Office of Polar Programs was to unravel the sequence of geomagnetic reversals present through the sequence, as they provide one of the best methods for telling time in sedimentary rocks of this sort.  Earth's magnetic field has an irregular pattern of magnetic polarity switches, where the total geomagnetic field collapses for a few thousand years, and can reestablish itself in the opposite polarity. The major magnetic pattern has been calibrated nicely for the past 200 million years using data from marine magnetic lineartions at sea, as well as those from biostratigraphically and radiometrically dated rock units on land. Previous investigators in Antarctica, however, have not tried this technique, on the assumption that the freeze-saw cycling of permafrost would disrupt magnetic orientation in the sediments of the James Ross basin.  We found, however, that occasional carbonate concretions were still in place.     We had to do a fair amount of experimentation to discover the proper magnetic cleaning techniques to isolate the original magnetization dating from the time at which the rocks formed. Using a combination of standard techniques, and a few that we developed for this project, the underlying pattern of the fossil magnetic field stood out clearly, allowing us to find the top and bottom of the major reversal boundaries between about 70 and 64 million years ago.

These data confirm that the stratigraphic section on the Antarctic Peninsula provides a unique, high-resolution record of the biological events that lead up to the Cretaceous tertiary boundary extinction.  The fossils present in the sequence on Seymour Island are extraordinarily well preserved &ndash; they still have the beautiful, iridescent "mother-of-pearl" that you see in oysters and abalone shells. This means that the fossils shell material was not subjected...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
