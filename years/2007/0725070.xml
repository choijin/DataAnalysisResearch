<AbstractNarration>0725070: University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign&lt;br/&gt;PI: Thomas H. Dunning&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;In this project, the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign will provide a new class of computing capability to the research community, opening up new possibilities in science and engineering. It will provide the capability for researchers to tackle much larger and more complex research challenges across a wide spectrum of domains. NCSA will acquire, deploy and operate a very large, architecturally coherent, innovative, leadership-class, high-performance computational resource, to be known as Blue Waters, for the science and engineering research community. This system will be sited at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) where it will be operated by the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) and its partners in the Great Lakes Consortium for Petascale Computing (GLC). Initially, large allocations of resources on the new system will be awarded by NSF through a separate peer-reviewed competition. As research activities are identified in this way, the GLC will form Petascale Application Collaboration Teams to provide collaborative consulting services to each activity.&lt;br/&gt;The Blue Waters project also includes education and outreach programs that will target pre-college, undergraduate, graduate and post-graduate levels. The Girls Engaged in Mathematics and Science (GEMS) and Southeastern University and College Coalition for Engineering Education (SUCCEED) programs will be augmented with materials related to petascale computing. Graduate education will be enhanced by the establishment of a Virtual School of Computational Science and Engineering that brings together the faculty at each of the universities in the Committee on Institutional Cooperation (CIC) as well as Iowa State University, Louisiana State University, and the University of North Carolina, to create courses that focus on petascale computing and petascale-enabled science and engineering. The Virtual School will explore new instructional technologies and create courses, curricula, and certificate programs that are tailored to science and engineering students and will also sponsor workshops, conferences, summer schools, and seminars.&lt;br/&gt;The project will include an annual series of workshops targeted at the developers of simulation packages and aspiring application developers. In addition, the project will include two industrial partnership activities. The first, Industry Partners in Petascale Engagement program (IPIPE) will provide industrial partners with a first look at the technological and scientific developments that flow from the petascale program. The second, an Independent Software Vendor (ISV) Application Scalability Forum will promote collaborations between Consortium members, ISVs, and the industrial end-user community.&lt;br/&gt;This award will permit investigators across the country to conduct innovative research in a number of areas including:&lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;the development of structure in the early cosmos; the physics of supernovae, gamma-ray bursters, binary black-hole systems, and collisions between neutron stars;&lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;the first-principles design of catalysts, pharmaceuticals, and other molecular materials for specificity and efficiency;&lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;the mechanisms of reactions involving large bio-molecules and bio-molecular assemblages, such as enzymes, ribosomes and cellular membranes; the assembly of capsids;&lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;the interaction of very short laser pulse trains with polyatomic molecules;&lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;nonlinear interactions between cloud systems, weather systems and the Earth's climate; the detailed structure of, and the nature of intermittency in, stratified and unstratified, rotating and non-rotating turbulence in classical and magnetic fluids; and&lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;the exploration of the internal structure of the Earth using high-resolution, broad-band, global seismic inversions&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this award include: provisioning of unique infrastructure for research and education; extensive efforts to accelerate education and training in the use of high-performance computation in science; training in petascale computing techniques; promoting an exchange of information between academia and industry about the applications of petascale computing; and&lt;br/&gt;broadening participation in computational science through NCSA's GEMS program designed to encourage middle-school girls to consider mathematics-oriented and science-oriented careers.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><em>Leadership Class Scientific and Engineering Computing: Breaking Through the Limits</em> was awarded in 2007 and enabled The National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, along with Cray Inc. and the Great Lakes Consortium partners to design, develop and deploy the <em>Blue Waters</em> Sustained Petascale System, with a robust, full-featured petascale software environment. This system provides more than a petaflop of sustained performance on a significant number of real-world science and engineering applications. Blue Waters was the first NSF leadership-class computing system and targeted the most demanding science and engineering applications---those with extraordinary performance, memory and I/O needs---that were infeasible on other facilities. The balance of excellent processing, memory and I/O performance on Blue Waters makes it a groundbreaking system that enables new frontier discoveries in science and engineering, energizes academic research in computer science and engineering, inspires innovations in education, and enhances U.S. competitiveness. A focus on the system and the people who make it a valuable resource for science, engineering, and society has been key to its success. <br /><br />The system, built by Cray Inc., includes the following hardware: 22,636 Cray XE6 nodes and 4,228 Cray XK7 nodes that include NVIDIA graphics processor acceleration. The XE6 nodes boast 64-128 GB of memory per node and the XK7s have 38-72 GB of memory totaling over 1.6PB, making Blue Waters the largest memory system in the open science world. Blue Waters is 44% larger than the next largest Cray system ever built. Blue Waters' dedicated storage system includes 26 petabytes of useable online storage for quick access while jobs are running, and 250 petabytes of nearline tape for longer term data storage. Blue Waters staff experts engage in intellectual and support efforts with science teams around the nation to maximize the effectiveness of the system and to expand its impact. <br /><br />The impact and benefits of the Blue Waters Project have been widespread. Since going into full-service operations in 2013, Blue Waters has hosted nearly 4,000 users and a total of 785 projects from a myriad of disciplines.&nbsp; Researchers from across the country have utilized the system to advance scientific and computational research and to date have produced over 1,000 high impact papers and articles, many of which were only possible on Blue Waters. Once in operation, the focus of this deployment award shifted to deploying novel methods for education and community outreach, and to helping science teams increase their productivity by implementing new algorithms and application improvements. More than 200 education and training allocations were utilized in ways ranging from one-day workshops to week long institutes. The project has directly benefited over 3,700 individuals learning about different aspects of computational and data-enabled science and engineering at more than 219 academic institutions, including 65 institutions in EPSCoR jurisdictions. Experts in the field have provided training opportunities bringing petascale resources, tools, and methods to the science and engineering community. A virtual school of computational science and engineering offered 6 credit courses at 27 partner sites as well as multi-week classes, extending the impact of some of the best teachers to a broader range of institutions. The Blue Waters Graduate Fellowships provided 36 graduate students in multidisciplinary fields with nearly $2 million and over 2 million node hours. The Blue Waters Student Internship Program was designed to immerse undergraduate and graduate students in research projects associated with Blue Waters and to interest them in High Performance Computing (HPC). 120 undergraduate students have benefited from this opportunity. To ensure a long-lasting impact of the Blue Waters program, and to foster the development of a broader, well-educated community able to conduct computational science and engineering research using petascale technologies, resources, and methods, a repository of education and training materials was established and is accessible to the public via the Blue Waters portal.</p> <p><br />The Blue Waters Project worked closely with domain specialists to keep their applications at the cutting edge of performance on today's HPC systems.
