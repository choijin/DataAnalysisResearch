<AbstractNarration>This CAREER award by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry program supports work by Professor Ryan Julian at the University of California - Riverside to develop faster methods for proteomics - the identification of proteins in a given cell or environment.  Proteins are the biological agents which carry out virtually all chemistry in living organisms.  Identifying all proteins present is often one of the first steps towards obtaining a detailed understanding of a biochemical process.  Rapid identification is difficult because there are often thousands of proteins involved in complex functional relationships in a given site. Professor Julian and his group utilize a novel combination of mass spectrometry and laser induced photodissociation to facilitate identification.  The information obtained from these experiments can uniquely identify a protein in a fraction of a second.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research simultaneously serves many educational purposes, including the training of graduate, postgraduate, and undergraduate researchers in the important and growing field of biological mass spectrometry. Related outreach activities catering to the specific needs of the diverse student body at UC-Riverside include a program for the formal mentoring of science undergraduates on campus with an emphasis on helping underrepresented groups and student-athletes.  A new graduate course is being created to enhance student knowledge of chemical and noncovalent bonds and to emphasize the importance of connections between all fields of chemistry.</AbstractNarration>
