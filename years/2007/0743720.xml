<AbstractNarration>PI:  Kathleen Smith (Duke University awardee)&lt;br/&gt;Senior Personnel:  Kristin Antelman (North Carolina State University; subawardee), William Michener, Mark Servilla (University of New Mexico; subawardee), Jane Greenberg, Todd Vision (University of North Caolina at Chapel Hill; subawardee), William Piel (Yale University; subawardee).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scientific progress depends on the ability of scientists to build upon each other's work. Despite widespread appreciation for the value of repositories that archive certain kinds of data (e.g. GenBank, PDB), most data associated with published papers in evolutionary biology and related disciplines fail to be archived in a public repository.  Some of the obstacles to more widespread data archiving are sociological and some are technical.  In collaboration with a consortium of journals and societies in evolutionary biology and related disciplines, NESCent will develop a general-purpose digital library, called Dryad, for the preservation, discovery, sharing, and reuse of data underlying publications.  This project seeks to remove the key technical obstacles that currently prevent journals and societies from adopting a policy of mandatory archiving of data underlying publications. Some of the most important technical goals for Dryad include: (1) simplifying the process of data deposition during manuscript submission; (2) exchanging metadata with journal-required archives such as GenBank and TreeBase, and with metadata registries such as MetaCat; (3) assignment of globally unique, stable, resolvable identifiers for each data object, thus enabling data citations.  Additional goals intended to increase the reliability and utility of Dryad include: (4) cataloguing of taxonomic, geographic, and other specialized metadata to facilitate data search, (5) implementation of web services to allow third-party data search and retrieval, (6) distributed data backup among several institutions.  This project also seeks to support consortium members in their efforts to overcome the sociological obstacles to widespread data archiving.  Dryad will be overseen by a board of stakeholders drawn from the consortium, who will set policy and plan for long-term financial self-sufficiency. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will have a broad and transformative impact by enabling the preservation, discovery, sharing and reuse of data for an entire biological discipline an will serve as a model for the many other ?small science? disciplines facing similar challenges in data preservation and sharing.  Through a variety of engagement activities, data archiving will be promoted within the research community and Dryad will serve as a catalyst for the continued development of data exchange standards. Dryad will be a publicly accessible, web based, database, promoting wide distribution of the result of scientific activities. Future scientists will be taught about the value of archived data through development of classroom resources for datasets of special educational value.  Dryad development portal will be available at  http://www.nescent.org/wg_digitaldata/</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project undertook development of a shared digital repository, called Dryad, for the preservation, discovery and dissemination of data underlying published works in evolutionary biology, at the behest of a number of journals and societies in field.  A production repository with a web submission interface was launched in January 2009 at http://datadryad.org.  By the end of the granting period, 3,864 data packages had been published from 252 different journals, and the site was receiving approximately ten thousand file downloads per week.    A major goal of this project was to demonstrate the feasibility of a partnering with journals to promote data submission to Dryad at the time of manuscript submission. By the end of this project, 38 different journals covering not only evolutionary biology, but also ecology, medicine and other areas, had integrated data submission to Dryad as part of their production systems. Eighteen of these use a workflow in which data are available for inspection by peer reviewers and editors during manuscript review.  Development of the repository was achieved in large part through customization of the open source DSpace platform.  Technical work focused on features designed to promote adoption of data archiving by journals and researchers and reuse of data for research and education. These include (1) development of data curation standards and capacity; (2) a proof-of-concept for interoperability at the time of data deposit with TreeBase, a specialized repository in which many journals require phylogenetic data to be archived; (3) functionality to enable users to discover related data available through the Knowledge Network for Biocomplexity, (4) assignment of globally unique, stable, resolvable identifiers for each data object and web services to allow third-party data search and retrieval, (5) distributed backup for the web site and data, and (8) capacity for supporting variation among journal policies, such as the one-year embargoes on public access permitted by the Joint Data Archiving Policy, a policy adopted by many partner journals in January 2011.  A stakeholder-governance group consisting of representatives from partner journals, societies and publishers, called the Dryad Consortium, advised on development priorities and provided feedback on the development of a formal sustainability plan for the repository.  The outcome of sustainability planning was the incorporation of Dryad as a membership-based nonprofit corporation in 2012.  Among the first tasks of the nonprofit board was to approve the terms and price schedule for membership fees, which started in January 2013, and data publication charges, which started in September 2013.   The project invested in sustained community engagement with partner journals and the wider community of stakeholders.  In addition to standard academic outputs such as publications and conference presentations, Dryad-affiliated personnel led discussions of data issues at numerous society and journal business meetings, maintained an active and widely-followed social media presence, hosted booths at several conferences a year to speak with researchers one-on-one, and co-organized a major community meeting on data publication in May 2013 in Oxford, UK.  The project team collaborated with NESCent staff, researchers and educators to develop several teaching college and graduate-level classroom modules using archived data as part of an ongoing initiative called DryadLab. Perhaps the most lasting broader impact of the project was to help achieve international recognition for the importance and feasibility of making research data archiving an integral part of scholarly communication, as evidence by how Dryad is highlighted in the influential 2012 Royal Society "Science as a Public Enterprise" report (http://royalsociety.org/policy/projects/science-public-enterprise) and the Accelerating Science Award Program portfolio for 2013 (http://asap.plos.org).
