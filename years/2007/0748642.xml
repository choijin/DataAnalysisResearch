<AbstractNarration>In this CAREER proposal the PI proposes to study the molecular mechanisms of DNA mismatch repair. The experimental approach will use single molecule experimental techniques. Specifically the PI will use single molecule fluorescence resonant energy transfer (smFRET) to observe the real time dynamics of the conformational changes taking place in the DNA molecule at an angstrom spatial resolution. It is hypothesized that these conformational changes are important for damage recognition by the repair proteins. A novel combination of force and smFRET spectroscopies is proposed to determine the effect of external force and torque in the protein-DNA interactions. The PI hypothesizes that these external loads can mimic the effect of physical constraints imposed in vivo on the DNA by multiple protein binding and rotational constraints. The focus of the proposal is on studies of DNA mismatch damage recognition. The assays and methodologies developed will allow extending the studies to downstream signaling events in the mismatch repair process resulting from interaction of multiple protein complexes. The PI will develop a new course "Introduction to Biological Physics" at the advanced undergraduate level. Undergraduate and graduate students will develop research projects and the PI will create awareness of emerging interdisciplinary fields and research opportunities for undergraduate students. Special attention is focused on the participation of undergraduate students from underrepresented groups in science in summer research projects.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ DNA is the molecule that encodes the genetic information used in the development and function of allliving organisms.  Because the information encoded in DNA is essential for all life processes, preservingthe information encoded in DNA is extremely important.  The DNA mismatch repair system works toprotect DNA from spontaneous mutations by recognizing and repairing DNA sequence errors. Understanding the details of the DNA mismatch repair pathway is of great interest to the biomedicalcommunity, as mutations in genes encoding proteins involved in DNA mismatch repair pathway orinactivation of genes encoding these proteins can lead to spontaneous mutations and a predispositionto many forms of cancer in humans.The research supported by this NSF grant was focused on understanding the details involved in the firststep of the DNA mismatch repair pathway, DNA mismatch recognition.  In humans, the DNA mismatchrepair process is initiated by binding of specific proteins that attach to the DNA at the location of themismatch.  After binding to the DNA, these proteins bind ATP (which provides energy), and then otherproteins can attach and repair the mismatch.  However the details of how all of these proteinscoordinate their behavior have been unclear.   The results of our research demonstrate that the mismatch repair proteins act very quickly, within a fewseconds, for the types of DNA mismatches that they are known to efficiently repair.  However, certainmismatches in DNA (where the DNA makes a small loop) that not efficiently repaired result in themismatch repair proteins staying stuck at that location.  This explains why these particular types of DNAmismatches are harder to repair.  Our results show that these problematic DNA mismatches canfluctuate in their configuration leading to these stuck repair proteins.  When such mismatches aren?trepaired, the DNA mismatch can become a precursor for mutation.       Last Modified: 10/10/2017       Submitted by: Ivan Rasnik]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
