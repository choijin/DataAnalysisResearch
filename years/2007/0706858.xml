<AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY 2007.  The goal of the fellowship is to increase the participation of minority scientists at the postdoctoral level and to prepare them for positions of scientific leadership in US science. To attain this goal, the fellowship provides opportunities for postdoctoral training and research of the highest quality to recent doctoral recipients.   It is expected that Fellows supported through these fellowships will play important roles in training of the future workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research and training plan is entitled "Molecular mechanisms that mediate memory consolidation during sleep."  Accumulating evidence points to a connection between neuronal function during sleep and memory formation. The goal of this research is to provide direct evidence of a molecular connection between waking experience, memory consolidation, and sleep by using genetic and pharmacological approaches to directly manipulate signaling pathways and gene expression within neurons. Using mice, the research tests the hypothesis that contextual fear memories acquired during wakefulness are associated with sleep-dependent memory enhancements through the molecular replay of activity within the cAMP/PKA/CREB signaling pathway. The sponsoring scientist is Edwin G. (Ted) Abel at the University of Pennsylvania. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific training goals are to become experienced with genetic and molecular approaches in combination with electrophysiological techniques needed study sleep-memory interactions and gain experience in teaching and managing laboratory personnel.</AbstractNarration>
