<AbstractNarration>IIS - 0713295&lt;br/&gt;Frischer, Bernard&lt;br/&gt;University of Virginia Main Campus&lt;br/&gt;II CXT - Enabling a 3D Digital Cultural Heritage Pipeline: From Aquisition to Publishing to Archiving&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this proposal, an interdisciplinary research team of computer scientists and domain experts in the humanities will investigate acquisition, archiving, and publication issues pertaining to 3D virtual environments of cultural heritage sites.  The long-term objective is to create a center to "Serve and Archive Virtual Environments" (SAVE), which will ultimately exist as an open repository of scientifically authenticated 3D cultural heritage models. The project will create cost-effective tools to more easily capture the data necessary for the creation of the models. Tools for version control and methods for sustainability will be developed.  The project's workplan includes:&lt;br/&gt;-  development of an innovative 3D acquisition system for efficient, easy creation of 3D models of cultural heritage sites;&lt;br/&gt;- research into archiving and presentation issues for 3D model repositories;&lt;br/&gt;- deployment of a pilot 3D cultural heritage model archive; and,&lt;br/&gt;- implementation of a complete process for editorial review and publication of authenticated 3D models&lt;br/&gt;The resulting 3D archive will made publicly available as an online resource.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
