<AbstractNarration>An award has been made to the University of Puerto Rico Mayaguez under the direction of Dr. Nico M. Franz to consolidate the collection of macroinvertebrates at the university and place them in new cabinets and improve curation and database tools for the collection.  The collections of marine invertebrates and insects will be housed in new cabinets and storage equipment, a significant upgrade that will safeguard the collection for future research and study.  A database will be constructed with data for the taxonomy and geographic information on the collections.  Undergraduate students will assist in the entry of data and curation and re-housing efforts.  In addition, the students, including those from underrepresented groups, will participate in collections-related research projects.</AbstractNarration>
