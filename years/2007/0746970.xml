<AbstractNarration>Stereotype threat occurs when awareness of a negative group stereotype in a particular domain reduces the quality of performance exhibited by group members. The current work (a) examines how stereotype threat undermines women?s math performance and expression of math proficiency in education situations and (b) employs laboratory and education-based interventions to alleviate the deleterious impact of negative group stereotypes. Only by understanding how stereotype threat hurts performance can training regimens and performance strategies be designed to ameliorate its impact. The current studies build on earlier work suggesting that stereotype threat affects performance on difficult academic tasks (e.g., math) by inducing situation-related worries that consume working memory (WM). The first set of studies in the present project investigate why math performance changes when WM is impaired, specifically examining how problem solving strategies are altered when WM is limited. The second set of studies attempt to prevent WM limitations to begin with by reducing ST-related worries and altering views of the ST situation. The work draws on literatures exploring how individuals regulate unwanted emotions (e.g., fear/disgust) and tests how these same emotion regulation strategies can be successfully applied to ST.</AbstractNarration>

Consequences for suboptimal performance, especially in examinations, include poor evaluations from teachers, lost scholarships, and lowered motivation to pursue further education &ndash; especially in domains in which one experiences failure. Yet, in comparison to research examining the cognitive processes underlying successful skill execution, less work has addressed the causal mechanisms by which stress-laden academic situations lead to disappointing performances. Even less is known about the individual characteristics of those most likely to fail. This CAREER grant examined the causal cognitive mechanisms of a phenomenon that has been shown to reduce performance in academic situations involving group stereotypes. Stereotype threat (ST) occurs when the awareness of a negative stereotype about a social group in a particular domain reduces the quality of performance exhibited by group members (Steele, 1997). For instance, when negative stereotypes are activated, African-Americans perform worse on tests described as assessing intelligence (Steele &amp; Aronson, 1995) and women perform worse in math (Spencer, Steele, &amp; Quinn, 1999). This latter area was the subject of the current grant. Although women receive more than half of awarded undergraduate degrees, they receive far fewer in many of the sciences, and comprise a minority of academic faculty positions in STEM disciplines (NSF S&amp;E Indicators, 2006). Because ST contributes to women&rsquo;s low math and science representation (especially in more senior positions) it is important to investigate ST and related stress-induced underperformance and to devise means to alleviate their negative consequences.</p> <p>The current work (a) examined how ST undermines women&rsquo;s math performance and expression of math proficiency in education situations and (b) employed laboratory and education-based interventions to alleviate the deleterious impact of stressful academic situations. &nbsp;</p> <p>This work focused on disruption of working memory as possible mechanism for how ST negatively impacts academic performance. Working memory is a short-term memory system involved in the control, regulation, and active maintenance of a limited amount of information immediately relevant to the task at hand.

In several studies we show that stress-laden environments such as ST essentially place people in a dual-task situation in which task execution and performance-related worries vie for the working-memory capacity once devoted solely to the task at hand (see Beilock, 2008, <em>Current Directions in Psychological Science</em>; Rydell et al., 2009, <em>JPSP</em>).</p> <p>Based on our laboratory findings regarding the mechanisms underlying ST and stress-induced performance decrements more generally, we developed interventions to boost high-stakes test performance in classroom settings based on the idea that stressful academic situations cause a burden to important attention and working memory systems that could otherwise be used for demanding cognitive task performance.
