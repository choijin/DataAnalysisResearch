<AbstractNarration>This project develops a creativity enhancing tool for innovative education by building an electronic laboratory notebook application for a tablet PC in which students can combine graphical and handwritten notes in electronic form.  The graphical diagrams are understood by sketch recognition systems built by the students and their teachers.   Students take their electronic laboratory notebooks from class to class; the application studies the user's context to determine the most likely domain in which the student is drawing.  This new model of active visualization will increase students' understanding of the graphical material.  This tool allows students to draw free-hand drawings, just as they would on paper into a tablet PC, that are automatically recognized by the computer using sketch recognition system that provides simulation, feedback, and search capabilities.  The tool will be evaluated by observation and interview to determine if the students are more creative when using the sketching tool. This work will aid the learning process through a new visualization model for real-time simulation of the students' hand-drawn sketches, ultimately being used to teach students at all levels from kindergarten to graduate students.</AbstractNarration>

CAD systems exist to animate and correct diagrams, but their mouse-and-palette interfaces have to be learned, not only taking valuable time away from the subject material, but also diverts the student away from his or her creative impulses.  An additional issue is the time delay between a studentÆs completion of hand-drawn homework and the receipt of graded feedback.     A sketch-based system allows students to interact with a computer with the same creative freedom as they would on paper, removing the need to æteach the toolÆ and improving studentsÆ spatial cognition skills and manual dexterity, while providing immediate feedback. It seems counter-productive to have to spend precious time learning how to use the system before focusing on learning the actual course material. Sketched-based homework problems allow students to actually create the answer to a problem rather than simply identify the answer, as in traditional Scantron or standard computerized multiple-choice questions.

Additionally, we have developed multiple algorithms that allow a user to search for their sketches by sketch.     In order to facilitate collaborative drawing, we have developed collaborative drawing software that allows multiple people to draw from remote locations in real-time. To allow people to also use this software on a multi-user surface, we have developed a novel algorithm to automatically determine who is drawing on a collaborative surface using only the pressure and tilt sensors of the stylus.
