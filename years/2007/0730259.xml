<AbstractNarration>Partnerships for International Research and Education (PIRE) 2007&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal No:  0730259&lt;br/&gt;PI: Sridhar Krishnaswamy &lt;br/&gt;Institution:  Northwestern University&lt;br/&gt;Title: [PIRE: US-Asia Network of Centers for Intelligent Structural Health Management of Safety-Critical Structures (ISHM)]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will join U.S., Indian, Chinese and South Korean partners in an international research and education project to establish a US-Asian network of centers for basic research on Intelligent Structural Health Management of safety-critical aerospace, mechanical, and civil structures.  The aim is to develop ISHM systems that are applicable across disciplines and in diverse global settings.  Sridhar Krishnaswamy, Professor of Mechanical Engineering and Director of the Center for Quality Engineering &amp; Failure Prevention at Northwestern University leads a partnership with the University of Illinois, Chicago; Harbin Institute of Technology, China; Indian Institute of Technology, Madras, India; National Aerospace Labs, India; Pusan National University, South Korea; &lt;br/&gt;GE India Technology Center; Goodrich Corporation; Honeywell; and Boeing.  On the U.S. side, this five-year project will train 22 graduate students, and 10 undergraduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This PIRE will implement an extensive exchange program of faculty and student research to develop novel sensor systems for on-line diagnostics, develop advanced instrumentation for off-line non-destructive characterization, investigate material degradation mechanisms to obtain damage growth laws for relevant material systems, and develop probabilistic methods for prognosis of the remaining lifetime of a structure.  The international partners include Jinping Ou, Professor of Civil Engineering and Engineering Materials at Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China; Krishnan Balasubramaniam, Professor of Mechanical Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology, Chennai, India; and Joon-Hyun Lee, Professor of Mechanical Engineering, Pusan National University, Pusan, Korea.  U.S. researchers will conduct part of their research at the international partners' sites through several extended visits of about four months' duration each.  The international training for the students includes internships with industry.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Division of Civil, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Innovation is co-funding this award.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ PIRE-ISHM Outcomes     Background:  The structural integrity of safety-critical aerospace, civil, and nuclear power plant structures is of enduring concern to the international community.  Structural degradation, whether engendered by inherent material aging due to the environment and service loads (fatigue, corrosion, radiation etc) or by unpredictable external events (earthquakes, hurricanes, bird impact etc), is an inevitable part of life.   The societal and economic consequences of catastrophic structural failure include unacceptable loss of life and disruption that transcend national boundaries.     Objectives:  This PIRE-ISHM project established a collaborative international network of centers to pursue basic research and education in the area of Intelligent Structural Health Management (ISHM) of safety-critical aerospace, mechanical and civil structures.  The research goals of this multinational effort were:  to develop novel ISHM systems      and methodologies incorporating the latest technology and expertise from      the partner countries; and  to utilize global test beds      necessary to evaluate these systems.    The education goals of this project were to foster in our students a unique set of skills including:  scientific and technological depth combined with cross-disciplinary breadth;  technological perspicacity, namely the ability to discern appropriate technological solutions in a global framework that are implemented taking into account geographic-specific considerations; awareness of entrepreneurial and intellectual property issues relevant to transitioning from innovation in the laboratory to invention of fieldable ISHM systems on a worldwide basis; and  ability to successfully engage in complex technological endeavors with international partners.      The Team: The academic partner organizations were: Northwestern University (lead); University of Illinois, Chicago (sub-awardee); Indian Institute of Technology, Madras; Pusan National University, Korea; Harbin Institute of Technology, China ; Dalian University of Technology; Hong Kong Polytechnic University. Industry partners included Honeywell, Boeing, and GE Global Research.   The team from the US side included 3 senior faculty, 4 faculty affiliates, 5 post-doctoral researchers, 20 graduate and 16 undergraduate students.  In addition,16 faculty and 17 graduate and undergraduate students from the international partners participated.     The Intellectual Merit:   Intelligent Structural Health Management is an emerging concept that provides an efficient methodology to minimize the possibility of catastrophic failure of safety-critical structures. ISHM comprises diagnostic and prognostic modules.  The diagnostic module consists of instrumentation for off-line nondestructive characterization of structures during fabrication and maintenance, as well as on-line sensors that are located at critical points on the structure for in-service monitoring.  Information about the current state (presence of defects, material degradation due to aging etc) of the structure obtained by the diagnostic sensors is used to make an informed prediction about the probable evolution of further structural degradation, to provide an estimate of the remaining lifetime of the structure, and if necessary, to schedule rehabilitative measures. ISHM therefore represents a shift away from routine inspections, which are currently scheduled based on ensemble statistics obtained on similar structures, to inspections that are scheduled based on the actual state of the structural health of individual structures.  This will lead to improved safety and result in increased efficiencies in terms of reduced cost of inspections, and minimized disruption.  The research undertaken in this project have resulted in significant developments in new fiber-optic and thin film sensing systems for structural health monitoring, fundamental understanding of the interaction between ultrasonic waves and damage evol...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
