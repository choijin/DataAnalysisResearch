<AbstractNarration>Understanding which problems quantum computers can solve faster than classical computers is a fundamental problem.  It is known that quantum computers can break widely used cryptosystems, including those used for e-commerce transactions, but finding new useful applications is a challenging and important task.  It is equally important to determine which cryptosystems quantum computers cannot break.  This is important since today's encrypted information should remain secure even after quantum computers have been built.  This project will address these two issues.  The first part will focus on finding new problems that have exponentially faster algorithms on quantum computers than on classical computers.  Problems where a potential exponential speedup exists include graph isomorphism, the unique shortest lattice vector problem, and the nonabelian hidden subgroup problem.  The second part of this project will study which classical cryptosystems remain secure in the presence of quantum computers.  This requires understanding the limitations of quantum computers.  Modern cryptography relies on assuming that certain problems cannot be solved on classical computers, and this set must also be identified for quantum computers.  Some existing systems, such as lattice-based cryptosystems, have not been sufficiently studied.  Other questions include the security of zero-knowledge proofs and pseudo-random number generators against quantum attacks.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Understanding which problems quantum computers can solve faster than classical computers is a fundamental problem. It is known that quantum computers can break widely used cryptosystems, including those used for e-commerce transactions, but finding new useful applications is a challenging and important task. It is equally important to determine which cryptosystems quantum computers cannot break. This is important since today's encrypted information should remain secure even after quantum computers have been built. This project addressed these two issues.    The first part of this project focused on finding new problems that have exponentially faster algorithms on quantum computers than on classical computers.  We found quantum algorithms for computing ray class groups and Hilbert class fields in number fields.  We found quantum algorithms for computing the unit group in arbitrary degree function fields and made progress on the arbitrary degree number field case.  Number fields and function fields have different applications including applications to cryptography.   The second part of this project studied when a classical cryptographic protocol can remain secure in the presence of quantum attackers. This requires understanding the limitations of quantum computers.  Modern cryptography relies on the assumption that certain problems cannot be solved on classical computers, and this set of problems must also be identified for quantum computers.  In addition, the security of cryptographic protocols relies on proofs that depend on the model of computation.  These security proofs must be analyzed when attackers can be quantum computers.  We showed that secure function evaluation is possible with classical protocols even when the adversary has a quantum computer.   A final outcome of this project is in the area of Hamiltonian complexity.  A question from physics involves understanding physical systems described by their Hamiltonians.  The physical layout of the system and the dimensionality of the particles determine how hard the properties of the system are to compute.  We showed that when the system has a simple layout on a line with nearest neighbor interactions and eight dimensional particles, the basic computational problems are still very difficult to compute.   Two Ph.D. students and two REU students were trained on this grant.            Last Modified: 12/23/2014       Submitted by: Sean J Hallgren]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
