<AbstractNarration>In this project the PI will study how the primate retina processes and encodes visual images. The retina is an extraordinarily sophisticated optical image detector, converting a light image into a set of electrical signals, filtering these signals both spatially and temporally, and sending the output up the optic nerve to the brain. The output signals consist of multiple trains of electrical spikes organized in an exquisite and complex way, with more than 20 separate parallel pathways carrying visual information from the retina to the brain. In pilot experiments, a number of previously unknown, or poorly known, functional types of retinal neurons have been uncovered and in this research project the PI will answer the following questions: What roles do these cell types play in retinal processing? How do these neurons respond to different kinds of visual images? What information about the outside visual world do these cells communicate to the brain, and how is this information encoded? To answer these questions, a movie will be focused on the retinal input neurons (the rod and cone photoreceptors) and the electrical spikes generated by the retinal output neurons (including the new and poorly-known cell types) will be imaged and recorded by a dense two-dimensional array of over 500 microscopic electrodes. The output signals will then be correlated in space and time among themselves and with the input visual images to probe the neural code at the retina/brain interface. This research project will aid the development of future retinal prosthetic devices that are intended to restore some visual function in blind human patients with retinas damaged by photoreceptor disease. The project will also provide interdisciplinary research opportunities for undergraduate students, graduate students in both physics and biology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Intellectual Merit  The eye is a remarkable biological webcam that streams signals  conveying data about the outside visual world, in real time, not to your  computer but to your brain. The cornea and lens of the eye focus visual  images on the input neurons (the photoreceptors) of a thin neural  tissue (the retina) that lines the back of the eye. The retina's output  neurons (the retinal ganglion cells) transmit digital-like electrical  signals to specific regions of the brain through a multi-fiber cable  (the optic nerve).  The main goal of our project was to understand the functional  organization of the retina. We would like to know how the retina  processes dynamic visual images and we would like to decipher the secret  code that the retina uses to send information about the visual world to  the brain.  To reverse engineer the retina we performed experiments as illustrated in the figure. Live retinal tissue is placed, ganglion cell layer down, on a glass substrate fabricated with a large-scale, two-dimensional array of more than 500 closely-spaced microscopic electrodes. This system is able to simultaneously record, and electrically image, the signals from hundreds of individual ganglion cells.  A movie, consisting of dynamic visual stimuli, is focused on the photoreceptors. In response, the retinal neural network processes these input stimuli and produces an output consisting of a pattern of electrical signals. This electrical pattern is detected by the electrode array. To determine the functional response properties of the retinal ganglion cells, the output electrical signals of each cell are correlated with the visual input.  With these experimental methods, in collaboration with neurobiologists (particularly Prof. E. J. Chichilnisky, now at Stanford University), we have studied many aspects of the functional organization of the mammalian retina. Of particular note, we have investigated how the retina processes colored images by measuring the output signals of a large population of ganglion cells as the  color-sensitive photoreceptors - the cones - are presented with a fine-grained set of colored visual stimuli.  In summary, we have pioneered, developed and applied novel technology and methods to record and image neural electrical activity of a neural system (the retina) on a large-scale, in fine spatial, temporal and chromatic detail. Our work has been cited as one of the advances in the last decade that has made it possible to record neural activity in a large population of neurons. Broader Impact Development of Human Resources This project was truly interdisciplinary, at the interface of physics and neurobiology, whereby we applied techniques and expertise developed in the context of high energy physics experiments (including the search for the Higgs Boson) to the study of neural systems. We were thus able to open new opportunities for biology and physics students and young researchers to work together, and to learn from one another, at the physics/neurobiology frontier. Thus, to give one example, all of our former postdoctoral scholars have obtained faculty or research positions undertaking research at the physics/neurobiology interface. Biomedical Applications   In addition  to systems that can record the neural activity of a large population of  neurons, we have also developed novel systems that can electrically  stimulate a neural network (such as the retina), in a general  spatiotemporal pattern, and can simultaneously record the response of  the network. We have applied these systems, in collaboration with Prof. Chichilnisky, to carry out  electrophysiological studies to guide the design of retinal prosthetic  devices - devices intended to restore visual function in blind human  patients with retinas damaged by disease (such as retinitis pigmentosa)  that lead to photoreceptor degeneration.
