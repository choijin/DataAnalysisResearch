<AbstractNarration>Although digitization of health information and IT applications in health care have received significant focus in recent years (mainly from government officials interested in improving care while achieving more cost efficiencies), the concerns of patients and their needs, as they relate to information access, have not received a similar level of attention. There is a gap in expectation with regard to the role of health information systems between the general public, who are increasingly becoming more computer- and Web savvy, and health IT professionals. A deeper consideration of the gap is expected to help clarify the challenges and point to potential means for developing effective information systems that deliver health information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main goal of this national workshop is to focus on key challenges involved in delivering high quality digital health information directly to citizens and health care providers. The challenges cover many areas encompassing access, interpretation, decision-making, security/privacy, evaluation, and economic issues. A goal of the workshop is to create a forum where multi-disciplinary perspectives are supported to develop a scope for research in this area, identify critical research topics, and establish associated knowledge resources that may be helpful.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
