<AbstractNarration>This project represents a continuation of Professor Krische's efforts toward the development of phosphine catalyzed C-C and C-N bond forming processes. Prior to studies from Professor Krische's group, Morita-Baylis-Hillman type couplings were largely restricted to the use of aldehydes and aldimines as electrophilic partners. The Krische group has expanded the range of electrophilic partners applicable to MBH-type coupling to encompass enones, allylic acetates and arenes. In the proposed funding period, enantioselective variants of these transformations will be devised and other phosphine catalyzed processes will be developed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Professor Michael J. Krische at the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of Texas at Austin.  Professor Krische's research program focuses on catalytic reaction development, in particular on byproduct-free processes for C-C and C-N bond formation.  The successful development of the proposed methodologies will have a large positive impact on synthetic organic chemistry in the pharmaceutical and agrochemical industries.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
