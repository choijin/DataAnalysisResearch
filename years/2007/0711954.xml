    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be used to fabricate, measure, and test a novel micro-lens array and optical design for use in a new type of ultra high-definition (UHD) head mounted virtual reality display (HMD). The proposed research builds on large screen (UHD) projection technology that uses a rapidly scanned micro-display to produce images possessing much more resolution than the micro-display itself. It accomplishes this by illuminating different sub regions of each pixel during each scan, producing an image made up of the sub regions instead of the pixels. At present, custom-made micro-displays with lens arrays embedded in the front glass, very close to the pixels, are needed to focus light into the tiny pixel sub regions. This proposed research tasks will include the fabrication, measurement, and testing of a novel type of lens array than can produce arrays of sub-pixel sized illumination spots at distances of several tens of mm from itself, through the use of light wave interference. It is anticipated that this type of lens array can be mounted remotely from off the shelf micro-displays, thus eliminating the need for custom micro-displays and allowing wide implementation UHD technique at lower cost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outcome of the proposed research should lead to the development of HMDs aimed at high-end work station markets. Application areas which are obvious include scientific visualization, including biotechnology research, genetic engineering, and fluid flow dynamics, and simulation and training. Currently, the needs of the simulation market are met by large, expensive dome and out the window simulators. Small HMDs should also have an impact on this market which includes applications for driving, flying, and ship piloting training for military and civilian markets</AbstractNarration>
