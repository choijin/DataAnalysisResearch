<AbstractNarration>This project makes a fundamental contribution to the field of direct brain interfaces (DBI) by introducing new paradigms for continuous control interfaces for human-computer interaction. One of the most effective direct brain interfaces is an evoked-response method based on Steady State Visual Evoked Potentials (SSVEP), with relatively high information rates, accuracy averaging over 95%, and no training required. Control in of SSVEP-based systems is implemented in a simple discrete selection paradigm, such as choosing from a set of icons. Discrete selection techniques work well for applications such as spelling or choosing a channel on a television. Unfortunately, they do not work well for continuous tasks such as drawing, moving a cursor on a screen, or driving a wheelchair. This project will explore, develop, and validate an SSVEP-based direct brain interface to provide a continuous channel of control for people with severe physical disabilities. The objectives are: 1) to create and evaluate SSVEP-based DBI paradigms for continuous control; and 2) to validate the control methods by applying the new continuous control interface to a wheelchair navigation task.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Methods for continuous SSVEP-based DBI control signals have broad applications for commercial, military and assistive technologies that go beyond users with motor impairment. Such developments could be applied as enhancements or replacements for traditional interfaces in places where the environment itself impairs the user?s control abilities, such as a fighter pilot?s cockpit, an astronaut?s space suit or a deep-sea diver?s helmet; or where the user is required to dedicate their physical resources elsewhere, such as a doctor performing surgery. Mainstream users, particularly the elderly, may benefit from a hands-free interface, and continuous neural control could provide an added dimension to more common interactions such as gaming.</AbstractNarration>
