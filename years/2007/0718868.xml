    <AbstractNarration>In plant and animal cells, the genetic code (DNA) resides protected in the nucleus, an internal compartment of the cell. Genes are expressed when messenger RNAs (mRNA) are copied or transcribed off the DNA code. The mRNAs then leave the nucleus to be translated into proteins at protein factories called ribosomes. On the way, these messages undergo a considerable amount of processing, in which internal sequences are edited out in a process called splicing and the ends of the message become chemically modified. This international conference is intended to be a forum for discussion of the latest research in the field. This conference is notable because the majority of talks are selected from openly submitted abstracts giving ample opportunity for broad and diverse representation of junior scientists including graduate students to present their latest research. National Science Foundation funding will primarily be used to support junior scientists and members of under-represented constituencies within the field who would otherwise not be able to attend.</AbstractNarration>
