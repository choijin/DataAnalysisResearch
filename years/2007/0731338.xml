<AbstractNarration>COSEE Pacific Partnerships is a regional collaboration among members of the Western Association of Marine Laboratories, Pacific community colleges, and informal science education institutions. The primary goal of the collaboration is to integrate marine research and education for audiences that traditionally have had limited access to an understanding of the ocean. The project will develop five partnerships based at marine labs (the University of Oregon's Institute of Marine Biology, Oregon State University's Hatfield Marine Science Center, Humboldt State University Marine Laboratory, California, the Kewalo Marine Laboratory, University of Hawaii and Western Washington University's Shannon Point Marine Center). Each marine lab will partner with one or more community colleges and informal science education institutions to undertake a series of actions to promote ocean education. The COSEE partnerships will develop a number of model activities that increase educational and professional development opportunities for community college faculty, which in turn will improve the ocean literacy and career potentials of community college students. These activities include opportunities for faculty to conduct research and outreach at marine labs, courses designed to increase opportunities for ocean literacy at community colleges, and internships and career information for community college students. The partnerships will expand the role of marine-lab scientists in education and outreach by providing workshops that show scientists how to communicate their research results to a general audience effectively. COSEE Pacific Partnerships will develop multilevel educational and professional development opportunities in ocean literacy for informal science education professionals and volunteers by working with marine lab scientists, Sea Grant personnel, and community college faculty. These opportunities will include formal certificate-based programs for informal science education professionals and a Master Coastal Naturalist program for informal science education volunteers and staff.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The programs and activities of the Center for Ocean Science Education Excellence (COSEE) &ndash; Pacific Partnerships increased the understanding of ocean science by community college faculty and students, and the general public, and allowed graduate students and faculty at six Pacific marine laboratories to improve their ability to communicate their science effectively.  Graduate students and faculty at the marine laboratories were provided a number of opportunities to increase their abilities to engage in effective broader impacts of their research and undertake outreach activities to the target audiences.  Several opportunities were provided to accomplish this; they included:  1. Involvement with eight week-long workshops held at Pacific marine laboratories and attended by a national audience of community college faculty that focused on improving the teaching of ocean science at community colleges, focusing on developing active learning curriculum for their students.  2. Acting as mentors for eight-one community college students, a population that traditionally has little access to undergraduate research experiences, who participated in term-long research projects in the mentor?s laboratory.  3. Participation in Communicating Ocean Science (COS) and the Communicating Ocean Science for Informal Audiences (COSIA) workshops.  4. Participation in the development and implementation of the coastal ecoregion of the Oregon Master Naturalist program, designed for the general public interested in learning about the coastal and ocean region.  5. Individual assistance, provided by COSEE-Pacific Partnerships PIs and project coordinator, with developing broader impact activities associated with their research.  Additional opportunities to increase the understanding of ocean sciences by community college faculty occured with their participation in national geoscience annual meetings sponsored by the American Geophysical Union, the Oceanography Society and the Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography.  Competitive applications for four meetings selected a total of  100 community college faculty for this activity.  At each of the meetings COSEE &ndash; Pacific Partnerships provided a workshop on a topic of relevance to the community college participants and sponsored a meeting session suitable for community college presentations.
