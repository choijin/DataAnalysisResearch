<AbstractNarration>This award from the Division of Chemistry (CHE) supports the renewal of a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at Columbia University for the summers of 2008-2010.  The program will be directed by James Valentini with assistance from Virginia Cornish and Ruben Gonzalez, faculty members in the Department of Chemistry at Columbia.  This REU site will bring eight NSF funded students to campus for a ten-week period each summer to conduct cutting edge research in chemistry.  An additional eight REU students will be supported with institutional funds.  Junior, sophomore, and highly qualified freshman undergraduate students will be recruited from across the nation. One of the special advantages that this program can offer to the REU undergraduate research students is the opportunity to participate in research that extends beyond the faculty and resources of the Chemistry Department. Columbia has a Nanoscale Science and Engineering Center and a Materials Research Science and Engineering Center, each of which brings together faculty from the Chemistry Department and faculty in Physics and in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. Many faculty in the Chemistry Department are principal investigators in the Centers and the REU students in this program will have the opportunity to choose projects that are part of the Centers research efforts. Chemistry REU students can also choose to work with non-Chemistry faculty in the Centers or work in the labs of faculty in the Biological Sciences Department who have extensive collaborations with members of the Chemistry Department. These many interdisciplinary efforts span the frontiers of chemistry research and provide Columbia's REU students unique opportunities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes Report  The Columbia University Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program in the Chemistry Department has offered undergraduate students the opportunity to take part in all the activities of a practicing research scientist.  Our aim was to develop enthusiasm for scientific research and teach the skills necessary to channel the enthusiasm effectively and productively.  The twenty-nine students that participated in our program over three years developed original research plans in close collaboration with a Columbia mentor, carried out those plans in the laboratory of our faculty sponsors, and presented the results of their research in a written report and during our summer research symposium.  The students were involved with projects throughout the entire department encompassing organic, inorganic, physical and theoretical chemistry.  A selection of project titles includes:  Derivatized amino acid synthesis for misacylation of tRNA molecules The function of ribosomal protein L11 C-terminal domain in the GTPase center Investigating collagen network structure as a function of temperature and concentration via confocal microscopy Self-assembling phthalimide thiol onto gold surfaces for the production of carbohydrate sensors Synthesis of pyridoxamine PAMAM dendrimers for transamination reactions Temperature dependence of cytochrome P450 BM-3 activity Single-molecule Conductance of Diaminostilbenes  Progress Towards the Total Synthesis of Isocyclocitrinol a: Efforts Towards Development of a Diastereoselective Cyclocarbonylation Reaction  Synthesis, Characterization, and Nonlinear Optical Studies of Silica-Coated Ag/Au Alloy Nanospheres Novel Zn-Porphyrin Tweezer as a Circular Dichroism Sensitive Reporter of Amino Alcohol Chirality   Participants gained experience in collaborative work and cooperative learning in the lab and also in seminars.
