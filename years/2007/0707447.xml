<AbstractNarration>Dr. John J Cowan of the University of Oklahoma-Norman Campus, will continue his research on the formation, age and evolution of the heavy elements - specifically those formed in the slow and rapid neutron-capture processes in the oldest stars in our Galaxy.  The detection by Dr. Cowan and his collaborators of the long-lived radioactive element thorium in several, and recently uranium in one, Galactic halo stars has provided a perhaps unique opportunity to directly determine the ages of the oldest stars.  Dr. Cowan will also introduce a chronometer pair, Th/Hf, to make age determinations for the oldest stars in the Galaxy.  These studies, independent of cosmological models and parameters and chemical evolution models, will result in more accurate age estimates for the oldest stars than previously possible and will help to answer the fundamental questions of just how old are the Galaxy and the Universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the proposed research activity involve several areas.  The NSF-supported research is incorporated directly into the course curriculum of Dr. Cowan's regularly taught introductory astronomy course for non-science majors.  Both graduate and undergraduate students are involved in the research activities of Dr. Cowan, including female students who are being trained and mentored by Dr, Cowan.  As part of public outreach, Dr. Cowan also regularly gives public lectures on astronomy to the general public.</AbstractNarration>
