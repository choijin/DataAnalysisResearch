<AbstractNarration>Degradation by marine bacteria of the organic carbon dissolved in coastal seawater is a major process in the ocean carbon cycle. However, the details of this important process seem hopelessly complex.  The thousands of distinct compounds that make up this dissolved organic carbon (DOC) pool and the thousands of bacterial species that participate in its metabolism are largely unknown to science, and this greatly impedes efforts to understand the fate of carbon in coastal oceans. In turn, this hinders development of predictive models of carbon cycling in a changing ocean.  Overcoming this impediment requires an environmental functional genomics approach.  This project will use gene expression patterns in bacterial communities at the Sapelo Island, GA LTER site to identify the components of terrestrial- and marine-derived organic matter that are assimilated and metabolized in the coastal ocean. By sequencing expressed genes directly from seawater at times when ecosystem inputs are the most distinct, the patterns of DOC supply and flux will be discerned. Expression studies of model bacterial strains cultured from coastal communities will be used to identify the biochemical pathways for metabolism of individual carbon compounds and determine the compounds that are preferentially transported and metabolized from the marine DOC pool. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sapelo Island Microbial Observatory project will improve understanding of the role of land-margin ecosystems in the global carbon cycle, addressing how cellular-level activities mediated by bacteria affect major biogeochemical processes. It will provide opportunities for interdisciplinary training in microbial biogeochemistry and ecological genomics to students and postdoctoral associates, and will sponsor a research experience in microbial biology for promising high school biology students, broadening the participation of underrepresented groups in science. This project will develop novel informatics approaches for microbial ecologists that couple molecular sequence data with environmental context information, and will openly share databases and bioinformatics tools with the scientific community.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The microorganisms that inhabit the ocean make up a vast community that is not easily seen but whose activities drive all major elemental cycles of the planet. Our National Science Foundation project focused on microbial activities related to the marine carbon cycle. The research site was located in coastal Georgia, where we examined the organisms responsible for changing the form of carbon dissolved in seawater. By applying new genomics techniques directly to microbial communities, essentially skipping the requirement of having cultures of each organism growing in our laboratories, we were able to determine the genes harbored by individual microbial species and resolve when those genes were expressed. We found that a typical marine bacterial cell in coastal seawater can adapt its gene expression over time frames of just a few minutes in response to shifting environmental conditions. Some microbes responded most strongly to temperature, and species whose carbon cycle activities peaked during both colder and warmer temperatures were identified. Other coastal microbes had strong day-night patterns in their activities that were linked to solar radiation levels. High school students were able to learn more about the ocean and its microbial inhabitants through field trips to the University of Georgia Marine Institute on Sapelo Island, GA, and through summer research internships in our laboratories. Better information about microbial genomes and gene expression in the ocean is improving our understanding of the ocean carbon cycle in the face of changing climate and increasing human perturbations.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/03/2014<br>      Modified by: Mary Ann&nbsp;Moran</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2014/0702125/0702125_10022835_1412333803071_MicrobiologyatSapelo3--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2014/0702125/0702125_10022835_1412333803071_MicrobiologyatSapelo3--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Exploring Sapelo Island"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2014/0702125/0702125_10022835_1412333803071_MicrobiologyatSapelo3--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Exploring Sapelo Island"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">High school students participated in a weekend field trip to learn about microbes of the ocean in April, 2014.
