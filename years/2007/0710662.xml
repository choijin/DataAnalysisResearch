<AbstractNarration>This integrated program between the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) and the Technical University of Einthoven (TU/e) aims to establish predictive models of flow-induced changes in polymer crystallization kinetics and morphology.  Polymers are essential players in the ongoing materials revolution.  Semicrystalline polymers comprise over two-thirds of the annual production of all synthetic polymers and are in the midst of a renaissance, as recently developed metallocene catalysts allow new combinations of final properties through finer control of the molecular structure.  Unfortunately, new synthetic capabilities take many years to deliver new products: extensive trial and error is required because structure-processing-property relations remain poorly understood. Processing alters the rate, form and anisotropy of crystallization:  it can accelerate crystallization by orders of magnitude, and it has a profound effect on material properties, such as mechanical strength and gas permeability.  This collaborative project will provide principles and computational models that are needed to enable design of macromolecules with processing dynamics in mind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research at Caltech has revealed early events in flow-induced crystallization and their origin in the dynamics of the melt. Flow can open a kinetic pathway to nucleation, such that the rate of nucleation tracks the rate of molecular motion in the melt.&lt;br/&gt;Oriented precursors formed during flow template subsequent oriented growth; the distance between the precursors governs the time for completion of the oriented structure.&lt;br/&gt;To translate these new experimental findings into design tools that can be put into practice, corresponding advances in theory and modeling are needed. Therefore, this collaborative program links Caltech's experimental capabilities with what is widely regarded as the world's leading team in modeling polymer processing: the Eindhoven group led by Han Meijer.  Their powerful capabilities to model structure development during processing will be extended to connect molecular specifications of the polymer with the kinetic parameters that describe the formation of crystallization precursors and the growth of crystallites on them.  In turn, the expanded model will predict trends as a function of molecular parameters, which will be tested experimentally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Integrated modeling and experiment will elucidate the fundamental mechanism by which processing affects polymer structure development as a function of resin molecular characteristics and the imposed flow and thermal history.  Technologically, models that incorporate fundamental knowledge of the molecular processes involved in flow-induced crystallization could revolutionize design of semicrystalline polymers and optimization of polymer processing. The Materials World Network award enables this coherent program of simulation and experiment, which will provide a new generation of design tools that will accelerate new product development in polyolefins the largest segment of the thermoplastics industry, consumed at a rate of over 70 million metric tons per year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is co-funded by the Division of Materials Research and the Office of International Science and Engineering&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project is an international collaboration between the United States and the Netherlands sponsored by the Materials World Network program of the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF).  A special feature of this research is that it brought together scientists from different countries to solve major scientific problems together.  The unusual mixture of perspectives led to creative and unanticipated outcomes.  A hybrid theory (Figure 1), which emerged over years of exchange between the Dutch and American research groups, opens new opportunities for designing polymers that can be processed at high rates to create products with superior properties at lower cost.  And a significant invention resulted from frustrations that prevented the scientists from preparing ideal materials for their experiments.  In the process of overcoming an obstacle to their fundamental research, the team made a discovery (Figure 2) that may have tremendous practical applications and is the subject of a pending patent (Figure 3).      Perhaps the most important outcomes of this project are seen in the people who were transformed by their contact with one another.  The graduate students are young scientists who became deeply involved in doing science together in an international collaboration.  They developed into mature, skilled scientists who are prepared to become leaders in science and technology.  Members of the research team also actively engaged in service activities for the general public.  In connection with this research project, the outreach activities included public events that brought together scientists and artists (Figure 4), as well as hands-on activities for school children that are affected by autism (Figure 5).  These very different activities are rooted in the nature of the materials and the molecules that are at the heart of the research.     The materials of interest are polymers&mdash;specifically, polyolefins.  Chemically, these are very large molecules built from very simple (and inexpensive) building blocks.  In terms of familiar materials, these polymers are the stuff of plastic bags, milk jugs, car bumpers and hip replacements.  Their diverse properties arise from the way the long, flexible molecules crystallize with one another.  Even though this class of materials is very widely used&mdash;each year more than 111,000,000 tons of polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP) are used worldwide&mdash;there are many unsolved mysteries about the way they solidify during processing.  The goal of this research was to improve the ability to predict and control the processing behavior and material properties of polyolefins.  To achieve that goal, the Materials World Network (MWN) brought together some of the worldÆs best researchers in computational modeling of polymer processing with an outstanding team of experimentalists who had made important discoveries about the molecular processes that occur during processing.  The modelers from the Netherlands and the experimentalists from the United States worked together by travelling to each otherÆs labs, meeting at international conferences and using the internet.  Extensive contact allowed them to sort out differences in perspective and settle points of disagreement.  The process moved researchers out of previously held positions and opened the way to a new model that accounts for many previously unexplained phenomena.  More details on the model can be found in the final report for the grant; here, the "take home lesson" is that bringing together people with different expertise and perspectives led to discoveries that isolated scientists were unlikely to make.  Thus, the unique features of the NSF-MWN program significantly enhanced scientific progress.          Last Modified: 09/04/2012       Submitted by: Julia A Kornfield]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
