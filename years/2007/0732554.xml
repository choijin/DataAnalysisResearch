<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a research cruise to perform geologic studies in the area under and surrounding the former Larsen B ice shelf, on the Antarctic Peninsula. The ice shelf's disintegration in 2002 coupled with the unique marine geology of the area make it possible to understand the conditions leading to ice shelf collapse. Bellwethers of climate change that reflect both oceanographic and atmospheric conditions, ice shelves also hold back glacial flow in key areas of the polar regions. Their collapse results in glacial surging and could cause rapid rise in global sea levels. This project characterizes the Larsen ice shelf's history and conditions leading to its collapse by determining: 1) the size of the Larsen B during warmer climates and higher sea levels back to the Eemian interglacial, 125,000 years ago; 2) the configuration of the Antarctic Peninsula ice sheet during the LGM and its subsequent retreat; 3) the causes of the Larsen B's stability through the Holocene, during which other shelves have come and gone; 4) the controls on the dynamics of ice shelf margins, especially the roles of surface melting and oceanic processes, and 5) the changes in sediment flux, both biogenic and lithogenic, after large ice shelf breakup. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts include graduate and undergraduate education through research projects and workshops; outreach to the general public through a television documentary and websites, and international collaboration with scientists from Belgium, Spain, Argentina, Canada, Germany and the UK. The work also has important societal relevance. Improving our understanding of how ice shelves behave in a warming world will improve models of sea level rise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is supported under NSF's International Polar Year (IPY) research emphasis area on "Understanding Environmental Change in Polar Regions".&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project focused on the use of microfossil (foraminifera) assemblage and stable isotopic analyses on sediments and sediment cores from the western and eastern margins of the Antarctic Peninsula and has resulted in the following outcomes:  Over 1000 samples were processed and analyzed to identify foraminifera.  Close to 900 samples have been processed and analyzed for foraminiferal geochemistry (stable isotopes).  Results of these analyses show significant changes during the past 10,000-12,000 years in the foraminifera assemblage and stable isotopes.  Interpretation of these changes indicates that warm water masses have played a major role in changing the ice conditions along the Antarctic Peninsula.  The foraminiferal records from Barilari Bay, in the southern region of the Antarctic Peninsula, in combination with analyses of sediments and other microfossils indicate changing oceanographic conditions coincident with the Mid-Holocene Climatic Optimum and Little Ice Age, a climate event that has been elusive in the southern hemisphere. There is a major contrast between the western and eastern margins of the Antarctic Peninsula with the eastern margin showing no evidence in the foraminiferal records of ocean warming, therefore suggesting the changing ice conditions on that margin are more closely related to atmospheric warming.   This project included 3 major oceanographic cruises; two sponsored by the NSF aboard the R/V Nathaniel B. Palmer and one in collaboration with the Korean Polar Research Institute (Republic of Korea) aboard their new icebreaker the R/V Araon.  Participating on these cruises were graduate students from Southern Illinois University Carbondale.  This provided them with hands-on experience in the planning and execution of research cruises to the Antarctic.  Samples and data collected on the cruise were used to produce MS theses for two of the graduate students with the third student using samples and date towards her PhD dissertation.  This project has also supported 4 undergraduate students as laboratory technicians and undergraduate research assistants allowing them to gain experience in laboratory methods and research.  The project was included in a REU workshop on Antarctic marine sediments hosted by Hamilton College that included domestic and international undergraduate students.  This workshop provided the students with the opportunity to work with Antarctic sediments and the different microfossils groups contained within them to gain a better understanding of the scientific method, from collection and interpretation of data to presentation of results.  The results of this project have been presented at regional, national and international meetings and contributed to peer reviewed publications. Results were also incorporated into the content of the SIUC "Imagining Geographies: Antarctica"  program that blended the sciences, liberal arts and fine arts from the university and community organizations into an educational program that emphasized the teleconnections of global, regional and local conditions.  This program included classroom discussions, public displays, and presentations, K-12 teacher workshops, and panel discussions.  Other broader impacts include presentation of research related activities and results to local school and civic groups.
