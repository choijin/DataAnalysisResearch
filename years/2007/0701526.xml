<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION:&lt;br/&gt;Optical fibers have become a critical component for many applications, from optical communications and the internet to intelligent sensing, manufacturing and medical, and suggesting an even broader field of new applications. Most of the fibers presently used are made of silica glass but some of its properties are not sufficient for these new applications. In response to this need, researchers at Lehigh University are developing new fibers, made of (tellurite) glasses with enhanced optical properties and with new internal structures further enhancing these properties. This project will not only contribute to the development of these new fibers but also provide valuable scientific information on the transformation of these glasses when undergoing the fiber manufacturing process, and on its relationship to their final optical properties. For this reason, we are partnering with a small but very successful company, which is very interested in expanding the type of fibers they are already manufacturing. This being a highly multidisciplinary and fast-evolving technological field, the students involved in the project will be exposed to a broad scope of technical issues of very current interest. In addition to training graduate students, this project will offer short term research opportunities to promote interest in science and engineering in under-represented student groups at the undergraduate level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION:&lt;br/&gt;Many of today's communication and intelligent sensing applications combine electronics with photonics. However, there is now growing interest in applications that would be "all-optical", eliminating as much as possible the need for electronics. For this to become a reality, it is first necessary to develop new glasses and fibers with enhanced nonlinear optical properties. The researchers in this project are developing new soft glass fibers with such properties, in particular using modified tellurite glasses. In addition, these fibers are being designed and manufactured to have special microstructures that enhance their waveguiding and nonlinear optical properties. An original and versatile way to "preform" the glass in order to manufacture these microstructures is through the use of an extrusion technique. The originality of this project is to combine three different research areas into a coherent program of study: glass science, a study of the effect of forming or the manufacturing process on the structure and properties of the glasses and, finally, a study of the resulting wave-guiding and optical properties of the fiberized glass.  The vertically-integrated nature of the project has attracted the attention of a small but very successful fiber company with which we are partnering for the development of these and other fibers. As described, this project exposes students at both the undergraduate and graduate levels to a variety of topics, and brings them to understand and appreciate the interrelationships between these different topics and areas of study as well as their relevance to all-optical applications. It also trains them in the use of a corresponding variety of cutting-edge research tools.</AbstractNarration>

Present day optical communications are based on silica fibers, which transmit light in a certain range of wavelengths (0.4 to ~2 microns). Other potential and very desirable applications are not possible with these silica fibers because they require longer wavelength, into the mid-infrared (2-6 microns). The present research project addresses this need by developing new glasses and fibers that can transmit light in this longer wavelength range. The new applications that can be made possibe by these new fibers are multiple and in a variety of different fields, the environment, metrology, medical, security and military. Developing such fibers requires both basic science in the field of glasses and a detailed understanding and conrol of the processing of these glasses and their forming into fibers. Ultimately, their properties depend jointly and intimately on both the composition and properties of  glasses and on their processing and forming.  A malor outcome of this project has been to characterize the relation between the composition and properties of tellurite glasses and the properties of the corresponding fibers, or the impact of processing and forming of these glasses on the optical properties of the fabricated fibers.  This project has focused on tellurite glasses because they are both very stable chemically and mechanically (being oxide glasses like silica) and because of their unique optical properties which can enable many of the applications mentioned above.  To achieve its goals, the project has relied on  fundamental materials studies of tellurite glasses, engineering studies of processing and forming of these glasses into fibers and physics/optics studies of the fabricated fibers.  We have produced tellurite fibers with optical transmission losses as good as or better than comparable fibers developed by other groups.  And we have demonstrated in these fibers linear and nonlinear optical effects of interest  for a variety of applications (fiber lasers, fiber amplifiers and fiber wavelength converters)  Of greatest importance for the future development of such fibers and their applications,  we have identified the materials and processing/forming parameters that critically determine the properties and performance of tellurite fibers (such as optical transmission loss, chromatic dispersion and optical coefficients)  The results of this work were published in 24 journal articles and presented at 15 conferences.  On the human side, this project has allowed us to train5 graduate students (PhD), 3 Masters graduate students, 2 postdoctoral research associates and given 16 female undergraduate students  summer research opportuniies.
