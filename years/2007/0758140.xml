<AbstractNarration>The Born-Oppenheimer (BO) approximation and its extension, the Born-Huang&lt;br/&gt;expansion, is at the core of molecular physics but only in the past two decades has the&lt;br/&gt;full richness of the underlying theory been explored. From the traditional perspective,&lt;br/&gt;molecular forces are expressed in terms of a mean scalar field generated by the&lt;br/&gt;collective behavior of the fast degrees of freedom (i.e. electrons).&lt;br/&gt;This mean field, the Born-Oppenheimer potential, acts upon the slow degrees of&lt;br/&gt;freedom (vibronic coordinates) and it determines the vibrational structure of molecules&lt;br/&gt;and the collision properties of atoms. The modern expression of the BO theory, and its&lt;br/&gt;multichannel extension, allows for the presence of effective vector, gauge, potentials.&lt;br/&gt;These potentials can generate velocity dependent forces, as if from an effective&lt;br/&gt;magnetic field, acting upon the slow degrees of freedom. M. V. Berry coined the term&lt;br/&gt;geometric magnetism to describe the latter. They can also lead to the appearance of&lt;br/&gt;geometric phases.&lt;br/&gt;In this research, a Rydberg electron in orbit around a complex core is considered for&lt;br/&gt;investigation of the non-Abelian geometric phase in atomic systems. If the core has&lt;br/&gt;non-vanishing angular momentum the Rydberg electron experiences an effective,&lt;br/&gt;non-Abelian, gauge potential. The potential has magnetic monopole-like structure and&lt;br/&gt;there are interesting analogues with phenomena familiar in particle theory. An effective&lt;br/&gt;spin-orbit interaction is derived and is related to the screened charge of the monopole.&lt;br/&gt;The effect of that interaction on the level structure will be calculated and compared with&lt;br/&gt;experimental measurements. Rydberg atoms can also be manipulated to form coherent&lt;br/&gt;wave packets, so called designer atoms, and a study of numerical wavepackets&lt;br/&gt;in the field of the monopole is proposed. This work will advance the fundamental&lt;br/&gt;understanding of Rydberg systems that have possible applications to quantum&lt;br/&gt;information and computing.&lt;br/&gt;In addition to Rydberg systems, similar gauge structures arise when describing the&lt;br/&gt;collision of atoms. In the scattering problem, serious difficulties in application of the&lt;br/&gt;Born-Huang method arise. The mathematical framework of gauge theory promises to&lt;br/&gt;shed new light on some of these long standing difficulties. There is lots of interest,&lt;br/&gt;generated by advances in the laboratory realization of cold molecules, to develop&lt;br/&gt;advanced capabilities for tests of parity violation and the variation of fundamental&lt;br/&gt;constants. Full understanding of molecular dynamics is required in order to account for&lt;br/&gt;all systemic effects, including those of induced vector potentials, that might influence&lt;br/&gt;high precision measurements.</AbstractNarration>
