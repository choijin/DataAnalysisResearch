<AbstractNarration>The project is focused on research related through molecular concavity.  Specifically, how highly concave molecules can: 1) potentially act as supramolecular protection groups;  2) function as selective catalysts; 3) assemble into water-soluble nano-capsules capable of trapping, storing, and separating hydrocarbon gases; and  4) assemble into nano-capsules capable of controlling photochemical reactions carried out within their interiors, will be studied.  The focus of the first two subprograms is on hosts soluble in organic media.  The molecules in question are some of the largest and most preorganized ones in the literature.  Consequently, a wide range of molecules can be trapped within their concave binding sites.  The second two subprograms rely on water-soluble hosts and the hydrophobic effect to drive their assembly into supramolecular capsules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Professor Bruce Gibb, of the Department of Chemistry at University of New Orleans.  Professor Bruce Gibb and his research group will examine how molecules of highly complex structure can augment important chemical processes or circumnavigate contemporary chemical problems.  His research could make chemical synthesis more efficient and more environmentally friendly by allowing reactions that normally require chemical solvents to be carried out in water.  In addition, it could also provide a new approach to separate hydrocarbon gases.  The latter is important as oil reserves are depleted and hence hydrocarbon gas reserves become more important to the economic wellbeing of the country.</AbstractNarration>
