<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT (Chadwick/Nooner)&lt;br/&gt;OCE-0725605/0726093&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:  This research will continue measurements of long term volcanic inflation of the seafloor at Axial Seamount on the Juan de Fuca Ridge using an innovative new pressure sensor/benchmarking method.  Present data show Axial Volcano has been re-inflating since its 1998 eruption.  The center of Axial caldera has been uplifted 2.4 m since then. At the current rate of inflation, it is estimated that in another 4-8 years Axial will be fully inflated and ready to erupt again. Axial volcano is the only underwater volcano in the world where inflation and deflation is being measured, where the magma supply rate can be quantified, and where an entire volcanic cycle can be documented.  Data from the project will be able to be used to constrain the depth of magma movements beneath the caldera, show how the magma supply rate changes over time, and help determine whether or not eruptions can be forecast.  Measurements of the volcano will be made in 2009 and 2011 at an array of seafloor benchmarks inside and outside the caldera using a remotely operated vehicle. The measurements follow a NOAA funded survey in the summer of 2007 and will provide inflation data every two years until 2011. Data will then be compared to other volcanic regions and used to optimize crustal deformation models.  Goals will be to determine whether the inflation rate follows an exponential decay that is governed by the pressure gradient between a deep source that supplies magma to the shallow reservoir beneath the caldera.  It will also seek to determine if magma delivery is focused, supplied at a higher rate, and stored in a deeper and larger reservoirs than at normal mid-ocean ridge segments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  Broader impacts of the work include support of an early career scientist, and support for public outreach from NOAA's successful NeMO web site which features education and outreach material for students, teachers, and the general public that are related to eruptions on Axial Volcano since 1998.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project developed new methods for precisely measuring long-term vertical movements of the seafloor at Axial Seamount, an active submarine volcano in the NE Pacific.  We measured these seafloor movements with surveys at an array of seafloor benchmarks using a remotely operated vehicle and an instrument to measure pressure very precisely.  In this way, we could measure the depth of the benchmarks inside the summit caldera relative to a reference site outside the caldera. Our results show that Axial Seamount has an inflation/deflation cycle, similar to basaltic calderas on land, in which the volcano gradually inflates between eruptions and suddenly deflates during eruptions.  In fact, we discovered that Axial Seamount erupted again in April 2011 and we were able to forecast the timing of that eruption based on our inflation measurements.  This is the first time that a successful eruption forecast has ever been made at a submarine volcano.  We also collected instrumental recordings that showed short-term precursors in the months to hours before the 2011 eruption started.  We believe that Axial Seamount may be an excellent natural laboratory for testing ideas and techniques for forecasting volcanic eruptions because the Earth's crust is unusually thin at this location and this has created an usually simple magmatic system.  Future monitoring efforts at Axial Seamount with the National Science Foundation's cabled observatory that will be part of the Ocean Observatories Initiative will test these ideas in the coming years.
