<AbstractNarration>The ant genus Paratrechina is a diverse group of 158 species; however, as many as twice that number remains to be discovered and described.  Paratrechina ants are important representatives of ant communities around the world.  The researchers propose to revise the taxonomy of the genus on a global scale, creating identification tools and describing new species that will complete a large and important chapter for the ant volume of the proposed "encyclopedia of life".  This project will facilitate accurate species identification for a wide range of scientific studies, and will assist United States government quarantine inspectors responsible for monitoring potentially invasive species. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers will train students in various aspects of modern systematics and biological research.  Undergraduate and graduate students will be fully integrated into the research, with positions widely advertised to encourage women and underrepresented groups to apply. Outreach will be facilitated through the creation of a Paratrechina of the World website, providing land managers and agricultural inspectors an authoritative source of information on these animals.  Several Paratrechina species are already of quarantine concern, and the proposed project will provide tools needed to protect areas from the accidental introduction of species, and will inform decisions about agricultural biological control efforts.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Systematics and taxonomic research form the foundation for the study of biological diversity.  As R. M. May put it, "without taxonomy to give shape to the bricks, and systematics to tell us how to put them together, the house of biological science is a meaningless jumble."  Before our research project, the genus Paratrechina and related genera were in a rather jumbled state themselves.  The morphological limits of the genera were unclear and despite one earlier taxonomic work, there were no taxonomic revisions available to allow identification of species outside of North America.  Our results have changed the situation in this group of genera considerably.  At the level of the genus perhaps our most striking result was the finding that the genus Paratrechina was not monophyletic, but in fact consisted of 3 separate lineages all of which we elevated to genus (Nylanderia, Paratrechina and Paraparatrechina). This was supported by a robust phylogeny that we created during this project and all the genera now have sound morphological descriptions, also newly developed. The phylogeny was based on molecules and consisted of 55 taxa with 3.6 kb per taxon from 5 genes. At the species-level, the vast majority of the more than 120 species that had already been described in Paratrechina were transferred to Nylanderia, a genus that had long been in synonymy with Paratrechina.  As a result, we created the Prenolepis genus-group, a clade of 6 genera related to Paratrechina.  This places these genera within a sound phylogeny-based context and provides a platform for future studies in behavior, biodiversity, conservation biology, ecology, invasion biology, and systematics.   We revised species within multiple genera within the Prenolepis genus-group including: Euprenolepis, Nylanderia, Paraparatrechina, and Paratrechina.  We created a new genus based on our results, Zatania, that currently contains 5 extant species and 1 fossil species.  The revisions resulted in the treatment (diagnosis, descriptions and keys) of 65 species and the discovery of 31 new species from around the world, including the discovery of 2 fossil species from Dominican amber.  There are now morphologically based keys available for these genera that will allow future researchers to accurately and reliably identify species.  This will allow for not only increased identification of ant species, but also allow for the discovery of new species more quickly.  An example of how our revisionary work has influenced fields outside of taxonomy and systematics can be seen in our work with the Tawny Crazy Ant (Nylanderia fulva).  We were able to definitively put a name to this new invasive ant species that has invaded the entire Gulf States region of the United States.  We worked closely not only with other systematists on this project, but also with agricultural entomologists from the USDA, land managers and pest control experts, all of whom were desperate to finally get a name to this quickly spreading ant.  Another example can be seen in the genus Euprenolepis, which has at least two species that are mushroom harvesters &ndash; a very unusual behavior among ants.  Behaviorists have recently published work on the second mushroom-harvesting species, a species that was described as part of this project in 2009.  A number of educational opportunities were created as a result of this project.  Four masterÆs level graduate students were sponsored who directly worked on this project.  Two of those students are now pursuing their Ph.D. degrees in systematics.  One of the goals of the project was to expose undergraduates to revisionary systematics, an underrepresented discipline in most biological curricula.  Six undergraduates directly participated in this project and one of those students assisted in the description of six new species.  We furthered our outreach efforts by providing images of all species we treated via AntWeb.org and created AntWiki.org pages for the genera we investigate...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
