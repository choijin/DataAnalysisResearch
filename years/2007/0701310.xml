<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT for award DMS-0701310 of Mantovan&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Beginning in 1967 Langlands suggested an intricate web of&lt;br/&gt;far-reaching conjectures connecting the theories of automorphic&lt;br/&gt;forms and Galois representations. He also predicted some of these&lt;br/&gt;correspondences to be encoded in the cohomology groups of Shimura&lt;br/&gt;varieties and their local models. The proposed research pursues the&lt;br/&gt;study of the geometric implications of these conjectures, focusing&lt;br/&gt;on two key features: the compatibility between global and local&lt;br/&gt;conjectures and the functoriality principle. The PI aims to enlarge&lt;br/&gt;the class of Shimura varieties whose local behavior at unramified&lt;br/&gt;primes is well understood by eliminating two common restrictive&lt;br/&gt;hypotheses: the assumption of properness and the restriction to the&lt;br/&gt;subclass of Shimura varieties of P.E.L. type. In the first case, the&lt;br/&gt;PI proposes to develop the integral theory of arithmetical&lt;br/&gt;compactifications for Shimura varieties, following the works of&lt;br/&gt;Faltings-Chai and Pink. In the second case, she plans to study the&lt;br/&gt;bad reduction of Shimura varieties of Hodge type, following the&lt;br/&gt;strategy of Rapoport-Zink.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The Langlands program proposes the existence of a relation between&lt;br/&gt;seemingly unrelated objects in number theory and harmonic analysis.&lt;br/&gt;A Galois group is the collection of all symmetries existing among&lt;br/&gt;the roots of a given polynomial in one variable and a Galois&lt;br/&gt;representation is the realization of such symmetries as matrices. On&lt;br/&gt;the other hand, automorphic forms are complex functions possessing&lt;br/&gt;many self-similarities. A connection between the two theories as it&lt;br/&gt;is proposed by the Langlands program would provide an incredibly&lt;br/&gt;powerful mathematical tool translating theorems of harmonic analysis&lt;br/&gt;into theorems about algebra, and vice versa. In some cases, it is&lt;br/&gt;expected such a correspondence to be encoded in the geometry of&lt;br/&gt;certain algebraic objects: the Shimura varieties and their local&lt;br/&gt;models. This project aims to shed some light on how the geometry of&lt;br/&gt;these spaces could reflect some of the deepest aspects of the&lt;br/&gt;Langlands' conjectures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
