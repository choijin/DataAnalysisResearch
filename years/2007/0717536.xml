<AbstractNarration>This CCLI Phase 2 project is developing inquiry-based educational modules to repair students' critical misconceptions in eight areas of thermal and transport science. It is refining and testing these modules with diverse chemical engineering students at five partner schools, with particular outreach to underrepresented student populations. The modules are designed to give students carefully designed situations where reality, rather than the professor, can dispute their misconceptions. These educational materials are being disseminated through a variety of mechanisms, including an on-site faculty workshop as well as an instruction manual with inquiry-based activities, supplementary instructional aids, and reliable assessment tools. The effectiveness of the materials is being assessed using previously developed concept inventories as part of a comprehensive evaluation plan coordinated by an outside evaluation expert. The project is providing evidence about whether this approach can be used to address a broad range of persistent misconceptions in engineering science and whether it can improve underrepresented student retention. Finally, these materials can be used for ABET accreditation, since they provide a proven vehicle for addressing important learning outcomes and a valid and efficient assessment tool to document students' learning gains.  &lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
