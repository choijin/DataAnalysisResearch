<AbstractNarration>Microscopic valves on the surface of land plants called stomata are essential for plant growth and survival and impact our global environment.  Stomata are an interface between plants and the atmosphere. Notably, carbon-dioxide molecules (greenhouse gas) enter plants through stoma and are fixed into sugars to support plant growth and biomass production.  Furthermore, a loss of water vapor through stomata, a process known as transpiration, promotes water movement from soil to the tip of plants to support their growth. During plant development, stomata are formed through a series of orchestrated differentiation events, where signals between cells specify the density and distribution of stomata on the plant epidermis.  Recent research led to identification of candidate ligands and cell-surface receptors that govern stomatal patterning. This proposal is aiming at establishing the function and action of candidate ligands, EPIDERMAL PATTERNING FACTOR1 (EPF1) and EPF2, and to further determine whether these proteins associate with potential receptors, TOO MANY MOUTHS and ERECTA-family receptor kinases.  Accomplishments of the proposed research will advance our knowledge to improve water-use efficiency and biomass production of important crop plant species. The proposed project will provide excellent training opportunities for future scientists at all levels in diverse backgrounds, from undergraduate, a starting technician and a postdoctoral researcher.  They will learn broad knowledge of plant biology, molecular genetics, biochemistry, and imaging techniques and how to propose important questions in biology.  A part of the research will further be incorporated into the undergraduate teaching lab course (Introductory Biology) to enhance education.</AbstractNarration>
