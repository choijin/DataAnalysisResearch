<AbstractNarration>Sparse recovery is the problem of efficiently tracking the m largest items out of d.  This includes tracking m brightest blips in a RADAR image or the m most prominent features in a Magentic Resonance image.  Many communities, including the theoretical computer science community, have addressed these problems.  The theoretical computer science community's principled approach to randomness and approximation in algorithms leads to solutions that are remarkably more efficient than traditional approaches, especially when the size d of the problem is large, as is the case in many RADAR and medical imaging problems.  But, despite the tremendous promise of theoretical advances, to date there has been little dramatic impact on the way massive datasets are handled in practice.  For many massive dataset algorithms, the new algorithms are exponentially faster than classical algorithms in important respects.  Exponentially algorithms will eventually, of necessity, replace existing algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses massive dataset issues that arise in RADAR or medical imaging.  It brings theoretical advances in sparse recovery to those fields through collaboration between theoretical computer scientists and engineers.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project contributed new algorithms for SPARSE RECOVERY, a central problem in the management of big data.  The new theory addressed both the runtime of algorithms and the number of measurements made of the data.  This work was presented at major international conferences and used and cited by others.  It involved collaboration with several senior researchers.  The project also partially but significantly supported two graduate students, including a member of a recognized underrepresented group.  The students have gone on to employment and one won an award for her PhD dissertation.  The students traveled to present their work on the project at major conferences, too.  The grant also supported several Research Experience for Undergraduates projects.  Finally, the project supported outreach through a weekend activity at a science and technology museum and visits with elementary and middle school children.  The museum weekend covered the topics of error-correcting codes, which are useful for reliable communication and data storage as well as secure computation.  The work with elementary school children includes one hour per week of regular visits to one school and informal, ad hoc visits to other schools and Future University meetings at the University of Michigan, in which middle schoolers are brought from Detroit to the University for a program.
