<AbstractNarration>In AutomationTek, two institutions are developing a hands-on remote lab automation curriculum that allows learners to operate equipment such as robots, programmable logic controllers, rapid prototyping systems, and wet process control systems over the Internet. It includes detailed expert instruction, video and audio feedback, and evaluation. The structured, modular format lends itself to degree programs as well as to employed workers who need specific training. A total of 60 modules are expected to support over 2,000 learners each year. Each component takes students through a complete, progressive learning system that first teaches through simulation, and then allows interaction through real-time remote lab operation. AutomationTek draws on the partners' strong relationships with industry, experience in distance education, established articulated degree programs, emphasis on active learning and innovative instructional technology, and reputations for individualized, quality instruction. Modules that respond to workforce development, yet emphasize comprehensive education grounded in theory, develop learners who can process information, solve problems, and are ideally suited to current and future manufacturing environments. A focus on two-year programs improves access for many underrepresented learners who choose to enroll closer to home. With remote operation of equipment becoming more common in the workplace, successful remote operation of equipment for education and training supports Indiana's commitment to continued manufacturing growth and has long range potential for global impact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
