<AbstractNarration>The project ``Texnh: A New Approach to the B.A. Degree in Computer Science,'' was funded by the NSF (CISE/EIA) in 2003. Texnh is the Greek word for art. It is also the root of the Greek and English words for technology. The objective of the Texnh project is to establish a strong connection between arts and sciences in teaching computing. Based upon this work, the School of Computing at Clemson University has structured the first two years of its undergraduate curricula according to the Texnh approach, whose focus is problem-based instruction in the domain of computer-generated visual media.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this project is to build upon the Texnh foundation in a manner consistent with the objectives of the EAE program. Partners at Western Carolina University and UNC Wilmington will employ the Texnh approach in selected courses for at least two years. The Texnh approach will be extended to senior division courses at Clemson University. A rigorous assessment mechanism incorporating environmental assessment, dynamic assessment, and other mechanisms identified by the project's external evaluator working with the CPATH evaluators will be used by all partners.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
