<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;SES-0753623 &lt;br/&gt;Gail Smith &lt;br/&gt;CUNY &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SES-0753656 &lt;br/&gt;Janet Weiss &lt;br/&gt;University of Michigan Ann Arbor &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SES-0753628 &lt;br/&gt;Steven Salley &lt;br/&gt;Wayne State University &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SES-0753641 &lt;br/&gt;Karen Klomparens &lt;br/&gt;Michigan State University &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The City University of New York (CUNY), the University of Michigan (U-M), Michigan State University (MSU), and Wayne State University (WSU) are among the Top 25 Institutions awarding baccalaureate and doctoral degrees in the social, behavioral and economic (SBE) sciences to underrepresented minorities. In addition, these institutions have documented success in meeting AGEP goals in the STEM (science, technology engineering and mathematics) fields. CUNY is currently part of a MAGNET/STEM AGEP alliance partnered with the New Jersey Institute of Technology, Polytechnic University and Stevens Institute of Technology. U-M, MSU and WSU partner with Western Michigan University to form the Michigan AGEP Alliance (MAA). CUNY and the Michigan AGEP Alliance (MAA), consisting of the University of Michigan, Michigan State University and Wayne State University combined efforts and formed a new regional alliance to advance the production of underrepresented minorities (i.e., African American, Hispanics, American Indians, Asian/Pacific Islanders) in the social, behavioral and economic sciences (SBE) at the B.S. through Ph.D. and early career levels. Alliance institutions are both sharing resources and best practices across the alliance and including SBE fields in existing AGEP programs. The CUNY/MAA Alliance for the SBE sciences has increased participation in summer research programs, expanded recruitment and research opportunities for social sciences students, further developed targeted relationships with minority-serving institutions, provided across the alliance student mentoring and mentoring training for faculty, coordinated skill building workshops to help ensure graduate study success and enhanced fellowship support. It has also expanded student support groups, teaching opportunities, teacher training workshops, students' attendance at professional workshops, and postdoctoral and early career education. This grant funds a continuation of these efforts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project broader impacts will be through the institutionalization of a larger pool of individuals studying and conducting research in the SEE disciplines through the utilization of effective strategies that will attract, motivate, and train domestic talent, especially among underrepresented minorities, women and persons with disabilities. The result of these activities will be to advance understanding of the role of the social and behavioral sciences in the nation, as well as to strengthen the national workforce. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

The graduation success of the community members is excellent and over 90% of them currently hold academic positions, but perhaps the impact of the community participation is best captured by what our recent graduates say in response to the question: "How does membership in AGEP influence what it means to work in your profession?" Here are three representative examples:  "AGEP helped me translate my knowledge into practical terms so that anyone can understand the work that I do"  "I think AGEP reinforced my identity in my profession. I had lost a "community" of intellectuals that was also a community of people of color, and was losing my identity."  "The primary influence was in how I participated in mentoring activities, both for myself and for others. Although the isolation I felt and witnessed among others in my program was intense from the onset of my program, I took a very passive approach to building relationships where I was mentored, provided co-mentoring, or mentored others. AGEP changed that. I became more proactive in seeking mentoring and providing mentoring and began to understand fully how necess...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
