<AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase II project will develop and deliver a software media architecture that removes a critical barrier to the widespread use of multi-projector, high-resolution, ultra definition displays. The approach defines a set of layered abstractions from the low-level display driver to higher-level protocols including multi-user display use and security. This model is the bedrock of a new display architecture that will not constrain future display innovations, allow content developers and producers to communicate to current and future display systems, and acts to isolate the underlying complexities of new display technologies from users. Building on this new architecture, the Phase II project will implement a software-based Display Operating System. The project is motivated by the perception that we will soon live in a world where displays cease to be individual discreet devices but rather become an extension of our environment; a limitless fabric of pixels. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The potential impact of this innovation is significant, by removing the usability and cost barriers normally associated with ultrahigh-resolution displays, applications once available to only a select few can become commonplace. This has the potential to change the advanced visualization, media interaction models, as well as the way in which we interact with our computational environments. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Advanced display systems have been relegated to a limited number of elite institutions that are willing to bear a large support, installation, and maintenance cost.  As a result, highly immersive, beyond-HD display systems have not played a major role in our everyday workplace and educational environments.  As part of the Media Fusion project, Mersive has developed and commercialized software that allows our display hardware partners to introduce a new class of display systems that are an order of magnitude lower in cost, self-maintaining, and do not require additional infrastructure.  Due to advances made in the project, Mersive has launched two new display products for scientific engineering, product design and telecollaboration that deliver 12 million pixels for less than $80k.  Figure 1 depicts two displays that were introduced to the marketplace as part of the project.  The two figures depict revolutionary display products that were a direct result of Mersive's work on this project.    In addition to our focus on revolutionizing the cost and performance of high-resolution display systems, Mersive has been exploring a new methodology for media sharing in pixel-rich environments.  As part of the project, we have developed the Media Fusion architecture that allows mobile devices to connect to display infrastructure in simple and intuitive ways.  The architecture supports advanced collaboration , media sharing, and communication.  The project produced a software architecture that is now being explored by some of our partners to change the way workers collaborate about data in the Oil and Gas industry, monitor large amounts of visual data in the Government intelligence community, and how co-located collaboration can be supported by the Media Fusion software.   Finally, the project resulted in a number of more intangible outcomes including three patent awards, four new patent applications, several important technology partnerships, and several new reseller agreements.
