<AbstractNarration>The Jackson Laboratory, in Bar Harbor, Maine, conducts research in functional genomics and in interdisciplinary approaches to solving biological problems using the latest genetic tools. Jackson Lab will recruit 8 undergraduate students each summer within the framework of its existing Summer Student Program. The 11-week program will offer students hands-on training in interdisciplinary research linking the biological, physical, and computational sciences to investigations of genome function. Each student will perform an independent, hypothesis-driven research project as a member of a sponsoring scientist's laboratory team. Students can select from among the scientific staff many of whom are leaders in the country. Participants will be chosen through a competitive nationwide application process to represent a diverse group with respect to gender, ethnicity, economic background, and enrollment in research-limited institutions. Underrepresented groups are encouraged to apply and are actively recruited. Students are provided access to Jackson Lab's resources such as courses and conferences, state-of-the-art instrumentation and bioinformatics databases, and housing in an oceanfront dormitory overseen by professional staff. Jackson Lab offers a stimulating environment in which undergraduates with a passion for hands-on experimental science can contribute to real research progress and make great strides in intellectual and personal growth. Additional information is available at http://www.jax.org/education/ssp.html, or by contacting Jon Geiger at summerstudents@jax.org; or the PI, Barbara Knowles.</AbstractNarration>
