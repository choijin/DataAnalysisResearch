<AbstractNarration>CBET-0748049&lt;br/&gt;Allen&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two-phase flow in large-scale systems has historically been important to the fields of hydrodynamics and heat transfer. Advances in MEMS analytical devices, microscale heat exchangers, space-based processing and thermal control technologies, and terrestrial-based technologies such as fuel cells have highlighted the need for improved understanding of gas-liquid flow with a strong capillary component. Attempts at developing universal flow regime maps for small scale systems have been unsuccessful due to the inability to properly account for the effects of capillary forces, dissipation due to menisci motion and gas-liquid interface interaction. The PI will conduct a systematic experimental and analytical investigation of two-phase flow at the capillary scale and develop engineering design tools. Educational opportunities for pre-college, undergraduate and graduate students are integrated throughout the research program. The first three overlapping research phases consists of qualitative experiments to study gas-liquid interface dynamics and development of a high-speed confocal microscopy technique. The second phase of this program focuses on quantitative studies utilizing the high-speed confocal microscopy technique for micro-Particle Image Velocimetry (micro-PIV) near dynamic gas-liquid interfaces; a region of flow not accessible with any currently available micro-PIV methods.  The analytical and experimental studies of the second phase will isolate and quantify the effects of surface tension, interface curvature, interface shear, gas phase inertia and compressibility, hydrodynamic dissipation due to menisci motion and dynamic contact lines on the morphology of the two-phase flow through microchannels. All of these effects have been observed in capillary-scale two-phase flow, but not quantified. The third phase will construct and test predictive tools for design and development of advanced technologies and to improve water management strategies for more reliable fuel cell operation.  The results of research will help in development of automotive fuel cells where inability to effectively manage the water produced by the hydrogen-oxygen reaction constitutes one of the major difficulties in mass deployment. Impacts of this research have an educational aspect and a societal aspect. Graduate and undergraduate student training is an important part of this work. Students will be recruited from under-represented groups through existing Michigan Tech educational partnerships. A key element of the educational aspect of this study is the tiered mentoring of graduate to undergraduate students and undergraduate to pre-college students where students learn through demonstration and instruction from other students. The societal impact will be most evident in advanced technology development; particularly with respect to alternative energy conversion technologies such as fuel cells. The results of this study will be a more thorough, quantitative understanding of two-phase flow in systems where capillary forces are important and application of this understanding to advance technology while developing student talent in the growing field of microscale devices and fuel cells.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project investigated gas-liquid flows moving at high speeds through extremely small capillaries and channels.  The goal of the project is to better understand how the two phases (gas and liquid) interact with each other when capillary forces are important.  Capillary forces are important when the liquid surface area is small such as in a ball-point pen, a felt-tip marker, a paint brush, wicking of water into a paper towel, and in a candle wick. An improved understanding of how a gas and liquid (air and water) interact with one another in a small diameter tube is important for a wide variety of technologies including microchips for health screening and pharmaceutical development, reliable and efficient automotive fuel cells, small scale heat exchangers for electronics cooling, and zero-gravity thermal control and life-support systems.  In order to study this flow, commonly referred to as two-phase flow (liquid and gas phases), at the very small sizes, we had to develop a new method for measuring inside the capillaries.  A novel optical microscope technique suitable for high speed imaging (more than 1000 images per second) was  successfully developed with Prairie Technologies near Madison, WI (now part of Bruker).  Image 3 is a view of the interior of the confocal head that connects the microscope to the high speed camera.  The components shown collect images that are thin `optically slices' of the liquid films inside the microchannels or drops as illustrated in image 2.  During our investigation, a previously unreported type of flow behavior was observed.  Image 1 illustrates the formation of 'shock' in the liquid film that trails behind a liquid plug moving in the capillary.  The shock is a sudden change, or jump, in the thickness of the liquid film and this thickness jump has important implications on the nature of the flow, pressure and mixing of the gas and liquid farther downstream.  A similar, though not related, thickness jump is often seen in a slow water stream impacting on the bottom of a kitchen sink, provided the stream is smooth and bubble free.  A number of other new findings and results were produced during this project.  Highlights of this project include  development of a novel  optical microscopy system that can image inside of extremely thin liquid films (&lt; 0.010 mm) moving at high speeds discovery of a flow phenomena not previously known simultaneous thickness, velocity and morphology measurements in ultrathin liquid films insid capillaries determination of the air velocity needed to lift nanoparticles from a surface; with applications to health and safety controls for manufacturing plants working with nanoparticles fundamental, unambiguous data that may be used to test the accuracy of computer models attempting to simulate two-phase flow in microsystems development of a new optics lab for graduate students development of design criteria for the formation of water plugs in fuel cell gas flow channels, which similar to capillaries are extremely small   The novel optical microscopy technique has found utility in other scientific fields such as chemical engineering and biology and researchers from these fields are collaborating with us to use our new microscopy capability. Researchers in biology are interested in using this microscopy techique to study how fluid flow affects cell and tissue growth.  Researchers in chemical engineering are interested in using this microscopy capability to calibrate microchips that can be used to screen blood for blood type and presence of cancerous cells.  We hope that this new technique will be transformative for these scientific disciplines as it has for two-phase flow in mechanical engineering.  This project partially supported the graduate and undergraduate education of 11 students in mechanical engineering, 4 of whom are from traditionally underrepresented groups in science and technology. These students have been provided an opportunity to pursue cutting edge rese...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
