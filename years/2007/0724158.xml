<AbstractNarration>This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program supports research by Professor Christopher Cummins at MIT to study the ability of the early actinide elements to engage in triple bonding to carbon.  The triple bond between uranium and carbon has not yet been realized experimentally, but it has potential for the alkyne metathesis reaction. The proposed methods for delivering the uranium-carbon triple bond center on non-traditional, heterobimetallic bond-activation reactions, which allow for incorporation of a 13C isotopic label, which will be used to probe the nature of the uranium-carbon triple bond. This will be done using experimental CPMAS solid-state NMR methods, with data interpretation aided by quantum chemical calculations. The new reactions will be characterized in terms of structure, bonding, and mechanism with attempts to apply the new reactions in chemical synthesis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will be performed in collaboration with Prof. Karsten Meyer at the University of Erlangen in Germany.  Uranium chemistry is relevant to the problems associated with nuclear energy. By training students in this area, who will receive an international research experience, the project will contribute to our national competency in actinide science. Depleted uranium should become increasingly available as nuclear becomes a more popular source of clean energy; productive uses for depleted uranium represent a major potential societal benefit.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
