<AbstractNarration>Abstract:  OCI-0724300/Zimmerman&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A community-based planning activity, intended to gather input on the type of infrastructure required to provide high-end cyberinfrastructure services to the science and engineering research and education community after the current TeraGrid project awards expire in early 2010, will be conducted over a period of approximately one year.  It will be coordinated by a neutral facilitator who will engage the stakeholder communities, including the science and engineering research and education community, developers of information technology intended to improve the accessibility and utility of high-end digital technologies for science and engineering, current service providers within the TeraGrid, institutions who would like to be service providers in the follow-on infrastructure, and NSF.  The intention is to bring together a large number of members of the stakeholder communities, in person and online, to develop plans for the most appropriate vehicles for delivering access to advanced cyberinfrastructure resources and services to researchers and educators in a way that allows them to maximize their productivity and enables breakthrough discoveries.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will overcome some of the limitations of traditional technology design and planning processes by including modern social networking approaches to supplement more traditional techniques of gathering input and facilitating discussion.  The planning process to be used is user-centric and involves four phases:  elicitation of user needs and priorities; comparison of requirements; development of options for delivery of services and resources; development of recommendations to guide the future delivery of services and resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The process will be guided by the PIs and a Steering Committee drawn from widely trusted members of the stakeholder communities.  Emphasis will be placed on ensuring that members of under-represented groups are actively involved in the planning process.  Results from the planning process will help guide the research and education community as they develop ideas for the successor to TeraGrid.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
