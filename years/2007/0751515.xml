<AbstractNarration>With support from the National Science Foundation, and building upon the success of the Mississippi e-Center, the Science Diversity Center (SDC) will establish the Science and Technology Center (STC) Student Transitional Alliance for Research in STEM (STARS) partnership, designed to provide faculty and students from minority-serving institutions with increased access to undergraduate and graduate research opportunities at six NSF-sponsored STCs.  Program goals encompass: increase the number research opportunities for students underrepresented in STEM at MSIs supported by the NSF's Human and Resources Development Program, including the Centers for Research Excellence in Science and Technology; provide an expanded forum for STCs to share STEM education and knowledge transfer initiatives, and develop research collaborations with MSI faculty.   Besides providing a rich atmosphere for encouraging future scientists and engineers, STCs conduct innovative, world-class research of national importance, that promise to contribute to the Nation's by developing STEM potential through discovery and education. The STC /STARS partnership will offer a significant number of under-represented students and faculty in STEM the opportunity to participate in STC-based research. Consequently broadening the participation of all citizens and enhancing diversity within NSF's programs will help address the national challenge of preparing a more diverse and globally competitive STEM workforce for the future.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
