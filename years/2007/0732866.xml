<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: ECS-0732866&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title: NSF Workshop on Quantum, Molecular and High Performance Modeling and Simulation for Devices and Systems&lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;PI Name:  Dowling, Jonathan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI Institution: Louisiana State University &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scope of Proposal: &lt;br/&gt;ECCS has announced a new thrust area in its core programs for on Quantum, Molecular and High Performance Modeling and Simulation for Devices and Systems (QMHP). The main purpose of this area is to capture the new large opportunities for science and society (large intellectual merit and broader merit) which may result from new fundamental cross-cutting research involving three core communities: (1) experts in modeling and simulation of electronic systems and devices; (2) high performance computing relevant to systems and devices; and (3) the quantum many-body principles relevant to systems and devices. The purpose of this workshop is to improve our understanding of where these new opportunities lie, and to create a workshop report to stimulate more and better proposals to this area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scientific merit of proposal: &lt;br/&gt;Work in modeling for electronics and optoelectronics has already resulted in important very fundamental advances in scientific understanding, such as cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED), essential to the design of VCSELs yet also a fundamental change in our understanding of the laws of physics. The workshop will attempt to identify areas where such fundamental breakthroughs may be possible in the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broad impact of proposal: &lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of electronics and photonics technologies are known to be huge. Design packages are essentially just models with interfaces. Improved design will benefit from improved models. The workshop provide NSF with a better understanding of the unmet emerging new opportunities to improve models and designs in a way which serves as an enabler to such crucial areas as energy, universal access in communications, and massively parallel nanocomputing.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
