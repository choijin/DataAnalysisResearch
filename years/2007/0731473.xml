<AbstractNarration>RACE/ETHNICITY, CRIME, AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE:&lt;br/&gt;DIVERSE RESEARCH AND PARTICIPATION IN THE ACADEMY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit. This project builds on the successful collaboration of a group of scholars from&lt;br/&gt;diverse backgrounds (African American, Latino, White, etc.), disciplines (Criminology or&lt;br/&gt;Criminal Justice, Family Relations, Law, Public Policy, Political Science, Social Work, and&lt;br/&gt;Sociology), and stages of career (assistant-, associate-, and full-professors, and graduate students)&lt;br/&gt;whose work is oriented to improving the quality of research on the interlinkages among&lt;br/&gt;race/ethnicity, crime, and criminal justice, and on broadening perspectives and participation in&lt;br/&gt;research on this topic. These scholars recently published a book, The Many Colors of Crime, in&lt;br/&gt;which they lay out a critical new research agenda (see Peterson, Krivo and Hagan 2006). The&lt;br/&gt;first goal of this project is to undertake the kinds of studies called for in the volume, and thereby,&lt;br/&gt;begin to provide a deeper, and more nuanced, understanding of the interrelationships among&lt;br/&gt;race/ethnicity, crime, and criminal justice than heretofore available. The second goal of this&lt;br/&gt;project is to advance the research and professional development of young scholars from&lt;br/&gt;underrepresented groups for carrying out innovative research on crime and justice by establishing&lt;br/&gt;an annual Summer Research Institute as a follow up to a 2006 pilot institute. The overarching&lt;br/&gt;purpose of the institute is to support the advancement of ethnoracial minorities engaged in the&lt;br/&gt;study of crime and justice in order to further democratic inclusion in academe, and advance&lt;br/&gt;knowledge in this area by supporting the potentially diverse perspectives these scholars can offer.&lt;br/&gt;Approaches to Achieving Project Goals. To facilitate achieving the project objectives, the PIs&lt;br/&gt;will undertake a series of workshops that bring group members together, and hold a summer&lt;br/&gt;research and professional development institute for young scholars from underrepresented&lt;br/&gt;groups. The workshops will be both idea- and product-oriented and serve as the mechanism for&lt;br/&gt;planning and making progress on collaborative projects. The summer research institute will take&lt;br/&gt;place in a "safe" and resource-rich environment and be structured to provide the support, training,&lt;br/&gt;and mentorship needed by young faculty for completing a research project for journal publication&lt;br/&gt;or grant proposal. The institute will culminate with participants presenting their work at the&lt;br/&gt;RDCJ-N workshop where they will gain feedback and develop networks with other senior and&lt;br/&gt;junior scholars in the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts. This project is structured to have two important broader impacts on scholarship&lt;br/&gt;and the academy. First, it will draw on the expertise of scholars who are diverse along a number&lt;br/&gt;of dimensions (e.g., race and ethnicity, disciplinary training, and stage of career) to develop and&lt;br/&gt;carry out significant innovative crime and justice research. This work will have as its central&lt;br/&gt;premise the need to take into account the complexity of race/ethnicity and embed analyses in the&lt;br/&gt;differential positioning of groups in society. Through collaborative, multi-method, and&lt;br/&gt;comparative studies, the researchers will produce a body of original multidisciplinary work that&lt;br/&gt;emphasizes the variable significance of race for crime/criminal justice, and how racialization&lt;br/&gt;relates to the understanding of citizenship and democracy, nationally and around the world.&lt;br/&gt;Second, the project will broaden participation in crime and justice research by fostering the&lt;br/&gt;careers of scholars from underrepresented groups. Together the workshops and summer research&lt;br/&gt;institute will have a general impact in bringing diversity in perspectives and participation to&lt;br/&gt;research and curricula on crime and criminal justice.</AbstractNarration>
