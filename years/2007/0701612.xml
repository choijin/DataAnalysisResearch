<AbstractNarration>Proposal Number:  0701926 and 0701612&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title: Collaborative Research: Quantum Simulator for Modeling Quantum Dot Photodetectors&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI Name:              Vasileska, Dragica and Klimeck, Gerhard&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI Institution:  Arizona State University and Purdue University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will develop a new 3D Quantum Transport Simulator that solves the non-equilibrium Green's function transport problem with an innovative Contact Block Reduction (CBR) method self-consistently. The approach incorporates atomistic band-structure effects by utilizing the results of the NEMO3D simulation software. The Simulator can be applied to any 3D nano-device structure. To accommodate Freescale's interest in sensors, this simulation tool will be used to investigate the operation of Quantum Dot Infrared Photodetectors. This aspect of the research will help developing novel night vision goggles and chemical sensors.  &lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the proposed activity is the accurate simulation and understanding carrier transport and operation of novel nano-device structures. Predictions are that within as little as five years, industry and academicians will be required to consider 3D and quantum mechanical effects to accurately predict new nano-device behavior. The fully quantum-mechanical transport NEMO3D-CBR Solver will fill this immediate and essential need for both Academia and Industry.&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the proposed activity is related to the development of a novel and efficient simulation tool that can be used by future generation students. The tool will be deployed on http://nanoHUB.org which has served over 5,100 simulation users with over 174,000 simulations in the past 12 months leading to Feb 2007.  Research codes similar to the ones proposed here, like the nanoHUB nanowire / nanoMOS code have served over 544 / 359 users.  The community will be enabled to conduct real research and education with the outcomes of this proposed work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
