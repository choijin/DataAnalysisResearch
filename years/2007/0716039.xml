<AbstractNarration>Proposal: 0716039&lt;br/&gt;Tontong Ellen Li&lt;br/&gt;CT-E: Secure Communication System Design for Wireless Networks&lt;br/&gt;Michigan State University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to develop advanced design methodologies for inherently secure wireless networks through tight secure access control and strong privacy protection. First, for secure access control, it establishes a resilient and highly reliable wireless interface to strengthen or replace the current device-based and/or password-based security by the highly secure user-based access control. The major challenge lies in that user based access control generally requires reliable transmission of several orders of magnitude more bits than the traditional user verification process. In this project, resilient security protocols and high capacity access control protocols are designed for effective credential information transmission and real time user authentication.  Second, in current privacy protection schemes, information confidentiality is mainly performed at the network layer independent of the PHY layer, and thus is far from adequate for multimedia wireless communications. This research enhances the PHY layer built-in security by integrating cryptographic techniques into the transmitter-receiver design. Based on both cryptographic techniques and inherent ambiguity in signal detection over multiple access channels, this project formulates a joint PHY layer and upper layer privacy protection mechanism. Finally, overall system integration and validation will be performed through a reconfigurable simulation platform. By directly addressing multiple pivotal wireless security concerns, it is anticipated the important technological advances to be achieved in this project will contribute significantly to the design and development of a new generation of highly secure wireless networks. Additionally, by integrating the technological advances into the undergraduate/graduate curricula, and through outreach activities, significant impacts are expected from this project on training a highly-skilled and diverse workforce in the areas of wireless communications and network security, and on educating the public with respect to the need for secure and ethical operations in wireless communications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
