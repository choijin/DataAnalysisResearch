<AbstractNarration>Fried&lt;br/&gt;0706460&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Epitaxially-grown thin alloy films are essential components&lt;br/&gt;in many nano- and microscale devices used in the electronics and&lt;br/&gt;other industries.  Unfortunately, the growth of planar strained&lt;br/&gt;films is susceptible to instabilities.  These instabilities are&lt;br/&gt;often manifested by the formation of surface ripples, surface&lt;br/&gt;cusps, and island-like mounds such as quantum dots and quantum&lt;br/&gt;wires.  The demand for films with precisely tailored micro- and&lt;br/&gt;nanostructures has led to an extensive literature concerned with&lt;br/&gt;morphological instabilities during the epitaxy of thin alloy&lt;br/&gt;films.  To date, attention has focused primarily on instabilities&lt;br/&gt;that arise from a mismatch in lattice parameters between the film&lt;br/&gt;and the substrate and surface diffusion.  However, interfacial&lt;br/&gt;stress, which may strongly influence the formation of surface&lt;br/&gt;patterns, has received almost no attention.  Moreover, because of&lt;br/&gt;the geometric complications associated with the description of&lt;br/&gt;evolving surfaces in three space dimensions, studies of&lt;br/&gt;growth-stress interactions have thus far confined attention to&lt;br/&gt;two-dimensional theories, wherein the interface is a curve. &lt;br/&gt;Additionally, no theory yet accounts for the influence of surface&lt;br/&gt;stress on phase segregation and related pattern formation,&lt;br/&gt;processes that occur during epitaxy.  In this project, the&lt;br/&gt;investigator and colleagues:&lt;br/&gt;  1.  Perform stability analyses and numerical simulations&lt;br/&gt;  designed to explore the role of surface stress in the stability&lt;br/&gt;  of epitaxially growing films. &lt;br/&gt;  2.  Extend the existing two-dimensional theory to three space&lt;br/&gt;  dimensions. &lt;br/&gt;  3.  Develop a theory that describes the interaction of growth&lt;br/&gt;  and phase segregation during the epitaxy of alloys. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The investigator and his colleagues develop and analyze&lt;br/&gt;mathematical models, and carry out numerical simulations, of the&lt;br/&gt;behavior and characteristics of epitaxially grown thin films.  An&lt;br/&gt;increased understanding of the morphological stability of these&lt;br/&gt;films allows for progress and innovation in a variety of&lt;br/&gt;strategically important applications.  For instance, in the&lt;br/&gt;electronics industry, epitaxially grown multi-layers have been&lt;br/&gt;used to increase the storage capacity of hard drives and are now&lt;br/&gt;being studied for possible improvements.  Progress rests directly&lt;br/&gt;on the ability to control small-scale features that form during&lt;br/&gt;growth.  Another compelling example of the importance of&lt;br/&gt;epitaxial films is provided by recently proposed hybrid&lt;br/&gt;organic/inorganic devices capable of detecting airborne&lt;br/&gt;contaminants.  These devices combine a monolayer of sensing&lt;br/&gt;molecules on a semiconductor transducer grown via molecular beam&lt;br/&gt;epitaxy.  A precisely tailored surface structure is necessary to&lt;br/&gt;ensure that the sensing molecules adhere correctly to the&lt;br/&gt;transducer and perform reliably.  Epitaxial films also have&lt;br/&gt;potential in the development of optical semiconductors for&lt;br/&gt;applications such as variable wavelength lasers.  The devices&lt;br/&gt;have a wide range of potential applications, including the&lt;br/&gt;detection of toxic gases from vehicle exhaust, factories,&lt;br/&gt;accidents, fires, natural disasters, etc.  With a variable&lt;br/&gt;wavelength laser, it is possible to shorten measurement times&lt;br/&gt;from 1-2 minutes to 1 second, allowing for more rapid containment&lt;br/&gt;and evacuation during emergencies.</AbstractNarration>
