<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This collaborative project will document geographic patterns of genetic variation in both prehistoric and modern human populations along the North Slope of Alaska and assess how the ancient residents of arctic Alaska are related to contemporary Inupiaq populations throughout the circumarctic region. This will be achieved by the characterization of maternally inherited mitochondrial (mt)DNA sequences, paternally inherited Y-chromosome markers, as well as biparentally inherited autosomal genetic markers in both the archaeologically derived prehistoric samples and the contemporary populations of the North coast of Alaska.  Direct comparison of patterns of genetic variation in prehistoric populations and their possible modern descendants, and the placement of this biological variation in archaeological (temporal) context, is a powerful tool for the reconstruction of population history.  Although the prehistoric genetic data will come from well-known archaeological contexts (e.g., Nuvuk), the research team will also directly date a subsample of the prehistoric material to confirm the temporal placement of the samples.  They will also generate stable isotope data from the ancient samples to facilitate reconstruction of prehistoric diets, paleoecology of the region, and contribute to the reconstruction of ancient migration/colonization events. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The data to be generated by this project, on both extant and prehistoric populations, will afford a definitive genetic characterization of the Inupiat people of the northwestern American arctic, and permit testing several hypotheses regarding the origin of the eastern arctic Inuit population.  Additionally, the research undertaken here will permit a much more detailed analysis and understanding of the Thule expansion across the North American high arctic, one of the last great transcontinental migrations and colonization events.  A fuller understanding of this human dispersal will permit us to identify genetic signatures of rapid colonization, replacement versus admixing colonization models, and help clarify the origin and history of North American arctic populations.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Working closely with local archaeologists and community leaders, this project assisted in the excavation and recovery of prehistoric burials from the Thule cultural period from the site of Nuvuk at Pt. Barrow, AK.  The ancient burials were being lost into the Arctic Ocean due to increased coastal erosion as a result of climate change.  Local leaders wished the burials to be rescued prior to erosional loss, and reburied safely further inland.  Permissions were granted for scientific study of the remains, both morphological and molecular, between the time of disinterrment and reburial. Burials were located above the permafrost level in unconsolidated gravel deposits with  summer ground temperatures near 5 degrees C.                  Although complete forensic examinations were conducted of each burial, the remains were, in general, too fragmentary to result in formal quantitativeanalyses.  Age, sex, and apparent pathologies and injuries were recorded.  In contrast, very small skeletal samples were obtained directly during excavation, and were subsequently characterized genetically in the ancient DNA lab at the University of Utah.  Initially, the hypervariable region (HVSI) of the mitochondrial (mt) genome was sequenced via three overlapping fragments that had been amplified from purified DNA extract.  All individual samples yielded mtDNA molecules and subsequent HVSI sequences, and results have been confirmed with replicate DNA extracts and sequencing.  MtDNA HVSI sequences were used to identify the mitochondrial lineage for each individual burial.  Mitochondrial DNA is maternally inherited and therefore permits tracing of maternal lineages back in time.                  Modern Eskimo/Inuit populations of the North American arctic are characterized my mitochondrial lineages belonging to two major groups, haplogroups A2 and D.  In the Nuvuk material, lineages A2a,  A2b and A2root were observed, along with three individuals belonging to a D lineage.  D4 lineages are rare in modern arctic populations (&lt;5%), and this seems also be true for the Thule population of North Alaska.  A separate D2 lineage is common among both ancient and modern Aleuts and PaleoEskimos of the high arctic, but is not known in Neo-Eskimo (Thule) or modern  arctic populations.  This lineage was also not observed at Nuvuk.                  Archaeological evidence indicates that Thule people rapidly migrated from North Alaska to Greenland via Northern Canada approximately 800-1000 years ago.  Early genetic research suggested that some mitochondrial lineages actually arose during or after this migration in central Canada, and were carried back westward in subsequent migrations.  One of these lineages is a form of A2b that also possesses a mutation at position 16212 in the mitochondrial genome.  This mitochondrial haplotype is observed at Nuvuk at a time that clearly predates the Thule migration.  Coupled with another A2a lineage, one with a mutation at position 16311, it seems these lineages were present in the ancestral Thule population, did not originate later in Canada, and strengthen the linkages between the Thule of North Alaska, Greenlandic populations, and the modern arctic populations of Beringia.                  To clarify the nature of prehistoric Thule genetic variation in North Alaska, we determined the full mitochondrial genome of the individuals whose HVSI sequence is haplogroup D.  One of these genomes is complete, and the other two are nearly so.  The completed mtDNA genome clearly belongs to the lineage now termed D4b1a2a1a.  We anticipate that the two remaining genomes will also be members of this lineage, and will provide needed genomic comparisons for similar genomic analyses on early arctic peoples in Eastern Canada and Greenland.                  Finally, in order to provide additional geographic context to our aDNA results from Nuvuk, we characterized HVSI sequences from prehistoric burials on the Alaska Peninsula, and a terminal Ple...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
