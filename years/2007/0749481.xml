<AbstractNarration>This proposal formally establishes a multi-university Center for Particulate and Surfactant Systems as part of NSF's Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) program. The University of Florida (the lead institution) and Columbia University will maintain research sites to collaborate on research.  The proposed center's goal is to develop a knowledge base on the interactions between particulate systems and their relationship with the structure of different surfactants for enhanced performance in the pharmaceutical, chemical, microelectronic, and other nano-bio applications.  The research thrust areas identified in the proposal include synthesis, characterization, processing and applications.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed activity involves a number of researchers from different disciplines from both universities.  Much of the research will be carried out in collaboration with a number of industrial researchers.  The proposed I/UCRC research program will contribute to a timely development and commercialization of targeted research of major societal significance.  Work force development through education and advanced training of students will be a resource to industry and academe in this critical field of science and engineering and surfactant systems.  In addition, recruitment of women and under-represented groups will be emphasized. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
