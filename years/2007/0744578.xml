<AbstractNarration>This project will continue work on the chemistry of organic compounds of sulfur, selenium and tellurium, including development of an environmentally benign nematicide based on garlic oil, study of angiogenesis by compounds related to garlic-derived ajoene, chalcogen-containing molecular wires for use in nanotechnology, completion of the total syntheses of thiarubrine E (an antibiotic from Asteracea plants) and of lentinic acid (novel poly-sulfur compound from shiitake mushrooms), study of sequential one-electron oxidation of 1,5-dichalcogenacyclooctanes, and synthesis of thiacorrannulene and of trifluoromethylselenomethionine (a novel amino acid homologue). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Professor Eric Block of the Department of Chemistry at the University at Albany, SUNY.  Professor Block's research efforts seek to advance knowledge and develop practical uses of organic compounds of the chalcogen elements (sulfur, selenium and tellurium). The proposed research will contribute to environmentally benign methods for agricultural pest control. Successful development of the proposed methodology will have an impact on agricultural industries. Other projects could lead to the development of new pharmaceuticals as well as new materials for use in nanotechnology.</AbstractNarration>

Sulfenic acids are believed to be important antioxidants, which may explain antioxidant properties of garlic and related alliums.
