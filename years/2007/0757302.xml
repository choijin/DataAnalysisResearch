<AbstractNarration>The objective of this collaborative research project is to explore a unique concept of manufacturing using carbon nanotube/nanofiber based nanopapers and achieve the multifunctionalities of such nanocomposites with improved structural damping, thermal conductivity, and fire retardancy. This project's approach involves making carbon nanopapers by the filtration of well-dispersed carbon nanotubes and carbon nanofibers under well-controlled processing conditions. The carbon nanopapers are integrated into laminates using modified composites manufacturing processes. Process analysis will be conducted using multi-scale and multi-physics modeling techniques in an attempt to optimize the quality of carbon nanopapers and nanocomposites. Two carefully selected test beds will be utilized for the proof-of-concept of this technology. Fundamental research in the project will contribute to the understanding of the processing-morphology-property relationship of multifunctional nanocomposites and polymer transport in the hybrid reinforcements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will have a major impact on nanomanufacturing through advancing processing science of carbon nanopapers and multifunctional nanocomposites. The carbon nanopaper offers numerous potential applications including structural composites, electronics, heat sinks, and fuel cells. If successful, this research will develop light-weight composites with improved thermo-mechanical and structural damping properties for potential applications in space, aerospace, and soldier protection equipment. This research will enhance the thermal conductivity and fire retardancy of nanocomposites, which can enable many potential applications such as ship and offshore structures. This research involves strong interdisciplinary collaboration between materials science and mechanical engineering. In addition, the innovative research will also benefit undergraduate and graduate education at the two collaborating universities (University of South Alabama and University of Houston) through the Nanocomposites Educational Kits and new course modules on nanocomposite materials. This research will also be integrated into minority programs, women engineering programs, and outreach programs at both universities.</AbstractNarration>
