<AbstractNarration>This award is to support the renewal of the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site program at the University of Idaho in Moscow, Idaho.  The objectives of this REU site are: (1) to introduce undergraduate physics majors to the excitement of physics research, (2) to train these students in the laboratory skills needed in modern physics research, (3) to foster student personal growth by having the students work in teams and by teaching them the ethical dimension of scientific research, and (4) to promote diversity in the field of physics by encouraging applicants and participants from under-represented groups.  The Idaho physics faculty will design research projects that are challenging yet viable.  Both theoretical and experimental projects will be made available.  The students will be encouraged to work in small groups to foster teamwork skills. Weekly meetings will be held to allow the students to interact and to keep each other posted on their progress.  The REU students will interact with Idaho faculty, research staff personnel, post-doctoral researchers, graduate students and undergraduates.  Supplementary activities will include weekly lunch together with faculty and weekend activities that revolve around the tremendous outdoor experiences available in Idaho.  The program will conclude with REU student research presentations.</AbstractNarration>

"Doped ZnO and MgZnO Nanoparticles as Hydrogen Gas Sensor," "Study of Nanomaterial Growth and Characterization," Synthesis of Nanoporous Metals and its Applications," "Analysis of Boulders Ejected from Martian Impact Craters," "Synthesis of Iron Nanoparticles," "Fabrication of Metallic Nanoporous Films," "Fabrication of Barium Ferrite Thick Films,"  "Exploring the Effects of Hydrogen Gas Exposure on Nanowires," "Synthesis of One Dimensional Nanostructures," "Fabrication of Titanium Oxide Nano-cluster Films in Dye-Sensitized Solar Cell Application," "Use of Non-equilibrium Methodology to Estimate the Potential of Mean Force."   Their research resulted in ten journal publications and seven conference presentations.  They also learned oral, written communication skills, and developed the necessary skills to becoming successful scientists and members of society. They also learned the ethical dimensions of scientific research.       Last Modified: 06/07/2012       Submitted by: Wei J Yeh]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
