<AbstractNarration>Tutorials  in  Introductory  Physics is a research-based curriculum that has been demonstrably effective at improving students' conceptual understanding when introduced in lieu of a standard recitation section in the introductory calculus-based course.  The project is creating a set of fifteen laboratories, some of which  are  based on Tutorials.  Others are based on new and existing research into student understanding of three areas: conservation of energy and momentum, vectors, and torque and rotation.  The laboratories then undergo an iterative development cycle of research, evaluation, and implementation and are being tested at 6 universities that serve diverse student populations.    &lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project includes goals to (1) contribute to efforts to understand the needs of different student populations; (2) widen the impact of research-based curriculum, improving the introductory physics course on a national scale; (3) build upon proven curricular materials; and (4) develop assessment instruments for specific topics that are currently inadequately addressed by existing instruments. &lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this project is to (1) broaden the research base for effective curriculum development in introductory physics; (2) disseminate the results of research on the teaching and learning of physics; (3) model effective laboratory  pedagogy to physics faculty  and teaching assistants; (4) serve women, underrepresented minorities, and persons with disabilities with aspirations for careers in science-related fields; and (5) provide a laboratory experience involving the process of scientific inquiry. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
