    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) phase I research aims to develop a dual-layer protective coating system for carbon/carbon (C/C) composites, using a novel, low-cost sol-gel method. The success of the dual-layer coating technology has been proven earlier by the company?s the physical vapor deposition (PVD) process, which is, however, quite expensive. The proposed research aims to use a low-coast process to achieve the same quality and performance goals with an overall low-cost manufacturing process. The C/C composites are used in the construction of pressure pads for aircraft braking systems exposed to extremes of temperatures and other harsh environments (e.g. airport runways and aircraft de-icing chemicals and use of temperature-indicating crayons during maintenance checks performed during refueling). This exposure to chemicals accelerates oxidation of the carbon composites and premature failure of brakes. The currently used oxidation protection technology is not adequate for the achievement of lifetime of the brakes as specified by the design. Thus, this technology, with its novel, low-cost coating process, has a significant benefit for improving the service life of critical brake pads.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this technology, if successfully developed and implemented on a commercial scale, will significantly improve the performance of a critical aircraft component. Other potential civilian markets for this technology will be in the auto race car engines which also experience very harsh operating environments during racing events. Additionally, this technology could open up new applications for the use of C/C composites in brake pads in the long-haul transportation rigs running on America?s highways. Thus, successful development an implementation of this technology will have significant impact on the U.S civilian and military vehicles, by improving the reliability&lt;br/&gt;and durability of the critical braking systems, which will save lives, improve fuel efficiency and performance of our critical transportation infrastructure.</AbstractNarration>
