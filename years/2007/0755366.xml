<AbstractNarration>This award is to support the renewal of the REU site run by JILA (formerly Joint Institute of Laboratory Astrophysics) and the Department of Physics at the University of Colorado.   The primary objective is to provide opportunities for undergraduate students to participate in high quality ongoing research programs.  Each year selected students will spend 10 weeks during the summer at the University of Colorado in Boulder.  The intellectual focus of the REU program is physics and undergraduate students are paired up with preeminent faculty to do research in the fields of Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics, Biophysics, Condensed Matter Physics, Elementary Particle and Nuclear Physics, Plasma Physics, Physics Education Research, and Geophysics.  Although the main emphasis of the summer is centered around each student's individual research lab, where the students are expected to master at least a part of a large task, a variety of other activities take place during the program.  This includes the electronics and machining classes in the first two weeks of the program, a weekly seminar series aimed at the students, and lab tours.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our program was titled "Research Experience for Undergraduates at Physics/JILA" and is centered at the University of Colorado, Boulder.  Every summer for 10 weeks we brought in 10-14 undergraduate students from around the country to perform research within a group lead by a faculty member and (typically) consisting of postdoctoral researchers, graduate students, and perhaps other undergraduate researchers.  32 different faculty-led research groups hosted these 41 students over the grant period.  We paid particular attention to recruit under-represented groups (women and minorities) as well as to include students from small colleges and universities, since students at these institutions are less likely to have opportunities to be involved with research at their home institutions.  Areas of research included atomic, molecular, and optical physics, biophysics, condensed matter physics, chemical physics, physics education research, high energy physics, and plasma physics.  Every week of the program, one of the participating professors gave a lecture and a lab tour about their specific research project. We also had machine shop classes, electronics classes, ethics lectures, a program on 'getting into grad school', and a number of social activities. In the last week of the program each student gave a 15 minute presentation about their research. Each student also turned in a final paper describing their research project.  Through the participation of the students, each of the projects also gets a boost, helping the individual research projects.  The effectiveness of the students in boosting the individual projects is indicated by the large number of publications involving these students.  Our main and most important outcome is in contributions to human resource development in physics.  We did a variety of evaluations of the effectiveness of the program and the satisfaction of the students with the program. We found that the program was in general very well received and worthwhile.  We have used this feedback to continue to improve our program.  These students are then better equipped to contribute to the rest of society. Not all of the students that we educate stay within physics or even within science.  However, the understanding that they gain about the scientific process and how research is performed will be beneficial to them and to their future colleagues, no matter what they end up doing.
