<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;This proposal unites academic research groups at the University of Virginia, Cornell University, and Florida State University with a leading polyolefin industrial scientist at ExxonMobil Research and Engineering Corporation.  The research focuses on the development of novel polypropylene synthetic chemistry and an exploration of the fundamental physical phenomena underlying nucleation and growth in quiescent and flow-induced crystallization of semicrystalline polymers.  Specifically, the PIs will use branching architecture as a tool to control nucleation and thereby manipulate the final crystalline morphology and macroscopic material properties.&lt;br/&gt;The team assembled to achieve this goal is skilled in novel polyolefin synthesis, crystallization kinetics and structural characterization, rheology and flow-induced crystallization, and industrial polymer processing.  Model isotactic polypropylene (iPP) materials, including narrow molecular weight distribution linear, star, H-, and comb polymers, will be synthesized with precisely controlled stereoregularity and location of branch points.  Quiescent crystallization experiments will principally seek to ascertain: (1) the influence of increasing chain irregularity due to branching on the level of crystalline organization and relative content of the alpha and gamma phases in homopolymer samples; and (2) the type and conformation of branching architecture that enhances nucleation in blends with linear chains.&lt;br/&gt;Flow-induced crystallization of linear and branched iPP blends will seek to determine: (1) how crystallization kinetics, nucleation density, degree of crystallinity, and crystalline structure are influenced by branching for fixed longest relaxation time; (2) if molecular architecture alters the local segmental orientation to promote nucleation; and (3) how polymorphism and morphology depend upon the number of arms (stars), ratio of branch to main chain molecular weight (H-polymers), and number of branch points (combs).  &lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;Over 43 million tons of thermoplastic resins are produced in the U.S. each year with an estimated market value of over $65 billion.  Much processing is performed in an ad hoc manner without the benefit of modeling or coherent blending strategies.  Since the raw materials are often not renewable, waste in processing has a significant environmental impact.  Moreover, the ability to exert better control over crystallinity and crystalline morphology will lead to better films, lighter weight parts, and also inject inexpensive PP materials into novel applications due to extended material properties.  By providing quiescent and flow-induced crystallization data on well-defined material systems, theoretical tools allowing quantitative predictions of semicrystalline morphology are expected to result from this work.  Students in Chemistry and Chemical Engineering will be not only be exposed to modern polymer synthesis and characterization, rheology, and material characterization techniques (e.g., X-ray scattering, birefringence, optical and transmission electron microscopy), but they will also be able to participate in industrial research experiences at ExxonMobil.  The PIs will also combine their diverse talents and perspectives to assemble a K12 educational program on "Plastics" to be adopted in their respective communities.  The PIs also have a record of including underrepresented groups in their research efforts (e.g., undergraduates from Ghana and Panama and several female undergraduates, graduates, and postdocs).  Additionally, the FAMU-FSU College of Engineering is a jointly managed program of FAMU, a historically black college and university, and FSU with 40% minority and 25% female enrollment, and numerous African-American undergraduates have conducted undergraduate research in the laboratory of the PI at that institution.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
