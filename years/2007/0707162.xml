<AbstractNarration>Proposal Summary&lt;br/&gt;Wildfire, although a natural and periodic phenomena, has an immediate and sometimes devastating&lt;br/&gt;effect on watersheds. The impacts of wildfire can include high rates of overland flow, high&lt;br/&gt;sedimentation rates, decreased water quality, and destructive debris flows. Southern California is&lt;br/&gt;prone to widespread fires at the urban-wildland interface due to its Mediterranean climate (wet&lt;br/&gt;winters, dry summers), prevalent Santa Anna winds during the fall season, and an ever-expanding&lt;br/&gt;population which is responsible for igniting many of the observed fires. The Day Fire, which&lt;br/&gt;recently occurred north of Los Angeles, consumed nearly 254 square miles of National Forest and&lt;br/&gt;designated wilderness areas. Several major drinking water reservoirs for the metropolitan region are&lt;br/&gt;located downstream from the Day Fire burn area, presenting an immediate and serious concern for&lt;br/&gt;water resource managers. One of these reservoirs, located on the eastern fringe of the burn, is&lt;br/&gt;Pyramid Lake, which stores water from the California Aqueduct as well as natural inflows from the&lt;br/&gt;Piru Creek watershed. The objective of this proposal is to understand the physical and chemical&lt;br/&gt;mechanisms that control nutrient, metal and other contaminant fluxes in post-fire watersheds, with a&lt;br/&gt;focus on the Pyramid Lake reservoir system. A SGER grant is critical to this objective as it allows an&lt;br/&gt;immediate field campaign focused on the physical and chemical parameters related to likely primary&lt;br/&gt;problems.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit. This work addresses fundamental questions on the impacts of fire on metal and&lt;br/&gt;nutrient transport and cycling in watershed systems. By enabling coordinated, spatiotemporally&lt;br/&gt;dense observations of multiple parameters in terrestrial, aqueous and sediment phases within one&lt;br/&gt;watershed system, we will be able to elucidate complex transport relationships in post-fire&lt;br/&gt;watersheds. While there has been considerable literature demonstrating the effects of fire on&lt;br/&gt;hydrologic processes, we do not fully understand the relationships between sediment flux and&lt;br/&gt;nutrient and metal transport in post-fire systems. Ultimately, we plan to use the collected data to&lt;br/&gt;develop mechanistic and watershed scale models of nutrients, metals and sediment transport in postfire&lt;br/&gt;watershed systems.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts. The proposed research represents a unique opportunity to understand a crucial water&lt;br/&gt;quality issue, while also synergizing with on-going hydrological and geomorphologic studies to&lt;br/&gt;define and address issues fundamental to response and recovery in burned watersheds. Our study&lt;br/&gt;will be the first to investigate the potential effects of fire on nutrient and metal transport in a streamreservoir&lt;br/&gt;system which is an integral part of the regional water supply in a semi-arid region.&lt;br/&gt;Ecosystem and water supply managers will be able to utilize information gathered in this study to&lt;br/&gt;develop mitigation and warning strategies for reducing the impacts from increased metal and&lt;br/&gt;nutrient fluxes in burned watersheds. This proposal will also contribute to the education of one&lt;br/&gt;Ph.D. graduate student at UCLA, as well as undergraduate students at the University of the Pacific&lt;br/&gt;and UCLA. UCLA undergraduate students will develop undergraduate research projects (taken as&lt;br/&gt;CEE199) involving data collection and analysis, field surveys, and/or modeling studies, and Pacific&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate students will incorporate data collection and analysis into Senior Thesis projects.</AbstractNarration>
