<AbstractNarration>A novel lightweight functionally graded polymer based composite material will be developed in this project. This material will have substantially higher energy absorption in quasi-static and dynamic loading conditions compared to other lightweight materials. The proposed functionally graded material (FGM) is based on creating a dispersion of hollow micro-particles of glass according to their wall thickness in a polymeric matrix. The gradient in wall thickness will provide a better control over properties of these FGMs compared to the existing FGMs that are based on creating a gradient of particle volume fraction. The new FGM structure will be designed and optimized through extensive theoretical and experimental analysis. The experimental research will include development of processing methods, characterization of mechanical properties and development of structure-property correlations. Analytical models for two- (matrix and particles) and three-phase (matrix, particles and air voids) composite materials will be developed using homogenization techniques. These models will be applicable to hollow and solid particle filled composites and will provide significantly enhanced predictive capabilities over the currently available models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is the first comprehensive attempt to unify the concept of solid and hollow particle filled composites by defining solid particles as a special case of hollow particles. The mew FGM will open up several possibilities for future research in smart composites, self healing composites, bio-compatible materials and highly damping materials. The immediate applications of the new FGMs are expected to be in higher damage withstanding structures. Future possibilities lie in automobile structures, bio-medical implants, sports equipment and self healing components. Extensive educational activities are planned for graduate, undergraduate and high school students as part of the project. The results will be disseminated widely through journal publications, conference presentations and inclusion in the relevant courses.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
