<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;This award will provide support to defray expenses of participants at three mini-conferences in harmonic analysis and related areas that will take place in Fall  2008, 2009, and 2010 at Auburn University. These mini-conferences represent the continuation of a longstanding series of meetings (thirty-six at last count), most of which have been held at Auburn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the Fall 2008 meeting, 40-50 participants from about thirty regional universities as well as from other institutions are expected. The program will feature three principal speakers, who will deliver one-hour lectures, and a number of twenty-minute talks. Significant participation by graduate students from both Auburn University and other institutions typifies this conference series. The programs for the later meetings, still in the planning stages, will have a similar structure. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ During the three-year project period, we organized three Mini-Conferences on Harmonic Analysis and Related Areas, with 2 to 3  main invited speakers each year who gave 2 one hour lectures each and 5 to 6  invited 1-hour speakers.  Also we had a number of contributed talks of 25-minutes each, all of them being led by mathematicians or young "rising stars" on the subject of the conference.  We had an average of 35 participants each year, all of which are active research mathematicians from a number of states in the USA, Canada and Mexico and some from overseas (Japan, Germany, Taiwan, Brazil, China, Australia).   We have found that this conference, which is part of a series of Mini-Conferences that began in 1985, to be rewarding and stimulating, proving once again that there is no better way to do mathematics than through personal contact among mathematicians. The presence and participation of highly talented mathematicians has been a very important step forward in bringing analysts from all over the country (and the world) together and this made the Mini-Conference series a total success. These meetings also served the purpose of providing mathematicians at small colleges (many of them being traditionally black institutions) in the region the opportunity to have exposure to the new and exciting research in the field.  The benefits of the Mini-Conference series will be felt throughout time. The knowledge acquired will come out in bits and pieces and has already had a tremendous impact on the research at Auburn University.
