<AbstractNarration>This project is focused on the development of new synthetic route to highly functionalized allyl vinyl ethers utilizing an inexpensive copper promoter.  The specific aims include 1) development of an efficient, mild, versatile, environmentally friendly, stereospecific, and widely applicable route to allyl vinyl ethers; 2) demonstration of the methodology for synthesis of highly functionalized vinyl ethers in general; 3) development of new chemistry of the readily available functionalized vinyl ethers including new modes of cyclization; and 4) expansion of the scope of copper cross coupling chemistry and development of a greater understanding of the factors that control the reactivity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Professor Craig A. Merlic, of the Department of Chemistry at University of California-Los Angeles.  Professor Craig A. Merlic's research efforts revolve around the discovery, development, and exploitation of novel reactions effected by inexpensive copper compounds. Such novel reactions offer promise for efficient approaches for the synthesis of complex organic molecules which are highly important in the pharmaceutical, agrochemical, and materials industries.</AbstractNarration>
