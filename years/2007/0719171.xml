    <AbstractNarration>Professor David Tyler, Department of Chemistry, University of Oregon (UO), is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program for a collaborative study between the Tyler research group at UO and researchers at Rohm and Hass on the development of a sulfuric acid-free method for the synthesis of methacrylates. The primary goal of the proposed research at UO is to develop a viable, homogeneously catalyzed process involving a key reaction in a proposed sulfuric acid-free industrial synthesis of methacrylates. The current industrial method uses sulfuric acid and generates about 2.5 kg of ammonium hydrogen sulfate per kg of methacrylate product. The treatment and disposal of the ammonium hydrogen sulfate contribute not only to higher product costs but also to wasted energy, raw material loss, and an unnecessary impact on the environment. The development of a successful sulfuric acid-free process would be an impressive application of "green chemistry" to a major industrial process. A successful sulfuric acid-free reaction developed on a laboratory scale at the University of Oregon will be studied on a larger scale by industrial collaborators at Rohm and Haas, who will also investigate how to combine various catalyzed reactions to give new sulfuric acid-free processes for the production of methyl methacrylate and related products. For the purpose of enhancing the education and professional development of graduate students, the Chemistry Department at UO has a history of working collaboratively with a variety of partners including local and regional industries, local K-12 school systems, and numerous regional colleges and universities. Meetings and teleconferences with researchers at Rohm and Haas and significantly long visits to the Rohm and Haas labs giving hands-on industrial experience will allow students to learn how chemistry developed in academic research labs is translated into large-scale manufacturing processes. This industrial exposure will give them a distinct edge in the practical world. Underrepresented groups will have a strong presence in the graduate and undergraduate student audience that participates in the research supported by this grant.</AbstractNarration>
