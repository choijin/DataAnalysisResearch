<AbstractNarration>This experimental research program explores an optically-trapped, strongly interacting Fermi gas of lithium-6 atoms as a model for exotic, strongly interacting matter in nature. The strength of the attraction or repulsion between the atoms is easily tuned using a magnetic field, enabling stringent tabletop tests of predictions for nuclear matter, which is not accessible to direct measurement. A primary goal of the program is the measurement of quantum viscosity, which will enable a test of a recent string theory conjecture on the minimum viscosity of strongly interacting "nearly perfect" fluids.  The experimental program offers unprecedented opportunities to test state-of-the-art theoretical techniques that cross disciplinary boundaries, from high temperature superconductors in materials science, to the physics of the quark-gluon plasma that existed during the Big Bang of the early universe. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The experiments have practical impact in helping to determine whether it is possible to create super-high temperature superconductors that operate far above room temperature?materials that would enable energy-saving power lines and magnetically levitated trains. Data from the experiments are provided to condensed matter and nuclear theorists in several countries, including the United States, Germany, China, and Australia. Further, the PI is part of an International Alliance started at the Kirchhoff Institute for Physics in Heidelberg, which connects Fermi gases to high energy physics.  The research program will also serve as a learning environment for undergraduate students, graduate students, and post doctoral associates who work as a team to devise, construct, and perform new experiments and then to theoretically analyze the results. Members of the team are engaged in all aspects of the program, and have the opportunity to write and present papers and to give talks at conferences. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This program on ultracold atomic gases has explored a remarkable conjecture from the string theory community on {\it perfect fluids}, which unifies several fields of physics and connects the hottest matter in the universe to the coldest matter. An example of a nearly perfect fluid is the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) produced in gold ion collisions. A QGP is an exotic soup of quarks and gluons, which exhibits almost perfect frictionless flow and is thought to be a good approximation to the state of matter that existed microseconds after the Big Bang. At a temperature of two trillion degrees, where even the constituents of atomic nuclei melt, a QGP is the hottest matter in the universe.

Remarkably, an ultracold atomic Fermi gas, at ten billionths of a degree, also exhibit nearly perfect fluidity. The Fermi gas comprises just a few hundred thousand spin-up and spin-down atoms in an optical trap made of a focused laser beam. An external magnetic field controls the strength of the interaction between spin-up and spin-down atoms, which interact very strongly when the field is correctly tuned. In this regime, the atoms share a common feature with a QGP, which is nineteen orders of magnitude hotter and twenty-five orders of magnitude more dense than the Fermi gas. Both systems exhibit similar ``elliptic" flow, Fig.1, which is a consequence of extremely low viscosity. In this program, the viscosity of a strongly interacting Fermi gas was measured for the first time by observing both elliptic flow and vibrations of the trapped gas. Fig. 2 shows a collision between two clouds, which exhibits shock waves.     The tabletop experiments carried out in the program impact theories of strong interactions in intellectual disciplines well outside atomic physics, including materials science and condensed matter physics (superconductivity), nuclear physics (nuclear matter, quark-gluon plasma), high-energy physics (theories of strong interactions), and astrophysics (compact stellar objects). This research on nearly perfect flow may  have practical impact in helping to determine whether it is possible to create super-high temperature superconductors which operate far above room temperature--materials that would enable energy-saving power lines and magnetically levitated trains. For this reason, the proposed program fits very well into  national initiatives  in materials science.       Last Modified: 07/12/2011       Submitted by: John E Thomas]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
