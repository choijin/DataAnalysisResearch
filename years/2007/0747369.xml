<AbstractNarration>Computation has fundamentally changed the way we study nature. Recent breakthroughs in data collection technology, such as GPS and other mobile sensors, gene sequencing, and microsatellite genotyping, are giving biologists access to data about wild populations, from genetic to social interactions, that are orders of magnitude richer than any previously collected. Such data offer the promise of answering some of the big questions in population biology: How do animals form social groups and how do genetic ties affect these processes? Which individuals are leaders and to what degree do they control the behavior of others? How do social interactions affect the survival of a species? Unfortunately,in this domain,our ability to analyze data lags substantially behind our ability to collect it. There are three major drawbacks with currently available techniques for analysis of both genotypic and social structure data. First, most traditional methods are aggregate and numeric, thus they are inappropriate for identifying infrequent yet critical events, such as response to predation. Second, the newer approaches focus on human populations and are not directly applicable in the context of wildlife biology. Finally, current analysis techniques are essentially static in that all information about the time and order of social interactions or the concurrency of gene expressions is discarded. Thus, they lack the expressive and computational power to answer the questions outlined above. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this interdisciplinary research is to develop a robust and scalable computational framework for the emerging field of computational population biology. Ultimately, this research will enable biologists in their scientific inquiry to take advantage of new data by focusing on its underlying qualitative (rather than numerical) and explicitly dynamic structure. This research will use combinatorial techniques to extract that structure. In the scope of this project the following will be developed:&lt;br/&gt;1. Techniques for inferring genetic relationships in wildlife populations and using them to predict genetic diversity.&lt;br/&gt;2. Novel computational methodologies and tools for analyzing dynamic social interactions, focusing on prediction of interaction patterns and dynamic processes within populations.&lt;br/&gt;3. Techniques for combining the genetic and the social structures of a population and across species to identify global ecological processes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;Many students, especially female, turn away from computer science in part because of the perceived lack of its applicability to real-world issues and impact on the society. This project has the potential to attract those who would otherwise be lost to computing by providing the view of its larger impact and connection to science. A comprehensive interdisciplinary education and outreach plan will be developed which bridges the traditional pipeline from K-12 to graduate education. The standard views of mathematics and computing will be broadened to include "puzzle-solving" combinatorial thinking by introducing hands-on outreach activities. The unique conflation of wild life biology and computing will continue to be presented at various forums aimed at attracting minorities and girls to science and computer science. Finally, through introduction of biological motivation in computer science courses and the computational methodology in biology courses, this research will provide the students in both disciplines with experiences in asking and answering biological questions by developing new applications of computer science. The methodologies, concepts, and tools developed as part of this interdisciplinary research will be useful to scientists in diverse fields such as behavioral ecology, conservation biology, and disease ecology. Techniques for analysis of social structures have broader relevance to human societies, especially in the context of epidemiology, dissemination of ideas, and crisis management.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

Unfortunately, in the domain of population biology, as in many others,&nbsp;our ability to analyze data lags substantially behind our ability to collect it.</p> <p>In this project, we have established the fields of Computational Population Biology and Computational Ecology. We have defined the scientific framework of asking biological questions, translating them into computational abstractions, finding, quite often developing de novo, computational solutions that would result in biological insights. We demonstrated how computational approaches can be part of every stage of the scientific process of understanding animal sociality, from intelligent data collection to hypothesis formulation, and provide scientific insight into collective behavior of zebras, baboons, and humans.&nbsp;</p> <p>To leverage DNA data about populations, we have developed algorithms and computational tools for inferring kinship relationships from genetic data. We have deployed our tools as a web-based application, freely available to anybody, at <a href="http://kinalyzer.cs.uic.edu/">kinalyzer.cs.uic.edu</a> (Fig 3). More than 100,000 kinship inference requests from scientists all over the world have been fulfilled by Kinalyzer since it went live in 2009.</p> <p>To understand the social behavior of animals, we have developed a computational framework for analysis of dynamic social networks (Fig 5). The fundamentally innovative aspect of our approach is that we did not consider networks as static objects but, as they are in reality, constantly, often rapidly, changing. Methods for sampling networks, finding the right temporal scale for analysis of these highly dynamic objects, finding periodic patterns and fluid dynamic communities within them, predicting their structure, and analyzing the spread of processes propagating over them, such as information and diseases. We are making our methods freely available as a suite of R analytical language packages <em>tgraph.</em> We have applied our methods for network analysis to understand the fundamental evolutionary differences between two closely related species of equids, Grevy&rsquo;s zebra and wild asses (Fig 1). Others have used our framework to gain insight into the social behavior of many other animals, including humans.</p> <p>To grow the field of computational ecology, we have developed a course in Field Computational Ecology. This is a highly integrated, interdisciplinary field course based on a &lsquo;frontier problem-solving&rsquo; model where experts from several disciplines bring together their different perspectives and expertise to collaborate on a complex project, in our case, ecology, animal behavior, and computer science. Graduate students in biology (primarily animal behavior, ecology and evolutionary anthropology) and engineering (primarily computer science and bioinformatics) worked with faculty in all disciplines to learn how to ask questions, frame hypotheses and understand how and why the disciplines and cultures do this differently (Figs 4). The course was successfully taught three times, with the field component in Kenya, with many successful student projects that resulted in many publications and developed into larger projects, some of which continue to this day. Many students who were trained in this course are continuing in interdisciplinary careers. We have made the syllabus and the model of the course available for others to use.</p> <p>More than twenty graduate students in biology and computer science and many undergraduates worked on research projects that stemmed out of the work supported directly or indirectly by this grant. Many collaborations have been born and this grant gave rise to other projects, some of which continue to this day. Most notably, the work on network analysis is being applied to understand the workings of a brain (Fig 6) and innovative approach for recognizing zebras from photographs, developed during the first offering of the Field Computational Ecology course, has grown into the Wildbook system which is now deployed for over a dozen species and is continuing to grow to support wildlife research and conservation world-wide (Fig 2). The attractive application to animal biology served as a great introduction to computer science in countless talks delivered by the PI to wider public, from elementary and middle school audiences to the White House Frontiers conference.</p> <p>In summary, impacts of this research span computer science, biology, education, and social sciences. Many outcomes go well beyond academia and have an impact on our society and the biodiversity of our planet. At the time when computation, particularly AI and Data Science, are becoming an inherent part of every aspect of our lives, this project has laid the foundation for bringing that technology to ecology
