<AbstractNarration>Howard University, through the HBCU-UP Educational Research Project grant, aims to discover the institutional, instructional and individual factors that are related to success in producing African American science and mathematics teachers at HBCUs.  Through application of mixed methods, the proposers seek to answer the following question:  what factors lead to success in producing African American science and mathematics teachers at HBCUs?  The methodology will include case study of teacher preparation programs, interview study of current African American science and mathematics teachers who are recent graduates of HBCUs, and a longitudinal study of a cohort of students majoring in science and mathematics at an HBCU.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Analysis of the data will utilize qualitative and quantitative techniques, including issue-focused analysis, cross-case displays and synthesis, pattern matching and descriptive and multivariate statistics.  The project aims to advance knowledge on best practices for the supply and preparation of teachers at HBCUs.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
