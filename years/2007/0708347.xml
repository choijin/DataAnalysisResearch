<AbstractNarration>0708347&lt;br/&gt;John N. Harb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal was received in response to the Active Nanostructures and Nanosystems initiative, NSF 06-595, category NIRT.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An alternative to top-down fabrication of electrical circuits is to use self-assembly of molecules to form the smallest circuit structures, and combine these molecular circuits with interconnections fabricated by top-down techniques.  The dimensions of molecules and molecular templates are such that devices with exceptionally narrow linewidths are possible.  In addition, self-assembly is inherently parallel, making it amenable to high-throughput fabrication at reasonable cost.  This project seeks to combine the complementary advantages of bottom-up self-assembly with top-down patterning, with the goal of developing a process for fabrication of nanoelectronic circuits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To accomplish this objective, an interdisciplinary research group, ASCENT (ASsembled nanoCircuit Elements by Nucleic acid Templating), has been formed at BYU.  Efforts are focused on the development and refinement of four key technologies:  (1) solution-phase molecular circuit assembly, (2) high-resolution chemical surface patterning, (3) high-resolution metallization of molecular templates, and (4) chemically directed assembly and integration of molecular circuits on surfaces.  Molecular circuits will be self-assembled in solution using customized DNA templates ("test-tube circuits").  DNA self-assembly is particularly powerful because of the large number of possible nucleic-acid sequences that enable highly selective bonding of DNA strands to each other and to other molecules.  Chemomechanical patterning, a method that we have developed, will be used to chemically modify the SiO2 substrate.  This chemical patterning will provide anchor points to attach and align the molecular circuits on the surface, as well as provide a means for local wiring to the anchored circuit, all with a resolution &lt; 10 nm.  Electroless metal plating of both the exposed DNA and chemically templated lines will then electrically connect active circuit elements to each other and to the larger-scale architecture.  The net result will be DNA-templated molecular circuits that have been aligned and wired locally on an oxide surface.  Interconnect technology similar to that used currently in the semiconductor industry can then be applied to create the larger global wiring needed for practical devices based on the proposed molecular circuits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts including a strong emphasis on undergraduate research, an outreach program to the local Hispanic community and others, and a multidisciplinary environment for graduate education.  The potential societal impact of the technology is that it may provide an innovative solution to the semiconductor industry's need for greater resolution, and it does so using technologies that evolve naturally from and connect well to current microfabrication processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Nanostructures That Can Self-Assemble  It is difficult to imagine that a pile of Legos&reg; could assemble itself into a desired object.  However, on a molecular level, such self assembly is not only possible, but critical to key processes of life.  An understanding of the factors that control self assembly combined with careful molecular design enables scientists and engineers to assemble a variety of nanostructures (one nanometer is one billionth of a meter) by simply mixing up the pieces and letting them put themselves together.   This project involves the use of self assembly to make nanostructures from DNA.  These nanostructures then serve as templates upon which other materials can be deposited, with the end objective of creating useful nanometer-sized devices.  Applications of interest include nanoelectronic circuits and nanosensors, among others.  Work on this project was performed by an interdisciplinary research group consisting of chemists, chemical engineers and physicists at BYU, with funding from the National Science Foundation (CBET 0708347).  Working together, we were able to develop ways of assembling DNA into new types of nanoscale structures with a variety of shapes and sizes.  We were also able to put different metals onto these DNA templates and measure how well they were able to conduct electricity.  Can you imagine measuring the current flow through a wire that is less than one millionth of a meter long?  In addition to being able to put metal on all of a self-assembled DNA shape, we developed a way to put a continuous metal layer on only part of the structure by using the molecular code of DNA to specify the location.   Other aspects of our work included developing ways to put different types of materials on DNA templates (different metals and semiconductors).  We also explored ways of creating patterns of molecules on surfaces that are designed to attach to our DNA structures.  The methods developed in this project provide the foundation for a new generation of nanodevices based on self-assembled structures.    This multidisciplinary study provided an ideal educational experience for 12 graduate students and 16 undergraduate students that contributed to the project.  All of these students have received training in nanotechnology and are prepared to make future contributions to this important area.  Several of the undergraduate students have gone on to graduate school as a result of their undergraduate research experience.  Four of the students working on the project had the chance to travel overseas and participate firsthand in a collaborative effort with a world-class research institute in Germany.   Finally, students working on the project developed and taught science lessons, complete with fun demonstrations, to 5th and 6th grade students at a local school with a large minority population.  This outreach program provided a wonderful learning experience for both those doing the teaching and the children being taught, helping to prepare a new generation of scientists and engineers.
