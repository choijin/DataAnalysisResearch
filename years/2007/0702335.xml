<AbstractNarration>Large and sparse matrix computational problems are often solved by certain&lt;br/&gt;subspace projection methods -- most commonly Krylov subspace type projections.&lt;br/&gt;The basic idea is to project the original problems (matrices) of high dimensions&lt;br/&gt;onto certain subspaces to arrive at smaller and manageable ones, and the smaller&lt;br/&gt;reduced problems can then be solved by one of the dense matrix algorithms such as&lt;br/&gt;those in LAPACK. Existing projection techniques often do not preserve structural&lt;br/&gt;properties enjoyed by eigenproblems from various engineering applications, and&lt;br/&gt;therefore the reduced problems do not necessarily reflect their practical&lt;br/&gt;backgrounds in any meaningful ways. It is conceivable, as it is often the case,&lt;br/&gt;that approximating a problem by one of its own kind would do better. Indeed there&lt;br/&gt;are cases where structural preserving methods are far superior to those that are&lt;br/&gt;blind to the inherent structures. The objective of this proposal is to exploit&lt;br/&gt;in depth structural properties of matrices from the standpoint of their application&lt;br/&gt;backgrounds and to develop accurate and efficient structural preserving numerical&lt;br/&gt;methods for eigenvalue and related problems of practical significance. A number of&lt;br/&gt;interesting ideas will be pursued here, including a general framework for carrying&lt;br/&gt;out structural preserving subspace projections, an unifying convergence analysis&lt;br/&gt;for all Krylov subspace type projections that connects moment matching properties&lt;br/&gt;in reduced order modeling and eigenvalue and eigenvector convergence theory, and a&lt;br/&gt;sub-orthogonalization process that will serve as the basis to devise efficient&lt;br/&gt;projections.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eigenproblems appear ubiquitously all across applied science and engineering,&lt;br/&gt;and their solutions are routinely sought and are critical in one way or another&lt;br/&gt;to various scientific computational tasks. Examples includes computational&lt;br/&gt;problems from structural dynamics, control systems, circuit simulations,&lt;br/&gt;computational electromagnetics and microelectromechanical systems, data mining,&lt;br/&gt;and web search engine design, etc. This investigation shall advance significantly&lt;br/&gt;the underlying engineering applications by making the involved matrix computations&lt;br/&gt;much less expensive, more accurate, and most importantly result in scientific&lt;br/&gt;simulations that reflect better the underlying physics. Graduate students with&lt;br/&gt;emerging expertise in numerical eigenvalue computations will be involved.</AbstractNarration>
