<AbstractNarration>This award from the Instrumentation for Materials Research - Midscal Instrumentation program and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activity in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate supports a collaborative team from University of Illinois Chicago, University of Illinois Urbana Champaign, and the University of Michigan to construct a new instrument. The instrument called Intermediate Energy X-ray Collaborative Development Team (IEX-CDT) will be located at the Advanced Photon Source (APS) and will combine two techniques: angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy and soft x-ray resonant scattering studies of materials and patterned devices, with a spot size of order of few micrometer. Uniting these two techniques in a single facility will allow to investigate new materials and, more broadly, to bridge the realms of synchrotron-based x-ray scattering and spectroscopy. In addition, the Department of Energy, through the APS budget, will provide $ 3.17 M million towards the construction costs. The APS will also provide engineering expertise, strict safety oversight, and quality assurance procedures.   &lt;br/&gt;The instrument will be a user facility available to the general users through the APS peer-reviewed general user program. The facility will also be available for hands on training within the Argonne's National Laboratory's School on Neutron and X-Ray Scattering. In addition the PIs, plan to organize a soft x-ray science workshop where results obtained at the proposed instrument and similar facilities in other nations, are disseminated through the scientific community. The facility will be maintained and operated by the APS.</AbstractNarration>

The availability of the facility thus greatly enhances the nation's capabilities not only in world-leading materials research but also in the training of students and young scientists.    One of the great scientific challenges of the 21st century is to elucidate the properties of materials that have very complex structures and competing electron interactions.  While such materials offer great promise for the development of advanced energy production and storage systems, next-generation computers, and improved sensor devices, unraveling their complex structure and complicated electron behavior has been a huge obstacle. Moreover, these materials often exhibit different electronic properties in the bulk vs. on the surface.  The IEX combines two powerful probes--angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and resonant soft x-ray scattering (RSXS)--that together produce exquisitely detailed images of the structure and electronic behavior of these materials, both those deeply buried in the interior and those on the surface. Scientists are able to observe structures on the scale of a few nanometers (a sheet of paper is approximately 100,000 nanometers thick) and attosecond time scales (an attosecond is to 1 second as a second is to the age of the universe).  While IEX was designed to investigate solid-state materials, it is already home to a growing program that studies polymers and soft-matter structures--in particular how they self assemble. Applications for such molecular engineering range from microelectronics processing to biological tissue engineering. Thus the scientific impact of the IEX will be much greater and more interdisciplinary than originally anticipated.  Another outcome of the project is that it led to the creation of a technology start-up company in central Illinois to fabricate the high-precision diffraction gratings that are required for IEX and that were previously unavailable from a U.S. manufacturer.  The company, which employs three full-time engineers and has secured venture capital funding, is now producing gratings for several other U.S. national laboratories, in addition to IEX.
