<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;OISE-0755170&lt;br/&gt;Jacob L. Jones, U. Florida&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Piezoelectric materials couple electrical and mechanical displacements and are therefore becoming increasingly valuable in measuring and interacting with our physical world.  Current applications of piezoelectric materials include vibration and displacement sensors, mechanical actuators, sonar, ultrasound, and ferroelectric memories.  This U.S.-Swiss International Research Experience for Students (IRES) project will enable students to become globally active participants in the science and engineering of piezoelectric materials by complementing their existing US research activities with research activities abroad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As part of this IRES program, undergraduate and graduate students will process and structurally characterize various piezoelectric materials at the University of Florida as a component of their ongoing research activities.  These students will then travel to the Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne in Lausanne, Switzerland, and conduct detailed piezoelectric property measurements under the guidance of Dr. Dragan Damjanovic, a leader in the field of piezoelectric property measurements and their interpretation.  The students will then combine their knowledge of the processing, structure, and properties of piezoelectric materials to develop a more fundamental understanding of those materials to enable new technological applications. Specific examples of piezoelectric materials in which students will undertake research activities include polycrystalline piezoelectric ceramics and single crystals, thin films, and piezoelectric polymers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  Research partnerships can provide access to unique resources and intellectual expertise.  The benefits of international research experiences for students go beyond the independent contributions of each partner and facilitate an intellectual synergy by bringing together individuals of different backgrounds and experiences who share unique perceptions, ideas, and problem solutions.  Today's new scientists and engineers must be educated on the benefits and need for international collaboration by obtaining such international research experiences themselves.  The proposed IRES program will enable such experiences through the research theme of science and engineering of piezoelectric materials.  At least five undergraduate and graduate students will obtain an international research experience for at least four weeks each year.  This opportunity is available to any student at the University of Florida within engineering or related disciplines and will be advertised during recruitment of both undergraduate and graduate students.  Numerous methods will be used to encourage participation from underrepresented groups including targeted advertising and the use of stipend supplements during recruitment.  This program will enhance infrastructure for research and education by providing a direct link between the University of Florida and the University in Lausanne.  The research results will promote continued collaboration between these complementary institutions, and the students will develop their own international linkages with local students and staff, promoting a larger societal benefit in the longer term.</AbstractNarration>
