    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project develops a system for facilitating the monoclonal antibody screening process. The system will be a proprietary technology able to significantly shorten the time required for producing antibody-generating hybridomas, and to improve the successful rate for identifying and cloning monoclonal antibodies. The goal is to establish a cellular basis selection system in collaboration with researchers at Hunter College of the City University of New York.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this research are in monoclonal antibody generation and&lt;br/&gt;production. Since monoclonal antibody has become a powerful tool for diagnosis,&lt;br/&gt;treatment and many other purposes in the bioresearch fields, the proposed technology would be of benefit to biotech industry, biodefense against bioterrorism, pharmaceutical industry, and society as a whole. This project also fosters collaboration between industrial biotech and academe.</AbstractNarration>
