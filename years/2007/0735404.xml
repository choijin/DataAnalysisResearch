<AbstractNarration>The CCCP (Carnegie Mellon, Columbia, Cornell, and Princeton) Mathematical Finance Workshop will take place on November 30 and December 1, 2007 at Princeton University. It has been held annually by the participating universities since 2004. In just three years, it has become a cornerstone of the mathematical finance community, providing a platform for the dissemination of cutting-edge research in the field. It brings together participants from different levels to discuss their work openly in a small-sized informal forum. In particular, it gives graduate students an opportunity to expose themselves to the most recent trends in their areas presented by distinguished leaders in the field, to engage in high-level open discussions on these topics, and to present their own research. This provides an ideal setting for the exchange of ideas, the initiation of new projects and scientific collaboration.  Usually, researchers from each of the four participating universities plus one or two guest speakers present their work in a half hour talk. The CCCP Workshop is an open meeting sponsored by the university hosting the event that year. It will be advertised through the four universities' departmental websites, suitable mathematical bulletins, and electronic mailing lists available from past meetings and departmental lists.</AbstractNarration>
