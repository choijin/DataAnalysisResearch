<AbstractNarration>Mathematical and computational models will be used to study populations hierarchically segregated into groups referred to as "households".  These households may represent patches within an agricultural field, fields within a landscape, dorms within a school, schools within a city, cities within a region, or even subnetworks within larger computer networks.  Population models and epidemiological models will be explored within this framework, complementing other work with lattice-structured populations.  In the models, interactions within a household occur much more often than interactions between different households.  Primary goals of the models are to better understand how and why spatially targeted and/or clustered treatments affect dynamics of infections, for example varying the rates of pesticide application to crop fields based on the levels of insect infestations among those fields.  Factors such as spatially varying resistance (both long-term, due to e.g. mosaic planting of different crops in different fields; and short-term, e.g. as a result of pesticides) will be included in the models.  Another application will be better understanding the spread of malicious computer software ("worms") using biological dispersal strategies in clustered heterogeneous computer networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Entomologists and other researchers will cooperate with the principal investigator and his students to develop applications of the project such as controlling maggot flies in commercial blueberry fields in Maine, planthoppers in rice fields in China, and other agricultural crop pests.  Interdisciplinary courses on modeling and simulation will incorporate various topics from the project.  Undergraduate research training will be a significant part of the work, including participation in a summer research program primarily aimed at underrepresented minority groups.  Outreach to high school students and teachers will also be included, with the participation of current undergraduates studying to become K-12 teachers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We studied the spread of malicious software ("computer worms", which are able to spread more easily on their own, without as much assistance from people as computer viruses need) through the Internet.  Such malicious software spreads in a manner similar to the spread of infectious diseases through a human population divided into subgroups (such as cities or other communities).  In human and other biological populations, infectious individuals frequently encounter other individuals within a localized group (in the same dormitory, school, herd, etc.), and occasionally interact with individuals from more remote groups.  Recent generations of computer worms have been engineered with biologically-inspired strategies, where an infected computer preferentially tries to contact nearby computers to infect them, and occasionally reaches out over longer distances for infection attempts.  We showed that, even in a population in which most individuals are immunized or vaccinated against a disease, the presence of "hot spots" (groups where a larger number of individuals opt out of vaccination) can greatly increase the risk and speed that an infection will grow, and increase the number of people affected by the outbreak. The concept of herd immunity breaks down when some groups deviate too much from the average.  It's therefore important to not only achieve a high level of vaccination within a population, but also to minimize the presence of these localized hot spots with lower vaccination levels.  Our models also showed that the authors of computer worms were fairly successful at using biologically-inspired dispersal strategies to enable their software to spread more successfully.  In computer networks, only computer hosts running a particular type of software (i.e. a particular operating system such as Windows/OS-X/Linux, or software such as web servers or file-sharing servers) may be susceptible to a given computer worm.  The computers vulnerable to a given computer worm are distributed in a very uneven way throughout the Internet, again leading to "hot spots", or particular regions in the Internet that are especially susceptible.  Our detailed measurements of the distribution of computer hosts in the Internet have shown that an infected computer can increases its chances of finding other vulnerable computers by a factor of as much as 500 times, by using biologically-inspired strategies to seek out other vulnerable hosts.  Various educational workshops aimed at K-12 students were conducted, sometimes with other high-school students helping to guide the activities.  Mobile simulation software was developed, including a an app "SPEED Sim" ("Spatial Population Ecological and Epidemiological Dynamics Simulations"), available for free for iPad/iPhone/iPod Touch on the Apple iOS App Store.  (A version for Android devices was also released on Google Play, but is not being maintained as actively as the iOS version.)  A prototype version of this app is able to simulate the spread of a computer worm on an entire Internet with 4.3 billion hosts efficiently and quickly even on an iPad; this model will be released to the public app later on.  Additional ongoing K-12 outreach activities are planned, as are public workshops at a Maine Science Festival in 2015.  We are in the final stages of setting up two iPads for exploring simulation models in the Maine Discovery Museum, a children's museum in Maine.
