<AbstractNarration>Li&lt;br/&gt;0703532&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     This CSUMS project links faculty from the departments of&lt;br/&gt;mathematics, computer science, and applied science at William and&lt;br/&gt;Mary to create a computational mathematics component in the&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate program.  Project personnel modify freshman and&lt;br/&gt;sophomore courses to place greater emphasis on computational&lt;br/&gt;issues, thereby preparing undergraduates for special upper&lt;br/&gt;division courses and eventual participation in undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;research.  Students do research projects on theoretical and&lt;br/&gt;practical problems from numerical linear algebra, quantum&lt;br/&gt;computing, optimization, dynamical systems, and mathematical&lt;br/&gt;biology.  Typically, students in the program start doing research&lt;br/&gt;in their junior year and the following summer, and continue their&lt;br/&gt;work during their senior year through carefully supervised honors&lt;br/&gt;theses.  In addition, academic year activities include special&lt;br/&gt;computational mathematics seminars and visitors, plus an annual&lt;br/&gt;workshop in which students present their discoveries.  Important&lt;br/&gt;scientific findings are submitted for publication in professional&lt;br/&gt;journals and presented at scholarly conferences.  In addition,&lt;br/&gt;students discuss their results and experiences in local high&lt;br/&gt;schools, in the Virginia Governor's School for Science and&lt;br/&gt;Mathematics, and in regional two-year colleges.  Such outreach&lt;br/&gt;presentations should attract a larger and more diverse population&lt;br/&gt;of younger students into further study of computational&lt;br/&gt;mathematics, and give research students in the program additional&lt;br/&gt;practice in communicating mathematics to others.  To broaden the&lt;br/&gt;perspective of the students in the program, and to encourage the&lt;br/&gt;interchange of ideas, there are visits to other institutions and&lt;br/&gt;research agencies in the U.S.  and abroad.  A website is set up&lt;br/&gt;to facilitate communication with other research groups and&lt;br/&gt;computational mathematics programs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     At the base of modern computer and information technology is&lt;br/&gt;an interdisciplinary field called computational mathematics. &lt;br/&gt;This project unites the skills and knowledge of faculty from the&lt;br/&gt;departments of mathematics, computer science, and applied science&lt;br/&gt;to create a new computational component within the undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;curriculum.  It prepares students to participate in undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;research projects in the theoretical and practical aspects of&lt;br/&gt;computation, and it builds linkages between the computational&lt;br/&gt;mathematics programs at William and Mary and similar programs&lt;br/&gt;nationally and abroad.  Successful experiences in this program&lt;br/&gt;attract students to further study in computational mathematics&lt;br/&gt;and to careers in the field.  The diverse research backgrounds of&lt;br/&gt;the program's faculty interact to break down the intellectual&lt;br/&gt;compartmentalization that stands in the way of progress for both&lt;br/&gt;our students and our faculty.  The new ideas developed in the&lt;br/&gt;program are disseminated through conference talks and scholarly&lt;br/&gt;publication by our students and their faculty mentors.  Through&lt;br/&gt;outreach to high school and community college programs, they&lt;br/&gt;attract a larger and more diverse group of pre-college students&lt;br/&gt;into computational mathematics programs here and elsewhere.  The&lt;br/&gt;project is supported by the MPS Division of Mathematical&lt;br/&gt;Sciences, the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities, and the&lt;br/&gt;EHR Division of Undergraduate Education.</AbstractNarration>
