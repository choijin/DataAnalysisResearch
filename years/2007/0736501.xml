<AbstractNarration>Kwang W. Oh&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this SGER is to study the feasibility of the mechanics of droplet formation, induction, and sorting using MEMS based microfluidic devices.  The development of detection schemes for a variety of biological targets such as bacterial pathogens, tumor cells, and other biological targets is of great importance.  The goal of this SGER is to demonstarate feasibility study is for a portable device for detection which has a high throughput and is free of environmental contamination&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit:&lt;br/&gt;A specific plan has been developed to show the feasibility in which a droplet containing a single cell labeled with QDs in a microfluidic cytometer will be (1) formed by two-phase (aqueous-in-oil) flow, (2) rapidly detected by fluorescence or scattering signal detectors, (3) inductively charged with a positive or negative high-voltage electric pulse, (4) automatically sorted due to the deflection of the droplet under an electric field, and (5) transported to the next stage for further manipulation processes (for example, for continuous-flow polymerase chain reaction (PCR)). The research tasks will be (1) the study of droplet formation and (2) the study of droplet induction and sorting. If successful, the feasibility study will greatly improve rapid detection and automatic sorting of the biological targets by the aqueous-in-oil droplet based microfluidic system, and enable on-chip post-processing such as single cell handling, lysis, or analysis, due to the aqueous-in-oil droplets serving as isolated compartments, in a single platform. &lt;br/&gt;Broader impact:&lt;br/&gt;The output of this study will provide a quantum jump over current approaches, providing a means by which the targets can be detected and sorted on a high-throughput microfluidic approach, in order to isolate the targets from clinical or environmental samples. Moreover, research findings from this proposed research will be presented as research-based educational materials and implemented in courses in different forms, such as classroom presentation and web courses. In addition, web-based learning modules related to the research outcomes will be launched at MicroTAS.org website (MicroTAS: micro total analysis systems) that is being established by the PI.</AbstractNarration>
