    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0707306&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Lars Andersson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator is proposing to do research on&lt;br/&gt;problems relevant to Lorentzian Geometry, General Relativity and&lt;br/&gt;Riemannian Geometry. The main focus of his research, the Cauchy&lt;br/&gt;problem for the Einstein equations, interacts deeply with each of&lt;br/&gt;these areas. Among the topics considered in this proposal are&lt;br/&gt;global stability of cosmological models, the theory of marginally&lt;br/&gt;trapped surfaces and dynamical horizons, and the structure of&lt;br/&gt;cosmological singularities. Andersson will attempt to prove that&lt;br/&gt;in the case of spacetime dimension at least eleven, there are&lt;br/&gt;families of vacuum cosmological models which are globally stable,&lt;br/&gt;with quiescent singularity. In the 3+1 dimensional case, similar&lt;br/&gt;results are expected to hold for the Einstein-scalar field&lt;br/&gt;equations. Andersson and collaborators have recently been able&lt;br/&gt;to apply techniques developed in the theory of minimal surfaces&lt;br/&gt;to the case of stable marginally trapped surfaces, which play the&lt;br/&gt;role of apparent horizons in general relativity. Andersson plans&lt;br/&gt;to pursue the connection between marginal surfaces and minimal&lt;br/&gt;surfaces in his future research, and to apply these techniques&lt;br/&gt;also to dynamical horizons. In addition to the above topics,&lt;br/&gt;Andersson proposes a program of research using analytic and&lt;br/&gt;numerical techniques, directed towards investigating the&lt;br/&gt;asymptotic behavior of general inhomogenous cosmologies near the&lt;br/&gt;singularity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Einstein equations describe the geometry of spacetime, which&lt;br/&gt;in turn determines the motion of bodies (planets, stars,&lt;br/&gt;galaxies) in space, as well as the dynamics of fields and&lt;br/&gt;particles via their respective field theories. The geometric view&lt;br/&gt;of the universe provided by the Einstein equations has led to&lt;br/&gt;some of the most fundamental and paradoxical features of our&lt;br/&gt;picture of the universe, including the initial spacetime&lt;br/&gt;singularity or Big Bang and black holes. The mathematical study&lt;br/&gt;of spacetimes in extreme conditions such as near the Big Bang&lt;br/&gt;singularity or near the singularity in black holes has led to a&lt;br/&gt;far reaching conjecture called ``Cosmic Censorship'', which&lt;br/&gt;implies that phenomena which violate the intuitive notions of&lt;br/&gt;causality must be hidden (censored) from observers. In this&lt;br/&gt;project, problems related to cosmic censorship are studied using&lt;br/&gt;a combination of computer based and analytical techniques, with a&lt;br/&gt;particular focus on the evolution of geometry from initial&lt;br/&gt;conditions.</AbstractNarration>
