<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports integrated research, education and outreach activities in theoretical condensed matter physics. The goal of this research program is to develop new integrated modeling of problems involving nonlinear dynamics of interacting networks. These problems arise in the mechanical properties of materials ranging from fracture and friction to wrinkled membranes. This research effort will also attempt to extend this approach across another disciplinary boundary into medicine and biology. The project will take up problems concerning diseases propagation in epidemics where the  networks consists of the population of susceptible individuals. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The problems where nonlinear dynamics is the operational mode span many fields. there are common themes such as the use of statistical physics and scaling laws to make detailed predictions about complicated nonlinear dynamical systems.  Research is carried out on specific problem, but resulting theoretical breakthroughs are often generalizable to many system.  In this research, specific problems include: (i) The fracture of rubber, particularly connections between mesoscopic properties and macroscopic phenomena, (ii) Dynamics of static friction. (iii) Friction at the atomic scale in the presence of large electrical fields and currents. (iv) Geometries of membranes with metrics. (v) Epidemics on networks. Through such diverse investigations, the generalizations needed for a fundamental understanding of nonlinear science are emerging.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research has very strong educational commitments coupled to it. In addition to preparing graduate students and postdoctoral researchers for careers in academic or industrial  research and development, by the topic of nonlinear science has become part of the curriculum based on the expertise of the research group, so it is something many students are able to experience. Beyond the university, there PU is engages in a strong K-12 teaching outreach program that connects K-12 teachers to university researchers as part of K-12 teacher professional development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports integrated research, education and outreach activities in theoretical condensed matter physics with the central these on nonlinear dynamics. Nonlinear dynamics spans the range from exotic theories of the cosmos to the practical matters of when things fail in real life. One example taken up in this research is prediction of when elastic material cease to stretch (end the linear regime) and begin to rupture (enter the regime of nonlinear dynamics).  In a very real sense, the one problem in polymer fracture could result in both fundamental advance in the theory of nonlinear dynamical systems and help keep garbage bags from breaking. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this research program is to develop new integrated modeling  of  problems involving nonlinear dynamics of interacting networks. These problems arise in the mechanical properties of materials pushed beyond normal limits. This research effort will also attempt to extend this approach across another disciplinary boundary into medicine and biology. The project will take up problems concerning diseases propagation in epidemics. The studies of rupture in networks of polymers provides theoretical tools that may help make predictions about epidemics when  networks consists of the population of susceptible individuals. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first educational benefit of this research resides with the graduate students who participate in the research and for whom the work is the foundation for the Ph.D.  dissertation. But, the principle investigator of this research project is also involved in  other efforts supporting outreach and professional development for K-12 teachers. As a consequence, the material encountered in this research is employed in creating materials for teacher preparation, and in supplying interesting topics the PI can use in outreach activities to the broad public. Activities of the investigator also include updating a graduate textbook in condensed matter physics and directing a nationally recognized program for preparation of teachers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
