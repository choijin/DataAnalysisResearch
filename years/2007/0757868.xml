<AbstractNarration>The PIs on this group proposal intend to work on the following projects. Grossman plans to study different aspects of flavor physics. This includes traditional probes like B meson, D meson and K-meson physics, but also new ones, like top production and decays, and flavor aspects of physics beyond the standard model. Csaki and Perelstein plan to focus their attention on understanding the structure and signatures of models of electroweak symmetry breaking and of hierarchy stabilization, including supersymmetric, extra-dimensional and little Higgs models. Once the LHC experiments start, they expect to focus on theoretical interpretation of the data, with the ultimate goal of determining the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking. They will also work on issues at the interface of particle physics and cosmology, aiming to understand the implications of the LHC data for cosmological questions such as the nature of dark matter and the dynamics of the electroweak phase transition. In string theory, McAllister and Tye propose to study certifications that result in stabilized moduli, and to use&lt;br/&gt;these setups to find realistic implementations of inflation in string theory. This provides a rigorous framework for resolving theoretical issues in inflation, and also provides the best prospect for experimental constraints on string theory. McAllister and Tye will pursue both aspects of this connection. Lepage proposes to use lattice simulations to finnd theoretical predictions for B and D meson physics observables at the few percent level, some of which will be compared to forthcoming results from CLEO-c. Kinoshita is proposing to calculate the eighth and tenth order QED contributions to the lepton g - 2,&lt;br/&gt;which will enable the most precise determination of the fine structure constant and also give the most stringent tests of QED. On the more formal side, LeClair is proposing to study quantum field theories in lower dimensions, with potential applications to condensed matter systems and string theory. The group is committed to training the next generation of theoretical physicists especially in the areas of LHC Physics and Cosmology. The Cornell particle theory group regularly lecture at the local high school and at the local chapter of SPS, and participate in a wide range of outreach activities&lt;br/&gt;both locally and abroad. Being part of the Laboratory for Elementary Particle Physics (LEPP) at Cornell provides unique opportunities for interactions with experimental colleagues working on CLEO-c and the CMS experiment at the LHC and the group provides theoretical support for the experimental program.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
