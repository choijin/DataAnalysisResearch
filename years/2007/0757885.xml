<AbstractNarration>The objective of this project is to develop methods for combining historical and ongoing measurements of the Earth?s magnetic field with numerical computer models for Earth?s dynamic core, where the geomagnetic field is generated.  Similar methods, generally referred to as data assimilation (DA), are widely used in atmospheric sciences to improve reliability of weather forecasts generated by numerical models of atmospheric flows.   Our application of these methods to the geomagnetic field will allow development of improved models of magnetic field generation, better understanding of physical processes in Earth?s core, and improved estimation of the slow time variations of the geomagnetic field, i.e. geomagnetic secular variation (SV) in the historical and more distant past.  Such improved SV will be of value in diverse scientific studies, including Earth rotation, geodynamics, geomagnetism, and paleoclimate.  Ultimately, development of geomagnetic DA will result in improved forecasts of the future evolution of the Earth?s magnetic field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project builds on previous work with sequential DA in geomagnetism, adapting recent developments of variational DA methods in ocean and atmospheric sciences.  Key components of our effort include development of tangent linear and adjoint codes for the MoSST (Modular Scalable Self-consistent Three-dimensional) geodynamo model, use of these codes to implement a modern variational DA scheme (the so-called representer method), and initial applications to geomagnetic datasets. In the variational approach model inputs (initial and boundary data, forcing) are adjusted to simultaneously fit dynamical equations and observational data.  This technical approach provides a natural way to use high quality data from recent years to improve magnetic field and core flow estimates for past epochs, allowing dynamically consistent simultaneous estimation of the time evolution of the magnetic and fluid velocity fields in the core, and the resulting signals observable at the surface. More generally, variational DA provides a common framework for comparing geodynamo model outputs to data, and will allow rigorous tests of dynamical hypotheses.  The tangent linear and adjoint tools developed for variational DA will also have applications to sensitivity and stability analysis of the numerical geodynamo models.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this project we have developed methods for combining data with a numerical model that simulates the generation of EarthÆs dynamic magnetic field by convection of liquid iron in the outer core.   Our approach is similar to advanced methods for data assimilation that have been applied in recent years for weather forecasting, and for modeling ocean flows of importance to climate.   The work involved is highly technical: an existing numerical computer model developed over the past decade by researchers at NASA has been modified to allow us to compute the sensitivity of model outputs (simulated observations of the changing geomagnetic field at EarthÆs surface) to model inputs (the initial state of EarthÆs core at the start of the model run, thousands of years ago).   Using the computed sensitivity it is possible to make adjustments to the initial state so that the simulation matches (within error bars) actual observations of the magnetic field.   Because the model can be sampled throughout the core (including components of the magnetic field and of the core flow that cannot be directly observed from the surface) the resulting data assimilating model will provide a more complete picture of the geomagnetic field, and allow us to better understand the physical processes that are responsible for generating and maintaining EarthÆs magnetic field.   As in the case of the atmospheric sciences, where data assimilation is a critical part of modern weather forecasting, assimilation of data into geodynamo models offers promise of improved forecasting of future changes in EarthÆs magnetic field.   Such forecasts will be useful for applications, such as navigation and directional drilling, where very accurate and up-to-date models of the geomagnetic field are required.
