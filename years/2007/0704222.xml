<AbstractNarration>Project Summary&lt;br/&gt;Polymer surfaces and interfaces control the properties that define function in the emerging areas&lt;br/&gt;of biotechnology and nanotechnology. Although the general topic of polymer surfaces and&lt;br/&gt;interfaces has a long and rich history, the evolution of new polymer chemistries, fabrication&lt;br/&gt;approaches, characterization methods, and targeted applications provides unquestionable&lt;br/&gt;motivation for an inter-disciplinary symposium to foster discussions and cross-breeding of ideas&lt;br/&gt;and understanding to push this critical field forward. Accordingly, I and three co-organizers&lt;br/&gt;[Professor Jeff Youngblood (Purdue University), Professor Rigoberto Advincula (University of&lt;br/&gt;Houston), and Dr. Ying Chang (Academia Sinica Taiwan)] are leading the organization of a&lt;br/&gt;focused symposium entitled: Polymer Surfaces and Interfaces at the upcoming national meeting&lt;br/&gt;of the American Chemical Society in Chicago during March 2007.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;This symposium will consist of six focused topic sessions that will not only demonstrate the&lt;br/&gt;common foundation of polymer surfaces and interfaces across a wide range of applications and&lt;br/&gt;approaches, but most importantly the program will encourage the development of collaborations&lt;br/&gt;and cross-breeding of ideas. The focused topic sessions include: 1.) Polymer Brushes, 2.)&lt;br/&gt;Macromolecular Assemblies, 3.) Responsive Surfaces, Interfaces, and Films, 4.) Biopolymer /&lt;br/&gt;Bioactive Surfaces, 5.) Chemistry at Surfaces and Interfaces, 6.) Adhesion and Interfacial&lt;br/&gt;Physics. These six topics represent the current state-of-the-art research in the field of polymer&lt;br/&gt;surfaces and interfaces. The range of chemistries, processes, characterization methods, and&lt;br/&gt;applications within each of these focused sessions will provide a unique program to encourage&lt;br/&gt;collaboration and education among established and young researchers. The foundation for this&lt;br/&gt;program has been set with an extensive and diverse list of invited speakers that represent the&lt;br/&gt;leaders in research in the topics covered by the six focused topic sessions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this symposium will emerge from the diversity of the co-organizing&lt;br/&gt;committee, the diversity of the invited speakers, and the diversity of the general participants at&lt;br/&gt;the national meeting of the American Chemical Society. This symposium will encourage the&lt;br/&gt;exposure of young researchers in the field of polymer surfaces and interfaces by inviting several&lt;br/&gt;speakers that are either young professors or post-doctoral researchers, while also providing a&lt;br/&gt;poster session for the general participation of graduate student researchers. Furthermore, the&lt;br/&gt;participation of women and under-represented minorities will be encouraged through direct&lt;br/&gt;invitations and widely-distributed advertisements. This organization will not only provide&lt;br/&gt;opportunities for research scientists from all backgrounds to discuss current challenges and&lt;br/&gt;approaches in polymer surface and interface research, but it will provide an opportunity for&lt;br/&gt;young researchers to be educated and prepared for their future careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
