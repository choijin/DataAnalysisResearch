GLASS is comprised of seven universities--Northwestern University (Alliance lead institution), University of Illinois atUrbana-Champaign, University of Chicago, Ohio State University, Pennsylvania State University, University of Wisconsin, and Temple University. The Alliance seeks to broaden the participation of PhD students in the social and behavioral sciences by: (1) engaging in coordinated activities across the seven universities, (2) increasing coordination of activities on each campus, (3) and studying the impact of various techniques on promoting diversity in graduate education.  GLASS will focus on increasing the number of minority students enrolled in alliance institutions' graduate programs in the social, behavioral and economic sciences, the establishment of permanent infrastructure on each campus and across alliances to support diversity and a diverse population of graduate students, and the development of a publishable set of techniques and guidelines that can be used by any university and creates a national forum for the exchange of ideas and best practices for promoting diversity in the academy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The value added of the alliance structure includes: 1) alliance-level activities (e.g., an annual student research conference and the creation of common recruiting materials and coordinated recruiting efforts; 2) recruitment through the implementation of an Alliance Visiting Scholars Program and coordination of recruiting efforts at major conferences, fairs and university visits; 3) increased retention of students due to a cadre of social and behavioral professors and scholars who provide an instant, multi-level mentoring network and enable transition programs; and 4) increased activities and programs targeted at undergraduates in a wider range of universities and colleges to increase the pool of potential graduate students.  The number of universities in the alliance also allows the PIs to analyze the effectiveness of new strategies for broadening participation and the transference of existing techniques to new settings. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:  The alliance model contribute to creating a diverse graduate education student body and faculty at US colleges and universities.  Further the Alliance will develop written materials that can be distributed to all universities in the US could form the basis for a national exchange of ideas about alliances as a strategy to broaden participation in US institutions of higher learning.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

An eighth institution, Indiana University, was invited to join the GLASS alliance during the last two years of the project.  The GLASS alliance engaged in coordinated activities on each campus to recruit, enroll, retain and graduate underrepresented minority students in SBE disciplines.  Additionally, the alliance model expanded the mentoring and networking opportunities available to the students who participated in GLASS. The SBE disciplines represented in the GLASS alliance were: sociology, psychology, political science, anthropology, human development and social policy, and economics.  Graduate students in these fields were invited annually to participate in either a professional development or research conference, attend special workshops on some aspect of academic employment, and/or attend summer workshops designed to enhance their research training.  The GLASS alliance existed from August 2007 through December 2014. During this time period at Northwestern University, approximately 55 underrepresented minority SBE graduate students participated in one or more program activities.

Approximately seven students who completed their PhDs in SBE disciplines are employed in industry or government, and the majority of the remaining students are still enrolled in their graduate programs.  Another key outcome of Northwestern University's SBE program was the establishment of the PhD Preparation program for undergraduates interested in learning about graduate school opportunities. This program was designed to build the pipeline from college graduation through PhD completion.  The PhD Preparation program continues to be financially supported at Northwestern University even though Federal funding has ended.  Finally, the NSF SBE program at Northwestern University served to catalyze in part two new administrative positions. The Graduate School hired a director of diversity and inclusion in May 2014 and as of this writing, the Office of the Provost has instituted a new Associate Provost for Diversity and Inclusion position to be filled during summer 2015.  The Associate Provost for Diversity and Inclusion will be responsible for creating and implementing university wide diversity programming, and both positions include components of Northwestern University's NSF AGEP and SBE programs.
