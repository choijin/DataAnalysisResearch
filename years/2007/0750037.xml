<AbstractNarration>In this project the PI will further develop and apply ideas from scaling theory that he developed in the past to understand the hierarchical structure and transportation of energy and resources within cells, to investigate similar implications for energy and size distribution of trees and plants within ecosystems, to derive fundamental quantitative theories of sleep and aging, tumor growth and structure, and brain functionality. For example, can it be understood why organisms age and what sets the scale for life-span and, in particular, where in molecular scales 100 years come from for humans? In addition, the paradigm will be extended to address analogous questions in complex network structures of social organizations, such as cities, and to understand the role of innovation and economies of scale in their growth trajectories. Technically, most of the proposed work will be analytic in nature utilizing many of the standard, powerful techniques of theoretical physics, including the language of field theory, the renormalization group, and thermodynamic concepts; when necessary, computer simulations will be employed. In addition, the work will generally be carried out in close, collaboration with biologists, ecologists, biochemists, economists, and other physicists, including post-doctoral fellows and students. The paradigm and principles thus far developed suggest novel ways of attacking many important and fundamental problems across the broad spectrum of biology where quantitative analytic thinking familiar in physics can play a central role. This program aims at establishing a rigorous, quantitative, mathematical, predictive, coarse-grained theory of biological phenomena and to extend it to social organizations. The primary focus has been on energy and material resource use but longer-term the intent is to integrate the energy transport networks with those carrying information, whether genetic or neural, to formulate a unified theory. This work has the potential for having major impact on many highly practical problems in biomedicine (such as the non-invasive study of cardiovascular abnormalities, aging, toxicology and pharmacology, sleep and cancer) as well as providing a conceptual framework for addressing many of societys major problems (including the environment and energy sustainability, and the fate of our cities. The results will be circulated in high-profile scientific journals as well as in more accessible media, including our summer schools, student and high school programs, the SFI business network and by lecturing in other institutions.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Despite the amazing diversity and complexity of living systems, an extraordinary simplicity and regularity is manifested by how many fundamental processes scale across an immense size range from cells to ecosystems.  For example, metabolic rate scales approximately as the 3/4-power of mass over 27 orders of magnitude from intracellular complex molecules to the largest multicellular organisms. Similarly, time-scales (such as lifespans, growth-rates, and evolutionary rates) and sizes (such as genome lengths, RNA densities, and tree heights) scale with exponents that are typically simple multiples of 1/4.  These universal quarter-power scaling laws follow from underlying generic principles that transcend the evolved design of specific organisms and are embedded in the mathematics and physics of optimized, fractal-like, branching networks that sustain life at all scales.  These ideas lead to a general quantitative, predictive framework that captures many essential features of diverse biological phenomena, including cardiovascular and respiratory systems, forests, ontogenetic growth, cancer, aging and death, sleep, cell size, and evolutionary rates. The main thrust of this project was to explore the ramifications of this conceptual framework and extend it to explore fundamental problems that potentially have important health or environmental implications:  i) Tumors. The theoretical framework enables a quantitative understanding of how cells, tissues, and vascular networks act together across multiple scales. It relates tumor vascularization and growth to metabolic rate and yields extensive predictions for tumor properties, including growth rates, necrosis, blood flow rates and vessel sizes, all in good agreement with data. The theory explains why similar tumors grow slower in larger animals, helping to resolve Peto's paradox (that whales and humans are less cancer prone than mice). It provides a quantitative comparison between characteristics of tumors and normal tissue and a sound theoretical basis for how to scale up investigations on animals to humans.  ii) Growth. The network theory provides a framework for determining how rates of food assimilation and energy are allocated to maintenance, biosynthesis, physical activity, and storage. It predicts that growth and assimilation rates for all animals should cluster closely around two universal curves; data for mammals and birds of diverse body sizes and taxa support these predictions.  iii) The temperature size rule (TSR). Incorporating the effects of temperature on biochemical reaction rates into the ontogenetic growth model leads to a simple explanation for the tendency of ectotherms to grow faster but mature to smaller body sizes in warmer environments &ndash; by as much as 20% for a 10oC temperature increase. This has important environmental implications for predicting effects of climate change. Explicit examples included post-hatching development, where an animal consumes food to fuel its metabolism, and embryonic development, where the organism fuels its metabolism from energy reserves stored in the egg.  iv) Sleep.

It leads to predictions for sleep time, sleep cycle time, and REM (rapid-eye-movement) time as functions of body and brain mass, and explains, for example, why mice sleep ~14 hours per day whereas elephants sleep 3-4 hours per day. Mammalian data are consistent with these predictions and provide strong evidence that sleep times are set by the brain rather than that of the whole-body.  v) Aging and mortality. Like sleep, this is presumed to result from damage in the networks associated with metabolism operating across all scales from molecules to the whole body.
