<AbstractNarration>The growing awareness of the importance of dimension reduction in bioinformatics has led to the development of new techniques. Various extensions of sliced inverse regression(SIR) have appeared. More recently a new way of studying the relationship between variables in a complex data system, called liquid association (LA), was proposed. LA describes how variation in the pattern of association between a pair of variables, including its sign and strength, is mediated by a third variable from the background. In this proposal, the investigators  will (1) develop hybrid dimension reduction methods that blend in ideas from PCA (principal component analysis), K-mean, SIR, PHD (Principale Hessian Direction), LA and a variety of clustering methods; (2) provide effective dimension reduction tools for incorporating clinical or other phenotype data involving life time which are usually subject to censoring; (3) investigate related statistical inference issues concerning false positives; (4)  investigate the pattern of cellular coordination at the functional module level; (5)  develop LA based methods for variable selection; (6)  provide better insight to intrinsic nonlinearity in marginal Gaussian models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The recent rapid growth in the public repertoire of biological data and knowledge resources has been astonishing. This includes the completion of genome sequencing for human and many species, the stride in the SNP detection and international HapMap project, the accumulation of full genome microarray gene expression data under a number of conditions for numerous organisms and tissues, the identification of the high density genetic markers, protein-protein interaction and complexes, as well as the availability of various gene annotation websites featuring both functional and structural information of the gene products, their biological roles and relevance to disease studies. Such open data resources hold the promise of benefiting numerous projects aiming at solving detail genetic profiles predisposing to complex diseases and their trait components. However, researchers are also facing the insurmountable difficulties due to the enormous complexity of data structure and exceedingly high dimensionality. To succeed, it is critical to continue the research on developing new computational arsenals. Modeling through probabilistic and statistical reasoning has found numerous compelling applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
