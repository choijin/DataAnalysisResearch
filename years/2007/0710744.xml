<AbstractNarration>0710744&lt;br/&gt;Dittmar&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This U.S.-Brazil award will support a planning visit by Drs. Thorsten Dittmar and William T. Cooper of Florida State University to go to Campos dos Goytacazes in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil to work with their counterpart, Dr. Carlos E. Rezende  of North Fluminense State University on the biogeochemistry of coastal zones.  They will work to establish a quantitative baseline of coastal outwelling of dissolved organic matter (DOM) along climatic gradients, identify the driving forces behind outwelling, and assess the impact of DOM outwelling on the cycling of trace elements in the coastal zone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs have worked together over the years via distant communication.  This planning visit will allow the two sides to bring together their different approaches to an important problem face to face.  They will involve students from both sides, adding to the investment in this multi-disciplinary bi-national collaboration.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
