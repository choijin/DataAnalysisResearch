<AbstractNarration>PROPOSAL NUMBER: 0742587&lt;br/&gt;PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Andrew Zydney&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION: University of Pennsylvania&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PROPOSAL TITLE:  2008 Gordon-Kenan Graduate Research Seminar on Membranes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant will provide support for graduate students and post-doctoral researchers to attend and participate in the Gordon-Kenan Graduate Research Seminar to be held in conjunction with the Gordon Research Conference on Membranes: Materials and Processes on August 10-15, 2008. This will be the first Gordon-Kenan Graduate Research Seminar in membrane science and technology, and it will provide an opportunity for current graduate students and post-doctoral researchers to come together to discuss their research and share mutual experiences while at the same time building informal networks with peers that may lead to collaboration.  The last few years have seen a tremendous growth in interest and activity in membrane science and technology, driven largely by advances in our ability to control and analyze complex structures at the nanoscale. In addition, critical societal needs in the areas of bioprocessing, energy, and the environment are providing exciting new opportunities for membrane technology. This includes the development of membrane electrodes for fuel cells, membrane separations for the purification of ethanol produced from cellulosic biomass, and membrane systems for carbon dioxide removal and sequestration. The Gordon-Kenan Graduate Research Seminar will have specific sessions on Membranes for Bioseparations and Biomedical Applications and Membranes for Energy Production and Storage, along with a more general session on membrane science and technology. The discussions among the graduate students and post-doctoral researchers will provide feedback on current research efforts, and they will enable the participants to develop new ideas for important research activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:&lt;br/&gt;The opportunity for graduate students and post-doctoral researchers to interact in a&lt;br/&gt;Gordon Conference setting will have a positive impact on the personal and professional development of these young scientists. The informal networks that will be developed through these interactions will provide critical support for the students as they pursue their professional careers, including encouragement for young researchers interested in pursuing academic careers. Special efforts will be made to attract a diverse group of graduate students and post-doctoral researchers to the meeting, including individuals from the leading research groups in the United States and around the world.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
