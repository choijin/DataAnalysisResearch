<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Wolf&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is to provide partial support for twenty U.S. mathematicians (four or five senior principal speakers and the others junior) to participate in the Sixth Workshop on Lie Theory and Geometry to be held in C'ordoba, Argentina, November 12-16, 2007. &lt;br/&gt;Lie theory and differential geometry play tightly intertwined central roles in many active parts of mathematics and physics. Over the last twenty years there has been a high level of mutually beneficial collaboration in these areas between U.S. and Argentine mathematicians. A series of workshops on Lie theory and geometry has been instrumental for those scientific exchanges, and of equal benefit to U.S. and South American mathematicians.    The workshop program will emphasize four main areas and their interactions: (1) representation theory of Lie groups, (2) inverse spectral geometry,&lt;br/&gt;(3) geometric structures (i.e. homogeneous spaces), and (4) applications of Lie groups to number theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will address recent advances in the main areas and strengthen existing efforts as well as forge new collaborations to address major open problems.  The broader impacts of the proposed activity include advances in a number of current U.S. Argentine research projects, expansion of the mathematical horizons of many younger U.S. mathematicians, and strengthening of scientific ties in the western hemisphere. There has been extensive fruitful collaboration between the U.S. and Argentine mathematical communities, sometimes involving European researchers, and one of our goals for this workshop is to open up these collaborative opportunities to more young U. S. mathematicians.  Participation by women and minorities will be actively sought and encouraged.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
