<AbstractNarration>This award supports the Committee on Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Science (CAMOS) of the Board on Physics and Astronomy of the National Academies. CAMOS identifies and discusses issues of concern to the atomic, molecular, and optical (AMO) science community, particularly in connection with research opportunities, and provides guidance to federal agencies regarding their associated programs.  The committee?s operating guidelines are:  (1) to provide active stewardship of the agenda laid out by the AMO 2010 report; (2) to provide a means by which federal agencies can request technical information and assistance from the National Academies about AMO science and related fields; (3) to initiate case studies on important timely topics in AMO science and/or its multidisciplinary connections with other fields of science and technology; (4) to provide an interface for communication among the subfields of the AMO community as well as with the staff of federal agencies that support research in the field. CAMOS prepares white papers on emerging areas of research in the atomic, molecular, and optical sciences to initiate subsequent National Research Council committee studies on those topics. CAMOS oversees all studies initiated under its auspices.  A specific topic that CAMOS is expected to address in the process of following up the AMO 2010 study is quantum information science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant provided partial support for the National Research CouncilÆs (NRC) Committee on Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Sciences (CAMOS).  CAMOS is a standing committee consisting of a group of scientists drawn from universities, industry, and government laboratories that provides guidance on ways to maintain and strengthen AMO science as a discipline. Its goals include (1) acting as active stewards of the recent decadal survey for AMO science, Controlling the Quantum World; (2) responding to requests for technical information and assistance that relate to AMO science; (3) initiating and overseeing the conduct and publication of studies that involve AMO science and its multidisciplinary connections to other fields of science and technology; and (4) providing a forum for discussion among AMO scientists and Washington D.C. policymakers.      To carry out its objectives, CAMOS meets on a semiannual basis and between those meetings, conducts its business through telephone conferences.  Over the three years covered by this grant, CAMOS conducted focus sessions at its meetings that concentrated on several of the areas highlighted in Controlling the Quantum World as having great scientific promise.  Summaries of the presentations and the discussions in those focus sessions were prepared and provided to funding agencies and are available through CAMOSÆs web site - http://sites.nationalacademies.org/BPA/BPA_048649.  The committee also developed several study proposals based upon the committeeÆs assessment of the needs of this field.
