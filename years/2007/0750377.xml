<AbstractNarration>Drs. Emile Schweikert, Stanislav Verkhoturov, and Richard Rickman of Texas A&amp;M University are supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program with co-funding from the Office of International Science and Engineering to investigate the nature of the molecules and molecular fragments that are ejected when a surface is bombarded with energetic massive clusters.  The latter are composed of hundreds of atoms of gold or bismuth and are accelerated prior to impact to hypersonic velocities.  The purpose of the project is to identify the ionized ejecta from single massive projectile impacts and relate the observation to the nature and abundance of the chemical species originally present in the nanometric size volume perturbed by a projectile.  This work combines the localization of a single projectile shot via electron emission microscopy, with the detection of the concurrent ionized emission via mass spectrometry.  The data from a sequence of such impact emission events can be displayed as a chemical map showing the distribution of molecules with an anticipated sub-100nm lateral resolution. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development of mass spectrometry with extremely high spatial resolution will enhance "chemical vision" at a level where current capabilities are limited.  Technology for chemical mapping with the sub-100nm resolution is critical for characterizing nanoparticles and mapping biological structures such as single cells.   Members of the research team are thus exposed to a wide-range of interdisciplinary science.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A new instrument has been developed for localizing and identifying molecules at the nanoscale (one nanometer is one billionth of a meter).  Molecular microscopy of structures, objects and domains of tens to a few hundred nanometers is at the core of critical problems in cell biology, is the basis for nano-electronics, is key to elucidating the effects of nanoparticles on health and for understanding the role of colloids and aerosols in the environment.     The challenge for molecular characterization at the nanoscale is that little material is available for analysis.  Key goals for this project were to develop a method for extracting a maximum of signal from a vanishingly small amount of material and to design and assemble appropriate instrumentation.  Major technical hurdles have been overcome.  We report significant progress with a novel technique which uses "nano-projectiles" to interrogate solid objects.  The process involves bombarding the object with individual nanoprojectiles, each a cluster of 400 gold atoms carrying a positive charge and accelerated to velocities of tens of kilometers per second.  Their impact causes ejection of molecular fragments and molecules which can be identified with a mass spectrometer.  Further the location where a nanoprojectile hits is determined at the time of impact with an electron emission microscope. The outcome is a unique instrument and data processing scheme for molecular microscopy shown in image 1.     The performance of the instrument for nanoscale analysis has been validated with, for example, the characterization of nanoparticles (image 2), the characterization of mixtures of nano-objects, the quantification of antibody binding sites on cell surfaces, and the detection of lipids in rat brain (image 3).  The results have been described in three Ph.D dissertations, reported in 24 peer-reviewed publications and communicated in 23 oral presentations at national and international scientific conferences.     The development of the original instrument and methodology for nanoscale molecular analysis results from an interdisciplinary effort at Texas A&amp;M University led by Chemistry Professor Schweikert.  Colleagues at the Nuclear Physics Institute in Orsay, France, directed by Professor Della-Negra contributed physics and engineering expertise.  The collaboration that led to the one-of-a-kind instrument at Texas A&amp;M, spawned a new expanded molecular microscopy project in Orsay which was recently funded with a grant of 4 million Euros by the French "Equipment d' Excellence" program.     Research in the nanoscience field is growing at a breathtaking pace spanning from nano-photonics to cancer nanotechnology.  The Texas A&amp;M team intends to contribute critical measurement expertise with continuing efforts in advanced nanoscale molecular characterization.
