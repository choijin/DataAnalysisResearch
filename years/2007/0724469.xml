<AbstractNarration>The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes the development of ultracapacitor devices that combine the use of nanostructured carbon electrodes with organosilicon electrolytes.  These innovative ultracapacitor devices are expected to provide higher working voltages than existing devices, yielding significantly increased energy and power density.  This Phase II project  will use laboratory results to develop prototype devices and address issues associated with scale up and development of procedures for creating prototype devices.  These ultracapacitor devices will be characterized for long-term use by evaluating their physical properties and stability.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The size of the  ultracapacitor market, already surpassing $200M, continues to grow at a compound annual growth rate of more than 15%.  The development of improved ultracapacitor energy storage devices should accelerate this growth by facilitating the commercial development of low-emission vehicles, which should reduce the overall demand for energy.  Organosilicon-based electrolytes should improve the overall safety profile of  ultracapacitor devices due to their low flammability and low vapor pressures. The improved safety and improved physical characteristics will expand opportunities for the use of  ultracapacitors as robust energy storage devices in consumer electronics and industrial applications. This work will also assist in the development of a trained workforce by involving graduate students and postdocs in the research and development effort.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA["Integration of Nanostructured Electrodes with Organosilicon Electrolytes" NSF Award #0724469 Project Outcomes Report    During the project period Silatronix researchers investigated the use of organosilicon (OS)-based electrolytes as safer alternatives to the commonly used alkyl carbonate-based electrolytes in a range of energy storage devices, including ultracapacitors and lithium-ion batteries.

Key experiments comparing organosilicon compounds with similar compounds lacking silicon atoms showed that the inclusion of one of more silicon atoms into the molecular structure significantly increased the electrochemical stability of the compounds and also reduced their vapor pressure, making the OS compounds significantly less flammable than the compounds used in current-generation batteries.   To evaluate how the OS compounds perform in compete energy storage devices, researchers developed complete testing facilities and procedures and tested the performance of OS-based compounds in ultracapacitors and in lithium ion batteries. Silatronix researchers teamed with several major companies to evaluate electrolyte performance with different commercial electrodes, in addition to develop in-house capability to produce high-quality electrode materials. These studies showed that that pure OS compounds did not have adequate performance for the targeted high-power battery applications.  To address the larger market associated with higher-power applications, researchers developed new blends of OS compounds mixed with non-OS compounds and developed optimized compositions that provide electrochemical performance equivalent to the best existing electrolytes, while also significantly reducing the flammability of the electrolyte. Pure OS compounds were found to have very good performance for high-temperature battery applications, with demonstration of carbon monofluoride("CFx")  primary batteries that functioned very well up to at least 150oC. Based on these and other promising results, Silatronix has expanded to approximately 10 full-time employees and is currently engaging with a number of large battery manufacturers and/or materials suppliers to extend the excellent results obtained in coin cells to larger-format cells of interest for automotive applications.   The results of this research have provided important new fundamental insights into the chemical and electrochemical properties of OS compounds and have lead to new mixtures that could be used as replacements for existing electrolytes, potentially leading to increased safety without sacrificing performance. These compounds may also have a number of applications beyond lithium ion batteries. Funding of the proposed research also lead to significant educational opportunities ranging from high school teachers to graduate students, through links to both the University of Wisconsin-Madison and to Madison Area Technical College (MATC).  Funds were used to hire an award-winning college teacher from MATC to conduct research at Silatronix; the insights from these summer studies were then incorporated back into courses being taught.  Silatronix employees contributed significantly to the mentoring of two Ph.D. graduate students, five undergraduate students, and a high school student.  Through these interactions Silatronix employees provided students with excellent opportunities to learn about the technology of energy storage and electrochemistry. Finally, Silatronix employees   participated in the Careers in Chemistry Program, bringing a group of high school students to the companyÆs development lab, where students were lead through the process of battery-making and had the opportunity to interact and ask questions with three Silatronix research staff members.
