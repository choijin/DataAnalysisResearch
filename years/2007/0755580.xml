<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;This proposal creates an REU program in the combined areas of Social, Developmental, Health, and Cognitive Neuroscience Psychology (SDHCNP) within the NAU Department of Psychology. It provides direct research experience for 8 Native American, Hispanic, African American, Native Alaskan, and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander students, including first generation college/university students who are disabled, female, and White Each student will conduct research in a selected specialty area under the guidance of active Psychology Department researchers.  &lt;br/&gt;The target audience is unique, and there is a good approach to recruiting by including personal visits. Positive focus on professional development, grad school applications, methods for students. Different from other proposals, there is a plan to have a control group for the evaluation which is a good idea. &lt;br/&gt;The only concern discussed and resolved was that the research was not quite as innovative as some at the forefront in psychology research, but in the comments and discussion it was agreed on that it is clearly engaging for students; that the intellectual merits were really thoughtful; and the research is strong and solid with its direct, closely supervised, hands-on original research experiences in individual faculty laboratories provided by an experienced, productive, and stimulating faculty research mentor. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
