<AbstractNarration>Today, mankind's scholarly knowledge is stored in millions of papers that are often not the best format to keep track of scientific results, in 10,000s of databases that are rarely interlinked, 1,000s of software repositories with no central search facility, and of course in experts heads distributed around the globe and across the landscape of science. Many scientific projects and experiments require access not only to results published in papers but also to the raw or processed data used, the services/algorithms/tools applied, the people which performed the work as the paper might not report results in a way that the experiment can be re-run, or new data can be analyzed using the same tools, or all experts familiar with a dataset/algorithm can be retrieved, etc.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed workshop aims to identify the general features of cyber-enabled knowledge management tools in support of discovery. Specifically, the focus is on two major challenges: &lt;br/&gt;* How to better capture and interlink scientific data, algorithms, publications, and expertise? &lt;br/&gt;* How to improve access, navigation, understanding, and discovery by means of visual interfaces to digital resources such as scientific data, algorithms, publications, and expertise?&lt;br/&gt;The two challenges and potential solutions will be discussed in detail using two application domains of major economic and societal importance: science of science studies and biomedical research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The two-day workshop will bring together about 20 leading US and international experts in databases, digital libraries, cyberinfrastructure/e-Science design, social science of cyberinfrastructure, as well as practitioners in the areas of science of science studies and biology. The goal of the workshop is to identify high impact research directions, technological opportunities, synergistic collaborations across disciplines and application domains towards more effective knowledge management and visualization tools that will support discovery and innovation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Workshop Web site (http://vw.indiana.edu/cdi2008) provides relevant material and will be used for disseminating the resulting workshop report.</AbstractNarration>
