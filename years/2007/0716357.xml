<AbstractNarration>Spam has become a prominent problem in every important communications medium.  Most email users face spam every day.  An entire industry has sprung to "improve" search engine rankings of web sites.  Further, automatically generated spam has invaded blogs, social networks, online advertising, and VoIP connections.  Spam is a rapidly growing practical problem due to the easy adaptation of attacking tools that bypass defense mechanisms.  For example, useful defense techniques such as statistical learning filters and collaborative filtering are capable of distinguishing spam from legitimate email.  However, attackers have been using automated tools to bypass these defense mechanisms, resulting in a seemingly endless "arms race" between attacks and defenses.  For example, randomizing spam tokens and inserting legitimate text as camouflage can significantly reduce the effectiveness of statistical learning filters.  Although there is no known general solution for the arms race, known as Adversarial Learning, a defense based on the exploitation of the semantic necessity of spam email to contain strong spam tokens such as VIAGRA (or its misspellings) has been found and demonstrated to end the camouflage arms race.  This project seeks additional evidence to support the hypothesis that such structural (inherent) characteristics can be found and used in the identification of many kinds of spam attacks.  The first research thrust focuses on the development of defense methods resilient to adaptive spam attacks.  The second research thrust investigates the combination of spam attacks in distinct areas (e.g., email and web spam) and combined defenses.  Success in these thrusts will significantly and permanently reduce the effectiveness of spam attacks.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of our research project is to characterize and defend against a particular group of denial-of-information attacks which are in the form of spam and fraudulent web clicks. Spamming occurs in various media, including email, forum, chat-room and web; and fraudulent web clicks include click fraud and spam bots accesses to web sites (especially those with web forms).     The major research outcomes are in these four areas:     1. Our research result provides techniques for building effective and efficient collaborative spam filtering systems. Collaboration is a natural defense against spammers because the economics of spam dictates spammers to target a large number of recipients with identical or similar messages. However, any large-scale collaborative anti-spam approach is faced with a fundamental challenge -- ensuring the privacy of the messages among untrusted recipients.

Results from our technique enable advanced spam filtering systems that are capable of resisting spam attacks that evolve over time.  A prototype collaborative system named ALPACAS has been developed and released to public from this research.     2.

These web robots mimic regular users by either replaying user accesses or randomly clicking links and following each clicked link.

In this research project, we have designed mechanisms to identify various types of web robots, including those random walking bots and replay bots that mimic regular users.
