<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II aims to prove the feasibility of creating a web-based mapping and visualization application for end-users in wildland fire management communities as an extension to the results of the Phase I work. By partnering with strategic vendors, the project will expand our current application to offer not only advanced remote-sensing data products and customized reports, but on-site, real-time weather data, GPS tracking, and full data transfer and communications networks (including audio and video). The project aims to ultimately provide end-users access to a complete team of expert analysts and engineers to gather, merge, and analyze fire-related data products through satellite communications networking. Our experts will then consolidate and simplify all the available data into custom, real-time data reports with geospatial context and delivery it to end-users to expedite high-level decision making, which can save valuable assets and lives. The platform will be amenable to the networking, visualization and analysis of a great number of issues in not only the natural resources realm, but also homeland security, disaster relief, global monitoring, and hazard mitigation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ability to quickly and efficiently collect, analyze, and share geospatial data (in particular, time-sensitive environmental data) across the World Wide Web is the cornerstone value proposition for this product. These combined abilities provide a critical and as-yet-unavailable tool for the fire management community. The project has both economic and humanistic benefits in that confinement strategies decided-on and applied during the early stages of fires can significantly reduce the cost of fire suppression by several millions of dollars. This increased information will also allow decisions to be made that keep firefighters as safe as possible. Additionally the project will offer advanced data products in formats designed specifically to address the aspects that influence these decisions. The combination of the hub solution and web browser interface as a flexible architecture, is based on open standards and therefore is agile, dynamically configurable, and interoperable holding significant value for applications such as natural disasters, pandemics, or homeland security. The overlay and visualization of that data will provide analyses of critical importance for decision and policy makers, as well as regular citizens, all seeking the best geospatial information possible and in a form they can use.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Please see http://www.yellowstoneresearch.org/pub_abstract/NSF%20POR%20for%20ClimateScape%20final.pdf for the complete report.  OVERVIEW  We seek to empower all stakeholders to apply a broad suite of environmental data&mdash;ranging from satellite data to locally maintained sensors, from historic datasets to predictive models&mdash;to create local climate action plans for dealing with the impacts of climate change and its secondary effects: disturbance (fire, floods, drought), changing land-use patterns and invasive spread.  The ClimateScape web application, in mid-stage development is a set of tools designed to provide ready, simple access to necessary data in near real-time as well as historic comparisons.   ClimateScape is a web mashup that provides real time access to water quality and meteorological sensors, web cams, satellite images, active fires, Snotel sites, wind fields, and more.  It is built on the familiar Google Maps platform that includes user-friendly access to historic trends, analysis tools, and modeling capabilities of current and future conditions using the NASA-CASA (Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach) model and TOPS (Terrestrial Observation and Prediction System).  Through these NASA-Ames programs and other federal and state sensor systems, the ClimateScape web application will deliver instantaneous access to numerous critical ecological parameters (current, past, and predicted) sourced from ground sensors and ecological modeling based on NASA satellite data.  Output from NASA models will aid in adaptation to climate change, for example understanding crop stress and soil condition, and planning for water concerns such as tracking snowpack, reservoir storage, and flood events.  We hope that ClimateScape will encourage further cooperation with stakeholders obtaining and deploying additional sensor networks of environmental data.  In the same way that Weather.com puts meteorological data in the hands of citizens &amp; scientists, ClimateScape.net will deliver instant access to critical ecological parameters needed to understand and adapt to climate change.   CLIMATESCAPE WILL SERVE AS AN EARLY WARNING SYSTEM  Climate change and its associated extreme weather events can occur abruptly and without warning.  ClimateScape is a freely available source of environmental data streams that can prepare citizens and scientists alike for such events.  For example, a concerned citizen watershed groups could use ClimateScape to develop and implement their own watershed management plans (e.g., developing drought plans that include flow and water temperature action triggers as identified by state and federal hydrologists and biologists).  To create and implement these plans, such groups need ready access to local real-time stream flow and temperature data, coupled with water quality measures such as salinity, dissolved oxygen, and turbidity (via local sensors).  These data can be compared with 60 years of historical data supplied by our partners, and scenario planning efforts can be made using NASA models to determine the impacts of potential changes in climate and demographics.  By utilizing comprehensive input data, ClimateScape will serve as an early warning system.  It will help citizens, scientists, conservationists, and policy makers to ability to prioritize actions based on local and regional conditions.  EARLY PROJECTS &amp; EXAMPLE SCENARIOS   During the first year of the Phase II project, the Crow Nation in Montana was becoming fully aware that the frequency, intensity, and severity of wild land fires were being driven primarily by changing climatic conditions such as drought and other extreme weather events.  It became clear that our developments were applicable to all related disasters  such as floods, severe droughts,  forest pathogen outbreaks and other extreme weather events&mdash;all being driven by the impacts on changing climate on the landscape.
