<AbstractNarration>The project makes use of technology to create timely, valid, and actionable reports to teachers by analyzing assessments and logs of student actions generated in the course of using computer-based curriculum materials. The reports allow teachers to make data-based decisions about alternative teaching strategies. The technology supports student collaborations and the assignment of different learning activities to groups, an essential function needed for universal design for learning (UDL). Initially, two curriculum units are under development to meet California 8th grade standards (60% of course).  In the later years of the project this effort will be expanded to North Carolina Central University and districts in that state.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is a collaborative partnership that involves physical scientists, learning scientists, educators, and TELS, an established NSF-funded Center for Learning and Teaching.  The project is based on an extensive body of research and development in educational technology.  The project represents a significant and innovative advance in the use of technology to support formative assessment of student learning and provide feedback to teachers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

LOOPS incorporated cutting-edge tools and computational models and improved student assessment through sophisticated logging technology and innovative design of teacher assessment tools. TodayÆs classroom computers can execute sophisticated simulations of complex systems such as computational dynamics and climate models. The central challenge to wider use of these resources is that students often lack the inquiry skills to experiment meaningfully and to interpret the results, and that teachers need special talents to impart those s...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
