<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nitric oxide synthase is an enzyme involved in a number of biological functions such as neuronal cell signaling and vascular tone.  This enzyme exists as three distinct forms that are regulated differently in the body.  One regulatory factor is the enzyme''s interaction with another protein called calmodulin.  Calmodulin (CaM) is in fact involved in regulating over 40 different enzymes in cells, an action not completely understood. The project outlined here will make use of traditional protein footprinting methodologies coupled with mass spectrometry to unravel the mechanisms underlying CaM''s binding to and regulating the neuronal form of nitric oxide synthase (nNOS).  More specifically, this research will give insights into the folded structure of the proteins as they relate to the functioning of neuronal cells.  The broader impacts of this research are that it will provide much needed information regarding the role of CaM in regulating cellular functions, and in particular will shed light on the regulation of nNOS.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This research will additionally provide undergraduate students at Kalamazoo College the opportunity to conduct research at the cutting-edge of genomics and proteomics.  By conducting mass spectrometric studies coupled with bioinformatics techniques, graduates will be better prepared to advance in this new era of biochemistry research.  This research will add to the commitment to the biochemistry and molecular biology programs at the College already made by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute to support bioinformatics modules incorporated into teaching curriculum.  Funding for this research will additionally help the PI, a member of an underrepresented minority, attract and retain underrepresented students in biochemical research, and will provide these students a challenging and exciting problem to study.  Kalamazoo College has been recently awarded an NSF S-STEM grant to be used to provide scholarships to newly recruited underrepresented students to the College who plan to pursue science and math as a course of study.  The PI intends to use funds awarded to provide summer stipends for the S-STEM scholars to engage them in research projects as early as during the summer of their first year.</AbstractNarration>
