<AbstractNarration>This project is providing scholarships annually to low-income undergraduates in science, computer technology, engineering, engineering technology, and environmental science majors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The primary objectives of the program include (a) increasing participation and retention of academically talented, low-income students and underrepresented groups in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) programs; (b) assessing the academic, educational and communications skills of participants and preparing Individual Training Portfolios for each; (c) facilitating the personal and professional development of students by establishing partnerships with industry for mentors, job shadowing, internships, or research experiences; (d) increasing involvement in Career Center job placement activities; (e) providing academic and support services to increase student retention and improve academic performance; and (f) increasing the placement of participating students in baccalaureate transfer programs and related employment. Scholars participate in field trips to engineering and technology industries in the region and to four-year schools with whom the institution has articulation agreements in STEM majors. In addition, each student is assigned a faculty advisor and a Big Brother/Big Sister mentor from a related business or industry. The project builds on a successful Computer Science, Engineering, and Mathematics Scholarship (CSEMS) project that had outstanding results. This program has a comprehensive infrastructure for mentoring students and providing intensive, continuous intervention strategies. The active participation of business and industry partners enhances internship/research opportunities, as well as facilitates placements in the high technology industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: This project has been designed to broaden the participation of underrepresented groups through the provision of programs and activities with proven results. Groups targeted include females, minorities, persons with disabilities, low-income, and geographically disadvantaged populations. Selection criteria are designed to accommodate applicants who come from diverse backgrounds and have diverse career goals. Seeking to improve the quality, quantity, and diversity of students entering the STEM programs, a regional Summer Technology Institute is being offered to rising 11th and 12th graders and S-STEM scholars. The summer program advances discovery and understanding in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics and promotes and encourages new teaching, training, and learning strategies. Overall, the potential benefits of the project are significant to a region facing substantial economic challenges and forced to change its economy by seeking to meet the demand for graduates in fields such as engineering and informatics which are critical to developing a New Economy for the region.</AbstractNarration>
