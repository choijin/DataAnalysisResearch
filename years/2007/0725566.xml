<AbstractNarration>Proposal Number:  0725566&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title: Graphene nanoribbon-based nanoelectronic and molecular spintronic devices&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI Name:              Nikolic, Branislav&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI Institution:  University of Delaware&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to model theoretically nanoelectronic and nanospintronic devices built around graphene nanoribbons. Graphene represents a monolayer of carbon atoms densely packed into a honeycomb lattice. Although bulk graphene is a zero-gap semiconductor, its quantum wires and dots exhibit charge and spin properties that can be manipulated through the topology of their edges and their size. The approach to the modeling of spin and charge currents in hybrid and all-graphene multiterminal nanostructures is based on the development of novel computational algorithms using the nonequilibrium Green functions, density functional theory, and electron-electron interaction treatment beyond self-consistent mean field when necessary for ultrasmall devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The recent discovery of graphene has ushered unforeseen avenues to explore low-dimensional electron system, probe quantum electrodynamics of charged neutrinos in table-top experiments, and build quantum-coherent carbon-based nanoelectronic devices. Unlike carbon nanotubes, which are a rolled up sheets of graphene, the proposed graphene devices will be easy to integrate with standard lithographic techniques. Moreover, their ultrasmall size and reduced power consumption could offer a viable alternative to aging silicon technology, while&lt;br/&gt;making it possible to exploit quantum interference effects in charge and spin transport, even at room temperature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will offer excellent training for graduate and undergraduate students in quantum transport and parallel computing techniques. The outreach will include summer schools and creation of visual simulations to teach the exciting physics of relativistic electrons in graphene through computational science courses and on the Web.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
