Enhance JML's infrastructure including its type checker, runtime assertion checking compiler, and IDE support;&lt;br/&gt;. Make JML's software infrastructure more extensible; &lt;br/&gt;. Substantially improve the documentation of the language and its supporting tools; &lt;br/&gt;. Develop course materials and tutorials to facilitate classroom use of JML; and&lt;br/&gt;. Disseminate a well-documented, extensible, open source suite of enhanced JML tools.&lt;br/&gt;JML (Java Modeling Language), a formal specification language that can document detailed designs of Java and interfaces, has been used in different projects with great benefit. Feedback is obtained from users who are attracted by the ability to check Java code against JML specifications using a variety of tools. New research problems, however, are forcing re-inventing the infrastructure that JML provides, slowing the innovation, since JML does not support many of the new features of Java version 5, most notably generics. The Verified Software grand challenge has identified lack of extensible tools for formal methods research as a major impediment to experimentation. This project responds to the challenge by enhancing, extending, and well-documenting the infrastructure to advance and accelerate Java formal methods research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The infrastructure is expected to open barriers to formal methods adoption among software engineering professionals by endowing a large collection of tools that share a common, mature specification language. These advantages should attract more educators and improve reliability in safety- and mission-critical systems. Moreover, strengthening the formal methods component in software engineering curriculum, courses will be developed and targeted to undergraduate research,. The collaborative involves two minority-serving institutions and an institution in an EPSCoR state.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Java Modeling Language (JML) is a formal specification language that can document detailed designs of Java programs. In this collaborative project, JML software tools and documentation were improved to facilitate more productive and  broader interaction among researchers in the area.  These tools are also enabling early adopters to use the technology for improved reliability of mission-critical software systems and enabling educators to train of the next generation of software professionals. Under this specific award, the main scientific findings include a new form of software interface specification that caters for contemporary software designs and analysis tools.  Its key benefits are support for modular integration of verification and validation tools, and support for specification and validation of information flow security policies.  These results are embodied in an open source software prototype called Verifier for Region Logic.  Another important outcome is a precise semantics for JML, including its mechanism for specification inheritance.  Parts of the semantics have been encoded in an interactive theorem proving system, with the goal to support high assurance tool integration and comparison of results between research groups.  A final technical outcome is formal validation of a range of software refactorings, identifying conditions under which the refactorings do not alter software behavior.  The award supported training of a PhD student who graduated, as well as collaboration with industry researchers and academic researchers in the US and Brazil.
