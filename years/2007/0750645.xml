<AbstractNarration>Collaborative Proposal&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SES-0750597&lt;br/&gt;Robert Hummer&lt;br/&gt;Darlene Grant&lt;br/&gt;University of Texas at Austin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SES-0750160&lt;br/&gt;Jean Morrison&lt;br/&gt;University of Southern California&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SES- 0750723&lt;br/&gt;Karen Cook&lt;br/&gt;Stanford University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SES-0750645&lt;br/&gt;Rogelio Saenz&lt;br/&gt;Texas A &amp; M Research Foundation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The under-representation of African American, Hispanic/Latino, and Native American students in U.S. universities continues to be an important impediment to the goal of a more equitable society. At the graduate level, under-representation among minority groups is even more striking than at the undergraduate level; for example, African Americans comprised fewer than nine percent of graduate school enrollments and Hispanics comprised just five percent of graduate school enrollments in the early 21st Century in U.S. universities. Under-representation may even be more important in California and Texas, which are the two largest states in the country in  terms of population and also two of the most racially and ethnically diverse states. Indeed, both California and Texas are now considered to be "majority-minority" population states. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This collaborative renewal project -- which includes proposals  from the University of Texas at Austin, Stanford University, Texas A&amp;M University, and the University of Southern California -- will continue to address the under representation of Hispanics, African Americans, and Native Americans in graduate programs in the Social, Behavioral, and Economic (SBE) sciences at these four institutions. The project will continue to increase the enrollment, retention, and successful completion of under-represented minority (URM) graduate students in the SBE Sciences at alliance institutions, with the long-term intent to increase representation among URM groups on university faculties in the SBE sciences. Two principles continue to guide efforts. Alliance partners will: 1) share ideas, best practices, and resources, and create a network to recruit and retain students for alliance universities; and 2) build on successful initiatives that have already been developed on each of the campuses so that efforts can be as cost-effective and successful as possible.   Highly collaborative and innovative methods will be used to improve efforts in recruiting and retaining minority graduate students at the institutions.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this program is to influence the future of higher education in both&lt;br/&gt;California and Texas. The future of higher education in these two critical majority-minority states in part depends on the ability of universities in these states to diversify the racial/ethnic mix of faculty. The collaborative effort presents one model of how to do so within the SBE sciences.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The under-representation of African American, Hispanic/Latino, and Native American students in U.S. universities continues to be an important impediment to the goal of a more equitable society.  Looking at the 18-24 year-old population in 2000, African Americans comprised14 percent, Hispanics comprised 17.5 percent, and non-Hispanic whites comprised 61.6 percent. Undergraduate enrollment figures for the early 2000s indicated that African Americans represented only 11 percent and Hispanics represented just 7 percent; in comparison, non-Hispanic whites represented 71 percent of the total.  At the graduate level, the under-representation of some minority groups is even more striking.  For example, in 2000, African Americans comprised just 8.5 percent of graduate school enrolments and Hispanics comprised just 5.2% of graduate school enrollment; in comparison, non-Hispanic whites comprised 68% of graduate school enrollment.  Under-representation may be even more important in California and Texas, which are the two largest states in the country in terms of population and also two of the most racially and ethnically diverse states.    Our collaborative project---which included the University of Texas at Austin, Stanford University, Texas A&amp;M University, and the University of Southern California&mdash;aimed to help address the under-representation of Hispanics/Latinos, African Americans, and Native Americans in graduate programs in the Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences (SBE) at the four institutions.  The major goal of the project was to increase the enrollment, retention, and successful completion of under-represented minority (URM) students in the SBE sciences at our institutions, with the long-term intent to increase representation among these groups on university faculties in the SBE sciences.  Our efforts focused on three key themes: 1) improving recruitment of under-represented minorities into graduate programs in the Social, Behavioral, and Economic (SBE) Sciences; 2) improving retention through enhanced career development of URM students in our programs; and 3) improving job placement as our URM students completed their Ph.D. programs and moved into academic or postdoctoral positions.  To assist in developing and institutionalizing recruitment, retention, and placement, each campus budgeted for a Diversity Director.   Several strategies were employed to recruit the most promising URM students into our SBE programs.  To expand the pool of applicants, we built partnerships with minority serving institutions in California and Texas and implemented several successful strategies.  These strategies included visits by the EDGE Diversity Director and selected faculty members to selected institutions; presentations to undergraduate students promoting our graduate programs in the SBE sciences&mdash;both at our own institutions and at feeder institutions; assisting students with applying to our programs; discussions of the rewards associated with an academic career; and dissemination of written material on the EDGE program.  At Texas A&amp;M University, the Diversity Director and other faculty coordinated with the NSF-funded Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program, a program that draws talented undergraduates from minority serving institutions located around the state.   Our retention efforts recognized that URM students often face challenges such as adjusting to graduate studies, gaining proficiency with writing and methodology for the discipline, living in a new location, having limited financial resources, and little experience planning an academic career.  To address these issues, the Diversity Director Texas A&amp;M as well as those on other campuses, organized informal discussion groups whereby fellows met to discuss their concerns and share information.  Formal workshops were also organized to cover topics such as how to prepare a curriculum vita and how to get project approval by the Institutional Review...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
