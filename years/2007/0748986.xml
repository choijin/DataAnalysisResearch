<AbstractNarration>This project concerns the continued development of a new paradigm for the activation and functionalization of aromatic molecules.  The cornerstone of this project is to selectively bind an arene or polyaromatic hydrocarbon through dihapto-complexation to a transition metal, and to use this adduct as a scaffold for the assembly of new highly-functionalized polycyclic compounds.  Coordination serves to enhance the reactivity of the arene toward electrophiles, and to stabilize reactive intermediates (e.g. arenium or allyl cations).  In addition, coordination influences the stereochemistry of these chemical transformations, and protects the site of coordination so that it may be used for subsequent chemistry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Professor W. Dean Harman of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Virginia.  Professor Harman's research efforts revolve around the development of new methods for the activation and functionalization of arenes.  The development of such methodology will have an impact on synthesis in the pharmaceutical and agricultural industries.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes.  The production of modern pharmaceuticals utilizes an elaborate array of methods developed over this past century that stitch together relatively simple petroleum-based molecules into more elaborate chemical structures. When a new synthetic process is developed, it opens the door to the creation of new compounds that can be tested for their biological and medicinal value.  Aromatics, a broad class of chemicals found in crude oil, often resist these chemical processes as they are endowed with certain properties that cause them to be unusually stable.  Efforts are underway in the Harman research group to increase access to this important and abundant class of materials.  A new type of molecule has been invented that can clamp to an aromatic molecule, acting a bit like a molecular vise. These so-called Dearomatizaton Agents feature tungsten or molybdenum reaction sites, which have been carefully engineered to disrupt the chemical stability of the bound aromatic.  Such action dramatically enhances the chemical reactivity of the arrested molecule, allowing access to a broad range of fundamentally new chemical transformations.  This new way of utilizing some of the most common molecular building blocks of nature will provide new candidates for medicines and biological probes.  In 2011, the chemical company Sigma-Aldrich will begin selling these dearomatization agents, offering chemists around the world ready access to this new technology.  Broader Impacts.  The new molecular frameworks that are formed through professor HarmanÆs Dearomatization Technology provide novel architectures that ultimately will be valuable in the development of new pharmaceuticals. In many cases there are simply no other means for readily obtaining these compounds. As these dearomatization agents become commercially available (Sigma-Aldrich, 2011), their increased use in both academic and industrial (Discovery) settings is virtually assured.  Other impacts of this work are related to the professional training of graduate and undergraduate students in the areas of Organic, Inorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry.  Students are exposed to a research environment that is fully interdisciplinary, working on problems ranging from medicinal application  to elementary synthetic methodology, to novel inorganic reaction mechanisms.  In addition to the routine techniques used by synthetic organic chemists, these students gain experience with electrochemical and computational methods, and techniques for handling air-sensitive compounds.  They become integrated into the scientific community through attendance and presentations at professional meetings, participation writing peer-reviewed manuscripts, participating in the proposal-writing process, and meeting other scientists that visit the group or the department. In addition, graduate students develop their mentoring skills by training and collaborating with undergraduate students. Finally, an ongoing collaboration (20 years) of the Harman research group with the University of Richmond provides their students exposure to the graduate level research environment.
