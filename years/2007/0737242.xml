<AbstractNarration>Engineering - Electrical (55)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is designing and implementing an instructional tool for sequential logic design. The development of this tool completes the digital logic design tool that currently contains only the combinational logic design component. Completion of the overall tool provides an environment that allows students to acquire the knowledge they need through technology as well as through traditional methods. The approach is based on the idea that multiple representation of information (text, graphics, audio, and video) provides an effective strategy that addresses three different learning modes (Visual, Aural, and Verbal). Providing an e-learning tool that works as a practice tool rather than a homework helper is a novel concept that is not available in the online learning paradigms. The development of these tools will help students gauge their progress through immediate feedback, deepen their comprehension through interactive tutorials, and be self as well as lifelong learners through the use of online tools. An outside evaluator is helping the principal investigator to measure improvements in student learning and in their self-monitoring and self-assessment of learning strategies.   Dissemination is occurring through website and list server postings, conference presentations, journal publications, and a faculty workshop.  Broader impacts include the dissemination of the material and data, a faculty workshop, and a special focus on African-American students.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
