<AbstractNarration>Ecosystems are losing native species, gaining exotics, and becoming simpler and more homogenous.  The Waller group studies these processes in Midwestern forests using a unique baseline dataset from the 1950's. Differences among sites provide insights into what site and landscape features make forests susceptible to extinction and invasion.  Differences among species provide clues as to which ecological processes are driving these changes, including habitat fragmentation and deer herbivory.  In this project, the researchers will survey dynamic lowland forests to track invasions and extinctions and the roles of soil, light, invasive shrubs, and landscape conditions on plant community dynamics.  The team will also analyze how plant characteristics affect the susceptibility of different species to various kinds of ecological change.  This will allow these researchers to anticipate which species and sites are most vulnerable and the traits and conditions that make them vulnerable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will analyze changes in community composition in terms of the invasion, persistence and extinction of individual species.  These analyses will illuminate how shifts in plant distribution and abundance depend on plant traits as well as site and surrounding landscape conditions.  These results will be used to test theories of community change and to guide forest and wildlife managers charged with sustaining diversity and ecological integrity. This project will also draw attention to long-term ecological change and build public support for monitoring and understanding those changes.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Natural areas around the world are shrinking and becoming and more subject to human impacts like nitrogen inputs, invasions of exotic species, and habitat fragmentation.  These processes are reducing native species diversity, both locally among sites. In this project, we continued our studies of long-term ecological change across the plant communities of Wisconsin.  Our goals in this project were to:  a) extend our work to lowland floodplain forests,  b) compare sites to gain insights into what site and landscape features make plant communities susceptible to local extinction and invasion,  c) determine whether patterns of community composition in the 1950s could predict patterns of species loss and gain, and  d) compare species with different characteristics ('functional traits') to assess how these traits affect the ability of species to persist in today's landscapes.   In the lowland forests, we assessed the relative roles of soil, light, invasive shrubs, and landscape conditions on plant community dynamics.  These communities have converged 30% in composition (reflecting biotic 'homogenization') and experienced increases in invasive exotic species.  Sites with altered flooding regimes within more fragmented landscapes have experienced the most change.  Smaller upland forest sites and those closer to roads and houses also experienced more invasions, greater declines in diversity, and more homogenization.  Community structure in the 1950s did provide predictions for which particular species were likely to invade or disappear from sites.   We have now resurveyed 84 N upland forests, 121 S upland forests, 32 beech sites, 50 S lowland forests, and 54 'railroad' and 10 dry lime prairies.  In this work, we anticipated changes like succession toward shadier forest conditions, invasions of exotics, and species losses from smaller and more fragmented habitats.  Nevertheless, we were also surprised to learn that stands with no hunting lose far more species than hunted stands; declines in (re)-colonization contribute more to diversity declines than increases in extinction; and that local site conditions (like forest canopy and soil nutrient conditions) that strongly predicted herb community composition in the 1950Æs are now less important than surrounding landscape conditions. That is, the local site factors that historically formed the basis for predicting community composition in plant ecology have become significantly less predictive over the past 50 years. In contrast, landscape context and composition has become significantly more predictive. Overall, these results demonstrate how large ecological changes like these are occurring under our noses, but in a way that is slow and rarely monitored, making them invisible without quality quality baseline data and these extensive resurveys.  This project also allowed us to collect data on plant functional traits that we are just starting to analyze. Species with larger, thinner, and less tough leaves exhibit more differences in traits across Wisconsin. Several traits (leaf toughness, specific leaf area, leaf thickness, and leaf dry matter content) are well correlated with each other in thin, large-leaved species but not in thick, tough-leaved species. Leaf traits are not closely correlated with stem traits and different stem traits are often not well correlated with each other. Traits vary far more (&gt;3x) among than within species, as expected. We will next assess how these traits contribute to the differences we observe in species' abilities to persist and thrive in today's landscapes.  We will use these results to test theories of community change and to assist forest and wildlife managers charged with sustaining diversity and ecological integrity. Results from this project may also increase public appreciation for the magnitude and nature of long-term ecological change.
