<AbstractNarration>The proposed research focuses on the development of quasi-living polymerization techniques for the synthesis of semiconducting polymers with the aim of obtaining improved control over their shape, polydispersity, size and ultimately their optoelectronic properties.  The technique developed in the Luscombe group will be used to create a variety of novel conjugated polymer structures including block copolymers, star-shaped polymers, and brush polymers.  The optoelectronic properties of semiconducting polymers are known to be heavily dependent on their structures.  Being able to control the shape and size of the polymers accurately will enable the fabrication of organic electronic devices with improved processing and better stability.  The research program addressed in this CAREER proposal has clear technological applications in the area of flat-panel displays and photovoltalc devices that is directly relevant to both students and the public.  Additionally, the work described is fully interdisciplinary lying at the interface of chemistry, physics, and materials science.  This makes the research program particularly suitable for education and outreach programs.  The PI is actively participating in K through 12 outreach through existing programs in the university, and also accepting students and teachers for the NSF REU and RET Programs.  These interactions will be heavily leveraged to advance the major educational goals of the proposal.  The first goal is to introduce global education to middle and high school students by allowing students to learn the latest advances in modern technologies about  flat panel displays and photovoltalc devices while simultaneously expanding their horizons by interacting internationally via an internet based virtual classroom.  The second goal is to improve undergraduate education in the Materials Science and Engineering Department at the University of Washington by the incorporation of writing programs into their existing courses.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;&amp;&amp;&lt;br/&gt;Semiconducting polymers are actively under development for use in low cost, light-weight, and flexible electronic devices such as organic light-emitting diodes, thin-film transistors and solar cells.  However, their performances  in many applications is limited by our ability to accurately  control their syntheses and hence their structure and properties.  In this proposal, the fundamental aspects of controlling the synthesis of semiconducting polymers will be studied so that superior control over the shape, size, and properties of the materials can be achieved.  The work will impact a number of areas in the field of optoelectronic devices, and in particular, have a major impact on the improvement on organic solar cells.  The research  described in this proposal is highly interdisciplinary and well suited for outreach activities.  Specifically, the educational goals described in the proposal draw from the PI's research, educational, and personal experience to incorporate writing into the undergraduate curriculum at the University of Washington, and enhance global communication while introducing the latest results about polymers to the general public.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
