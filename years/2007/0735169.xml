<AbstractNarration>In March 2008, the Mathematics Department of the University of Florida will conduct a conference&lt;br/&gt;on Partitions, q-series and modular forms, which will include in it a Student Workshop.&lt;br/&gt;This conference is one of the highlights of a year long program on Algebra, Number Theory, and Combinatorics in 2007-08. The conference will bring together number theorists and combinatorialists&lt;br/&gt;to share and learn new methods and results. An important aim of the conference is to&lt;br/&gt;involve graduate students and advanced undergraduates. The Workshop in the first part is to prepare students for the Research Conference to follow.&lt;br/&gt;The theory of partitions and q-series is a central area of number theory having interactions&lt;br/&gt;with combinatorics, analysis, the theory of modular forms, computer algebra, and physics. It&lt;br/&gt;is an area where the Indian mathematical genius Srinivasa Ramanujan has made spectacular&lt;br/&gt;contributions. Topics covered in the conference will include Rogers-Ramanujan type identities,&lt;br/&gt;elliptic hypergeometric functions, partition congruences, modular forms and mock theta functions.&lt;br/&gt;A special feature of the research conference will be a series of lectures by Ken Ono on&lt;br/&gt;recent pathbreaking work connecting mock theta functions and modular forms.&lt;br/&gt;The three conference organizers from the University of Florida - Alexander Berkovich, Frank&lt;br/&gt;Garvan, and the PI - form one the major groups the theory of partitions, q-series, and modular&lt;br/&gt;forms, and the mathematics of Ramanujan. The strength of their program has been enhanced&lt;br/&gt;by association and collaboration with George Andrews, the premier authority on partitions and&lt;br/&gt;Ramanujan's work. This conference builds on several successful programs conducted previously&lt;br/&gt;by the number theorists at the University of Florida.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
