<AbstractNarration>AST-0708607&lt;br/&gt;Hamilton&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A previous NSF-funded collaboration in informal science education (DRL-0337286, PI Tom Lucas) led to the creation of two shows about black holes: a high-resolution large format digital dome show, and a Nova/PBS television show.  The Black Hole Flight Simulator created for that collaboration produces accurate general relativistic visualizations of what it is like to fly around, into, and even through black holes, in the context of a vision to 'give black holes to the world' in a way that people can more easily grasp, that is, visually.  This project will take this vision to the next level, carrying out the research behind the visualizations, and taking the representations to new heights of realism, educational content, and visual impact.  It involves research in numerical general relativity, coupled with the motivation to make the work accessible not only to scientists but to the world at large, and working with film-making professionals interested in bringing real science to the screen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broad goals of this proposal tightly entwine science and societal impact.  Existing and future visualizations will be seen by a great many people in the US and throughout the world.  High-performance scientifically accurate real-time visualizations should become a central component of science education, especially in relativity where everyday experience is a poor guide.  The scientists involved will gain literacy in visualization for non-scientists, bridging the cultural gap between scientists and the public.</AbstractNarration>
