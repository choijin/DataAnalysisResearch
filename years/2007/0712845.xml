<AbstractNarration>A completely new focus in robotics research is proposed.  The purpose is to enable automatic dispensing and mixing of highly viscous bio-samples which has important applications in life sciences including drug screening, protein crystallization, and protein expression.  Since the volume to deal with is extremely small at the micro- or nano-liter scale, and viscosity causes the samples to stick to everything, robotic handling of such bio-samples is extremely challenging.  Three novel methods are proposed to solve the problems.  The first method is an innovative micro-capsule with micro-channel for mixing viscous bio-samples using centrifugation such that no contact is needed.  The second method is soft-hard compliance of robotic motion for delivering bio-samples into tiny micro-capsules, for which a micro force-sensing device based on piezo-resistance and visco-elasticity is to be invented.   The third method is a programmable robotic spinning device which generates adequate centrifugal forces in real-time for mixing bio-samples.  The three new methods will lay a foundation for high-throughput dispensing and mixing of bio-samples using robust intelligence in robotics.   In addition, the project will bring a broader impact to life sciences, education, and economy.</AbstractNarration>
