<AbstractNarration>0729709&lt;br/&gt;Axinn&lt;br/&gt;PIRE: Collaborative Research and Training in Social Context, Population Processes, and Environmental Change&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Partnership for International Research and Education (PIRE) brings together researchers and students from five U.S. universities and four institutions in Nepal and China to undertake comparative studies on the dynamics of population-environment interaction.  Principal investigator, William Axinn of the University of Michigan and colleagues from Michigan State University, San Diego State University, the University of North Carolina, and Arizona State University will collaborate with Nepalese partners from the Institute for Social and Environmental Research and Tribhuvan University's Institute of Agriculture and Animal Science, and with Chinese partners from the Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Wolong Nature Reserve.  The field sites in Nepal and China are two high-profile settings where large, growing populations, rapidly changing economies, unique biodiversity and complex institutional structures offer exceptional research and educational opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The five-year plan for collaborative research focuses on improving understanding of patterns and processes affecting vegetation and habitats for three endangered species (pandas, rhinos, and tigers), achieving cross-case comparisons of the dynamics of population-environment interaction for Nepal and China, and establishing widely applicable tools needed to make such comparisons in other settings.  The educational objectives of the collaboration will draw upon the intellectual and physical resources of each partner to train a next generation of scientists skilled in conducting new international cross-case comparisons of the human-environment interaction.  This activity provides a unique international research and training experience for forty U.S. graduate and twelve undergraduate students.  Educational and research activities are closely integrated with a focus on learning and practicing concepts and methods needed to bridge key disciplines and foster international collaboration while pursuing compelling research questions.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Detailed single site case studies that provide micro-level information have greatly advanced knowledge about human-environment interaction, but cross-case comparison is now an extremely high scientific priority needed for better understanding of global environmental change.  Specifically, the strengths of the Nepal case study, which is rich in dynamic measurements of community context will be applied to the China case study.  Likewise, the strengths of the China case study, the analysis of remote sensing data and agent-based modeling to study forest and habitat dynamics, will be applied to the Nepal study.  The integration will increase the comparability of data and methods across these important cases and the cross-fertilization of research among different case studies will enhance the value of each case study.  More importantly, this work will enable the comparative study of human-environment interaction that pushes the field past singular case studies toward multilateral research designs.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has the potential to greatly accelerate investigation of important environmental change, ultimately helping to identify effective strategies for preserving biodiversity.  The  findings are expected to identify models of studying human-environment interaction that transfer across settings to link various studies in a mutually beneficial manner. Further, this project will train a new generation of scientists pioneering international cross-case comparisons of population-environment interactions. Such scientists will be crucial in the coming decades to integrate detailed understandings of specific cases into studies of global environmental change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded by the Office of International Science and Engineering together with the &lt;br/&gt;Directorate for Social, Behavioral &amp; Economic Sciences.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our PIRE project was "Collaborative Research and Training in Social Context, Population Processes, and Environmental Change." Environmental changes are often produced by social and economic processes that operate across international borders. In fact, changes in distant countries can have important environmental consequences in the United States. To help equip the next generation of American scientists with the tools needed to work in successful collaboration with scientists in other countries we specifically designed our project to put American trainees into multinational collaborative teams. Because scientific advance in this area also requires multiple types of expertise &ndash; spanning both the ecological and social sciences &ndash; these teams were also explicitly multidisciplinary. Our construction of these teams put each junior scientist into direct collaboration with multiple scientists from other fields of study and other countries, giving American undergraduates, graduate students, post-doctoral trainees, and junior faculty opportunities to build skills in a career of advancing the global science of studying environmental change.  Our research focused on change over time in human-environment interactions in the two most populous regions of the world: South Asia and China. Building on long-term studies of communities, families, land cover, and endangered species in Chitwan, Nepal and Wolong, China, our teams took a new multidisciplinary systems science approach to the integration of population change, social organization, land cover and habitat. Growing populations, rapidly changing economies, unique biodiversity and complex institutional structures combined to make these two sites ideal for advancing and testing theoretical and statistical models of how social and environmental phenomena change over time. Our research used an innovative combination of methods from several different areas of science, including community-level surveys, the analysis of satellite imagery, computational analysis of geographic data, sophisticated statistical models, and computer simulation models.. These tools gave us the means to link change over time in the social organization of communities to change over time in family and population events, to change over time in land use and land cover, to change over time in habitats. Each of these dimensions of change is itself complex and the relations among them are more complex because change in each has the possibility of creating change in any other.  By advancing this area of science we were able to produce:  Crucial improvements in the case-specific understanding of human processes affecting local vegetation and habitats for three important endangered species (pandas, rhinos, and tigers);  Equally important advances in understanding the ways through which changes in land cover and species diversity affect the nearby human population; A new set of tools for comprehensively comparing how these dynamic processes occur within different countries;  Both the models and methods needed to launch a new field of science investigating the human-environment relationships across long distances, spanning international borders.   The project produced both: 1) A new cohort of young scientists able to work in international, cross-disciplinary collaborations to advance this science and teach it to others, and; 2) A new theoretical and methodological framework for conducting multi-site global research on human-environment interactions. Through the project our team was also able to make substantial advances in institutionalized connections between U.S. universities (Arizona State University, the University of Michigan, Michigan State University, the University of North Carolina &ndash; Chapel Hill, and San Diego State University) and collaborative partner institutions in Nepal and China.
