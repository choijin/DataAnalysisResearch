    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will develop an Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) repair system for restoring the optical and electrical properties of scratched ITO-coated surfaces. These types of materials are used as electrically conducting windows which also provide protection against electromagnetic interference (EMI) in applications such as aircraft windshields and canopies, electro-optical devices, solar cells and EMI shielding.Currently there are no economical solutions to repair or rework the ITO-coated substrates scratch during the manufacturing or use in final applications. The proposed process will directly apply ITO films into the scratched areas. The research will focus on the development of process parameters, including materials, film deposition procedures, to allow the application of the novel coating technique in ambient conditions, rather than having to use high-vacuum equipment or high deposition temperatures. This will allow the technology to be used easily by technicians during manufacture, or in the field for on-site repair using a portable film application kit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this technology will be ITO-coated aircraft and helicopter canopies, damaged in service due to impact by debris or other materials. This will be a major benefit for the military since the damage to the aircraft due to electromagnetic interference can be quite hazardous. Other major, high-value-added markets include electro-optical devices, such as displays, organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs)and sensors.The new technology will permit the use of direct patterning processes used in microelectronics manufacture, thereby significantly reducing process costs. This will put the U.S. in a leadership position vis-a vis the Asian manufacturers of the electro-optical devices.</AbstractNarration>
