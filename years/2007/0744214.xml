    <AbstractNarration>A Gordon Research Conference on meiosis will be held June 8-13, 2008, at Colby-Sawyer College in New London, New Hampshire. Meiosis is the specialized cell division that gives rise to reproductive cells such as sperm and eggs. The long-term goal of the conference is to further the understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of meiotic chromosome segregation and cell division. The emphasis is on chromosome dynamics, but with substantial coverage of cytoskeletal and nuclear structure, gene regulation, gametogenesis, and evolutionary aspects. The specific aims of the meeting are to provide a forum for scientific interaction in this interdisciplinary field, to present the newest results in the field, to introduce young researchers to the field and foster their interactions with established investigators, and to promote interdisciplinary discussion that will foster new approaches, concepts, and ideas.&lt;br/&gt; This meeting provides a venue for discussions that will advance the understanding of this fundamental aspect of reproductive biology and will frame the experimental questions necessary to drive future research. The Meiosis Gordon Conference is a venue that allows promising researchers from the U.S. at early stages in their careers, including graduate students and post-doctoral fellows, to gain exposure to international leaders in the field. The meeting has always been successful in attracting female participants and has been attended by scientists from throughout the US and the world. Outreach to minority scientists will be through contacts with scientists in the field and through international advertising.</AbstractNarration>
