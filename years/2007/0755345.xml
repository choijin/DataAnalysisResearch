<AbstractNarration>The theme of this three-year REU Site program is "Sustainable Solutions to Emerging Environmental Problems."  With new technological and scientific advancements combined with increasing population and limited resources, environmental problems become more complex and inter-connected.   These problems may require technological and/or social solutions that provide for economic, social and environmental sustainability.  Examples of emerging environmental problems are: 1) the predicted end of oil; 2) climate change; and 3) human and ecosystem impacts of emerging pollutants.  In an effort to respond to the need for solutions to these emerging environmental problems, this REU Site program theme incorporates three main areas of research: Alternative Energy and Greenhouse Gas Reduction; Fate and Transport of Emerging Pollutants; and Political, Social and Ecological Responses to Emerging Environmental Problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of this REU site are as follows: 1) to motivate students to continue on to graduate school and successful careers in science and engineering,2) to recruit traditionally underrepresented students and provide these students with the opportunity to conduct independent research in environmental engineering and science in a supportive and challenging environment , 3) to advance multidisciplinary approaches to solving emerging environmental problems through cross-disciplinary training in hypothesis-driven research methods and experience in applied research, and 4) to teach students how to communicate their research to colleagues and the general public through professional oral presentation, peer-reviewed publication, and the media. In addition to the hands-on research experience students will participate in seminars, field-trips and social activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program will aim to increase recruitment of underrepresented students through contacts at colleges with large minority populations and collaboration with other on-campus programs.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

The program activities were designed to widen the educational pipeline in science and engineering and motivate students to continue on to graduate school and successful careers in science and engineering.

Although the research project component was the primary focus of this program, the field trips, seminars, and social activities provided the students with a broader academic experience.  The areas highlighted by the studentÆs participants to be the strengths of the program were:  the experience of conducting research, the opportunity to meet peers and mentors, and the introduction to graduate school.  In addition to learning how to conduct and complete a well-designed and substantive research project, the program also emphasized the importance of communicating research results.  All participants wrote a research paper and participated in a University Research Symposium.  In 2009, all 12 REU student participants have presented their research at the Northeast American Chemical Society conference.   For two consecutive summers, a research experience for teachers (RET) component has been added and four RET fellows have participated in the program activities including: the research project, field trips, seminars and research presentation.  Participation of the RET fellows in field trips and special projects and integration in a research project team have ensured cohesiveness among the RET/REU fellows and enhanced their appreciation for belonging to a diverse group.  The RET fellows have been associated with the Clarkson K-12 Project-Based Learning Partnership and STEM Programs. This partnership has been highly successful and greatly valued by the participants.  A project based module based on the summer experience has been incorporated by the RET fellows in their classroom during the academic year and posted on the Clarkson K-12 website.  Participants completed a comprehensive written survey before and after the program, which we used to evaluate the success of the REU site program at meeting its stated objectives, and to quantify participant satisfaction.  They also participated in an evaluative focus group discussion with an out...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
