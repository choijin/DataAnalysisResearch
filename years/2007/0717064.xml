<AbstractNarration>Human activities threaten the integrity of desert ecosystems, many of which?like the springs in the northern Chihuahuan Desert of west Texas and southeastern New Mexico?probably contain large numbers of unique species.  Unfortunately, little is known about the bottom-dwelling invertebrates of these systems.  This project will survey six desert spring systems.  Organisms from samples will be identified as known or undescribed.  A web-accessible database of species lists with digitized images for each spring will be created.  Genetic ?barcoding? using DNA sequencing will allow identification of cryptic species?those that appear identical but which are actually separate species.  Geographic patterns in diversity also will be investigated.  Because many of these species are likely limited to a single spring system, information generated by this project will be useful to agencies charged with conservation of threatened and endangered species.  Researchers also will test the efficacy of genetic barcoding as a method for identifying cryptic species.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has significant educational merit.  Students from Miami University Hamilton (an open-admission, two-year campus) will gain invaluable research experience.  The database will be accessible to the public and used in biology courses.  Research results will be provided to conservation agencies and published in scientific journals.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit  Desert springs are under significant threat due to human needs for water.  These ecosystems are also sites of hidden biodiversity.  Our goals were to survey invertebrates in springs of southeastern New Mexico and west Texas, use DNA  barcoding to identify new species, and examine geographic patterns of biodiversity.  Information gained provides increased understanding of how evolution has shaped the biodiversity of this region, while also shedding light on the impact of human activities and climate change on these ecosystems.  We sampled freshwater invertebrates four times each from nine springs.   Analysis of samples showed that communities did not differ over time and that the closer two springs are, the more similar their communities.  Such patterns also occurred in the fish communities, suggesting that community similarity is limited by dispersal ability of organisms and harsh desert environments between springs.  We noted minimal changes in community structure before and after a grassland fire; one endangered species responded positively to fire.  These results suggest that arid-land aquatic communities can be resistant to changes caused by wildfires. With climate change predicted to increase frequency and intensity of fires, aquatic communities may be more vulnerable to severe events in the future.  Using DNA "barcoding" (sequences of DNA that differ among species), we uncovered cryptic species (similar in morphology, but with significant differences in DNA) in many groups.  For example, the crustacean genus Gammarus contains at least four undescribed species.  Similar patterns are found in other crustaceans, snails, and flatworms.  The fact that this pattern is found in such disparate groups suggests that they would also be found in the many other invertebrates inhabiting these springs.  Furthermore, many of these species are limited to single spring systems and thus, each spring system has its own unique species of Gammarus and other groups.  These spring systems likely contain large numbers of unique, undescribed species of invertebrates.  Sequencing of DNA also provides insight into patterns of evolution.  Gammarus amphipods of this region are descended from two lineages:  one consisting of descendents of a marine relict that shares a most-recent common ancestor with marine Gammarus; the second shares a most-recent common ancestor with G. lacustris, a species found throughout North America and Eurasia.  However, Gammarus populations in each spring system form a unique group, indicating isolation and ongoing speciation.  The time scale of these processes is quite long; in the case of the marine relict group, differentiation from the marine ancestor probably occurred around 30 million years ago.  Two species of endangered aquatic springsnails (Pyrgulopsis roswellensis and Juturnia kosteri) have ranges that lie completely on Bitter Lake National Wildlife Refuge, Chaves County, NM and therefore, these are micro-endemic species.  Because these species are difficult to distinguish morphologically, it is difficult to assess their status on the refuge.  While geometric morphometrics showed significant overlap in shell shape, the species were distinguishable using DNA barcoding, supporting the use of this technique for distinguishing cryptic taxa.  Snails of the genus Physa are common to many of the springs in the northern Chihuahuan Desert.  DNA barcoding suggests the presence of both the widespread P. acuta and a number of cryptic taxa.  Our analysis detected the presence of at least four provisional species, each of which is relegated to a small number of springs.  Broader Impacts  This project provided training opportunities for a diverse group of young scientists.  One postdoctoral scholar, three graduate students, and a large number of undergraduates conducted research.  Many undergraduates were from Miami University Hamilton, an open-admission, urban campus.
