    <AbstractNarration>Over the next three years, an interdisciplinary team of faculty at Colorado College will help train the next generation of researchers in mathematical biology. The project will provide 16 undergraduate students with the opportunity to carry out in-depth research, working in interdisciplinary pairs with a 1:1 student-faculty ratio. The researchers will apply sophisticated mathematical techniques to a diverse array of biological phenomena: the population dynamics and habitat use of migratory owls; the evolutionary history of aboriginal populations in Asia; the genetic regulation of Salmonella bacteria; and the mutually beneficial interactions of ants, aphids, and ladybugs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mathematical approaches to biology promise to revolutionize both the biological and mathematical sciences. For the United States to maintain its leadership in this vital area, the next generation of researchers must be introduced to its methods, challenges, and opportunities. Colorado College has an excellent track record in preparing students for graduate work in the sciences, and this program will build on this strength in an area of national need. The faculty participants are committed to enhancing the diversity of the scientific community by recruiting and mentoring students from underrepresented groups. The project will help develop an ongoing program in mathematical biology, positioning the college to be a national leader in the field.</AbstractNarration>
