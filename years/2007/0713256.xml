<AbstractNarration>It is proposed to develop new numerical algorithms and mathematical models &lt;br/&gt;predicting the breakup of liquid into droplets due to cross-flowing air &lt;br/&gt;and the resulting gas-liquid mixture that follows.   New numerical methods &lt;br/&gt;are proposed which exploit large-aspect ratio computational elements.  The &lt;br/&gt;investigator together with two graduate students, shall develop new algorithms &lt;br/&gt;for including the capability for large aspect ratio elements, as a part of &lt;br/&gt;a dynamic block-structured adaptive mesh method.   The study of large aspect &lt;br/&gt;ratio elements as a part of an adaptive, unstructured grid framework has &lt;br/&gt;received significant attention recently (albeit, not in the context of &lt;br/&gt;two-phase flows, as we propose to study).   In contrast, the study of &lt;br/&gt;moving mesh methods with large aspect ratio elements, as a part of a block &lt;br/&gt;structured adaptive framework, has received very little attention.  An &lt;br/&gt;algorithm based on block structured adaptive mesh refinement affords one &lt;br/&gt;the advantage of easy scalability in regard to parallel computing, adoption &lt;br/&gt;of multigrid methodology and implementation of temporal sub-cycling &lt;br/&gt;techniques.  Numerical analysis issues regarding stability and convergence &lt;br/&gt;of a numerical method when applied on a moving mesh, block structured &lt;br/&gt;adaptive grid, shall be investigated.  Also, algorithms defining the motion &lt;br/&gt;of the moving mesh shall be investigated.   It is important that the level &lt;br/&gt;of skewness for the moving mesh can be controlled.  Research developed in &lt;br/&gt;this proposal can be applied to mathematical problems that exhibit moving &lt;br/&gt;boundary layers, shock waves, ignition fronts, or sharp interfaces.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is concerned with the development of orders of magnitude faster &lt;br/&gt;(100 times faster) numerical tools for the simulation of multiphase flow &lt;br/&gt;problems as applicable to science and industry.  These numerical tools shall &lt;br/&gt;be specifically formulated for high-density ratio, high-shear flows at an &lt;br/&gt;acceptable computational cost for engineering analysis of practical problems.  &lt;br/&gt;One immediate application of the proposed research is a jet-propulsion system &lt;br/&gt;in which fuel injected as a liquid is atomized into spray by interaction with &lt;br/&gt;a gas phase.  Another application is the prediction of momentum and energy &lt;br/&gt;transfer in the ocean due to hurricane force winds.  In order to predict &lt;br/&gt;momentum and energy transfer at the sea surface, one must take into account &lt;br/&gt;the sea spray generated by the high speed winds.  The ultimate benefits &lt;br/&gt;to society are reduced pollution, increased engine efficiency, and improved &lt;br/&gt;hurricane predictive capability due to a more accurate sea-spray &lt;br/&gt;parameterization.  This proposal is motivated by interactions between the &lt;br/&gt;PI and industry (e.g. UTRC).  Success of this proposal will not only have a &lt;br/&gt;direct impact on industrial applications relevant to atomization type &lt;br/&gt;processes, but also a direct impact on any industrial/scientific application &lt;br/&gt;of multiphase flow (e.g. navy ship hydrodynamics, microfluidic applications &lt;br/&gt;for testing human serum, biological fluid flows, nuclear reactor cooling &lt;br/&gt;systems, and underwater explosions).  The PI has ongoing collaborations with &lt;br/&gt;SAIC (ship hydrodynamics), Department of Applied Chemistry at the Muroran &lt;br/&gt;Institute of Technology (non-newtonian multiphase flows in chemical processing &lt;br/&gt;applications), the Center for Bio-Imaging and Modeling at Rutgers University &lt;br/&gt;(CBIM, visualization and animation of multiphase flows), for which all of &lt;br/&gt;these collaborations benefit from the proposed research on simulating &lt;br/&gt;multiphase flows.  The proposed research involves the participation of &lt;br/&gt;graduate students; graduate students shall be trained on issues which are &lt;br/&gt;timely and to which they have access to experts in the field.    &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
