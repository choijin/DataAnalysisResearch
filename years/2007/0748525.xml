<AbstractNarration>With the support of a CAREER award from the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program at the National Science Foundation, Professor Sivaguru Jayaraman of North Dakota State University will lead a research program that will focus on ways to control stereoselection during light-induced asymmetric transformations by employing molecularly chiral chromophores. The research program is highly interdisciplinary and opens up an opportunity to control stereoselection in solution during phototransformations, a traditionally difficult task. The methodology employs light as a reagent, to imprint molecular chirality in the reactant leading to chirality in the photoproducts in solution. Preliminary results from the PI's lab shows that enantioselectivity as high as 97% can be achieved in solution. Considerable promise offered by this methodology shall open up new approaches to access chiral molecules with high stereoselectivity in photoreactions. As part of the program, the PI will explore various stereoselective light induced processes (electron and energy transfer). These studies are expected to offer, (a) new insights into asymmetric phototransformations through rotamer control; and, (b) a multitude of new structures that will be molecularly chiral. The proposed work will complement the existing methodologies for controlling reactivity and selectivity during phototransformations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This CAREER award to Professor Jayaraman of North Dakota State University will use light to access chiral molecules with high stereoselectivity during phototransformations in solution using molecularly chiral chromophores. This represents a major paradigm shift in comparison to conventional methods that are used to control selectivity in thermal reactions. An important objective of the proposed activity is to integrate education and research through teaching and training of students and researchers in methods of inquiry at the highest scientific, intellectual, professional, and experimental levels. Some of the broader impacts of the proposed activities derive from the PI's commitment to employ the latest developments in information, instruction, and learning technologies, in particular, computers and related technology (animations for easy understanding of concepts) and the World Wide Web, to create intellectual partnerships between the undergraduates and the teacher. The PI, during the first year at North Dakota State University, has successfully recruited and supervised underrepresented groups that include one minority undergraduate, one female undergraduate, and one female Governor School student. Social benefits of the proposed research are expected to be in the areas of creation of basic scientific knowledge, training of students with a range of experience and expertise in interdisciplinary and collaborative research, and creation of an infrastructure for integration of research with education. In terms of community impact, special efforts are being made to inform both parents and their children (grades 9-12) together about the impact of modern science and technology. To begin this process, lecture series are being proposed and developed by the PI with the help of local high schools in the Fargo-Moorhead area through the PICNICS (Parents Involvement in Children, Nurturing Intellectual Curiosity in Science) program.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
