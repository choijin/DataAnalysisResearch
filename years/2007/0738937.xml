<AbstractNarration>With the support of the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division, Professor Kevin W. Kittredge of the Miami University- Middletown will focus on three projects; 1) mechanisms for ligand-exchange of alkanethiol capped monolayer protected clusters (MPCs), 2) measuring the pKa values for benzoic acids omega-functionalized alkanethiolate MPCs, and 3) hyperbranched polyamide films that passivate photochemical and thermal degradation of art. Professor Kittredge will study the physical properties of alkanethiols assembled as monolayer protected clusters (MPCs) and examine MPCs composed of different metals (Au, Ag, CdS, Pt, Cu), various linkers (oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorous, and carboxylate anions), and differing alkyl chain lengths. The influence of the metal core size on nanoparticle stability and the effects on the physical constants for omega-substituted alkanethiols will also be studied. An emphasis of this research is to improve the stability of these nanoparticles and increase their potential as molecular devices. By investigating the mechanisms and physical properties of MPC clusters, the design and synthesis of more complex clusters will continue. The emphasis will be to improve the stability of the nanoparticles and increase their potential as molecular devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With support from this CAREER award from the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program, Professor Kevin W. Kittredge, of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the Middletown campus of Miami University is developing methodology for preparation of omega-functionalized MPCs and thin films. The results of his work will help establish structure/reactivity and structure/stability relationships for organic nanoparticles. He will introduce this research to first and second year students at Miami University Middletown, a two-year branch campus of Miami University with efforts on their continuing education towards more advanced degrees. A major focus will be on developing educational materials to be used in university chemistry courses, similar to previous work by the PI. Additionally, demonstrations will be developed and disseminated to schools and museums.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our project has resulted in 17 internal presentations, 26 external presentations, 3 publications with 31 undergraduate students and 4 research assistants as presentors, co-presentors, and co-authors. (22 female and 6 students who identified as a member of a traditionally underrepresented group in the STEM disciplines).   We have collaborated with two universitys, one is an HBCU, and with two local area high schools.  Of the 31 students, 26 have continued their education working towards advanced degrees.  In summary, one project developed novel metal ion sensors using metallic gold nanoparticles with crown ether ligands attached to the metal core.  This nanoparticles were assembled into thin films where we studied their stability and ability to sense analyte metal ions.  The films were prepared in a variety of methods to permit swelling/contracting to optimize their abilities to absorb analyte material.  In another project thin films were prepared composed of polyamides.  Their method of preparation was optimized, the films were examined for the ability to absorb a particular dye or pigment, then be subjected to artificial aging conditions of light and humidity, then reexamined to determine their effectiveness to prevent the dye or pigment from undergoing a physical change.  In another project a series of carbon-13 labeled alkanethiols were synthesized and then used to cap gold nanoparticles.  We determined that these materials underwent an exchange with identical (but unlabeled) alkanethiols using NMR spectrometry in an associate type mechanism.  The incoming alkanethiol formed a complex with the attached alkanethiol prior to exchange.  We were not able to uniquely distinguish the conformation of this complex and were only able to exchange up to 40% carbon-13 labeled alkanethiol.
