<AbstractNarration>Proteins containing inorganic prosthetic groups composed of iron and sulfur are called [Fe-S] proteins and they have a wide variety of functions in essential biological processes. Among these are included electron transfer, substrate activation, catalysis and environmental sensing. In vitro evidence has been obtained to support the hypothesis that [Fe-S] clusters used to activate [Fe-S] proteins are pre-formed on assembly scaffolds. The current project is concerned with dissecting the in vivo details of bacterial [Fe-S] protein maturation and is designed to achieve the folowing objectives. Biophysical characterization of [Fe-S] clusters that are assembled on scaffold proteins in vivo. Biophysical, structural and genetic analysis of [Fe-S] cluster assembly complexes that are produced in vivo and contain trapped forms of [Fe-S] clusters.  Identification and purification of bacterial components that can contribute to the effective catalytic maturation of [Fe-S] proteins. It also provides young students with wonderful opportunities to learn how to conduct science and training in modern molecular biology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Many life-sustaining processes, such as nitrogen fixation, photosynthesis, and respiration, involve proteins that contain small, simple, inorganic entities comprised entirely of iron and sulflide.  Such inorganic entities are called iron-sulfur clusters and proteins that contain them are called iron-sulfur proteins.  Iron-sulfur proteins are involved in a variety of biological processes including electron transfer, substrate activation, and cellular signaling.  It is also widely considered that iron-sulfur clusters played a key role in the emergence of life on earth.  In spite of their simple structures, iron-sulfur clusters are not formed spontaneously in cells because intracellular free iron and free sulfide are highly toxic to living cells.  Instead, during the course of this project it was discovered that biological iron-sulfur clusters are assembled using a consortium of proteins that traffic iron and sulfur intracellularly in non-toxic forms.  Key aspects of the process involve the participation of a cysteine desulfurase, called IscS, which provides the necessary sulfide, and an assembly scaffold, called IscU, which provides the site for iron-sulfur cluster formation.  In this project it was demonstrated that iron-sulfur cluster assembly that occurs inside cells is a dynamic process that involves the association and dissociation of IscS and IscU.  It was also shown that once iron-sulfur clusters are formed on the assembly scaffold, they are released to other proteins that serve to carry them to other target proteins.  Insight into the chemical details of cellular iron-sulfur cluster assembly was obtained by isolation of an IscS &ndash; IscU complex that contains an iron-sulfur cluster trapped in the assembly process.  Crystallographic analysis of this complex revealed that during the assembly process an iron-sulfur cluster is located at the interface of the IscS-IscU unit and that the cluster must become exposed when the two proteins dissociate.  A final line of genetic investigation revealed all of the proteins that are produced at higher or lower levels when the cellular demand for iron-sulfur cluster formation is increased.  Two practical applications of the basic research performed during this project have emerged.  First, many biochemical pathways are limited by the activities of an associated iron-sulfur protein.  One example is the production of certain biofuels such as butanol.  Second, recent work performed in other laboratories has revealed that a number of human genetic disorders are linked to defects in the iron-sulfur cluster assembly process.  Consequently, effective development of certain commercial processes for agronomic and economic benefit, as well as, development of therapeutic approaches for certain disease states, will be advanced by a fundamental understanding of the biological mechanism of iron-sulfur cluster assembly, a process that, so far, appears to be universally conserved in Nature.
