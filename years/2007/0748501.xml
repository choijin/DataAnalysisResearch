<AbstractNarration>In this award, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Division of Chemistry, the Molecular Biophysics Program of the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, and the BIO Venture Fund for Interdisciplinary Research (VIR), Professor Kevin J. Kubarych of the University of Michigan, his postdoctoral fellows and graduate and undergraduate students are investigating the dynamics of the bacteriorhodopsin photocycle over six decades of timescale -- femtosecond to microsecond.  The principal tool for these studies will be multidimensional infrared (MDIR) spectroscopy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ultimate goal of the work by Professor Kubarych and his group is to develop a fundamental chemical understanding of how biomolecules move and perform their unique biological functions.  Bacteriorhodopsin is a well-studied system, and presents a unique laboratory for new experimental methods.  Although well-studied, there are a number of outstanding questions for how bacteriorhodpsin works, and Prof. Kubarych's group's work will help to provide answers.  In addition to his research work, Prof. Kubarych plans to bring cutting-edge technology from his laboratory, in the form of femtosecond spectroscopy instrumentation, into the undergraduate teaching laboratory.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
