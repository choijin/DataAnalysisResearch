    <AbstractNarration>Techbridge was founded in 2000 by Chabot Space &amp; Science Center to build an effective model program for girls in underserved communities and to encourage and promote their interests in technology, science, and engineering. The program''s emphasis on career exploration for girls has enabled staff to gain expertise training professionals and corporate partners for successful interactions between role models and students. Techbridge''s evaluation data and research confirm that visits with role models and field trips to worksites have a significant and lasting impact in influencing girls'' academic choices and career paths. In addition, these outreach efforts benefit organizations, boosting company morale and developing employee leadership. With a successful program in place backed by strong evaluation results, Techbridge developed a training model and resource guide for role models called ""Get Involved. Make a Difference. A Guide for Classroom Visits and Field Trips for K-12 Students."" The training and resource guide feature practical guidance and case studies that highlight activities and successful interactions between role models and youth. In this project, Techbridge will extend the distribution of ""Get Involved. Make a Difference."" to a wider audience and provide partners with research-based, field-tested resources and training to assist them in recruiting and supporting role models. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit--The Role Models Make a World of Difference project: 1) fills an unmet need by providing information and resources that are well organized, practical, useful, and easily accessible to role models and partners; 2) provides resources and training that are based upon a robust model program that has a 7-year track record for successfully engaging role models in outreach through classroom visits and field trips; 3) engages a team that brings extensive expertise to the project, with over two decades of experience developing career resources for girls; and 4) distributes guidelines for role models, developed with input from Techbridge''s research study and longitudinal investigation, to encourage role models to present in ways that are most likely to positively impact girls'' academic and career aspirations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts--The Role Models Make a World of Difference project has broad, long-term impact through outreach, training, and partnerships with educational, corporate, and government agencies that are committed to increasing girls'' participation in technology, science, and engineering. It is expected that over 225,000 role models will be trained and supported during the project that will promote the participation of girls in technology, science, and engineering.</AbstractNarration>
