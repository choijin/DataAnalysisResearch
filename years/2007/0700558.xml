<AbstractNarration>This project will develop a robust approach for damage identification (detection and quantification) of bridges exposed to environmental temperature and solar radiation variations and traffic loads. The approach will utilize the modal properties extracted from vibration response data with appropriate adjustments for thermal effects for damage identification.  The traffic induced vibration data along with measurements on the moving loads will be used for the extraction of the modal parameters. For the validation of the proposed modal estimation approach, the field data collected on two concrete bridges in Hong Kong will be utilized.  For damage identification, the methods based on the improved estimation of the curvature flexibility will be developed.  A comprehensive study will be conducted to evaluate the effect of thermal conduction on the modal parameters to propose simple methods utilizing only the yearly and diurnal temperature trends and spot measurements of the temperature at the time of data recording to calculate the temperature affected modal parameters. For damage quantification, the flexibility characteristics of damaged structure will be compared with those of the undamaged baseline structure adjusted to reflect the effect of the temperature environment at the time of the data measurements.</AbstractNarration>
