<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;ECCS-0747501&lt;br/&gt;J. Dawson, MIT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The objective of this research is to discover circuit architectures that enable the next generation of wireless transceivers for communications and biomedical applications. The approach is to focus on digitally assisted architectures, which exploit digital signal processing to enable transceiver performance. The wireless and biomedical fields are the most important, highest-impact applications in integrated circuit design because of exploding commercial and military demand. The difficulty is that transistors in modern processes do not permit the use of analog architectures that have, for decades, served so well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The intellectual merit of this program is a rigorous exploration of the optimal division of transceiver functionality between the analog and digital domains. This issue is pursued both through the application of mathematical optimization techniques, and also through design creativity to discover new circuit architectures. The projects to be pursued include new digitally assisted architectures for power amplifier linearizers, biomedical implants, and ultra high bandwidth polar transmitters. In addition, the PI will explore a new hierarchical optimization methodology for large mixed-signal systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The broader impact of this program is to strengthen the U.S. transceiver industry both through research and through bolstering the pipeline of women and minorities in science and engineering. The PI is collaborating with the directors of high school science and engineering programs at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to develop a series of laboratory modules that link mathematical and conceptual thinking to design. Once polished, these modules will be widely disseminated to like-minded programs across the country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
