<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wireless ad hoc and sensor networking has been identified as a recent major success story in the field of communications. Today, it is emerging as a promising technology with an expansive range of applications. The full potential of these networks is yet to be realized as a result of design challenges in the related networking issues. This research seeks to develop a research area crossing frontiers in random graph theory, probabilistic methods, communications and networking. Focusing on the analysis and design of finite wireless networks (i.e., networks with small or moderate number of nodes), for which both existing asymptotic analysis based on infinite number of nodes or simulation based approaches are inadequate, the work has the potential to advance knowledge and understanding across several related fields. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mathematical study of wireless networks serves as a theoretical foundation for this area. During the last ten years a variety of network properties such as network connectivity, coverage, reliability, delay, lifetime, sleep scheduling, throughput and capacity have been analytically studied to some extent. The majority of these analytical studies have concentrated on asymptotic scenarios, i.e., when the number of nodes tends to infinity. To study finite (small or moderate-size) networks researchers often resort to computer simulations and algorithmic approaches (such as linear programming). Thus, mathematical analysis of finite networks that could result in practically-useful formulas has been largely ignored. The goal of this research is to develop a general framework for design, study, and optimization of finite wireless ad hoc and sensor networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
