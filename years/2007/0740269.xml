    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I research project incorporates the emerging "Smart-Cut" technology to produce large optical index contrast lithium niobate waveguides on silicon substrates. Nonlinear optical operations that previously required optical switching power in the kilowatt range for bulk device form would require only tens of milliwatts using these innovative high contrast optical waveguide devices. Compact, efficient, and cost effective optical signal processing functions would be possible using nonlinear optical periodically poled and micro-ring resonator type device structures. The proposed lithium niobate on silicon platform would enable integration of all-optical, electro-optic, and electronic functions. A high contrast optical waveguide approach would make dense and monolithic all-optical circuits practical. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This enabling technology has broad impact for other materials systems used for optical chip products. Several key technologies developed under this program are useful for applications in a variety of industries, both defense and civilian. The proposed innovative smart-cut method will enable the development of unique modulator, switch, micro-ring optical filters, and nonlinear optical device products with extremely good competitive advantage compared to other optical products on the market. Lithium niobate-on-silicon optical waveguide devices would have great potential for civilian communications systems, as the quest for reliable, high-speed, low-cost, transmission and truly all-optical switching continues to be aggressively pursued by the telecommunications industry.</AbstractNarration>
