<AbstractNarration>Although mantle electrical conductivity primarily increases radially with depth, a growing body of evidence indicates there is significant lateral heterogeneity in the upper and mid-mantle, reflecting variations in composition, physical state, temperature, and volatile content. Conductivity complements seismically-derived density and elastic parameters; through co-registration and joint interpretation of these parameters, one can obtain better constraints on the composition and physical state of Earth's interior. The goal of this project is to develop significantly improved images of these 3D variations, especially in the transition zone and upper mantle. The project combines new approaches to data analysis with numerical modeling and geophysical inverse methods. An empirical orthogonal function approach is being applied to geomagnetic observatory data to extract the dominant modes of external excitation of the Earth's conducting mantle at daily variation and longer periods. These modes, which correspond to the most symmetric large scale sources, are then fit by simultaneously adjusting external source structure and 3-d Earth conductivity. A key constraint in this joint inversion is a priori knowledge of physically reasonable external source spatial structure.  Such structure is enforced through use of parametric models, and through multivariate spatial covariances developed from knowledge of source geometries and outputs of ionospheric general circulation models. Co-registered electrical and elastic models will be useful to geodynamicists, to separate better temperature and compositional effects in 3-d tomographic images, and by mineral physicists developing equations of state relevant to deep Earth materials. The research will also result in an improved characterization of external source fields, which, together with the 3D conductivity model, will be very useful to those working with satellite magnetic data, e.g., to provide improved external/induced field corrections for modeling of the main or crustal fields.  Current and planned efforts to use magnetic satellite data to probe mantle conductivity in particular depend critically on improved spatio-temporal modeling of external sources, and will ultimately benefit significantly from the results of this project. The project contributes to diversity and training of the next generation of Earth science researchers by providing post-doc support for an early-career female scientist. A global 3-d conductivity reference model is being produced that will be available as a resource to a broad community of Earth Science researchers, e.g., to provide boundary conditions, as well as large scale context, for modeling and inversion of data from regional magnetotelluric and geomagnetic induction studies, including the EarthScope backbone and transportable MT arrays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Time variations of the magnetic field, arising from electrical currents flowing high above EarthÆs surface in the ionosphere and magnetosphere (external sources), induce eddy currents deep within the electrically conducting Earth, producing secondary "induced" magnetic fields. In detail, these depend on Earth conductivity, and so, with sufficient knowledge of the external sources, observations of time variations of the magnetic field at the surface can be used to map variations of electrical conductivity deep within the Earth. Such maps can complement images obtained by other geophysical techniques, such as seismic tomography, ultimately allowing better constraints on composition and physical conditions deep inside the Earth.   For example, relatively small amounts of water (which could possibly carried to great depths within the Earth by subducting tectonic plates) would increase conductivity dramatically, and also have significant effects on dynamic processes within the Earth, but would have little effect on seismic data.  The objective of this project has been to improve our ability to image Earth conductivity variations in three dimensions, making use of recent and historical geomagnetic observatory data.       Major components of our effort have included: (1) developing and applying sophisticated multivariate data processing methods to extract data associated with the most coherent, simple, and large scale external sources.  (2) Developing physical consistent statistical models for external source spatial structure, and applying these to estimate spatial structure of external source current systems.   (3)  Adjusting 3-D electrical conductivity to fit the data, with assumed external sources taken from the second step.   (4)  Interpretation, with reference to other geophysical constraints, of the physical significance of the imaged variations of mantle electrical conductivity.       We have carried through all steps for the case of long period external field variations (T &gt; 1 day), where rotation of the Earth implies a strong zonal symmetry of magnetic field variations in an Earth-fixed reference frame.   These long period sources require substantial structure at high latitudes, and near the magnetic equator; not accounting for these source complications (as has sometimes been done in the past) can lead to significant errors when the data are interpreted in terms of Earth conductivity.   Some persistent non-zonal source structure also appears to be required at geomagnetic mid-latitudes, presumably reflecting effects of the complex non-dipole near-earth magnetic fields, which result in geographically fixed current patterns, even at long periods.  Three-dimensional inversions for Earth conductivity reveal high conductivity at depths of 400 km or so, in areas where old subducting oceanic plates (especially the Pacific plate) have the potential to transport water deep into the mantle.  We have also made initial steps for modeling sources for shorter period variations (hours to a day or so) which have a very different spatial character.    These shorter period data have the potential to substantially refine our images of upper mantle conductivity structure.
