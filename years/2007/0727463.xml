<AbstractNarration>In this project we will explore and evaluate the potential of a bio-mediated ground improvement technique to (1) improve the engineering properties (i.e. strength, stiffness) of a finite zone of soil and (2) heal zones of soil damaged by construction methods.  The former purpose parallels other conventional grouting techniques (e.g. treatment of large finite zones of soil which are inadequate for construction on constructed performance), while the latter purpose could be used to treat soil in the immediate vicinity of construction elements (such as piling) which has undergone damage (e.g. crushing, decementation) during the installation process.  In both cases, the overarching objective is to improve the performance of constructed systems through improving the ?weak link? in the load transfer mechanisms. &lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;Within this project our objective is to advance a bio-mediated technique which induces calcite precipitation with granular soils.  We will continue the development of an aerobic process whose feasibility has been established in the laboratory by the PIs and others, and explore a parallel anaerobic process with the same precipitated calcite end product.  Biological aspects of the treatment process will be investigated, including long-term permanence, treatment optimization, and environmental impact.  At the mm-to-cm length scale we will investigate the influence of the bio-treatment on soil and soil-structure interface behavior, examining changes in material state, permeability, response to static and cyclic loading across a range of strain magnitudes, and soil-structure interface shear.  Finally, we propose to perform m length scale model testing of the injection feasibility for treatment of a finite zone of soil and for treatment immediately around a pile using a wedge shaped chamber that accurately replicates radial flow and diffusion from a line injection source in situ. This will enable assessment of full scale field injection feasibility at reduced costs and localized measurements of the injection process not possible in the field.  This research program is designed to advance the bio-treatment method from proof-of-concept to a maturity that would motivate government agencies and industry to continue its development.    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The education, outreach, and training activities span K-16+ students, teachers, and research faculty.  The research team has linked with a prominent science and engineering education textbook publishing company to develop classroom lecture modules and laboratory exercises.  NSF Research Experience for Teachers (RET) and Research Experience for Undergraduate (REU) fellows will be involved in technical research as well as in the K-16+ curriculum development.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Summary  The project vision was to explore and evaluate the potential of a bio-mediated ground improvement technique that could be implemented for the purposes of (1) improving the engineering properties (i.e. strength, stiffness) of a finite zone of soil and (2) healing zones of soil damaged by construction methods.  The former purpose parallels other conventional grouting techniques (e.g. treatment of large finite zones of soil which are inadequate for construction on constructed performance), while the latter purpose could be used to treat soil in the immediate vicinity of construction elements (such as piling) which has undergone damage (e.g. crushing, decementation) during the installation process.  In both cases, the overarching objective is to improve the performance of constructed systems through improving the æweak linkÆ in the load transfer mechanisms.     Project Outcomes  Our activities throughout the project have generated accomplishments in every area of research originally proposed.  Through leveraging other funding, this grant supported two PhD students, four MS students, and many undergraduate researchers.  In addition, a visiting PhD student from China worked on this grant for 6 months in 2011.   The primary outcomes of the project can be summarized into five parts.  First, significant advances in optimization of the bio-mediated treatment technique were accomplished for both aerobic and anaerobic conditions as well as for biostimulation and bioaugmentation.  The environmental impact and the embodied energy of the technology were also evaluated.  Secondly, characterization of improved soil included practical design relationships, exanimation of treated soil at the microstructure particle level up through one meter scale 3-D models.  Thirdly, the use of bio-mediated ground improvement to heal and strengthen the interface between piles and soil was investigation in the laboratory, with improvement and strengthening successfully demonstrated.  Fourth, 3-D experimental models as well as numerical modeling significantly advanced understanding and improved design for field scale trials.  Finally, the education, outreach, and training program throughout the project reached K-12 students who visited campus on field trips, middle school teachers, engineering practitioners, and academic collaborators around the world.
