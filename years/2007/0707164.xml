<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0306299&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Eleny-Nicoleta Ionel&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal aims to understand the structure of the&lt;br/&gt;Gromov-Witten invariants of symplectic manifolds by combining&lt;br/&gt;together ideas coming from different fields of research.  The&lt;br/&gt;first project is motivated by a conjecture made by two&lt;br/&gt;physicists, Gopakumar and Vafa. The conjecture implies several&lt;br/&gt;surprising restrictions on the Gromov invariants of a Calabi-Yau&lt;br/&gt;3-fold. The goal is to prove the conjectured formula by adapting&lt;br/&gt;some analytical techiques developed by Taubes to relate the&lt;br/&gt;Seiberg-Witten and Gromov invariants in 4-dimensions.  The second&lt;br/&gt;project's goal is to obtain new relations in the cohomology ring&lt;br/&gt;of the moduli space of complex structures on a marked Riemann&lt;br/&gt;surface. Using the techniques introduced in a previous paper, the&lt;br/&gt;PI found several families of interesting relations, one of which&lt;br/&gt;proves a ten year old conjecture of Faber. The last project seeks&lt;br/&gt;to extend the sum formula for Gromov-Witten invariants to&lt;br/&gt;deformations more general then those appearing from a symplectic&lt;br/&gt;sum. There already seems to be several interesting new phenomena&lt;br/&gt;appearing in the general case.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work lies at the intersection of string theory and&lt;br/&gt;symplectic topology. String theory developed as a potential&lt;br/&gt;candidate for a unifying theory of the universe, which extends&lt;br/&gt;Eistein relativity theory. It is based on the idea that&lt;br/&gt;elementary particles (like electrons, photons) should be thought&lt;br/&gt;not as points, but rather small vibrating loops. Working out the&lt;br/&gt;details of this theory turned out to be quite delicate, and has&lt;br/&gt;in turn inspired many remarkable results in mathematics. But also&lt;br/&gt;fundamental results in mathematics have inspired many new&lt;br/&gt;discoveries in physics. It is hoped that this project will&lt;br/&gt;contribute to the increased interaction between mathematics and&lt;br/&gt;high energy physics. In the same time, one of the projects will&lt;br/&gt;involve graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
