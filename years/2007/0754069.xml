<AbstractNarration>The REU at Susquehanna University will host 8 students annually during the summers of 2008-2010 for an 8-week intensive course of study and guided research in Quantum Information Theory. After an intensive, self-contained introduction to the subject, students will work with members of the SU mathematics faculty on selected problems of current interest, potentially leading to publishable results. The staff includes members of the current SU mathematics department and visiting faculty from Los Alamos National Laboratory, the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics, and Bucknell University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We encourage applications from students in mathematics, physics and computer science with an interest; members of underrepresented groups are especially encouraged to apply. Participants should have a good grasp of finite-dimensional linear algebra and elementary probability theory; exposure to abstract algebra would be a plus, but is not strictly necessary. Prior knowledge of quantum mechanics is not assumed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For more information, see the departmental REU website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;http://www.susqu.edu/mathematics/reu/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award supported two years of an Research Experience for Undergraduates program.  Although we had funding for three years, we were unable to put a program together for the third year due to committments of the participants to other pursuits.  We returned the unused funds to NSF. The outcomes described below are for the two years the project was active.  One expectation that we put on this project to meet the Intellectual merit criteria was to produce publishable quality research.  The research conducted in the two years the program ran lead to five published works.  Here is a list of the publications that were produced:  Frey, M. R., Miller, A. K., Mentch, L. K., Graham, J. A. (2010). Score Operators of a Qubit and Some Applications. Quantum Information Processing, 9(5), 629-641.  Frey, M., Miller, A., Mentch, L., Graham, J. A. (2010).

Miller and S.S. Rubin, "Correlation identification in bipartite Pauli channels," International Journal of Quantum Information, 8:6, 979-990, 2010.  Barnum, H. N., Gaebbler, P. E., Wilce, A. G.

G., Wilke, R. (2012). Entropy and Information Causality in General Probabilistic Theories: Addendum. New Journal of Physics, 17.     We had several projects which completed high quality work, but never managed to make the jump into a publication.  Two groups of students did present their work in poster sessions at the Joint Math Meetings in 2009.  Since this was an REU grant we had aspirations to inspire the participating students to pursue graduate degrees.  Evidence provided by an external assessment of the program indicates that the majority of the students rated the idea of attending graduate school favorably after completing the program.  At least one of our participants has completed a PhD in mathematics.  Our external assessment also indicated that we were successful in providing to our participants the "thrill of discovery" to at least some degree and that they felt more positively about mathematics research as a result of the program.  These two results combine to help satisfy the Broader Impact merit criteria of the grant.       Last Modified: 09/04/2015       Submitted by: Jeffrey A Graham]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
