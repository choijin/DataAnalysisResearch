<AbstractNarration>The proposed work will develop mathematical and numerical techniques to make computer algorithms more efficient in several key manufacturing and engineering processes.  The work will focus on (i) semiconductor manufacturing to create faster and more reliable computer chips; (ii) seismic imaging to efficiently and accurately locate petroleum reserves; (iii) fluid jetting devices in the construction of computer display devices, bio-engineering of tissue scaffolding, and micro-jetting tools for printing circuit boards; (iv) injection molding and part manufacturing, and (v) logistical transport to determine optimal routing of goods and robotic motion. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These topics are linked through the requirement to efficiently, accurately, and robustly track the motion of complex interfaces.  Moving interface problems, which describe how boundaries move under intricate physics, are at the core of a host of practical and critical engineering and manufacturing problems.  As examples, semiconductors are built through multiple processes of shaping, depositing, and etching the interfaces between chemicals.  Seismic imaging in petroleum analysis requires fast solutions of propagating waves through the earth.  Fluid jetting devices, which appear across a range of scales from desktop inkjet printers down to automatic bioassay testing, require careful attention to the moving fluid interface problems between air, fluids (such as ink), and solid walls.  Injection molding requires carefully tracking the evolving boundaries between liquid, molten, and solid plastic as they fill a pre-formed mold.  Logistical transport and robotics require tracking optimal control interfaces to determine first arrivals. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work will be two-fold.  First, previous NSF support has allowed us to develop many of the current state-of-the-art numerical techniques for tracking moving interfaces, including level set methods, fast marching methods, ordered upwind methods, and escape arrival methods; this work will continue through a focus on more efficient versions and extensions to more complex physics.  Second, we will concentrate on prototype codes in each of the above-listed areas, in collaboration with industrial scientists, with the goal of creating practical engineering algorithms and simulations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant, plus previous grants, have been used to design and implement algorithms for solving partial differential equations that arise in complex front and interface propagation problems. NSF support has been instrumental in creating these algorithms, and has led to:  (1) Level set methods, which embed the moving interface as the zero level set of a higher dimensional function and then solve an associated initial value partial differential equation, and made efficient through Narrow Band Level set Methods.  (2) Fast marching methods: Dijkstra-like finite difference methods to efficiently solve Eikonal equations through an underlying ordering borrowed from discrete algorithms.  (3) Ordered upwind methods, which are Dijkstra-like methods to solve optimal control and anisotropic front propagation problems for static convex Hamiltonians in O(kN logN).  (4) Escape arrival methods, which simultaneously compute all multiple source/multiple arrival combinations through a Dijkstra-like algorithm based on a time-independent boundary value PDE based on the Liouville equations.  (5) Embedded material transport methods, which extend the range of level set methods to include material transport. Here, the speed of an evolving front depends not only on front geometry but also on material, parameterized quantities on the interface.     Under this current NSF grant, we have developed the following: (1) Two-Phase Viscoelastic Flow: Microjetting in Manufacturing and Industrial Devices (2) Design of New Materials: Navigating Molecular Worms Inside Chemical Labyrinths. (3) Voronoi Implicit Interface Methods for Multiphase Physics: Foams, Bubbles, and Cells. (4) Imaging for Biological, Medical, and Scientific Data Reconstruction.
