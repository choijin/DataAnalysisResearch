<AbstractNarration>Chemistry 12&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Guided inquiry experiments are being developed for introductory general and organic chemistry courses that use NMR spectroscopic analysis as an integrated hands-on method that provides evidence essential for reaching conclusions from the experiments. The project is converting a Varian EM-360 magnet into an Anasazi 60 MHz Eft NMR (FT NMR) spectrometer. Students are able to effectively run samples and analyze their data. This represents a significant improvement for students who have not previously had the benefit of hands-on access to NMR instrumentation. This applies to participating high school students taking advanced chemistry as well. Students are able to obtain spectra and reach conclusions about their experiments based upon their own NMR data.  Improving conceptual learning in the laboratory through development of guided inquiry experiments integrating NMR analysis is a major goal of this proposal.  The project is evaluating changes in conceptual learning, critical reasoning skills, student interest and motivation resulting directly from the project. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Guided inquiry experiments are providing educators with options for collaborative relationships among college professors, high school teachers and students. The teachers are passing on their acquired skills and knowledge from this project to their pre-collegiate students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
