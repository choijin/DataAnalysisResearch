<AbstractNarration>The fifth ACM International conference on Embedded Networked Sensor Systems (SenSys 2007) will be held in Sydney, Australia from November 6-9, 2007. To help increase the representation and participation of United States-based graduate students in this conference, this proposal requests support to help cover the expenses for ten (10) students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SenSys 2007 introduces a high caliber forum for research on systems issues in the emerging area of embedded, networked sensors. SenSys design issues span multiple disciplines, including wireless communication, networking, operating systems, architecture, low power circuits, distributed algorithms, data processing, scheduling, sensors, energy harvesting, and signal processing. SenSys seeks to provide a cross-disciplinary venue for researchers addressing these networked sensor system design issues. SenSys 2006 was a fourth in the series which followed a very successful third conference ACM Sensys 2005 sponsored by ACM (SIGCOMM, SIGMOBILE, SIGARCH, SIGMETRICS, SIGOPS, SIGBED) and NSF.  The quality of the papers presented in this single track conference over the past years reflects the significant intellectual merit of the proposed activity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The participation by graduate students will have a broad and educational impact. Support from NSF is critical to increasing the number of graduate students who can attend this premiere conference. The goal of the travel student program is to broaden the participation of students from various universities. The program will give priority to female and under-represented minority students, as well as students pursing their graduate studies in Minority Serving Institutions.</AbstractNarration>
