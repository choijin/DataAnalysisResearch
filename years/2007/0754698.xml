<AbstractNarration>CBET-0754698&lt;br/&gt;Andrew Berger, University of Rochester&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An optical probing and imaging technique called Integrated Raman and Angular scattering Microscopy (IRAM) will be developed for the purpose of simultaneously studying the chemical and structural composition of single cells. The engineering challenge of unifying Raman and elastic angular-scattering measurements on a high-resolution microscopy platform will first be addressed through basic studies on microbeads and immune cells. The development of dendritic immune cells from immature to mature phase will then be studied using the IRAM technique. Specifically, chemical and structural changes will be sought at various timepoints to shed light on the signal pathways that steer the differentiation process.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This projectÃ†s goal was to combine two optical methods that are each valuable for studying single biological cells.  The first method was Raman spectroscopy, an inelastic scattering technique that reports on the average chemical content of a cell.  The second method was angle-resolved elastic scattering, a method that detects the average sizes of organelles within a cell.     By combining these two methods on a microscope platform (integrated Raman and angular-scatter microscopy, or "IRAM"), it becomes possible to obtain chemical and structural data from single cells.  Because both methods are purely optical and require no external agents (such as chemical stains) to be applied to the samples, the overall approach is noninvasive and nondestructive.  This in turn means that cells can be "watched" for minutes, hours, or days under the microscope, while natural processes occur.  Detailed histories can be gathered from individual cells and compared.  Main accomplishments of this project include the following:  1. The Raman and angular-domain scattering systems were combined into the same optical system, sharing a microscope.  A single laser excited both types of scattering, and a single collection system with a beamsplitter enabled collection of both types of scattering without any moving parts.  The only moving part in the illumination was a mirror that directed the laser towards the sample in one of two ways, transillumination for angular-scattering, epi-illumination for Raman scattering.  This system design was published in the Review of Scientific Instruments.  2. IRAM data were acquired from single immune cells, some of which had been exposed to stimulants that cause immune cells to react.  The size and chemical responses of each cell were monitored using the IRAM microscope, and each cell was assigned a pair of values that distilled the two responses.  When these values were plotted in a two-dimensional "IRAM space" similar to a flow-cytometry diagram, the dots corresponding to stimulated cells landed in a separate region from the control cells.  This effect was seen for two different types of stimulants, one that tends to excite all cells and one that only excites some; this difference was observed using IRAM.  Some cells remained normal-looking under conventional white-light microscopy, but were clearly activated according to the IRAM data.  This work was published in the Journal of Biomedical Optics.  3. The IRAM system was(a)  equipped with a customized cell chamber for both trans- and epi-illumination and (b) placed under computer control, thereby enabling time-lapsed measurements of individual cells.  4. A fundamental, previously unappreciated challenge of making angle-resolved scattering measurements from single cells was uncovered: that the limited size of the cell and the relatively static arrangement of the scatterers leads to large, grainy distortions to the expected angular-scattering pattern.  Previous measurements on optically-trapped calibration beads (undergoing random thermal motion) had not revealed this problem; neither had averages of scattergrams from small numbers of single cells.  Measurements on static distributions of several beads, however, exhibited the same type of distortion, confirming this as a fundamental effect.   5. To address the challenge posed by the grainy distortions, the optical measurement system for angular scattering was redesigned to enable not just the intensity of the scattered light, but the relative phase of the light hitting the detector plane in different places.  This so-called "holographic" recording makes it possible to overcome the distortions and obtain size estimates on simple ensembles of beads for the first time; this work has been accepted for publication in Optics Letters.  Future work can extend this approach to objects with the complexity of biological cells.     The intellectual merit of this work is that a novel optical system has been developed for making deta...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
