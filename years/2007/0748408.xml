<AbstractNarration>This CAREER award by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program supports the work of Professor Adam S. Veige at the University of Florida to develop catalysts for Nitrile-Alkyne Cross Metathesis (NACM) reactions using a new class of hard-hard-hard, trianionic pincer ligands.  These ligands are designed to stabilize high oxidation state, early transition metals.  The under-explored NACM catalysis reactions will examine the trans-influence of the pincer ligands on M-N multiple bonds, particularly in stoichiometric and catalytic exchange reactions.  This research will lead to new methods for weakening M-N bonds, which are often too stable for NACM to work efficiently.  The synthesis of alkyne/nitrile complexes may have broad applicability as a tool in directed organic synthesis as the catalysts could find offer more environmentally-friendly methods of synthesis for both the chemical and pharmaceutical industries.  In addition to training undergraduate and graduate students in research techniques, the Professor Veige hopes to inspire wide audiences to develop an interest in research through "Chemistry Day at the Mall" outreach activities.  These activities will encourage scientists to see outreach to the public as an expected part of their professional career while encouraging younger students to consider scientific careers.</AbstractNarration>
