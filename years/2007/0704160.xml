<AbstractNarration>PI: Stephen Ritchie&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Alabama Tuscaloosa&lt;br/&gt;Title: Travel Support for the ECI Water Treatment and Reuse II Conference&lt;br/&gt;Proposal No.: 0704160&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant will be used to help disseminate knowledge about state-of-the-art research in separation processes applied to water treatment and reuse from around the world.&lt;br/&gt;This is the second meeting in this area sponsored by Engineering Conferences International. In addition to showing the latest advancements in integrated technologies for water treatment, water desalination will be a focus of the conference. Another focus of the meeting is water treatment in the developing world, which involves unique technical challenges such as arsenic and pathogen removal. The most respected and accomplished membrane and water technology related scientists and engineers from around the world will participate in this meeting. In addition to NSF resources, funds are being solicited from industry and the National Institutes of Health to support faculty and student participation in the meeting, so the NSF funds would be well leveraged.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the second meeting in this area sponsored by Engineering Conferences&lt;br/&gt;International, and provides a unique opportunity for students and faculty to interact with&lt;br/&gt;internationally renowned scientists and engineers on a one-to-one basis. In addition to 10&lt;br/&gt;technical oral sessions, an extensive poster session is an integral part of the conference. The funding will provide partial travel support for up to 10 students/young faculty to attend this meeting, Student participation in this meeting will enhance the infrastructure for research by giving students access to leading scientists and engineers from around the world in the technical sessions and in the poster session. Students will also have extensive opportunities to network with students and faculty from other research groups with similar interests. Society would benefit from this activity by having better trained, more knowledgeable graduate students prepared to push the frontiers of this unique enabling technology in a wide variety of practical applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
