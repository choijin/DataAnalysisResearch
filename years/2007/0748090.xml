    <AbstractNarration>The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award is to study a new class of one-dimensional nanostructures: boron-based (that is, boron and boride) one-dimensional nanostructures for thermoelectric power generation application. The approach will be 1) synthesis of both p-type and n-type boron-based nanostructures using chemical vapor deposition; 2) exploration of growth mechanisms to facilitate the high-volume manufacturing; 3) study of thermal stability of as-synthesized nanostructures at various environmental conditions; and 4) investigation of thermoelectric properties of individual boron-based nanostructures. The education objective of this CAREER award is to establish a highly interdisciplinary environment to help young researchers build solid technical and communication skills to meet the demand for human resources in nanoscale science and engineering. The approach will be 1) development of an interdisciplinary research group composed of both undergraduate and graduate students with various academic backgrounds; 2) enhancement of the current curricula to meet both departmental and institutional goals; and 3) recruitment of more students from underrepresented groups (especially woman students). &lt;br/&gt;If successful, this project will produce high-quality novel boron-based one-dimensional nanostructures, and provide fundamental understanding on thermal stability and thermoelectric mechanism and enhancement in these nanostructures. Discoveries resulting from this work will ultimately lead to the future creation of one-dimensional nanostructures-based thermoelectric energy converter. This new class of boron-based thermoelectric nanostructures will play an important role in meeting the energy challenge of the future. For example, they will find applications in waste heat recovery industry, and make contribution to the prevention of global warming crisis. The proposed work also enhances current activities in nanotechnology at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte by creating a highly interdisciplinary environment to achieve integrated research and education of graduate, undergraduate, and minority students.</AbstractNarration>
