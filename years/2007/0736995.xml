<AbstractNarration>Biological Sciences (61)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the laboratory course being developed by this project students combine genetics and genomics techniques to explore genetic variation within populations.  It is based on a pilot course introduced in 2007. Students isolate random E. coli transposon mutations affecting rates of genetic variation and analyze the unique mutants they have isolated to discover and understand functions essential to genetic stability. They then integrate their findings with public domain genomic information resources to develop a Web page for each gene investigated. As a finale for the course, students design their own simple experiment regarding mutagenesis and refine the experiment from the results of their preliminary analysis. Students are assessed, before and after the course, for their level of mastery of basic cellular and molecular processes and for their attitudes towards and understanding of scientific research. In addition, students evaluate the value of various aspects of the course, to aid in its future refinements. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project is that it provides real research laboratory experience in a course that leads to understanding of core concepts in genetics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this project is that the course serves as a model for future development of interdisciplinary project laboratories at Brandeis University and elsewhere.  Course materials (information, protocols, genomic resources,  exercises, design, strains) are being made available publicly. The novel integration of genomic analysis with readily accessible experiments with bacteria provides a course paradigm that can be replicated in diverse academic settings.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
