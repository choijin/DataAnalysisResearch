<AbstractNarration>    ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Frieze, Alan    &lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: DMS - 0753472 &lt;br/&gt;Institution: Carnegie-Mellon University&lt;br/&gt;Title: Random Graphs: Structure and Algorithms&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study of random combinatorial structures has emerged as an important component of Discrete Mathematics. The most intensely studied area is that of random graphs and many of the results of this area have been extended to hypergraphs or set systems. This proposal is aimed at doing research into various structural properties of random graphs and hypergraphs. In addition the proposal will consider some related algorithmic questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Graphs and networks are emerging as important phenomena. Networks arise in social contexts such as links between pages in the World Wide Web. They also arise in biological systems such as the protein inter-action network of a cell. These networks arise from "random processes" and so the study of random graphs is becoming more and more relevant. Finally, studying algorithms on typical graphs will hopefully be usefull in drawing back the shadow of the negative results of complexity theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Random Graphs have been the object of intense study since the pioneering work of  Paul Erdos and Alfred Renyi more than 50 years ago. The initial motivation for this study was mainly mathematical. In recent years this study has widened due to our understanding that the world is full of evolving networks connecting e.g. social, biological, chemical and ecological entities. Perhaps the most appropriate recent example is the world wide web. Many of these networks grow in a seemingly unpredictable manner, and in such circumstances it is appropriate to model them as growing randomly. Starting from this viewpoint, the project investigated a range of problems associated with random graph models of large networks.   In one part of the project we considered classical problems such as how many random edges are needed to ensure that various properties required by the network are present with probability close to one. In many cases there are computational questions associated with such properties. Often these computational problems seem to be difficult in the worst case. It is interesting therefore to see if there is a significant difference between worst case and average behavior. Random graphs are known to be an appropriate model for average case behavior and the project  studied  various questions in this light.   To give a  more specific case, we studied some problems associated with Hamilton cycles. A Hamilton cycle is a cycle through all the vertices of a graph, and these are often studied in the context of  the travelling salesman problem in vehicle routing. . We studied the existence of Hamilton cycles in random graphs with a linear number of edges where we conditioned on the graph having degree at least three. We made significant progress on the existence question via the analysis of a simple algorithm for finding a 2-matching with few components. A 2-matching is a graph of maximum degree two and a Hamilton cycle is a special case. We then discovered a fast algorithm for turning this 2-matching into a Hamilton cycle. It should be noted that in the worst-case, the Hamilton cycle problem is likely to be computationally difficult i.e. the problem is NP-complete. In addition to this problem, we considered related questions in hypergraphs, a notion that generalizes graphs. There are a number of ways of generalizing the notion of a Hamilton cycle to a hypergraph. We were able to find thresholds for the existence of the various types of  Hamilton cycles in hypergraphs.   As already mentioned, random graphs have enjoyed increased interest due to their possible use as models of real world networks. The project discussed some plausible models and proved relevant  properties of these models.   he project resulted in the production of more than 20 academic research papers reflecting on properties of large networks.
