<AbstractNarration>Participatory  sensing  is  a  revolutionary   paradigm  where&lt;br/&gt;people sense  their  environment, and  voluntarily share  this&lt;br/&gt;information using  pre-existing  communication  infrastructure.  It&lt;br/&gt;has tremendous potential to  advance  knowledge   in  diverse fields&lt;br/&gt;including urban  planning and  intelligent  transportation by enabling&lt;br/&gt;large-scale sensing without dedicated infrastructure. Achieving this&lt;br/&gt;potential hinges on  encouraging  sensor  data  sharing  between users&lt;br/&gt;who may not trust each other. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of this project are to design and implement a trustworthy&lt;br/&gt;participatory sensing  system, encompassing algorithms for (i)&lt;br/&gt;certifying the integrity of published sensory content, so users can&lt;br/&gt;trust it, (ii) sensory content protection, so more users contribute&lt;br/&gt;data, and (iii) anonymous content sharing between producers and&lt;br/&gt;consumers. It explores a novel  approach  for  trustworthy&lt;br/&gt;participatory  sensing  with a trusted  hardware  platform for each&lt;br/&gt;sensor, which besides the main processor, has a tamper-proof trusted&lt;br/&gt;hardware element that only executes code signed by a trusted third&lt;br/&gt;party. This recasts the integrity and privacy problems in a new way,&lt;br/&gt;allowing for simple, scalable and versatile solutions. Such a system can&lt;br/&gt;curb potential abuse, encourage user participation and thereby enable&lt;br/&gt;participatory sensing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expected project results include a new system model and algorithms for&lt;br/&gt;trustworthy participatory sensing, an implementation on the Intel AMT&lt;br/&gt;platform, and system demonstration in a real-world intelligent&lt;br/&gt;transportation application. The results will be disseminated via&lt;br/&gt;open-source software, conference publications and exhibits at the Oregon&lt;br/&gt;Museum of Science and Industry.  The project also consists of&lt;br/&gt;multi-level educational activities to promote under-represented groups&lt;br/&gt;in computing.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Today, there are over 4 billion cellphone users in the world; many with smart phones. These smart phones, equipped with positioning, audio, video and other sensors, offer an unprecedented opportunity to instrument our world for applications ranging from intelligent transportation, urban monitoring, public safety to public health. "Participatory sensing" or "mobile crowdsourcing" is a revolutionary new paradigm where people voluntarily sense their environment using the built-in sensors in mobile phones and share this information using the existing infrastructure of the Internet and cellular networks.   Using citizen contributed data for the above applications poses questions as to the integrity of the data.
