<AbstractNarration>An award has been made to the University of Montana under the direction of Dr. George D. Stanley to acquire new metal cabinets for the collection of Bear Gulch fossil biota of central Montana.  This collection contains important fossils of vertebrates, invertebrates, plants and algae that is unique in its composition and in the retention of original colors by many of the fossils.  The diversity of materials adds to our understanding of ancient climates on the planet.  The project will replace older oak cabinets, which are known to produce acid vapors that cause deterioration of the fossil rock material and destroy their scientific value.  The collection will be re-housed in cabinets in a mobile compactor system that will improve the physical accessibility of the collection for researchers and students.  The specimens will be catalogued, photographed, and the images and associated data will be made available online and through the web site called PaleoPortal.  Students will be employed in the project and will be trained in the practice of paleontological curation.</AbstractNarration>
