    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;TOPICS IN MACROECONOMICS&lt;br/&gt;NSF SES 0721321&lt;br/&gt;Martin Eichenbaum and Sergio Rebelo&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A central question in macroeconomics is how monetary policy affects the economy. Standard theories of the monetary transmission mechanism assume that the prices of many goods and services are fixed for extended periods of time. Models incorporating this assumption are widely used by central banks to inform monetary policy decisions. Over the past decade, economists have gained access to detailed data on prices of individual goods and services. They have used these data to measure the importance of price rigidity. An important series of studies uses the data that is collected to construct the Consumer Price Index to measure the frequency with which prices change. These studies conclude that there is substantial heterogeneity across different goods but that, on average, prices change roughly once a quarter. This finding poses a stark challenge to models which emphasize the importance of sticky prices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our project will use detailed microeconomic data to assess the empirical importance of a type of nominal rigidity that has heretofore not received much attention in the macroeconomics literature. We refer to this rigidity as the "reference price" phenomenon. By this we mean the tendency of goods prices to oscillate between two or three values over extended periods of time. It is difficult to reconcile the importance of reference prices with either existing sticky-price models or flexible-price models. We document the extent to which the reference price phenomenon is pervasive. Second, we examine whether the extent and timing of switches between reference prices is correlated with macroeconomic variables, including those characterizing monetary policy. Third, we assess whether our data is consistent with the idea that prices change according to a schedule that is set in advance, i.e., whether pricing plans are sticky. Fourth, we document how often sets of reference points change. This information sheds light on how often firms change plans rather than prices. We use our empirical results to formulate and assess alternative monetary models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our research is based on two detailed micro data sets. We obtained the first data set from one of the largest food and drug retailers in North America. We have access to weekly prices, quantities sold, and cost of goods sold for roughly 60,000 products. Products are defined at the unit product code and store level. Our sample period covers 2003 to 2006 and includes roughly four billion data entries. The second data set is from a chain of grocery stores in the Midwest with one hundred outlets. The data set consists of weekly observations on price and sales revenue for 3,500 items. The sample period covers 9 years, beginning in 1989, so that it encompasses one recession and one recovery. With these data, pricing plans can be studied by product characteristics in great detail and with regard to their degree of persistence over up to nine years in less detail.</AbstractNarration>
