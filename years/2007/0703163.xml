<AbstractNarration>This project builds on a previous NSF ATE award to create the Viticulture and Enology Science and Technology Alliance (VESTA) Regional Center of Excellence. A multi-state (Missouri, Oklahoma, Illinois, and Iowa) alliance of two-year colleges is committed to providing a comprehensive, regional approach to meet the current and future education and training requirements of the grape growing and wine making industry in the Mid-America region. The project focuses on solidifying linkages among VESTA partner institutions, identifying and validating industry skill standards, ensuring course delivery through the partner institutions, identifying high school and four-year institutional linkages, and certifying vineyards and wineries as field practicum sites. VESTA intends to expand to include two-year colleges in Arkansas, Kansas, Indiana, Minnesota, Nebraska, Ohio, Texas and Wisconsin, thereby supporting the grape and wine industry throughout the Mid-America region. While the VESTA program focuses on the needs of the industry in the Mid-America region, the Center also reaches out to other leading educational institutions throughout the country that feature high quality grape and wine educational programs to provide access to career pathways in viticulture and enology; a technically skilled workforce; and technological support to the grape and wine industry. It also supports entrepreneurs as they endeavor to create new vineyards and wineries.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The grape and wine industry (GWI) is one of the fastest growing components of the agriculture sector.  An example of that growth can be seen in Missouri with Missouri showing a 42% growth in grape acreage since 2003 and a 234% growth in number of wineries during that same time frame. Similar growth in both grape acreage and wine production facilities can be seen throughout the Midwest.  The Viticulture and Enology Science and Technology Alliance (VESTA) was established in 2003 to address the workforce needs of this industry.   VESTA began as a partnership of two-year colleges in three states under a grant from the NSF Advanced Technology Education (ATE) program. Beginning in 2007, VESTA became an ATE Regional Center of Excellence and expanded its focus on the workforce needs of the GWI across 12 states in the Mid-America region. Recognizing the importance of industry involvement to the success of this program, industry representatives participate at all levels of VESTA including curriculum development, state level advisory groups, and the National Visiting Committee.  The GWI is one of many within the agriculture sectors that lacks accepted standards for occupations. In response to this need, VESTA is collaborating with industry representatives in developing Occupational Competencies.  A preliminary list of 18 occupations were identified and matched to existing relevant occupations in the Occupational Information Network O*NET) of the US. Department of LaborÆs Employment and Training Administration (USDOL/ETA). This database consists of the worker characteristics and occupational requirements for positions listed in the DOL Standard Occupational Classification System.  These include specifications of the tasks, tools and technologies, and characteristics most often associated with occupations, such as knowledge, skills, abilities, education and experience.  Input from the GWI is critical to the accuracy and ultimate usefulness of these Occupational Competencies, and therefore, a conference was held in December 2013, at which the competencies for 18 occupations were refined, and an additional 17 occupations were identified.  The latter are currently undergoing competency development.   GWI and VESTA instructors have reviewed all VESTA courses to ensure that they provide the knowledge and skills required for all tasks performed by the 35 occupations. Results of this activity have been presented to regional and national industry organizations, and are being disseminated as a model in how to ensure that educational programs focus on the occupations of their target industry. GWI and VESTA instructors are using these Occupational Competencies to ensure that Viticulture and Enology courses provide the knowledge and skills required for all tasks performed by these 35 occupations.  To raise the awareness of careers in the GWI, VESTA established professional development opportunities for secondary school instructors that enable them to imbed viticulture principles into their science and mathematics curriculum.  In addition, formal agreements have been reached with four-year institutions that enable VESTA students to transition into baccalaureate and masters level degree programs.   To ensure that the GWI workforce is equipped with the essential knowledge and skills, VESTA provides a STEM foundation through online courses leading to technical certificates and associate degrees in Viticulture (grape production) and Enology (wine production).  Their learning experience is enhanced by skill development through laboratory and field experiences at over 200 commercial vineyards and wineries throughout the Midwest.   The VESTA web site serves as an electronic clearinghouse providing extensive information about the GWI including notices of industry conferences and training programs and recommended printed materials.  In addition, the VESTA Digital Library contains over 400 videos that are used in VESTA courses, as well as by other institutions ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
