<AbstractNarration>Recent years witnessed a steady progress in the field of high precision quantum&lt;br/&gt;electrodynamics of hydrogenlike bound states. Both the experimental errors and the&lt;br/&gt;accuracy of theory were signifcantly improved. As often happens this rapid progress&lt;br/&gt;leads to new problems. In the field of high precision quantum electrodynamic theory of&lt;br/&gt;bound states the long term problems are as follows;&lt;br/&gt;1. The theoretical error of the 1S Lamb shift in hydrogen should be reduced signifcantly&lt;br/&gt;below the level of 1 kHz (and respectively of the 2S Lamb shift significantly below tenth&lt;br/&gt;of kHz)&lt;br/&gt;2. The theoretical error of the hyperfine splitting in muonium should be reduced to about&lt;br/&gt;10 Hz&lt;br/&gt;3. The theoretical error of the 2S-2P Lamb shift in muonic hydrogen should be reduced&lt;br/&gt;below .001meV.&lt;br/&gt;All main theoretical problems of the theory of light hydrogenlike atomes will be&lt;br/&gt;addressed in the proposed research. Its main objectives include;&lt;br/&gt;1. Complete calculation of all three loop nonrecoil corrections of order \alpha^3(Z&lt;br/&gt;\alpha)^5m to the Lamb shift in hydrogen. These are the largest still unknown&lt;br/&gt;contributions to the Lamb shift. Respective three loop&lt;br/&gt;nonrecoil corrections to hyperfine splitting in hydrogen and muonium also will be&lt;br/&gt;calculated.&lt;br/&gt;2. Complete calculation of all three loop radiative recoil corrections of order&lt;br/&gt;\alpha^3(m/M) E_F to hyperfine splitting in muonium.&lt;br/&gt;3. Calculation of nonlogarithmic corrections of order \alpha^2(Z \alpha)^4 m to the Lamb&lt;br/&gt;shift in muonic.&lt;br/&gt;Calculation of light by light electron loop contribution of order \alpha^2(Z \alpha)^3 m to&lt;br/&gt;the Lamb shift in&lt;br/&gt;muonic hydrogen.&lt;br/&gt;4.Resolution of the discrepancy in the theory of bound state g factors in systems&lt;br/&gt;including particles with spins j \neq 1/2/</AbstractNarration>
