<AbstractNarration>In this collaborative effort, Drs. Rebecca Koopmann (Union College), Sarah Higdon (Georgia Southern University), Thomas Balonek (Colgate University), and members of their consortium team will carry out an array of activities directed toward involving undergraduate students in real-world, cutting-edge research projects to collect, analyze, and, in some cases, publish data from the ALFALFA (The Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA Survey, where ALFA is an acronym for the Arecibo L-band Feed Array project. ALFALFA is large survey for neutral hydrogen in galaxies external to the Milky Way being carried out using the seven-beam ALFA receiver on the Arecibo Observatory radio telescope. ALFALFA is expected to detect over 20,000 galaxies over the next five years, resulting in a wide range of scientific applications. The program has four components: 1) An annual undergraduate ALFALFA team workshop will be held at Arecibo that will introduce students to the ALFA project and communicate science programs and observing and data analysis techniques; 2) Students, with the help of faculty mentors, will develop their own research programs and do their own observing using Arecibo, the world''s largest telescope; 3) Computer infrastructure for data analysis will be provided to smaller schools; and 4) Summer research positions will be provided to students on a competitive basis to help keep them on a science track. The program will have wide impact at 14 universities belonging to the Undergraduate ALFALFA Team consortium. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program will advance discovery and promote learning among undergraduate and graduate students in a diverse array of university settings, both public and private, across the country. All team members will participate in the annual workshops and will be encouraged to present their results at scientific meetings. Infrastructure for research and education will be promoted via the collaboration between students and faculty and the observatory, which will stimulate undergraduate research at the smaller colleges. Curricular and outreach material for both undergraduate and K-12 application, developed at the participating institutions and in collaboration with the Director of the Angel Ramos Visitor Center at Arecibo, will be made publicly available. Women comprise a large fraction of the faculty involved in the program.</AbstractNarration>

The survey is designed to also discover low mass objects that contain sufficient gas to be detected by the emission from hydrogen atoms but which have not yet formed many stars (æstarlessÆ galaxies). Understanding the nature of these galaxies is an important step to understanding how galaxies form and evolve.  The Undergraduate ALFALFA Team has utilized a collaborative and peer mentoring model to educate and train students and faculty as they investigate the results from this survey. Over the six years of this grant, and two associated NSF grants, over two hundred undergraduate students and faculty members from the nineteen institutions have participated in the observations, data calibration, and analysis of the radio survey results. They have made substantial contributions to the scientific output of the ALFALFA extragalactic hydrogen survey and follow-up studies. Team students and faculty have presented their results at national meetings and through reviewed scientific publications.  A major component of the TeamÆs program has been to provide undergraduate students with the opportunity to conduct hands-on observations with the 1000-foot diameter Arecibo Observatory radio telescope.
