<AbstractNarration>Data-driven Animation of Skin Deformations&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Optical motion capture has been used very successfully to create compelling human animations for entertainment applications; however, it provides only a much simplified version of what we would see if we were to view a person actually performing those actions. The data contain the motion of the skeleton but miss such visually important effects as the bulging of muscles and the jiggling of flesh. The current state of the art uses 40-60 markers to approximate the rigid body motion of&lt;br/&gt;15-22 segments.  To the extent possible, the markers are placed on joint axes and bony landmarks so that they can more easily be used to find the motion of an idealized skeleton.  The investigators are taking a different approach to motion capture and use a very large set of markers (approximately 350-500) placed on the muscular and fleshy parts of the body to capture not only the motion of the skeleton but also the motion of the surface of the skin.  Models of skin and muscle deformations will have long term applications in such fields as computer animation, video games, surgical planning, humanoid robotics, and bioengineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators are using captured data to construct dynamic models of the deformations seen in human motion parameterized by joint angle, velocity, and torque.  Those models are used to generalize captured data to new motions and new subjects with a similar body type.&lt;br/&gt;The investigators have been able to accurately reconstruct the motion of the surface of the body by applying the three-dimensional trajectories for this dense marker set to a subject-specific polygonal model.  They are exploring a number of different approaches to generalize this data ranging from simple statistical dynamic models to relatively accurate anatomical models with parameters identified from the data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ As has been demonstrated in recent theatrical releases, skin deformation of animated characters must be natural, dynamic, and detailed if the characters are to appear realistic and lifelike. This level of realism is particularly important in scenes of rich natural environments such as those seen in Avatar and realistic special-effect shots such as those in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. These deformations are essential for conveying a sense of life: the tension in the muscles and the jiggle of the underlying muscle and soft tissue convey the exertion of the character and the dynamics of the motion.  In this project, we explored two different ways to create realistic skin and muscle deformation: modeling from recorded trajectories of skin markers and modeling from simulation.  We refer to the first as top-down as it takes data of skin motion and derives a model for novel skin motion and to the second as bottom-up as it goes from first principles of anatomy and physiology to novel skin motion.  Shoulder complex modeling from skin surface marker data: The human shoulder complex is perhaps the most complicated joint in the human body being comprised of a set of three bones, muscles, tendons, and ligaments. Despite this anatomical complexity, computer graphics models for motion capture most often represent this joint as a simple ball and socket. We developed a method to determine a shoulder skeletal model that, when combined with standard skinning algorithms, generates a more visually pleasing animation that is a closer approximation to the actual skin deformations of the human body.  Modeling of the skin surface from muscle activation: We developed an algorithm that generates natural, dynamic, and detailed skin deformation from standard motion capture joint angle data (skeletal motion capture data). The algorithm consists of two steps: identification of a muscle deformation model from high density skin data and simulation of the skin deformation to produce motion of the muscle and skin.  The results of this research are relevant to computer animation, construction of realistic robotics figures, and to biomechanics.  This research formed the core of a PhD student's thesis.
