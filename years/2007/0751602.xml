<AbstractNarration>In April 2006, extraordinary observations of a deep-sea explosive (Strombolian) volcanic eruption were made at NW Rota-1, a submarine volcano in the Mariana arc of the western Pacific.  This research funds a return to the volcano to collect observational and analytical data and its subsequent on-shore data analysis and interpretation.  Instruments including hydrophones, chemical sensors, current meters, and plume sensing devices will be deployed at the eruption site for one year.  During the cruises, visual observations will made.  A time-series collection of lava, gas and fluids at the active volcanic vent will also take place.  Vent fluids and biological specimens from local hydrothermal vent sites will also be sampled. In terms of scientific impact, the research provides an opportunity to learn about volcanological process that have been impossible to study directly until now.  Owing to the high viscosity of water, compared to air, closer and more specific observation and sampling of a Strombolian eruption can take place at Rota 1 than can be accomplished in subaerial settings.  As a result, this work reveals critical proceses that help unravel eruptive mechanism of a highly destructive type of explosive volcanism. Broader impacts include public outreach via the media. The work also involves inter-Agency participation, an interdisciplinary inter-institutional collaboration, and the training a graduate student.</AbstractNarration>
