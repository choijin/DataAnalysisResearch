<AbstractNarration>We propose to develop and run a summer school on Language-Based Techniques for Integrating with the External World. The aim of the school is to prepare graduate students, post-docs, and researchers in academia&lt;br/&gt;and industry to conduct research on this topic.&lt;br/&gt;The school will present and discuss material on several related topics in this area. See Section 3 for&lt;br/&gt;the importance of the topic area and Section 4 for the specific topics and speakers. Specifically, the panels&lt;br/&gt;outlined at the end of Section 4 show the interrelated and synergistic nature of many of the topics.&lt;br/&gt;Each topic will be covered for approximately four hours of lectures, providing ample time for speakers&lt;br/&gt;to address the topic from three perspectives:&lt;br/&gt;1. Foundational Theory Each speaker will begin with tutorial-level background on the fundamental&lt;br/&gt;principles and theory underlying the problems and solutions in the topic area. With this foundational&lt;br/&gt;perspective, the summer-school will cover key issues in areas such as type systems, logic, flow analysis,&lt;br/&gt;statistics, and distributed computing. These foundations are important because they motivate the&lt;br/&gt;advanced techniques and provide participants the skills they need to attack new problems.&lt;br/&gt;2. Advanced Techniques Each speaker will cover extensions to the classic theory that bring students upto-&lt;br/&gt;speed with respect to the latest results from cutting-edge research. The speakers have all published&lt;br/&gt;top research papers on their topic in the last year or two, so these perspective allows for the rapid&lt;br/&gt;dissemination of important ideas that can motivate additional research.&lt;br/&gt;3. Theory, in Practice Each speaker will describe how the theory and advanced techniques have informed&lt;br/&gt;practical tools used to make software development easier, faster, or more secure. Especially&lt;br/&gt;given the topic of external-world integration, the experience of the speakers in using principled engineering&lt;br/&gt;to apply cutting-edge research in the real world is a perspective the summer-school will&lt;br/&gt;emphasize.</AbstractNarration>
