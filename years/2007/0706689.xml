<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Fellowship will support a research agenda that is a novel approach to the study of nations and&lt;br/&gt;nationalism. This project investigates the "national movements" of stateless nations. It places intranational&lt;br/&gt;movement variation at the center of its analysis. Placing variance at the center of the research&lt;br/&gt;agenda is more likely to provide us with the most significant advances in our understanding of&lt;br/&gt;independentist nationalism, and of its counterparts, autonomist nationalism and federalist nationalism.&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, this project studies the conditions under which new nationalist political parties get&lt;br/&gt;successfully established within the institutionalized sphere of parliamentary politics and electoral&lt;br/&gt;competition, with a focus on the role played by networks of sociological nationalism. In selecting cases,&lt;br/&gt;this project will seek to have cases where there is variation in the independent variable: low vs. high&lt;br/&gt;levels of the presence of sociological nationalism in civil society, and a corresponding variation in the&lt;br/&gt;dependent variable: success or failure in the founding of autonomist, independent, or federalist nationalist&lt;br/&gt;political parties. The universe of cases covered by this project includes the nationalist parties of Quebec,&lt;br/&gt;Catalonia, Puerto Rico, Scotland, the Basque Country, Corsica, etc. The project will develop a data set&lt;br/&gt;mapping the extent of the presence of sociological nationalism in the civil society in the selected cases.&lt;br/&gt;The Fellowship will also support original fieldwork in the selected cases. Ultimately, the broader research&lt;br/&gt;agenda this Fellowship supports will help to illuminate the relevance of national movements for state&lt;br/&gt;stability and state maintenance.</AbstractNarration>
