    <AbstractNarration>The main objective of this Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) is to complete the development of health monitoring technology experiment that is specifically designed to report the degradation of a bridge cable under the combined effect of mechanical loading and environmental factors. Extensive analytical work has already been completed for the experiment. The analytical model is a probabilistic-based approach for the evaluation of the remaining strength of the cable. The model forecasts the time-dependent degradation of the cable strength under the effect of the environment through the deployment of corrosion sensors. The results of the model show promising results in the prediction of the degraded cable strength. However, physical testing is required for a true ""proof of concept"" of the environmental degradation of the strength. It is this testing that will be carried out if this research is funded. The Bridge Technology Consulting (BTC) Cable Strength Model along with data obtained from corrosion sensors embedded inside the cables is the only known model to provide continuous updating of the cable strength. Structural investigations already performed by the BTC Cable Strength Model have demonstrated the validity of the concept. On this basis, the idea of incorporating corrosion sensors embedded in the cable to update the damage state of the cable wires and re-assess the cable strength accordingly has considerable intellectual merit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The expected outcome of the project will have a significant broad impact on the assessment of the strength of degraded bridge cables throughout the United States. The project outcome will provide a clear proof that Health Monitoring System composed of the analytical cable strength model, combined with corrosion sensors embedded inside the cable is sound in concept and operates as expected. The system is expected to provide an efficient health monitoring tool for cable strength assessment that will be used by bridge engineer and bridge owners throughout the United States.</AbstractNarration>
