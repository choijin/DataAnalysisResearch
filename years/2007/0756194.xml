    <AbstractNarration>This grant will support a Special Session at the 2008 Annual RESNA Conference to highlight cutting edge and leading edge work of leading scientists and engineers. RESNA, through its Annual Conference has been providing an interdisciplinary forum for over 25 years for scientists, researchers, service providers, manufacturers and students to come together to learn about the work, challenges and solutions of their respective professions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This special session will bring scientists and engineers that are outside the field of rehabilitation engineering and assistive technology together with individuals working in the field to learn about future trends and the potential impact these trends may have on technology solutions for individuals with disabilities. The Emerging Technologies Session will be a two and a half hour session with up to 3 presenters from the U.S. and potentially one international presenter. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of this special session include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Providing individuals in the field of rehabilitation engineering and assistive technology with new strategies and approaches that may be of value to their current and future work with individuals with disabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Providing an opportunity for speakers to disseminate information about their work to an audience they would not otherwise reach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. Building and/or enhancing cooperation among stakeholders regarding the development of technology solutions for individuals with disabilities. RESNA is an interdisciplinary association of people with a common interest in technology and disability.</AbstractNarration>
