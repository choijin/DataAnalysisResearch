<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project supports a workshop to bring together:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; a)  computer scientists working on formal semantics methods,&lt;br/&gt; e.g., ontologies, knowledge representation languages&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; b)  accounting and accounting information systems faculty,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        c)  developers of standards for financial reporting systems,&lt;br/&gt;            such as XBRL, UN CEFACT, SDMX, ...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        d)  government statisticians working on the generation of&lt;br/&gt;            economic statistics&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        e)  staff from government financial and securities&lt;br/&gt;            regulatory agencies&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;to consider research issues and the potential utility &lt;br/&gt;and impact of formal semantics methods (e.g., ontologies,&lt;br/&gt;knowledge representation languages, description logic, etc.)&lt;br/&gt;for the specification of financial reporting systems &lt;br/&gt;and standards for financial information (reporting)&lt;br/&gt;systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;----------------------&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Financial reporting systems consist of financial transaction systems&lt;br/&gt;(e.g., general ledger),  classification schemes (notably charts of&lt;br/&gt;accounts), and aggregation mechanisms (e.g., summing all of the&lt;br/&gt;transactions for particular accounts).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Historic practice in the specification of financial information&lt;br/&gt;system standards is to specify the semantics via natural language&lt;br/&gt;texts.  The PI and others believe that this is&lt;br/&gt;inadequate to assure reliable semantic interoperability among &lt;br/&gt;the various accounting standards and systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop is the first to bring together researchers from&lt;br/&gt;the formal semantics / KR / ontology communities and the accounting&lt;br/&gt;community.  It is to explore the prospects for interaction of these&lt;br/&gt;two communities and write a report with a research agenda for &lt;br/&gt;work in this interdisciplinary area of formal semantic specification&lt;br/&gt;of financial information systems and the implications for &lt;br/&gt;interoperatibility of these financial reporting systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Financial information systems are an essential component in&lt;br/&gt;the management of large organizations - business, government,&lt;br/&gt;and nonprofits.  They are an essential component of the &lt;br/&gt;securities and banking industries,  securities and banking regulatory &lt;br/&gt;agencies and operation of taxation systems.&lt;br/&gt;Financial reporting systems are also the basis from which &lt;br/&gt;economic statistics, such as national income statistics and&lt;br/&gt;trade statistics are generated.   Improvements in the semantic&lt;br/&gt;specification of these financial information systems will &lt;br/&gt;facilitate the automation of the financial reporting chain,&lt;br/&gt;and improve the reliability of interoperability and integration&lt;br/&gt;of such financial reporting systems within businesses, and between&lt;br/&gt;businesses and regulatory and taxation agencies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, the adoption of formal semantic specifications for &lt;br/&gt;financial reporting systems will entail substantial changes in the&lt;br/&gt;training of accounting information system professionals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project web page:  http://www.msu.edu/user/mccarth4/NSFontology/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
