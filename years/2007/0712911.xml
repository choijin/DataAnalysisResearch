<AbstractNarration>The goal of the proposed research is to develop deterministic motion-planning algorithms to accomplish system-wide reconfiguration of connected clusters of mobile, modular robots, including undergraduate students in all aspects of algorithm development.  The first part of this project involves the incremental development and analysis of a suite of algorithms that together comprise a complete deterministic motion planner. The planner is ?complete? in the sense that it will reconfigure a system of n modular, mobile robots, from a connected initial configuration into any equal-sized connected goal configuration. We seek a distributed solution to this problem that is reasonably efficient and provably near-optimal, in terms of number of robot moves and overall reconfiguration time. We have already made progress on the development, analysis, and simulation of algorithms that form the basis for a complete planner for a robotic system composed of hexagonal robots and have also begun to develop algorithms that are resilient to the presence of obstacles in the reconfiguration environment. In the second part of this project, we will focus on making our algorithms adaptive to uncertainty and different module types.   The algorithms will be verified experimentally using a number of different visualization tools.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     NSF Grant 0712911 Final Report and Executive Summary   Original Goals and Work Completed: Our original objective was to develop a suite of distributed motion planning algorithms for a system of hexagonal, metamorphic robots to self-reconfigure via individual module movements from an initial polygonal shape to any other polygonal shape. In particular, we addressed the following goals in algorithmic development:      Reconfigure a straight chain to any shape goal configuration. This goal has been achieved in a piecemeal fashion. It remains a future goal for us to combine our straight chain to arbitrary goal shape algorithms into modules that can, both experimentally and through rigorous mathematical proof, be shown to reconfigure a straight chain into any arbitrary goal configuration.     Reconfigure an arbitrary initial shape to a straight chain goal configuration. This has proven to be one of the most challenging problems of the four original goals. Our latest work involves the reconfiguration of a restricted subset of polygonal configurations to a straight chain. We have submitted a paper that presents one such algorithm to an international robotics conference, and we are currently working on several other algorithms addressing this problem that are as yet unpublished.      Surface traversal and obstacle envelopment. We have solved the problem of enveloping and traversing obstacles and modular surfaces in the reconfiguration environment, but only for the case where these surfaces have the same shape, size, and interlocking mechanisms of the robots we model. The problems of enveloping obstacles that are of more complex and unpredictable shape and moving robots over various terrains are problems that remain to be addressed.     Fill holes or pockets in a configuration. It is probable that algorithms developed during this project for pocket filling can be combined with algorithms for surface traversal and goal partitioning to allow modules to access and fill holes in the goal configuration.     New Issues Raised: How can the goal configuration be partitioned into components that fit our current criteria for successful reconfiguration? What might be accomplished with limited robot communication? How can we adapt our algorithms to accomplish collision detection instead of collision avoidance? What could be accomplished by hexagonal modules with more fluid motion constraints than we have previously considered? Can the current work being done with smart materials be used to fundamentally change our system model?

The main attribute that students working on the project share is a fascination with robotics and an imagination capable of appreciating the possibilities of reconfigurable robotic systems. Each of the students working on the project programmed extensively in Java and Python and used the LaTeX typesetting program to document the results of their work. Nine of the undergraduates worked with the P.I. over 6 summers alongside the students funded by the Texas A&amp;M University Undergraduate Student Research Grant (USRG) in the Parasol Robotics Laboratory. Our work resulted in 10 publications that were submitted to robotics conferences or conferences on distributed and parallel computing, and 5 of these publications were accepted for publication in conference proceedings. Three of the student co-authors presented their papers at both international and national conferences. Nine posters were created as a result of this resear...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
