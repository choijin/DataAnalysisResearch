<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports the United States Polar Rock Repository (USPRR). The repository houses a research collection of geologic samples from Antarctica and the Arctic, along with associated materials such as field notes, photographs, maps, analytical data, paleomagnetic cores, thin sections, and microfossil mounts. It provides open access to these samples for researchers and collects legacy collections from institutions across the US. The USPRR integrates geologic and geophysical data from cataloged samples where possible, and maintains online sample, map, and rock physical property databases accessible via the world-wide-web. The broader impacts of the facility include new research infrastructure, improving planning for polar research, and providing information for educators and children to learn about polar geology via the website and facility tours. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
