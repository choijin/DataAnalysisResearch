<AbstractNarration>The research of this project deals with functional analysis and operator theory related to engineering systems theory. A very wide range of problems in engineering can be formulated and studied in terms of matrix inequalities. Furthermore, many linear system control problems have matrices as their natural variables and thus require an understanding of polynomials and rational functions in noncommutative variables. Of special practical importance is "convexity," for in its presence local minima (which can be found computationally) are in fact global minima (the ones that you really want to find). Yet more tractable are linear matrix inequalities. A surprising finding of the principal investigator and a collaborator that resulted from a previous grant is that any matrix inequality based on a convex noncommutative rational function is equivalent to a linear matrix inequality determined by the same function. In the current project the principal investigator will work on extending the classical (commuting) theory of polynomial inequalities (commonly called semialgebraic geometry) to noncommutative polynomials. He will explore aspects of this subject that pertain to convexity and curvature, develop computer algorithms based on this theory, analyze such algorithms, and look for connections with other branches of mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first line of mathematical models in engineering for nearly all things that move is a  "system" ; namely, a box with inputs and outputs. Even if these are not linear, the first step in a design is often linearization, so the mathematics of linear systems plays a major role in areas such as control for planes, cars, satellites, structures in earthquakes,&lt;br/&gt;oil refineries, machine tools, flowing fluids, and much else. The biggest advance in linear systems engineering during the 1990s was the realization that most linear control problems convert directly to matrix inequalities. Many different types of matrix inequalities surfaced in twentieth-century mathematics, but the ones that dominate today in engineering systems usually require that a polynomial or rational function of matrices be "positive semidefinite," a technical property. Many engineering matrix inequalities are&lt;br/&gt;"ill-behaved," but there is a classical core of problems in which such inequalities convert to "well-behaved" linear matrix inequalities.  The latter are computationally tractable and provably free from false optima (which can lead to unsafe designs). It is algebraic formulas like these that are programmed into modern computer packages in systems engineering. The goals of this project are the following: to test mathematically and computationally whether a given set of matrix inequalities is well behaved, to understand how to convert bad matrix inequalities into nice ones, and to develop corresponding computer algorithms. The principal investigator also devotes significant effort to promoting interactions between mathematicians and engineers.  In addition to working with his own graduate students, he runs a modest computational lab in the summer that is staffed by students. Although many of these students go on to obtain Ph.D.'s in pure mathematics, the lab experience and exposure to engineering broadens them considerably.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  There were a variety of projects  involving parts of operator theory and functional analysis mostly related to  Matrix Inequalities especially   Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs) and engineering system theory.  BROADER IMPACTS Most problems in technology involve many variables and equations in many unknowns. Often these are arranged carefully in arrays called matrices. Matrices can be added and multiplied, so calculations can be performed with matrices by algebraic manipulations. A major difficulty is that matrix multiplication depends on the order in which matrices are multiplied, usually AB is not BA; as opposed to numbers, eg.  7 x 3= 3 x 7. The terminology  is matrix multiplication is  noncommutative. Many of the findings from this grant bear on problems where the unknowns are matrices and the corresponding algebra which is noncommutative.   Much of the work supported focused on optimization. Most areas of technology in which there is a math model ( a rapidly expanding list) use  optimization, stretching from mechanical and  electrical systems to google and the emerging analytics industry.    Semidefinite Programming (SDP), based on LMIs, is one of the main developments in optimization over the previous 15 years.There are now a variety of computer packages available for finding solutions to LMIs. SDP is a fairly new far reaching extension of classical Linear Programming, a technique used universally thru areas of technology from airline scheduling, to portfolio selection, to  compression of big data sets, to large scale meal planning.    A basic question is:     What is the scope of semidefinite programming?   Problems treatable with LMIs are "convex", but  conversely:   which convex problems are treatable with LMIs?    Convexity is a highly desired property, since for a convex problem a "local" optimum is global. There are  computer packages which reliably find a local optimum for many problems. At least one of the local solutions is global, but there is no way to know if the program found it. Of course we are interested in thousands of variables, where  no pictures exist, there are  just  algebra formulas. Often there are thousands of local minima among which the global minimum is hiding.  When we have convex problems this difficulty goes away, thus the area of Convex Programming is very important and within that area, for LMIs  there are off the shelf computer packages for finding a global minimum.  This NSF project made basic discoveries on determining the scope of SDP, that is determining which convex problems were treatable by LMIs. Also there was strong findings treating  problems where the unknowns were matrices, as well as the production of related computer algebra software. Other topics meeting success were: chemical reactions, tokamak (controlled fusion reactor) design, numerical ranges.  This work sits on the boundary between pure and applied mathematics and has an impact on both. The PI gave lectures to both mathematicsand engineering audiences and wrote expositions targeting these groups.Also work with graduate students introduced them to a broad range of areas.     INTELLECTUAL MERIT         A serious advance on the scope of LMI techniques by Helton and McCullough  for matrix variables asserts: Every 'noncommutative basic semialgebraic matrix convex set'  has a LMI representation. Here the n-variables entering the LMI are each matrices. It is consistent with the vast engineering literature  where one finds matrix convexity only occurs in a modest list of systems problems and these are always associated with an LMI.  This  rigidity for n-matrix variable sets is in  contrast to the   case of a convex set C  with n-variables are numbers. Here a basic additional requirement is that C must satisfy a "line test",discovered by Helton and Vinnikov under the NSF grant of which this is a continuation.    Changing Variables.The previous result has the implication that the scope of a very popular systems engineering m...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
