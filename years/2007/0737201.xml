<AbstractNarration>Taking advantage of recent developments in the area of microfluidics and microelectromechanical (MEMS) systems, Colorado State University researchers will develop and test a miniaturized, microchip based aerosol analyzer, to be coupled with existing interface systems appropriate to the detection and analysis of size resolved precipitation and aerosols.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Analytical systems using microchip capillary electrophoresis (MCE) with Electrochemical Detection (ECD) are suggested to be versatile systems capable of measuring inorganic anions and cations, carboxylic acids and anhydrocarbohydrates (e.g., plant combustion biomarkers such as levoglucosan, mannosan, galactosan), all of which are of interest in characterizing ambient aerosol sources and composition.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development of  miniaturized, inexpensive aerosol analyzers holds the potential of their operation in dense sampling networks, personal exposure monitors, deployment on small unmanned aircraft systems, and in real time air-quality monitoring and aerosolized agent detection schemes, all of the above having potentially broad and desirable societal goals.</AbstractNarration>
