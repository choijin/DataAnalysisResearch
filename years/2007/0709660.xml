<AbstractNarration>There are several genes involved in tooth enamel formation and determining tooth enamel thickness. Tooth enamel thickness is correlated with diet. One gene involved in determining enamel thickness is Enam.  The investigators have shown Enam differences between human populations have been selectively advantageous. Additionally, there are differences in tooth enamel thickness between groups of people. This research proposes to test for an association between the Enam changes and thickness differences. The methods include measuring enamel thickness from bitewing x-rays and analyzing Enam DNA sequences for each individual. The researchers will then look for an association between the two measures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In recent genomic studies, many genes have been identified that have differences between human populations. Understanding those differences will help scientists understand how populations have adapted to different environments. Researchers have employed methods of scanning the entire genome to identify unusual regions that indicate recent advantageous changes. This research is one of the first to connect a gene identified with differences between populations to a measurable change, tooth enamel thickness in this case. This research will also inform about dietary changes that have shaped the evolution of human dentition.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
