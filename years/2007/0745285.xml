<AbstractNarration>It is widely believed that a biological system centered on RNA or RNA-like biopolymer, preceded the DNA-, RNA-, and protein-containing system that now dominates. However, this "RNA world" is now disjointed from modern biochemistry and current understanding does not make clear how it could have given rise to the present world through a continuous set of evolutionary steps. The purpose of this research is to explore the hypothesis that the modern ribosome is a molecular fossil of the primordial RNA replicase. In a broader sense, the research aims to address the transition from a hypothetical RNA organism to the Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA). To do this, the research group of the Principal Investigator will explore whether the ribosome that currently performs carbon-centered amide and ester bond formation can also perform phosphate-centered transesterification reactions indicative of ribozyme-like chemistry in the same active site. The research group will also investigate the structural plausibility of adaptor-mediated replication in the context of the modern translation apparatus rather than the template-directed replication model that has dominated since the early work of Watson and Crick. The broader impact of this project lies in its effort to enhance both university and pre-university science education related to the themes of the research, through formal coursework, mentoring, and science demonstrations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The notion that an "RNA World" existed prior to our current biochemistry was provocative when put forward by Francis Crick, Leslie Orgel, and Carl Woese in the 1960s, but since that time has become widely accepted.  This model for the origin of life leaves two fundamental questions unanswered&mdash;how did RNA organisms replicate their genomic information and how did the modern universal protein synthesis machinery (which is quite complicated) evolve?  The goal of the project is lofty--to work to provide biochemical support that the answer to both questions is the same&mdash;that the ribosome evolved from (and is a molecular fossil of) the primordial RNA-dependent RNA replicase involved in the earliest forms of life. We completed key validation steps in the experimental design, but did not complete the overall desired experimental endpoint--developing a working system for ribosomal based phosphodiester transesterification.  My research laboratory continues to pursue the idea that the ribosome (currently used by all organisms on earth to synthesize proteins) originated as the replicase used by the earliest forms of life to copy genomic information.       The Ph.D. student involved in the project, Dr. Lan Huong Lai completed her Ph.D. thesis in December 2016. In addition to her research and experimental work on the project, Dr. Lai performed significant outreach to the community and also committing a year of effort to the Body Engineering Los Angeles (BE-LA) program.
