<AbstractNarration>Workshop on New Research Frontiers in Shape, Solid, and Physical Modeling&lt;br/&gt;PI: Hong Qin, SUNY at Stony Brook&lt;br/&gt;Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;On June 2-6, 2008, State University of New York at Stony Brook (Stony Brook University) will be hosting&lt;br/&gt;and co-sponsoring Stony Brook Modeling Week. The Stony Brook Modeling Week comprises two&lt;br/&gt;prestigious symposia that are being held consecutively, namely, the annual Solid and Physical Modeling&lt;br/&gt;Symposium (to be held on June 2-4, 2008) and the annual International Conference on Shape Modeling and&lt;br/&gt;Applications (to be held on June 4-6, 2008). The first of these two conferences, the ACM Symposium on&lt;br/&gt;Solid and Physical Modeling (SPM) is co-sponsored by the Association For Computing Machinery Special&lt;br/&gt;Interest Group on Computer Graphics (ACM SIGGRAPH). It is an annual international forum for the exchange&lt;br/&gt;of recent research results in applications of spatial modeling and computations in design, analysis,&lt;br/&gt;simulation, and manufacturing, as well as in emerging biomedical, geophysical, and other relevant areas.&lt;br/&gt;The second conference, the International Conference on Shape Modeling and Applications (SMI) is cosponsored&lt;br/&gt;by the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers Computer Society (IEEE-CS) and provides&lt;br/&gt;an international forum for the dissemination of new computational techniques for modeling and processing&lt;br/&gt;digital representations of shapes and their properties to a diverse community of experts across a wide range&lt;br/&gt;of areas. These two conferences together traditionally had formed the International Convention on Shapes&lt;br/&gt;and Solids in 2004 and 2005, respectively.</AbstractNarration>
