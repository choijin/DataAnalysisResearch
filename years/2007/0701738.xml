<AbstractNarration>Integrative, Hybrid and Complex Systems&lt;br/&gt;Christopher C. Davis&lt;br/&gt;University of Maryland College Park&lt;br/&gt;Transceiver and Network Technology Developments for Directional Hybrid Wireless Networks&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our prior research, and the research of others, has shown that mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs) do not scale.  Our aim in this research is to prove that a higher communication tier can be created using autonomously configuring directional links in a flexible backbone network that connects MANET-like small clusters in an architecture that is "base-station-like."  This research will address important, unsolved research problems in stabilization, pointing, acquisition, tracking (SPAT), bootstrapping, and topology control algorithms needed to make our "hybrid" directional free space optical (FSO) and radio frequency (RF) networks a reality.  The research will help to resolve link physics issues that affect the FSO/RF channel, including:  (i) fading of the urban hybrid FSO/RF channel; (ii) measurements of temporal and spatial correlation functions on the channel; and (iii) studies of the performance of non-imaging FSO receivers with regard to amelioration of the tip-tilt and beam break-up problems of the FSO channel.  We will also build and study new optical wireless nodes with novel design features that make them potentially valuable in indoor optical wireless applications where RF is not desirable because of interference problems, such as in the healthcare industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators have a record of involving women and minorities in their research.  In addition, undergraduate students regularly participate in the research of the group and contribute to published journal and conference papers.  We plan to continue to participate in the University of Maryland MERIT program, an internship program for talented undergraduate students from universities across the United States.  We regularly provide year-long Research Practicum experience for seniors from neighboring high schools.  Because of the highly visible real engineering carried out by the group, we have many demonstrations that we run at academic open houses held at the University of Maryland each year to attract talented students, especially females and members of under-represented groups, into Electrical and Computer Engineering.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
