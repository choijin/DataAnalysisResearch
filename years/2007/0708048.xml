    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0708048&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Gregory J. Galloway&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is concerned with research projects at the&lt;br/&gt;interface of spacetime geometry and general relativity. In&lt;br/&gt;particular, properties of marginally trapped surfaces, which have&lt;br/&gt;played an important role in theory of black holes, will be&lt;br/&gt;investigated. Although physically well motivated, very few&lt;br/&gt;rigorous results about marginally trapped surfaces, and&lt;br/&gt;associated objects, such as dynamical horizons, had been known&lt;br/&gt;til recently. This situation has changed, and there are now&lt;br/&gt;rigorous results concerning existence, uniqueness, and other&lt;br/&gt;issues. Motivating this study in part is the realization of a&lt;br/&gt;deeper connection between marginally trapped surfaces in&lt;br/&gt;spacetime and minimal surfaces in Riemannian manifolds. The PI&lt;br/&gt;will conduct research on a number of topics pertaining to&lt;br/&gt;marginally trapped surfaces, such as the topology of black holes,&lt;br/&gt;rigidity and regularity of outermost marginally trapped surfaces,&lt;br/&gt;and aspects of dynamical horizons. String theory has increased&lt;br/&gt;interest in gravity in higher dimensions, and, in particular,&lt;br/&gt;there has been a great deal of recent research concerning black&lt;br/&gt;holes in higher dimensional spacetimes. Schoen and the PI&lt;br/&gt;recently obtained a generalization to higher dimensions of a&lt;br/&gt;classical result of Hawking concerning the topology of black&lt;br/&gt;holes. One part of the present proposal, involving joint work&lt;br/&gt;with Schoen, concerns an effort to obtain an important&lt;br/&gt;strengthening of this result, which would close a gap in the&lt;br/&gt;conclusion concerning allowed topologies. This circle of ideas&lt;br/&gt;should also be useful in obtaining lower entropy bounds for&lt;br/&gt;higher dimensional stationary black holes in the asymptotically&lt;br/&gt;AdS setting that extend known results in four dimensions. The PI&lt;br/&gt;will also conduct research on a continuing project with Andersson&lt;br/&gt;and Cai concerning the positivity of mass for asymptotically&lt;br/&gt;hyperbolic manifolds, and research pertaining to a problem of&lt;br/&gt;Penrose concerning the classical stability of string theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Modern theories of gravity are geometrical in nature. The&lt;br/&gt;gravitational field and other fields, black holes and related&lt;br/&gt;objects, may be described and analyzed using geometric&lt;br/&gt;methods. In more general terms, this project is concerned with&lt;br/&gt;the study of certain features of gravity of current scientific&lt;br/&gt;interest from this geometric point of view, utilizing the tools&lt;br/&gt;of Riemannian geometry, a mathematical theory of space, and&lt;br/&gt;Lorentzian geometry, a mathematical theory of spacetime. These&lt;br/&gt;theories provide a method for studying the relationship among&lt;br/&gt;three fundamental aspects of the spacetime universe: curvature&lt;br/&gt;(i.e., the bending of space or spacetime), topology (i.e., the&lt;br/&gt;global shape and complexity of space or spacetime) and causal&lt;br/&gt;structure structure (i.e., the large scale behavior of light rays&lt;br/&gt;and light cones).</AbstractNarration>
