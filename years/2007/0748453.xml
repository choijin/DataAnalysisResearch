<AbstractNarration>Objective:&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this proposal is to request funds from NSF to enable students and junior faculty to participate in the ?Workshop on Frontiers in Electronics? to be held 0n December 15-19, 2007 in Royal park Hotel, Cozumel, Mexico.  This conference is held every three years to review the rapid pace of electronic technology evolution that compels a merger of many technical areas. Examples of some of the areas that will be explored are bioelectronics, MEMS/NEMS, Silicon nanoelectronics and Beyond, High Speed Communications, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;The main purpose of this workshop is to gather experts and to encourage cross fertilization of people with different technical backgrounds.  The experts will be gathered from academia, industry, and government to review the recent breakthroughs and their underlying physical mechanisms.  The workshop will also explore nature of the future challenges in this ?electronic Planet?.  The workshop also plans to prepare archival proceedings of peer reviewed article for broad distribution.  The proceedings will be published in the Special Issue of the ?International Journal of High Speed Electronics and Systems?. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:&lt;br/&gt;We plan to invite senior scientists and engineers as well as young faculty and students to this conference.  The conference will provide a Forum for open discussion, brain storming sessions and cross ?fertilization.  Some of the junior faculty will be invited to make presentations at the conference.  The outcome of the workshop, in the form of formal proceedings can be used as a teaching tool and for guiding future research areas  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
