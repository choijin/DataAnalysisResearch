<AbstractNarration>0732436&lt;br/&gt;Gehrels&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Innovations in experimental methods and instrumentation are revolutionizing the acquisition and application of geochronologic information in Earth Science research.  Some of the most exciting advances are being driven by Laser-Ablation Multicollector ICP Mass Spectrometry (LA-MC-ICPMS), which allows for rapid determination of U-Th-Pb ages with micron-scale spatial resolution.  This technique is fundamentally changing the way that geochronologic information is utilized, with impacts that cover the span of structural geology, tectonics, stratigraphy, paleontology, petrology, economic geology, and geochemistry.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Arizona LaserChron Center (ALC) is a multi-user facility that utilizes LA-MC-ICPMS to provide the NSF-supported Earth Science community with U-Th-Pb geochronologic information and training.  Primary goals of the ALC are to (1) generate high quality/low cost U-Th-Pb geochronologic information for NSF-supported researchers, (2) use every aspect of facility operation as an opportunity to train student and faculty researchers in geochronologic theory and methodology, and (3) drive the development of new techniques and applications that take advantage of the strengths of LA-MC-ICPMS.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The funding will provide support for ALC staff members to assist NSF-supported researchers in acquiring geochronologic information and to drive the development of new analytical techniques, for maintenance and modernization of instrumentation, and for students to be able to conduct research in the laboratory.  This support will enable the ALC to provide geochronologic information for ~50 researchers per year in support of ~30 different NSF-EAR awards.  This collaborative research will drive important new developments in studies of the growth of continents, processes of mountain building, generation and dispersal of sediment through space and time, formation of mineral and hydrocarbon resources, history of evolutionary changes, chronology of early hominids, and genetic linkages between climate and tectonics. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award supported operation of the Arizona LaserChron Center (ALC), an NSF Multi-User Facility, from December 2007 through November 2010.  During this period, the ALC conducted geochronologic studies in collaboration with 626 researchers, including 226 faculty members, 10 post-docs, 246 graduate students, and 144 undergraduate students.  105 academic institutions and 128 NSF awards were involved in this research.   Geochronologic research at the ALC has been conducted with three main objectives and related activities:  (1) Provide geochronologic training and educational opportunities for students and faculty researchers.  This has been accomplished primarily by encouraging researchers to visit the ALC in order to become familiar with all aspects of sample preparation and data generation and analysis.  We have also developed extensive web-based resources, including detailed descriptions of all analytical methods used, software to make plots and analyze data, and  short courses on geochronology that can be used for individual instruction or in a classroom setting.  These short courses have been presented at two different GSA Meetings during the award period.   (2) Generate geochronologic data that is used to address critical problems in Earth Science.  Research conducted at the ALC has been fundamental to our understanding of a wide range of processes such as the growth of continents, formation of mountain systems, generation and transport of sediments, formation of essential mineral and hydrocarbon resources, and linkages between climate and tectonics.  We have also explored applications of geochronology to other fields, such as the timing of early hominid evolution, chronology of evolutionary changes, archeological sourcing of artifacts (e.g., mano stones and temper sands), chronology of mineral evolution as a record of bio-, atmo-, and hydro-sphere evolution, and chronology of meteorites and Mars.  Results have been reported in 128 journal articles that were published or submitted for publication during the award period.  (3) Develop and enhance analytical methods that take advantage of the spatial resolution and efficiency of Laser-Ablation ICP Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICPMS).  The ALC has been very active in improving the precision, accuracy, efficiency, and spatial resolution of U-Pb analyses of zircon by LA-ICPMS.  These improvements have come from our in-house research, from collaborations with academic researchers at other institutions, and from interactions with engineers at companies that manufacture mass spectrometers and laser ablation systems.  We have also invested considerable effort in developing new instrumentation and analytical methods to be able to determine U-Pb ages on a variety of other phases (e.g., titanite, rutile, baddeleyite, monazite, and apatite) and to measure isotope ratios of Hf and Li as well as U, Th, and Pb.  In an effort to organize the geochronology community around such efforts, we hosted an international workshop on methods of generating, interpreting, and reporting U-Pb geochronologic data in 2009, which was attended by 42 researchers from most of the active LA-ICPMS labs around the world.  The ALC is also very active in improving human resources in the Earth Sciences.  We strive to involve students in all aspects of facility operation, and strongly encourage involvement of members of underrepresented minorities.  We also encourage faculty researchers from other institutions to bring students to the lab when conducting analyses.  Travel costs for student researchers are subsidized using NSF Participant Support funds, and this has been very effective at increasing the number of undergraduate and graduate students involved in research.
