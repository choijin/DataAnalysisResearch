<AbstractNarration>The main objective of this research is to utilize a novel microbial technique in dust suppression. Results from previous and ongoing studies by the principal investigator on microbial remediation of concrete and structural cracks have identified potential application of such technique in cementing fine dust particles and plugging cracks on the soil surface.  The key component is close collaboration between Microbiology and Geotechnical Engineering.  The research plan includes: (1) bench-scale biological laboratory study, (2) geotechnical laboratory experiments to identify the optimum design of dust suppression, and (3) pilot-scale field implementation for the validation of the developed microbial method of dust suppression. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this research is to introduce a new, advanced and innovative approach for dust suppression that is environmentally safe and friendly.  The success of this study may provide an important inroad for many future interdisciplinary efforts between Microbiology and Geotechnical Engineering that are still in infancy.  Many such areas are left to be explored including the expedition of soil consolidation, improvement of extremely soft soils, reduction of soil permeability, containment of contaminated aquifers, etc., using microbial techniques. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts resulting from this study will be immediate and substantial due to the fact that the development of environmentally safe but effective methods of dust suppression has been one of the most prime interests among many scientists and engineers.  The South Dakota Department of Transportation, which will participate in this research, plans to disseminate the research results throughout South Dakota through its Local Transportation Assistance Program.  Eventually, the dissemination is expected to reach the entire transportation community in US and abroad.  The Rapid City Landfill Office will also participate and plan to expand the microbial dust suppression technique for the arrest or reduction of fugitive dust particles associated with the municipal landfill operations.  In addition, with additional supplemental funding from NSF REU program, underrepresented students will be recruited and actively participate in the project. These students will be encouraged to participate in hands-on experiments and analysis and assembly of data.  They can contribute their knowledge to the improvement in dust suppression inside the Indian Reservations.  The results of this study will be published in technical journals and conference proceedings.  The study results will also be made available through the Internet website for easy access by interested scientists and engineers.  Dissemination of data to the public will also be made through a variety of media infrastructure to enhance public interests and awareness of the role of microorganisms in natural environment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
