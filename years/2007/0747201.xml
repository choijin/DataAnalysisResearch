<AbstractNarration>Technology scaling has arguably been the most important contributor to the increase in the computational power in microprocessors and indirectly affects many aspects of modern life. One of the most important challenges facing continued technology scaling is the increasing variability in device characteristics, i.e., process variations. Process variations manifest themselves as fluctuations in performance, power, and reliability of manufactured processors. To mitigate these effects, this CAREER program develops variation-tolerant architectures that utilize ?holistic optimizations?, i.e., this project studies techniques that simultaneously consider various computational abstraction levels. The two intriguing examples of such techniques are the consideration of economical incentives to measure the quality of architectures and optimizing for user-perceived performance to increase lifetime reliability. In addition, this project studies the development of understudy components and modular architectures. Understudy components are structures that can replace parts of the chips that fail, whereas modular architectures are processors built using a small variety of similar structures that can be dynamically allocated.  These research tasks have the potential of having a large impact on both academic and industrial research. Process variations cause immense problems to all processor manufacturers and their rising impact should be understood in detail. In addition, there is a growing need to understand how different architectures affect the overall targets of the processor manufacturers as well as the users of these processors. Such an understanding, which will be developed in this project, can then be used to architect much more efficient processors.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Throughout this project, we have focused on improving processor architectures using holistic methods, in other words, methods that consider multiple abstraction layers simultaneously.  With the emerging technologies and ever more stringent constraints on the designs, such "across the stack" approaches are becoming essential in sustaining the processor performance and efficiency improvement.  First, we studied economic implications of designs.  Computer Architecture Literature is filled with optimizations that seek to improve various design goals such as performance, power consumption, reliability, and security.  However, the evaluation of these concepts tends to neglect one of the key factors driving any chip manufacturing decision: a company's bottom-line of revenue or profit.  This shortcoming is understandable, as the relationship between any design metric and profit is hard to understand. In this work, our main research activity has been centered on predicting the prices of processors by using information about their architectural features (such as cache sizes, bus speed, etc.).   Second, we have analyzed how user satisfaction changes with architectural configurations.  Specifically, we have performed user studies where we collect information about hardware performance counters and also asked users to rate their experiences.  Our experiments, performed using three interactive applications, have shown that there is a strong correlation between hardware performance counter readings and user satisfaction ratings.  Third, we analyzed usage patterns of smartphones. As the market for mobile architectures continues its rapid growth, it is important to understand and optimize the power consumption of these battery-driven devices. While energy consumption has been heavily explored, there is one critical factor that is often overlooked &ndash; the end user. Ultimately, the energy consumption of a mobile architecture is defined by user activity. Therefore, we have decided to study user patterns on smart phones to understand the important bottlenecks for these devices.   Finally, we have studied the utilization of nanophotonics for on-chip interconnect networks. With the prevalence of many-core processors in the market, the number of cores on a single chip is expected to reach hundreds, or even thousands. One of the most critical issues in this many-core era will be the communication among different on-chip components. Nanophotonics provides high bandwidth density, low latency, and distance-independent power consumption, which make it a promising candidate for future NoC designs. However, nanophotonics has its own constraints. We focused on developing novel architectures that improve their efficiency and resilience.
