<AbstractNarration>This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program supports Professor Dominick J.Casadonte at Texas Tech University for research focused on the photochemistry and photophysics of localized molecular assemblies containing 1,10-phenanthroline (phen) and 2,9-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline (dmp) with varying dimensionalities afforded by substitution at the (3,8), (4,7), and (5,6) positions on the phenanthroline ring system.  The long-term goal involves an understanding of the spatial requirements for photoactive and optoelectronic molecular systems.   Fundamental photonic and electronic studies will be conducted on a series of Cu(I) oligomeric and polymeric assemblies containing substituted diimine ligands bound together via acrylate or ethynyl linkages. The proposed poly-(Cu(I)(dmp- 5-acrylate)2 and poly-(Cu(I)(dmp-5-acrylate)(PPH3)2 compounds will be linked at the 5 position of each of the phenanthroline ligands in a sigma-bonded fashion.  Photoexcitation of the MLCT bands of these molecular aggregates will lead to charge separation throughout the network.  The Cu(I) polyacetylenic phenanthroline materials will be fully pi-conjugated throughout the lattice. Excitation of the MLCT bands will produce electron flow through the polymer or oligmer chains. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research aims to set the stage for the fabrication of molecular electronic circuit elements. Students will not only develop a consideration of aspects of synthetic and photochemistry, but will also be actively involved in cutting-edge outreach in rural and disadvantaged areas in the West through the development of education modules in light, optics, photochemistry, and electricity that will be posted on YouTube, iTunesU, and the PI's website.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Intellectual Merit: Our primary goal of this grant involved the synthesis and study of the photochemistry and photophysics of localized molecular assemblies containing 1,10-phenanthroline (phen) and 2,9-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline (dmp).  We were also interested in an analysis of the electronic characteristics of these assemblies and the varying dimensionalities afforded by substitution at the (3,8), (4,7), and (5,6) positions on the phenanthroline ring system.  Our long-term goal involves an understanding of the spatial requirements for photoactive and optoelectronic molecular systems, and ultimately, to determine motifs which might prove useful as "plastic" electronics.             We have conducted studies aimed at synthesizing and performing fundamental photonic and electronic studies on a series of Cu(I) oligomeric and polymeric assemblies containing substituted diimine ligands bound together via acrylate or ethynyl linkages and mixed-ligand Cu(I) species containing the substituted phenanthrolines and triphenyl- and tri-n-butylphosphine.  The phosphine-containing species allow us to control the solubility of the resulting polymeric metallo-phenanthroline species, as well as producing a hypsochromic shift both in the absorption and emission spectra into the visible spectral region.  The supramolecular materials produced are anticipated to display interesting optoelectronic properties, including photoconductivity and photocapacitance.              Over the course of the grant, we were able to synthesize and characterize 17 new 4,7-disubstituted conjugation&ndash;extended 1,10-phenanthroline ligands and their Cu(I) analogs (Fig.1).  Of significance here was the fact that while previous substitution schemes for the formation of 4,7-disubstituted-1,10-penanthroline gave yields of around 5%, the methodology that we have developed produced a significant number of ligands and metallopolymers with yields of greater than 90%.  We also 1) examined the theoretical reasons for the significant and unexpected enhancement in substitution reactivity observed at the 4 and 7 positions of 1,10-phenanthroline by the incorporation of excess CuI into the Sonogashira coupling scheme, 2) focused upon improving the synthesis of conjugation-extended 3,8-substituted phenanthroline ligands and their Cu(I) analogs, 3) explored the synthesis of water-soluble mixed-ligand Cu(I) mononuclear species containing a new motif in phosphine ligands which promises to enhance both the steric and electronic robustness of the Cu(I) oxidation state (Fig.2), and 4) synthesized a series of Cu(I) oligomeric species containing crosslinked of 2,9-dimethyl-5-acryloyl-1,10-phenanthroline (dmp-5-acrylate) ligands (Fig.3).  We have observed that the oligomeric species displays a moderate photocapacitive effect, storing about 50mf/mole at 365 m, with a discharge time of approximately 300 ms.  We have characterized the resulting compounds using GPC, MAULDI-TOF, FTIR, NMR, X-Ray, and optical spectroscopic methods.   Broader Impacts: One of the undergraduates who was supported by this grant, Honors College student Eileen Judkins, was one of the top 15% of applicants (300/2000) invited to present a poster entitled, "Synthesis and Characterization of Cu(I) Phenanthroline Polymer Precursor Complexes Involving Substituted Phosphines" at the National Conference on Undergraduate Research (NCUR) in Ithica, NY, on April 2, 2011.  In November of 2011, Eileen presented a poster concerning her work with phosphaadamantane compounds at the American Chemical Society Regional Meeting in Austin, TX.   She is currently in her first year in graduate school at Purdue University.  During the time of the grant, five graduate students, nine undergraduate students, and one international exchange student were mentored in the PIÆs lab.  One student (Hyungsock Suh) received a Ph.D. degree (spring, 2010), while another student, Emily Herbst, received a MasterÆs degree in August, 2011.              During...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
