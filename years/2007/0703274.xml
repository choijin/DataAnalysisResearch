<AbstractNarration> The central theme of the proposed research is to explore conjugated diblock copolymers&lt;br/&gt;for solar energy harvesting and to gain a fundamental understanding of the correlation between&lt;br/&gt;molecular/material structures and photovoltaic (PV) functions. New modular approaches are&lt;br/&gt;proposed to the syntheses of three representative new diblock copolymer systems, rod-rod, rodsemi-rod and rod-coil diblock copolymers. Plans are outlined to elucidate and control the self&lt;br/&gt;assembly and phase behaviors of the resulting materials. The dynamics of charge separation and&lt;br/&gt;charge transport will be investigated to gain insight into the electronic processes in these&lt;br/&gt;materials. Rational approach to modify the ITO surface is proposed in order to direct the&lt;br/&gt;interfacial assembly of these materials and optimize the charge injection. The resulting materials&lt;br/&gt;will be used to prepare prototype solar cells in a well defined cell platform for detailed&lt;br/&gt;characterization. The feedback from these studies will reveal the limiting factors in photovoltaic&lt;br/&gt;materials and guide the development of new materials. These fundamental studies will&lt;br/&gt;eventually lead to breakthrough in developing novel and cost-effective OPV materials enabling&lt;br/&gt;high solar energy conversion efficiency as well as future commercial vitality.                                           &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the proposed activity: This proposed research in syntheses&lt;br/&gt;and characterization of novel functional diblock copolymers will have a fundamental impact on&lt;br/&gt;our understanding in charge separation and transport in organic materials. The relationship&lt;br/&gt;between molecular structure and solid assembly, further between solid structure/physical&lt;br/&gt;properties is fundamentally important to polymer science and material science. A well-defined&lt;br/&gt;molecular system will lead to the formation of defined solid structures, which is invaluable to the&lt;br/&gt;studies in organic light harvesting materials. The proposed work is an important example of new&lt;br/&gt;functions that are introduced into diblock copolymer architectures. The modular synthetic&lt;br/&gt;approaches proposed here will add new knowledge to the synthetic arsenal.                                             &lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the proposed activity: Our nation is currently facing an urgent&lt;br/&gt;need for renewable energy source. Solar energy is the largest renewable energy source. Plastic&lt;br/&gt;solar cells offer potentially low costs in materials and processing, the possibility for large area&lt;br/&gt;and flexible structures, and the ease of the structural modification for the fine-tuning of band&lt;br/&gt;gaps. The proposed research is highly beneficial towards our economy and society. The&lt;br/&gt;proposed efforts will inherently provide ample opportunities for the interdisciplinary training of&lt;br/&gt;graduate and undergraduate students at the frontiers of organic/polymer/material chemistry. We&lt;br/&gt;plan to integrate the proposed research activities with a broad-ranging educational program&lt;br/&gt;aimed at college undergraduate and graduate students. The importance of early involvement of&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate students in research activities is widely acknowledged. In this program, we will&lt;br/&gt;put a great effort in recruiting more undergraduate students. This project is ideal for training&lt;br/&gt;graduate students and enables them to perform original and independent research. From these&lt;br/&gt;highly intellectual processes, they will develop creative thinking and skills and become mature&lt;br/&gt;scientists.</AbstractNarration>
