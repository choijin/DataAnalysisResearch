<AbstractNarration>0716515&lt;br/&gt;Kang&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is an unsolicited submission.  The main objective of this proposal is to investigate a novel method of achieving ultra high resolution, high speed, in-vivo cancer imaging based on common-path endoscopic optical coherence tomography (EOCT). The EOCT approach is aimed at improving the accuracy of biopsy site selection and increasing the resolution of noninvasive optical biopsy for detection of cervical, colon, and rectal cancers. The proposed work is in harmony with the ultrahigh-resolution fiber-optic confocal microscopy work being recently conducted at the FDA/CDRH Division of Physics' Laboratory of Optical Therapeutics and Medical Nanophotonics. A full system analysis using a set of preliminary studies will be conducted to validate this technique for fast and reliable imaging of cancerous tissues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research could resolve some of the critical issues associated with the current endoscopic OCT imaging technology. The high-resolution, real-time optical imaging technology can become a powerful non-invasive optical biopsy technique, enabling assessment of tissue microstructures for early detection of various diseases (such as GI cancer, bladder and cervical cancers etc) without the need for tissue removal. The potential impact on healthcare can be significant. Also, the education plan of the project includes training graduate and undergraduate students, and offers them with an advanced, hands-on engineering-oriented environment. The project also offers an excellent opportunity for tightening the collaboration between researchers with different expertise and promoting the effective use of the existing infrastructures at different institutions and government agencies.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
