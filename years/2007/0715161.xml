    <AbstractNarration>The Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) of UNESCO coordinates and facilitates ocean research among governments. A total of 129 countries comprise the membership; the United States is a key participant and strong supporter of IOC activities. The IOC develops and promotes international research to improve global understanding of ocean processes and their relationship to the sustainable development and stewardship of ocean resources. This project constitutes the NSF portion of support to the Ocean Science Section of the IOC, including development of a new program on Multidisciplinary Science and Natural Resources and an international initiative to examine critical issues of land-atmosphere-ocean biogeochemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Implications: Understanding the role of carbon, it's absorption into the ocean, it's consequences for ocean ecosystems and its long-term cycling, as well as the relationships between human colonization and its effect on coastal ecosystems, are fundamental societal concerns. Accurate data and the development of reliable models are essential in order to understand the consequences of inaction and the planning of cost-effective mitigation strategies. These planning activities stimulate beneficial exchanges between U.S. scientists and their international counterparts, often resulting in extended subsequent joint research, field activities and student exchanges.</AbstractNarration>
