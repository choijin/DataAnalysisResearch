<AbstractNarration>Cosmic Serpent - Bridging Native and Western Science Learning in Informal Settings is a four-year collaboration between the Indigenous Education Institute and the University of California-Berkeley targeting informal science education professionals. This project is designed to explore the commonalities between western science and native science in the context of informal science education. The intended impacts are to provide informal science education professionals with the skills and tools to gain an understanding of the commonalities between native and western worldviews; create regional networks that bridge native and museum communities; develop science education programs in which learners cross cultural borders between western science and indigenous peoples; and meet the needs of diverse audiences using culturally-responsive approaches to science learning. Participants are introduced to topics in physical, earth, space, and life science, using an interdisciplinary approach. Deliverables include professional development workshops, peer mentoring, museum programs for public audiences, a project website, and media products for use in programs and exhibits. Additionally, regional partnerships between museums and native communities, a legacy document, and a culminating conference jointly hosted by the National Museum of the American Indian and the Association of Science and Technology Centers will promote future sustainability. Strategic impact is realized through participants'' increased understanding of native and western science paradigms, museum programs that reflect commonalities in the two approaches, partnerships between museums and native communities, and increased institutional capacity to engage native audiences in science. This project directly impacts 270 informal educators at 96 science centers and tribal/cultural museums nationally while the resulting programs will reach an estimated 200,000 museum visitors.</AbstractNarration>

Project Outcomes  Project development and evaluation were guided by the Dine (Navajo) Model (Maryboy and Begay, 2007), which is a strategic planning model based on the four cardinal directions. : 1) East&mdash;HaÆaÆaah, a place of initiation; 2) South&mdash;Shadiah, a place of growth and organization; 3) West&mdash;IiÆiiÆaah, a place of activation; and 4) North&mdash;Nahookos, a place of transformation, renewal, and evaluation leading to sustainability. In keeping with Native worldviews that honor holistic processes, the evaluation was emergent and organic, rather than seeking predetermined outcomes. Following is an overview of project outcomes based on the four directions.  In the East (HaÆaÆaah), a place of initiation, project participants (Fellows) and team members (leadership and evaluation) deepened their awareness of worldviews, began building relationships across cultures and across institutions, broadened their understanding of the projectÆs aims, and experienced new learning, mainly in the areas of Native ways of knowing. The leadership and evaluation teams also gained awareness that several of the initial project goals would need a longer timeframe to be accomplished in a substantive way. Particularly, they realized that more time was needed to immerse all three groups in environments that supported relationship building, which could then form a foundation for creating collaborative programming in a sustainable way.  In the South (Shadiah), a place of growth and organization, team reflection and evaluation identified a critical need to spend more time in this direction, focused on relationship building in particular. The Leadership team recognized that most Fellows were not ready to activate the collaborative work or to create products, but needed more time to build trust and deepen relationships. In response, they focused on creating environments where open and honest dialogue could be shared around the two worldviews. Findings from the workshops showed that Fellows made connections with collaborating partners, developed ideas for collaborative work that links Indigenous knowledge and Western science, became more reflective practitioners, and deepened their understanding of relationship buildi...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
