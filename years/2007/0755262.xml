<AbstractNarration>This award supports the renewal of the Research Experience for Undergraduates site at the College of William and Mary.  The REU program is a ten-week program of physics research for junior-level undergraduates, selected on the basis of grades and letters of recommendation.  About 30 members of the Physics and Applied Science Departments at William and Mary, as well as several distinguished scientists at Jefferson Lab and NASA-LaRC have agreed to serve as mentors.  This program also involves two teachers in the neutrino physics program at the Soudan Underground Laboratory.  Fields represented by the potential mentors are: laser physics including work with the&lt;br/&gt;JLab FEL, laser atom interactions, condensed matter physics studied with lasers, NMR, and a variety of other techniques, neutrino physics, nuclear and particle physics, THz spectroscopy, polymer physics, surface physics, ultra-sonics, NDE, BEC on a chip, ultra-short laser pulses, plasma physics, non-linear dynamics, quantum computing, information and optics, bio-informatics, and astrophysics/cosmology.  Research projects in all these fields have been represented in the past in William and Mary's Physics REU Program, which has run continuously since 1987.  The RET program, which has been in operation since 2005, brings teachers into neutrino research at one of the foremost facilities in the world.  This award is co-funded by the Division of Physics and by the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities of the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate.</AbstractNarration>
