<AbstractNarration>0746210&lt;br/&gt;Gesquiere&lt;br/&gt; The study of the photophysical and optoelectronic properties of a functioning conducting polymer Bulk-Heterojunction Organic Photovoltaic Device (BH-OPV) is extremely complicated due to the complex nanostructure and overall morphology of the conducting polymer materials applied in these devices. As a result, device performance has remained below expectations and controversies have arisen about the appropriate active layer composition and thickness. To fundamentally address the issues of light absorption and conversion of absorbed light to free charge carriers in active conducting polymer materials for solar energy conversion we will develop a new class of composite nanoparticles that will be studied in a device environment. These nanoparticles contain a limited number of molecules but exhibit bulk properties, and are therefore highly suitable for the study of complex processes in highly heterogeneous materials. Of particular interest are the mechanism and kinetics related to interfacial charge separation/recombination, properties that are crucial to the function of BH-OPVs and are directly affected by molecular conformation, architecture and electronic structure. By the proposed single nanoparticle studies we will gain molecular and nanoscale level insight that will yield detailed knowledge on the bulk material that would not be accessible otherwise. In particular, we will obtain an improved understanding of interfacial charge transfer and separation processes occurring at molecular and mesoscale electron donor-acceptor interfaces while developing new techniques and methodologies for research on materials for solar energy conversion.&lt;br/&gt; The proposed research will be integrated with a novel educational approach. The  vision for science related (STEM) education is to increase interest, excitement, and retention of teachers and students in STEM education and careers through inquiry based learning, and development of a sustainable learning community between the involved learning partners (students, teachers, parents, and the community at large). In addition, current issues in STEM education are primarily motivation issues in dealing with subject areas that are considered ?very difficult?. Therefore, we propose an approach that targets both interesting deliveries, and emotional support and development for students and instructors.&lt;br/&gt; The proposed research program also has implications beyond academia.  Solar energy is the main candidate to meet the energy needs of our society, both from the perspective of supplementing our existing energy resources as well as from the perspective of harvesting a fuel that will reduce the pressure that our society is putting on its living environment. In the short term the societal impact will also be reflected in the education and support of two graduate students from underrepresented groups at the University of Central Florida. On a broader scale, Orlando and Florida in general have highly diverse communities at the social, economic and ethnic levels. We have a large population of Hispanic and African American students of diverse social and economic backgrounds in the community. The proposed program is built to actively reach out to and include these groups in promoting STEM education and careers. The local community will also be involved in encounters with research for designed for a broad audience through exhibitions and open-house events. In addition, we have a major resource available for community outreach in the Florida Solar Energy Center (FSEC). FSEC has been a leader in renewable energy and energy efficiency research and training for 30 years. FSEC is also distinguished as the largest and most active state-supported research and training institute in the United States in the area of renewable energy and building energy efficiency, and also provides additional community services including increasing community awareness to energy related issues, system testing, certification, continuing education and disaster relief among others.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The use of conducting polymers in plastic electronic devices could provide a more practical and accessible form of energy production, use and storage. Conducting polymers are useful materials since they are soft plastic materials that have properties similar to regular semiconductors found in everyday electronic devices and computer chips.  These materials have however come with their own set of problems that required study.  Such studies have led to for instance more efficient plastic (polymer) solar cells.  The main topic of study in this award was motivated by the observation that the efficiency of plastic electronic devices is intimately connected to the shape of the polymer chains that are integrated in those devices.  Conducting polymer chains can be looked at as "al dente" pasta. They have some flexibility, but retain a degree of stiffness.  Every time such polymer chains are added in a device, there is a degree of randomness to how they fold up and get tangled with each other.  This simple property has significant consequences, because changes in the folding and entanglement of the polymer chains actually changes how the device performs.  In other words, the electronic characteristics of the plastic polymer material are altered. To learn more about this problem our research was focused on studying how the shape of an individual polymer chain affects its electronic properties.  These studies can be completed by shining laser light on these single polymer chains and reading out the response with an highly advanced optical microscope.  It was found that the folding properties of conjugated polymers can be influenced by their chemical design, but full control cannot be achieved.   Other factors such as the solvent environment, polymer chain entanglement and side chain interactions should also be taken into account to predict conjugated polymer material morphology.  The role of interactions between neighboring polymer chains was studied by putting a limited number of chains in tiny particles (nanoparticles, much smaller than the size of a virus).  We found that the extent of interactions and its effect on the electronic properties can be tuned by adding functional fillers. The work on these nanoparticles was continued to develop conducting polymer nanoparticle devices enabling memory functions via optical programming and electrical erasing. Our work demonstrated the proof-of-concept and has opened the door for novel approaches to understanding charge-storage mechanism on the nanometer scale and future applications of composite conjugated polymer nanoparticles in nanoscale memory and photoresponsive devices.  The knowledge gained from studying how the polymer chain shape and polymer chain entanglement affect electronic properties was applied to build organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices by Near-Infrared (NIR) photoresponse. The data indicate that with the proper control of the shape and structure of polymer mixtures, NIR absorbing conjugated polymers can be effectively used to efficiently extend the photon capture range of polymer solar cells in an alternative fashion compared to tandem solar cells.   This research is moving the scientific community forward in terms of achieving sustainable renewable and clean energy.  Potential benefits of this include energy independence for the U.S. and development of new technology and manufacturing, which will impact the U.S. economy and as a result society at large. In addition, the research is in an area that can lead to sustainable ways to live on Earth for the global society.
