<AbstractNarration>The intellectual merit of the research is to  extend  our  understanding  of  the  biology  and  ecology  of  marine  picophytoplankton,  a  group  of  microbes  that  are  responsible  for  a  large  proportion  of  the  total  photosynthetic  carbon  fixation  that  occurs  in  the world's  oceans.  The  importance  of  picophytoplankton  as  the  dominant  primary  producers  in  open-ocean  ecosystems  is  well-established.  However,  the  factors  that  regulate  the  distribution  and  abundance  of  these  populations  remain  poorly  understood.    The investigators will explore  the  dynamics  of  top-down  (grazer-mediated)  regulation  of  picophytoplankton  populations  in  a  specific  context:  the  maintenance  of  summertime  subsurface  maxima  in  the  pico-cyanobacterium  Prochlorococcus  (but  not  Synechococcus)  in  the  Sargasso  Sea.   This  phenomenon  represents  a  relatively  simple  and  predictable  model  system  within  which  to  test  hypotheses  about  the  regulation  of  oceanic  picophytoplankton  in  general.    &lt;br/&gt;Recent  results  suggest  that  despite  their  abundance,  Prochlorococcus  in  the  subsurface  maxi-mum  are  growing  (and  being  grazed)  rather  slowly,  as  compared  to  the  smaller  population  at  the  surface.   In  order  to  understand  the  factors  responsible  for  this  apparent  paradox,  this  project  will  use  a  combination  of  field  and  laboratory  studies  to  characterize  and  compare  the  interactions  between  Prochorococcus  and  its  protozoan  grazers  at  these  two  contrasting  depths,  and  in  relation  to  Synechococcus,  which  forms  no  such  sub-surface  maximum.   &lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts include training for graduate and undergraduate students.  In addition, given  the  significance  of  picophytoplankton  as  primary  producers  at  the  base  of  oceanic  microbial  food  webs,  the  results  of  this  project  should  inform  efforts  to  describe  and  model  the  broader  oceanic  ecosystem,  and  ultimately  to  understand  its  role  in  the  global  carbon  cycle. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
