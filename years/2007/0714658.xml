<AbstractNarration>This collaboration between the Franklin Institute and the Free Library of Philadelphia Foundation identifies the role of crucial intermediaries in the science learning of children and points to the opportunities offered through a museum and library partnership to provide engaging science resources in under-resourced communities where many adults lack science expertise and confidence. Through an emphasis on literacy and science, LEAP into Science builds the capacity of after school leaders, teens and parents to be competent science learners and facilitators and to connect science centers, parents and libraries in support of the science learning and achievement of children. Project features include a workshop model for families with K-4 children, enrichment sessions for after school students, family events at the museum, professional development for library and after school youth staff, and a national expansion conference. The conference introduces the project to potential national implementation sites. Case studies of sites from this conference inform a research study investigating the obstacles, modifications and necessary support to initiate and sustain the program model. The formative and summative evaluation measure the impact of this program on children, parents, librarians, and teen workers at the libraries.  Fifty-three Philadelphia libraries in addition to libraries in three cities selected from the implementation conference have a direct program impact on 10,000 people nationally, including 300 after school facilitators and children's librarians.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ LEAP into Science began in 2007 as a museum-library partnership between The Franklin Institute and the Free Library of Philadelphia designed to engage underserved children and families in science and literacy learning by connecting hands-on science activities with childrenÆs books. The program aims to build the capacity of library, museum, and afterschool educators to engage communities in science and literacy through high-quality curriculum and professional development resources.  LEAP into Science curricula consists of 12 afterschool workshops, 6 family workshops, bookmarks, and book lists on a variety of themes including balance, wind, water, light, shadows, habitats, evidence vs. inference, measurement, and more.  These workshops are designed to be open-ended in nature, to encourage children and families to observe, explore, and investigate the world around them (see Science and Literacy figure).  LEAP into Science aims to give children, families, and facilitators the opportunity to feel like a scientist in familiar community-based settings (see Program Model figure).  From 2007-2011, LEAP into Science was offered in 53 branches of the Free Library of Philadelphia through their free afterschool drop-in program, as well as during evening and weekend programming.  In 2011, LEAP into Science expanded to 10 cities nationwide to explore the ways in which the programÆs curricular and professional development resources could be used to engage a wider audience of children, families, educators, and institutions across the US (see map of expansion sites).  Each of these sites consists of 2-3 institutional partners, creating a network of 27 diverse organizations around the country including science centers, childrenÆs museums, public libraries, statewide afterschool networks, school districts, universities, and public television stations. This group of national partners convenes monthly to discuss strategies for engaging communities in science and literacy, creating a robust network of institutions committed to broadly implementing and sustaining the program. LEAP into Science has reached nearly 40,000 nationally.   Evaluation efforts measured the impact on facilitators who were being trained in using LEAP into Science curriculum to engage children and families in hands-on science and literacy learning.  As a result of participating in LEAP into Science, facilitators from libraries and afterschool settings across the national cohort demonstrated significant increases in their general interest in science, leisure interest in science, enjoyment of science teaching, and beliefs about both science teaching efficacy and teaching science as inquiry (see table below).  While facilitators from participating science centers and childrenÆs museums did not show significant gains in interest, enjoyment and self-efficacy, there was significant increase in their beliefs about teaching science as inquiry,  The program also aimed to document the ways in which expansion sites used LEAP into Science, how the program impacted participating institutions, and the greatest successes and challenges in implementing LEAP into Science.  Results showed that expansion sites extensively used the program resources, primarily through afterschool programming using both science and literacy components.  Curriculum resources were adapted to meet the needs of different audiences, including blending concepts or activities across multiple workshops, stretching or modifying existing activities by adding new activities or books, and shortening or simplifying existing activities to fit the needs of younger audiences. Participating institutions reported impacts of continued and/or expanded science programming, strengthened partnerships and/or relationships with other organizations, and enhanced staff capacity in the areas of STEM and science literacy.  The greatest successes of the program as reported by expansion partners included the program curriculum resources, the fle...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
