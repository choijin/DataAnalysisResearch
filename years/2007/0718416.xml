<AbstractNarration>In birds, as in humans, young sometimes remain at home with their parents long after the usual age of independence.  In human agricultural societies, it is usually males, particularly first-born sons, that remain at home and the extent of family wealth, measured as farmland, is a key factor. Males also tend to be the gender that stays home in birds and this leads to a variety of interesting consequences, including cooperative breeding, where sons provide aid by feeding chicks in their parents' nest, or less obvious social behaviors such as communal roosting, cooperative defense of the territory, and food-sharing by family members.  Like humans, western bluebirds ?own? land in the form of defended territories with mistletoe, which provides a continuous supply of berries over the winter.   Like farmers, the bluebirds ?plant? the seeds of mistletoe by passing the berries through their guts, leaving the seeds still viable and surrounded by a sticky coating that helps them to adhere to limbs and grow.  Western bluebird sons and some daughters tend to stay home with their parents during their first year of life.  When mistletoe abundance was reduced by half, fewer sons stayed home, suggesting that in western bluebirds, as in humans, wealth plays a role in delayed dispersal.  The current work will determine whether parental favoritism also provides advantages to sons staying at home and whether in staying, sons incur fitness costs in the form of increased competition with relatives, genetic costs of reduced offspring viability due to incest, and reduced mate availability due to incest avoidance.  Studying these factors will complete the picture of delayed dispersal for western bluebirds and help tease apart which is more important to sons staying home ? resources or the increased access to those resources that comes from living with nepotistic parents.  It will also establish the extent to which mistletoe is a keystone resource that is critical for western bluebird conservation.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Biologists and anthropologists have long sought to understand how animals become social and the role that kin relationships and living in groups plays in survival and reproduction in species ranging from ants to humans.  This grant focused on how western bluebirds become social, which means wintering in family groups, having sons stay nearby, and thus living in kin neighborhoods where male offspring maintain connections to their family and natal territory for life.  As for 19th century farmers living in Massachusetts, wealth plays an important role in the delayed and localized dispersal of sons.  When parents have large holdings of oak mistletoe, sons tend to stay home for winter and are more likely, having done so, to disperse nearby.  This localized dispersal allows sons to go home and help their parents raise young in the event that they are unable to breed. But not all parents can afford to share with sons and nonparents shouldn't share at all.  We found that having parents present was also critically important to the dispersal decisions of sons, so it's not just sons with wealthy parents that stay home, but sons with surviving wealthy parents.  The way that bluebirds space their territories in winter means that sons staying on wealthy territories almost always survive to their first spring.  In other words, the mistletoe-dependent dispersal mechanism that leads sons to stay home is based, not on variation among territories and decisions to trade up in territory quality, but instead is a mechanism to keep enough sons in habitat where their prospects for survival are extremely high, releasing sons to the uncertainties associated with long distance dispersal only when their local prospects are poor. Evidence that parents are also critical to sons' staying home is evidence for the importance of kinship to concession of resources; this is further supported by our finding that about 80% of the mistletoe that locally dispersing sons have on their own territories comes from their parents, which is analogous to sons budding off a portion of the family farm.  Analyses are underway to examine the lifetime consequences of resource wealth and localized dispersal of sons.   This work provided new insights into the fitness consequences of a major factor (local dispersal) leading to cooperative family life, and also provided new insights into the tensions between cooperation and competition when animals live in kin neighborhoods. Based on new mathematical models, male competition for fertilizations in kin neighborhoods creates hidden benefits of clustering territories in socially monogamous species with extrapair fertilizations, especially for males living in kin neighborhoods.  This grant supported the training of two postdoctoral associates, one graduate student, 14 postgraduate interns, and 8 REU undergraduates, including one minority student.  Several publications featured undergraduates as coauthors. The research provides ecological information crucial to understanding the effects of removal of oak woodland for vineyards on western bluebirds, indicating that clearcutting likely leads to disruption of complex life history traits that influence demography and social behavior.  It also provided important data and research insights used to augment the learning content in the national nesting biology citizen science project, NestWatch.org.
