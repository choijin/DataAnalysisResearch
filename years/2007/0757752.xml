<AbstractNarration>Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) has been a very active field in recent years. Two&lt;br/&gt;theoretical techniques, S-matrix theory and effective field theory, allow the systematic&lt;br/&gt;treatment of many-electron systems, with the former being most useful for highly&lt;br/&gt;charged ions and the latter for neutral, few-electon atoms.&lt;br/&gt;Given the success of the theory, another important direction the field is going in is the&lt;br/&gt;use of the high precision of both experiment and QED theory to make atoms testing&lt;br/&gt;grounds for non-QED physics. The most striking use has been parity nonconservation&lt;br/&gt;(PNC) in heavy atoms, and another important use is in nuclear physics.&lt;br/&gt;A first major focus of this research will be in the fine structure of helium as a way of&lt;br/&gt;determining the fine structure constant. The extreme complexity of the electron g-2&lt;br/&gt;approach, recently shown by an error found in Kinoshita?s calculations, indicates the&lt;br/&gt;value of an alternative approach. Independent checks of a recent calculation of&lt;br/&gt;Pachucki are proposed.&lt;br/&gt;A second focus will involve research on highly charged ions, continuing a long standing&lt;br/&gt;collaboration with K.T. Cheng of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Completion&lt;br/&gt;of calculations of the spectra of sodiumlike ions along with extension to copperlike ions&lt;br/&gt;is proposed. Hyperfine splitting in highly charged ions will also be studied.&lt;br/&gt;A third research area is recoil corrections. The treatment of recoil in a highly relativistic&lt;br/&gt;system has been treated only by one other group. G. Adkins and I have been working&lt;br/&gt;on an independent approach to the problem, and continuation of this research is&lt;br/&gt;proposed. Another use of recoil techniques is in the treatment of photon-Z boson&lt;br/&gt;exchange diagrams, which have a binding singularity that has not yet been evaluated in&lt;br/&gt;a Bethe-Salpeter framework.&lt;br/&gt;A final goal, with broader impact, is writing a textbook on bound state quantum field&lt;br/&gt;theory. Most of the techniques used in the research described above have not yet been&lt;br/&gt;well described in textbook form, and doing this, along with giving a much needed update&lt;br/&gt;of Bethe and Salpeter's monograph, is the intention of this work.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit   Research was carried out which leads to understanding and control of the dynamics of atomic and molecular systems, including electrons escaping from atoms, trapped atoms, ultracold gases, and molecules.  These systems obey the laws of quantum mechanics, which are abstract and sometimes counterintuitive.  The methods we use are called "semiclassical";   this means that we use classical mechanics (NewtonÆs Laws), and incorporate just enough quantum theory to get an accurate description of the behavior of atomic systems.  Our methods are more intuitive than quantum theory, they are often far more efficient and effective, and they take advantage of the new knowledge and the insights that arise from modern classical mechanics.  Our work is unusual, and appreciated by the scientific community in the US, because these semiclassical methods are often used in Europe and China, but are not so commonly used here.   We have used these methods to describe the structure of highly-excited bound states of atoms in strong  electric and magnetic fields, escape of electrons from atoms in electric and magnetic fields, escape of particles or waves from a vase-shaped enclosure, and to describe transport of ultracold atoms from one reservoir to another.  Our calculations support experimental measurements being carried out in Lyon, France, in Minnesota, and new experimental measurements being set up by a young faculty member at William and Mary.   Twelve papers were published in front-line journals, and several more are being prepared.  Two students completed PhDÆs, two more are progressing toward a PhD, and several undergraduates also contributed to the research.   Broader Implications  Control of quantum systems is one of the "grand challenges" of modern physics. This research cuts across many disciplines in physics, mathematics and chemistry. Our study of ionization of atoms in fields is directly connected to theories of chaotic transport and theories of stability of dynamical systems. The general outline of the theory was first developed by Poincare to study the gravitational three-body problem (moon-earth-sun or earth-Jupiter-sun).  This type of theory is used to design spacecraft trajectories, examine orbits of comets, and study transport of meteors from Mars to the Earth. In chemistry, unimolecular reactions occur through the breakup of a highly excited state of a molecule, and bimolecular reactions often occur through an unstable collision complex, a "transition state". The modern dynamical version of transition-state theory is directly connected with the theory of chaotic transport. The systems we study provide valuable models: they have only a few degrees of freedom, the interparticle forces are known and controllable, and precise measurements can be made.     This research is also connected to technology. The mechanisms of escape of electrons from atoms should be similar to the mechanisms of escape of electrons from nanojunctions ("designer atoms") and similar to the mechanisms of escape of photons from optical resonators. Also high-Rydberg states of atoms can be used for infrared detectors, and the ionization process we are studying has been used to make a fast streak camera.   The field of nonlinear dynamics is excellent for introducing students to research. As soon as students learn elementary aspects of NewtonÆs Laws, they can begin computing trajectories, and analyzing their structure.  Finally, the PI uses the knowledge gained from years of research in nonlinear dynamics to help advance another project (not supported by NSF): monitoring the health of infants in neonatal intensive care units by using nonlinear dynamics to analyze patterns in their heart rates and respiration.
