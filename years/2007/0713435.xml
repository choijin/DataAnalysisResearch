    <AbstractNarration>Collaborative Proposal pair: 0713435 (Lead) &amp; 0713148&lt;br/&gt;"Collaborative: RI: Feature Discovery and Benchmarks for exportable Reinforcement Learning"&lt;br/&gt;PI: Ronald Parr, Duke University&lt;br/&gt;PI: Michael L. Littman, Rutgers University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on several aspects of automated feature discovery in the context of reinforcement learning. Badly chosen features cause reinforcement-learning algorithms to fail and, as such, only individuals skilled in feature construction can create successful reinforcement-learning systems for novel tasks. This issue underscores two shortcomings in existing research. First, most existing reinforcement-learning methods cannot generate or discover features automatically and robustly. Second, existing benchmark problems and paradigms for benchmarking do not distinguish adequately between clever algorithm design and clever feature engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses these challenges in two-pronged approach. The first prong aims to advance a technical agenda leading to a new approach to feature discovery and model representation. The second prong is the development of a benchmark methodology and repository with a different focus and structure from existing endeavors. The goal for the benchmarking effort will be to produce a set of fair and reproducible experiments that will help elucidate the strengths and weaknesses of existing approaches, while simultaneously introducing challenges to motivate the development of new approaches.</AbstractNarration>
