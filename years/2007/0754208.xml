<AbstractNarration>Cutkosky will investigate four projects: toroidalization, local monomialization and ramification&lt;br/&gt; of surfaces in positive characteristic, asymptotic properties of powers of ideals and semigroups&lt;br/&gt; of valuations on local rings.  In toroidalization, the  main conjecture is to show that any dominant morphism&lt;br/&gt;of varieties can be made into a toroidal mapping, or a local monomial mapping, by blowing up nonsingular&lt;br/&gt; subvarieties in the domain and range. Cutkosky will extend his recent work proving the conjecture for 3-folds,&lt;br/&gt;towards a general proof of the conjecture. On the problem of ramification in positive characteristic,&lt;br/&gt;the proposer has found with Oliver Piltant stable forms of mappings between germs of characteristic p surfaces.&lt;br/&gt;Cutkosky proposes to refine the formulation of  these forms, and apply them to a study of ramification of maps&lt;br/&gt; of surfaces in characteristic p. Cutkosky will continue his work on computing asymptotic properties of Hilbert &lt;br/&gt;type functions on functors of powers of ideals. Cutkosky also seeks to understand the semigroups which can&lt;br/&gt;occur as the value semigroup of a (possible noetherian) valuation dominating a noetherian local domain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Algebra is of increasing importance in modern science and technology. Cutkosky will  investigate&lt;br/&gt;several problems of theoretical importance in the general area of Commutative Algebra and Algebraic Geometry.&lt;br/&gt;The main objective is to understand the structure of polynomial mappings, and  systems of &lt;br/&gt;polynomial equations. Cutkosky  will   train undergraduate and graduate students, and  mentor young&lt;br/&gt; researchers through this project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This research was in the mathematical subfields of algebraic geometry and commutative algebra. I will list some areas in which I made progess, and the results were published.      I found a simple and readily accessible proof of resolution of singularities in dimension three, over fields of positive characteristic larger than 5. This is the process of smoothing out corners in a three dimensional space. I also greatly simplified an earlier work of mine on monomialization of morphisms of three dimensional varieties. This is the process of making a mapping between two algebraic spaces as simple as possible.   I also made progress on the classification of semigroups realized by valuations on local rings. This helps us understand the nature of a singularity, and the process of resolving singularities, especially in postive characteristic. Some of this work was done with graduate students working with me toward a Ph.D, and with former graduate students and Post Docs.  Recently I have been able to compute some limits under surprisingly general situations, which give information about the types of singularities, and the volume of linebundles giving mappings of algebraic varieties. In fact, I am able to give very simple necessary and sufficient conditions for such limits to always exist on a particular ring or variety.
