<AbstractNarration>Proposal Number: CTS-0553906&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Zahn, Jeffrey&lt;br/&gt;Affiliation:   Pennsylvania State University&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title:  Electrohydrodynamic Instability Micromixing Within Two Phase Microfluidic Systems for Biological Purification Technology&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project proposes to study organic-aqueous two phase microflows, and create an autonomous device capable of performing liquid-liquid extraction techniques for biological sample purification.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work will extend the current understanding and manipulation of multiphase flows in microgeometries through experimental, analytical and computational approaches. Two phase flow behavior  will be studied using a fluorescent dye localization technique and microPIV. The flow is destabilized by an electrohydrodynamic (EHD) instability to enhance mixing of the two phases to increase the surface area over which liquid extraction may occur, monitored by a novel sideview microPIV technique for three dimensional profile reconstruction. The proposal will experimentally study the flow behavior of the two phase system and EHD mixing and will compare the results to analytical and computational analysis. The modeling of EHD instabilities by computational modeling will also be extended.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The problem is multidisciplinary, bringing together tools from engineering and biology to attack a problem that is crucial for any future applications involving on-chip sample preparations. This work integrates interdisciplinary technologies and investigates a powerful approach to DNA extraction that has received little or no attention to date. This technique will enable sample preparation for highly integrated genetic screening diagnostics. Controlling two-phase mixing is a key hurdle for any future application that uses a liquid extraction separation procedure for sample purification prior to analysis. This technique holds major promise to enabling on-site biological sample collection and analysis for areas as disparate as medical genetic testing, high throughput DNA sequencing, biowarfare agent detection, and water quality monitoring. Special emphasis will be placed on educational outreach to under-represented groups in college level science education. These activities will enhance fundamental knowledge in the emerging field of BioMEMS and nanobiotechnology as well as train young scientists, engineers and educators in the area. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
