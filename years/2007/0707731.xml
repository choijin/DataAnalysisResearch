<AbstractNarration>AST-0707731&lt;br/&gt;Spergel&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is an international collaboration between Princeton University and Institut d'Estudis Espacials de Catalunya (Barcelona, Spain) to develop statistical tools to analyze data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), an NSF-funded telescope in the Atacama Desert of Chile.  The techniques, although tuned to the ACT data, will be useful for analyzing any high-resolution Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) experiment.  The first measurements made with these tools will be the power spectrum of temperature fluctuations in the microwave background, and mass fluctuations along the line-of-sight.  By combining simulations and analytical theory, the research group will compute the full covariance matrix and its inverse, and compute the likelihood of the observed values for diverse cosmological models.  Applying these techniques to the ACT data will improve measurements of the mass density of the Universe, the density of atoms, the properties of the dark energy, and the properties of the neutrino.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Measuring dark energy and dark matter provides insight into fundamental physics and the fate of the universe.  Measuring CMB fluctuations and the growth of structure opens a window to the earliest moments of the big bang.  These results will likely be of broad popular interest, even as this research trains undergraduate and graduate students in widely applicable statistical techniques, and engages them in a substantive international collaboration.  Releasing the user friendly likelihood software along with the data will help a broad group of cosmologists, astrophysicists, and particle physicists.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This proposal supported the development of novel techniques for the analysis and interpretation of cosmic microwave background  (CMB) data.  We developed techniques for simulating the microwave background signal from clusters, radio sources and dusty galaxies and the effects of gravitational lensing on the cosmic microwave background.  Using these techniques, we analyzed data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope and had several novel and exciting results:  -       a precision measurement of the CMB power spectrum which yielded the most precise estimates of the age and composition of the universe  -       the first detection of the gravitational lensing of the cosmic microwave background.  As we showed, this amplitude of this signal (when combined with CMB power spectrum measurements), implies the  existence of dark energy.  -       the first detection of the signal from hot gas in galaxies group of masses less than 100 trillion solar masses through the "Sunyaev-Zeldovich" effect.  This analysis was led by Nick Hand, a Princeton undergraduate supported by this grant.  -       the first detection of the correlation between the millimeter sky and the submillimeter sources seen in the BLAST data.  These sources are young galaxies and their emission traces the star formation history of the universe.     This grant supported the training of several graduate students, undergraduates and postdoctoral fellows.  The scientists supported by this grant communicated these results through scientific articles, popular talks and appearances on TV shows about cosmology.
