<AbstractNarration>Florida A&amp;M University proposes to serve as the institutional host-site for the&lt;br/&gt;Florida - Georgia Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (FGLSAMP) during&lt;br/&gt;Phase IV program operations. FGLSAMP is designed to promote and facilitate the&lt;br/&gt;programmatic goals of the National Science Foundation's (NSF) LSAMP program under&lt;br/&gt;the HRD Directorate. In accordance with the goals, objectives and effort of NSF to&lt;br/&gt;address the low participation and degree production within science, technology,&lt;br/&gt;engineering, and mathematics (STEM) by those ethnic groups identified as&lt;br/&gt;underrepresented in STEM disciplines, FGLSAMP will address this problem through its&lt;br/&gt;programmatic structure which promotes enhancement of academic performance,&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate research experiences, professional development, and preparation for&lt;br/&gt;pursuing STEM graduate degrees. The standard of success will be measured by our&lt;br/&gt;student participants': progression (to attain the B.S. degree); retention (within STEM&lt;br/&gt;disciplines); graduation (timely attainment); and STEM graduate enrollment&lt;br/&gt;(increasing STEM Minority enrollment). FGLSAMP will continue to employ a holistic&lt;br/&gt;approach to reform undergraduate education in the STEM disciplines along with&lt;br/&gt;identified "beast practices" as determined through it Steering Committee, while&lt;br/&gt;determining means to enhance and provide new program activities. FGLSAMP is&lt;br/&gt;designed to include a firm commitment of institutional administrators, faculty, staff,&lt;br/&gt;external partners, as well as parents and students.&lt;br/&gt;The goals of FGLSAMP are to significantly increase both the number of&lt;br/&gt;underrepresented minorities pursuing undergraduate degrees in STEM disciplines and the&lt;br/&gt;number of STEM B.S. degree recipients pursuing STEM graduate degrees. FGLSAMP&lt;br/&gt;will provide training opportunities to students in STEM disciplines while also providing&lt;br/&gt;an array of academic performance enhancement and support that will yield greater STEM&lt;br/&gt;retention and graduations rates among underrepresented STEM minorities. Additionally,&lt;br/&gt;to address the numbers of STEM B.S. recipients pursuing STEM graduate degrees,&lt;br/&gt;FGLSAMP has developed a formalize program component to prepare its undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;participants to pursue graduate degrees. This will be accomplished through an intensive&lt;br/&gt;programmatic design that has been accepted and adopted by the FGLSAMP Steering&lt;br/&gt;Committee. FGLSAMP will continue provide assistance for undergraduate research&lt;br/&gt;experiences that will include the introduction of international research opportunities for&lt;br/&gt;student participants. FGLSAMP will also continue to build and strengthen ties and&lt;br/&gt;inclusion of community colleges by the inclusion of 2 new associate level partners within&lt;br/&gt;the alliance. Community Colleges are a valuable source of human capital to enter the&lt;br/&gt;STEM academic pipeline.&lt;br/&gt;FGLSAMP program operations will be met through annual financial support from the&lt;br/&gt;National Science Foundation, a special appropriation from the State of Florida.&lt;br/&gt;Through the addition of two additional community colleges, FGLSAMP will be&lt;br/&gt;able to: 1) stimulate and increase student awareness of academic and professional&lt;br/&gt;opportunities in STEM areas and 2) create a larger network/pipeline between the&lt;br/&gt;community college students and FGLSAMP undergraduate institutions with which these&lt;br/&gt;two community colleges are affiliated. FGLSAMP will also capitalize and capture&lt;br/&gt;greater numbers of potential STEM majors prior to graduation and transfer to the upper&lt;br/&gt;division.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

Through employing a cohort based approach FGLSAMP is able to significantly address one of the leading  contributors of attrition within STEM&hellip;feeling of isolation by students.        Summary of Program Impact  After  20 years FGLSAMP continues to be viable and positively impacting and  enhancing efforts by institutions higher education (IHE) within the  alliance to better promote, recruit and prepare students for STEM  graduate study and careers with STEM organizations. The full impact of  FGLSAMP is most visible as a program that impacts and influences a  larger STEM community via:  Impact upon      STEM Recruitment, Retention, and Graduation rates within each alliances      IHE  Impact upon participation institutions of      higher education Impact upon      STEM graduate enrollment among underrepresented minorities Impact upon      internal and external partners/stakeholders Impact upon      the student participants of FGLSAMP   Utilizing  the organizational structure of an alliance allows the FGLSAMP program  greater scope and potential to address, impact, and influence identified  obstacles and challenges in the pursuit of not only increasing the  number of degrees awarded to underrepresented minorities in STEM  disciplines in a strategically unified manner. The alliance can also  build what can be consider a "learning community" of IHEs with one  mission, by which each institution learns from the commonalities and  differences of partner institutions.    The  alliance structure also allows for greater continuity and communication  that are of great value when student participants are transitioning  from one academic level to a higher level. A sense of community has  developed between the allianceÆs institutions and thus a productive  pipeline of student support and student opportunities has been the  culminating result of the alliance network.  In  addition to the organizational structure of the alliance is due to that  fact that FGLSAMP focuses on a broad spectrum of STEM disciplines. This  broad focus gives FGLSAMP the opportunity to impact the STEM culture of  each participating institution.            To gain a greater understanding of program effectiveness of upon retention and graduation rates , 4 alliance institutions (Florida A&amp;M University, Albany State University, Bethune-Cookman University, and Florida International University) have been designated  as primarily undergraduate degree producing institutions (due to the large number of students supported by FGLSAMP) in an effort to capture the impact of  the FGLSAMP Model upon the following areas:      Institution    Progression-   within academic continuum    Persistence   to the baccalaureate degree    Persistence   in STEM disciplines      ASU    92%    94%    87%      BCU    87%    90%    83%      FAMU    91%    93%    88%      FIU    88%    90%    86%      We attribute the high retention and graduation rates to the holistic approach of the FGLSAMP project.
