<AbstractNarration>This project represents a novel approach (Application-Based Service Learning, ABSL) to STEM education, an approach that uses service learning and community based problems to teach students modern scientific methods and to enhance their involvement in and understanding of scientific concepts as well as provide a service to the community.  Through projects in a variety of courses, a unique combination of PIs, a veterinarian, microbiologist, and animal behaviorist/forensic scientist, are helping undergraduate students investigate the environmental impacts, social hierarchies, disease transmission, and public health risks of feral cats in the Pittsburgh area. The techniques involved include DNA extraction, PCR, cloning, DNA sequencing, genotyping, gel electrophoresis.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Students learn about the specific community problem being studied in the service portion of the class. They then conduct novel research in laboratory classes or carry out specific projects in lecture based classes to help solve or understand the biology of the community problem. The project completes the integration of ABSL into the Biology curriculum in multiple courses at Duquesne University. The model has been successfully piloted in several classes by the PIs since January 2006, leading to some confidence in its intellectual potential. Assessment is being conducted via pre and post testing and longitudinal study of the students involved compared to students not engaged in the ABSL courses, thus adding information concerning application of this method to the knowledge base in undergraduate education in the biological sciences.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  The project is resulting in development of the ABSL pilot model to make it more generally applicable to a variety of biology courses and to the gathering of materials for a manual describing effective techniques for ABSL and an open source web-site, disseminating the manual and other information generated by the students.  In addition other institutions (Lehigh Carbon Community College, La Roche University and National Aviary in Pittsburgh) are being introduced to ABSL by their participation as partners in this project.  Due to its real world significance, the project appeals to students that may not otherwise participate in a research project. In addition, the project enhances infrastructure at several levels. Students from multiple courses are interacting, including non-science majors with diverse backgrounds. This provides opportunities for sharing different knowledge bases and skill sets. The networking occurring between multiple departments and universities strengthens interdisciplinary education and leads to greater enhancement of STEM teaching and learning. The community partnerships being developed are generating opportunities for students to gain a better sense of social responsibility and accountability and to obtain first hand knowledge on how to go about solving a community problem. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
