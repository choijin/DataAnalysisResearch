    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I research develops a novel bioprocess platform for the synthesis of toxic enzymes as inactive pro-enzymes in bacteria that can subsequently be activated via simple pH and/or temperature shifts. Recombinant enzymes for industrial synthetic applications or pharmacologic replacement therapies can be very difficult and expensive to produce in large quantities in an active form because they are toxic to the host, self-inactivate, or both. Numerous proteases, digestive enzymes, and cross-linking enzymes that break down or build up macromolecular complexes with high commercial potential are all but impossible to isolate in active form. The company proposes to use the catalytic core of the human transglutaminase 1 enzyme (TG1) to prove the concept. This research could have a direct impact on patients suffering from a severe form of ?scaly skin? disease, known as lamellar icthyosis, who have a defect in their TG1 gene.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this research are development of novel biomaterials and/or processes for several industries, including biotechnology, food processing, cosmetics and skin care (non-pharmacologic), detergents, and possibly waste remediation. Recombinant transglutaminases will specifically enable the development of novel types of biopolymers and materials. The research with TG1 could have a broader impact in the biomedical industry because it may lead to the development of a TG1-based ?liquid bandage? product for use in treatment of wounds, burns and cosmetic/reconstructive surgeries.</AbstractNarration>
