<AbstractNarration>This workshop concerns New Research Directions in Composition and Systems Technology for High Confidence Cyber Physical Systems, held in the Westin Gateway Hotel in Arlington, VAm on July 9th and 10th, 2007.  The workshop is a follow-on to earlier planning workshops held in July and November 2006.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cyber-physical systems are deeply embedded complex systems, in which interacting physical components are controlled by real-time networked control software at all levels and scales.  Physical components are designed to afford highly-interactive control of their operation, and cyber components must support both timed and high-rate reactive interaction and response.  Both the continuous and discrete behavior of these systems must be accommodated through nonlinear control, computation, communication, and resource management strategies for continually interacting components and subsystems.  These technologies are central to progress for U.S. industrial progress in sectors such as medical and health care technology, automotive systems, aviation, energy, and environmental control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main purpose of this workshop is to assess research needs and promising technical approaches pertaining to restructuring current systems technology that will enable us to derive the high confidence software platforms needed for cyber physical systems (CPS). The goal is to provide a sound, practical technological base for deeply integrating the cyber and physical aspects of future certifiably dependable engineered systems. The workshop will produce documentation which will be delivered in the form of a final report to help shape national research investments in HCSS-related systems and assurance technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These workshops are designed to support the objectives of the National Coordination Office (NCO) for Networking and Information Technology Research and Development (NITR&amp;D) Subcommittee and the High Confidence Software and Systems (HCSS) Coordinating Group.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
