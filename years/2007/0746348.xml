<AbstractNarration>Video games have been heralded as models of technology-enhanced learning environments as they exemplify many of the ideas emerging from contemporary learning sciences research. In particular, such games promote learning through goal-directed action in simulated environments, through producing as well as consuming information, embedded assessments, and through participation in self-organizing learning systems. Research suggests that participation in such environments involves many forms of scientific thinking and may lead to increased civic engagement, although to date, there are few examples of game-based learning environments that capitalize on these affordances.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will investigate the potential of online role playing games for scientific literacy through the iterative design and research of Saving Lake Wingra, an online role playing game around a controversial development project in an urban area. Saving Lake Wingra positions players as ecologists, department of natural resources officials, or journalists investigating a rash of health problems at a local lake, and then creating and debating solutions. Players will solve challenges within an interactive, simulated lake ecosystem as they attempt to save the lake, working for one of several constituencies. This design-based research project will span the full life cycle of a project, from case studies of learning in small, constrained settings to controlled experimental studies of games implemented across classrooms. In addition to asking if participation in scientific role-playing games can produce robust conceptual understandings, it will also examine if role playing games might serve as assessment tools for comprehending scientific texts, assessing conceptual understandings within scientific domains, and designing innovative solutions to environmental problems that draw upon scientific understandings. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The education plan includes the production of game-based media that can be used to support a variety of research studies, an online professional development community of educators using games for learning, support for graduate students trained in game theory, the learning sciences, and new forms of assessment, and new courses in game-based learning and assessment.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ CAREER: Scientific Role-Playing Games for 21st-Century Citizenship   The goal of Scientific Role-Playing Games for 21st-Century Citizenship was to develop and research the potential of role-playing games to improve scientific citizenship. The project has supported the creation of:  (1)  A free, online game Citizen Science, which has been played by thousands of students and is currently distributed through including BrainPOP;  (2)  Research studies, including 4 dissertations, 2 books, 7 articles and book chapters, and dozens of scholarly presentations;  (3)  A network of educators using games (including Citizen Science) for improving language and literacy instruction, inside and outside of the classroom.  (1) Citizen Science  Citizen Science is a Role Playing Game in which the player is a youth who alters the future of the Lake Mendota ecosystem in the Madison, Wisconsin area. The player begins stationed on a pier overlooking Lake Mendota and sees their father approaching with their family dog. Just before the dog jumps in, the player sees that it is a blue-green algae day, and the dog is at risk for ingesting Cyanobacteria, which can be fatal. Armed with this information, the player uses an argumentation tool to convince father not to allow the dog to swim.  This basic cycle &ndash; develop hypotheses, gather evidence, argue with evidence -- constitutes Citizen ScienceÆs core game cycle. The two hour game is an investigation of the LakeÆs health, which includes observing the shoreline, using authentic embedded virtual tools, running experiments on a simulated lake model to explore courses of action, and making arguments about Lake conditions. Players meet farmers, swimmers, boaters, and a muskrat to learn about the LakeÆs multiple uses and ways to manage it effectively. The central ideas and models were developed in conjunction with the University of Wisconsin Center for Limnology.  The game narrative (as reported in Blakesley, 2012) is the result of extensive design, user testing, and experimentation. The narrative events are tailored for students ages 8-12 and were developed through research with hundreds of students (Gaydos &amp; Squire, 2010a, 2010b).

The project has led to ongoing collaborations on follow-up games that are entering the marketplace and when used together, constitute an ecological curriculum for late elementary and middle school science.  (2) Research studies on Citizen Science (which are ongoing) have supported the development of Citizen Science, researched its efficacy across settings, and explored its potential to lead to broader change in educator practice, including:  New models for designing learning games based on academic content (Gaydos &amp; Squire, 2010a, 2010b);  Models for integrating narrative and games (Blakesley, 2012); Models of scientific citizenship (Squire &amp; Gaydos, 2013); Expert novice studies demonstrating Citizen ScienceÆs capacity to produce scientific thinking (Gaydos &amp; Squire, 2012);  Research studies demonstrating the efficacy of learning games (Gaydos, 2013); Research studies gamesÆ efficacy for promoting preparation for future learning (Gaydos &amp; Squire, in press); Case studies examining its use in well supported classrooms (Rothschild &amp; Squire, in preparation); Studies identifying the challenges and barriers to broad adoption (Gaydos, 2013).   The centerpiece study for Citizen Science was Matthew GaydosÆs dissertation investigating a series of curricular enactments with Citizen Science. Gaydos studied an experiment with Citizen Science in which students either read texts about lake ecology or played Citizen Science, finding learning gains for both groups, but increased scores for students in the g...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
