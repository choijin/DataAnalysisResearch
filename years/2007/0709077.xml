<AbstractNarration>Proposal #: CNS07-09077&lt;br/&gt;PI(s):          Kiesler, Sara B.  &lt;br/&gt;Institution: Carnegie Mellon University     &lt;br/&gt;  Pittsburgh, PA 15213-3890&lt;br/&gt;Title:   IAD: Laboratory for Research in Human-Robot Interaction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project Proposed:&lt;br/&gt;This project, developing a new generation of social robots for studies in human-robot interaction, aims at creating robots and modular robotics kits to be used to study robot social behavior, mutual understanding in human-robot communication, and the impact of assistants in group dynamics. The research involves understanding and testing theories of how these three aspects of human-robot interaction independently and interactively affect collaborative work and investigating how assistive robots can be designed best to aid people in domains such as health and aging. Designed to motivate and test theories, the work studies &lt;br/&gt;. Fundamental laboratory research on behavioral characteristics of robots performing social tasks, especially as these characteristics reflect likeness;&lt;br/&gt;. Controlled experiments and field studies of interpersonal communication and development of mutual understanding between robot and human, and&lt;br/&gt;. Robots in work groups.&lt;br/&gt;Aiming to better understand the societal impact of robots, a multidisciplinary team (robotics, computer science, social psychology, engineering, organization science, design) draws from and builds on basic research in cognitive and social psychology, and on recent research in robotics, computer graphics, and design. The team seeks a foundation for understanding and designing collaborative work with robots in critical environments like mines, hospitals, households with elderly or disabled residents, in challenging scientific settings and in situations in which the robot is remote.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This development contributes to public and student awareness of the human side of robotics. A life-size robot will be taken to school for educational purposes.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
