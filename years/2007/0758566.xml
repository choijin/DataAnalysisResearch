<AbstractNarration>This award establishes the Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) for Autonomic Computing at the University of Florida, University of Arizona and Rutgers University.  The I/UCRC will focus on multi university research on improving the design and engineering systems that are capable of funning themselves, adapting their resources and operations to current workloads and anticipating the needs of their users.  The center will work on improving hardware, networks and storage, middleware, service and information layers used by modern industry.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research performed at this center is important for U.S. industry to help maintain its lead in the information technology field.  This I/UCRC will have a broad impact on the participating students and faculty through involvement with the industrial members.  This center has the potential to develop new knowledge in this area that will increase US industrial competitiveness.</AbstractNarration>
