<AbstractNarration>With support from the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division, Professors Diana Aga, Jochen Autschbach, and Frank Bright of the University at Buffalo are developing stable and highly selective molecularly imprinted xerogel sorbents for clean-up and pre-concentration of environmental samples for analysis.  Synthesis and selection of sorbents with high selectivity and affinity is based on a high-throughput combinatorial production and screening approach, augmented by ab-initio and semiempirical quantum chemical computations.  The work includes fundamental studies of the environmental fate of residues of pharmaceutical contaminants in soil using a combination of mass spectrometric techniques and 14C-labeled tracers.  Results from this research will improve analytical capabilities for accurately identifying and quantifying unknown antibiotic degradates in the environment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results from these studies will provide decision makers with information to accurately assess and, if necessary, mitigate aquatic and human exposure to other pharmaceutical contaminants.  Further, this project will provide unique research experiences to graduate and undergraduate students because they will be exposed to various aspects of quantitative and qualitative analysis, theoretical chemistry, and issues in environmental chemistry, government regulations, and agricultural sciences. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

The proposed research focuses on tetracyclines (TCs) and sulfonamides (SAs), two of the most widely used classes of antibiotics in the animal industry. The overall goal of this research is to determine the identities and leaching potential of degradation products of two widely used veterinary antibiotics, chlortetracycline (tetracycline class) and sulfamethazine (sulfonamide class) in soil. The specific objectives are:  Develop highly stable, class-selective molecularly imprinted      xerogels (MIXs) as sorbents for isolating residues of antibiotics and      their degradates in soil Determine the persistence of TCs and SAs in soil and identify      structurally-related degradates isolated by MIXs using mass spectrometric      techniques Evaluate the soil mobility of the antibiotic degradates relative      to the parent antibiotics    Intellectual Merit: We demonstrated the feasibility of synthesizing tailored MIXs to simultaneously isolate structurally similar compounds. We showed that by using theoretical calculations, the synthesis of MIXs can be guided by focusing on template molecules that have strong interactions with MIXs. We have evaluated MIX-based sorbents for binding tetracyclines. Theoretical modeling of the tetracycline&ndash;silane interactions energies were able to confirm the precursor that yielded the best performing molecularly imprinted xerogels.  In this study we demonstrated that it is possible to use theoretical calculations to guide the synthesis of selective MIX rather than to conduct arbitrary combinatorial search and screening campaigns.
