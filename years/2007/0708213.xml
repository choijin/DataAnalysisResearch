<AbstractNarration>AST-0708213&lt;br/&gt;Medvedev&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will model the emission from Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) sources at various epochs and in different energy bands.  It makes a strong effort to develop analytical, semi-analytical and numerical frameworks.  The work has three main thrusts: 1) to develop a comprehensive model of GRB afterglows by calculating characteristic break frequencies, flux power-law indices and the bolometric flux evolution in the jitter emission paradigm; 2) to understand the non-Fermi acceleration of electrons in collisionless GRB shocks; and 3) to develop a semi-analytical and numerical framework for studies of GRB transient emission, covering the prompt and X-ray flare phases.  Accurate modeling of temporal, spectral and polarization evolution will explore whether the models are consistent with the observed correlations.  The results will be valuable for improved physical understanding and interpretation of observational results, and ultimately for uncovering the mystery of the origin of GRBs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Graduate student training, education and research is the dominant component of this study, which will support three students for three inter-related sub-projects.  During the study, the team will develop a display at their department, along with appropriate web resources, to describe the GRB phenomenon in a non-traditional way using every-day physics.  Additional impacts will come from the development of theoretical tools that will influence many areas of plasma astrophysics.</AbstractNarration>
