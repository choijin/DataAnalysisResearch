<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to interface Quantum-dot cellular automata (QCA) nanoelectronics and conventional electronics. As scaling of CMOS nears its end it is imperative to find new devices to overcome the problem of power density. Quantum-dot cellular automata is a promising new paradigm, however, silicon transistors have so many advantages that nanoelectronics must be made to interface to CMOS. The approach, a collaboration of groups at the University of Notre Dame and the University of Virginia, is to integrate conventional amplification and interface circuitry on-chip with nanoelectronic circuits grown using guided self-assembly of SiGe quantum dot molecules. &lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the project is in its investigation of the little-explored interface of nanoelectronics and CMOS.  Although power dissipation will limit CMOS in high-performance circuits, it will be used in circuit blocks far into the future. This project will move the field forward by integrating the growth of GeSi QCA cells into the CMOS fabrication sequence. &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The proposed project will have a broader impact in both technology and education. Interfacing nanoelectronics and CMOS circuitry should enable the electronics industry to move beyond CMOS. The project will shape the experience of the graduate and undergraduate students through research, study, and mentoring others.  An important component is an outreach program targeting middle school students through classroom activities, and field trips to bring students to the Notre Dame labs. Middle school aged children are an excellent group for outreach since they are still making choices about their areas of interests. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Summary  The goal of this project was to integrate nanoelectronic devices with silicon CMOS circuits.  As CMOS nears the end of the scaling roadmap there is a need to find devices that offer capabilities beyond those of CMOS.  At the same time, CMOS offers tremendous capabilities in integration density and power gain.  In the course of the project we were able to demonstrate the integration of CMOS Devices and SETs and measure the performance of the devices.  The FIB templating effort at the Renssalaer Polytechnic Institute demonstrated FIB modifications of Si surfaces.  Intellectual Merit Researchers are devoting a great deal of time and energy in developing new nanoscale devices that do not rely on the capacitive abrupt charging and discharging paradigm, a paradigm exemplified by CMOS devices. One such technology being investigated is Quantum-dot Cellular Automata (QCA). This computational methodology relies on charge position rather than charging and discharging of a capacitor to define logic states. This new paradigm may provide an avenue for computational abilities and low power densities unobtainable by the CMOS paradigm. It is likely that future high performance computers will utilize QCA, single electron transistors (SETs), or another new technology for high speed computing, due to the prohibitive energy demands of CMOS. However, the advantages of CMOS cannot be ignored. It is a well-understood, mature technology that is adequate for the majority of its current uses. CMOS will continue to be used in applications that require lower speed and high output power, including input and output systems for computers. Therefore, in order to harness the advantages of SET/QCA architectures, it is imperative to develop the integration technologies between SETs and CMOS architectures.  Research performed in this project demonstrated a proof-of-concept integration of single electron transistors and CMOS devices as a step on the path to full CMOS/SET/QCA logic integration.   Anyone who uses a laptop computer knows that energy, power dissipation, and the associated heat are significant issues.  An outgrowth of this grant was an experimental investigation of the fundamental limits of energy use in computation. These experiments were performed primarily by undergraduate students, and led to one journal publication, with another submitted, and three conference presentations.  These experiments investigated the use of charge as a state variable, and investigated assertions made by several groups concerning the fundamental limits of energy dissipation when charge is used as a state variable. An extremely influential critique of the use of charge as a state variable was made by Cavin et al. at the Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC), who asserted that the key source of dissipation in switching is moving charge&mdash;and that any charge based device must have a minimum energy dissipation no less than kBT per switching event.  While this is a small amount of energy, given the enormous number of devices per chip in modern integrated circuits, the associated power dissipation would become unmanageable in the future. The conclusions of Cavin et al. provided the underpinnings of a profound shift in the direction of research away from charge as a state variable, hoping to replace it by spin or magnetic domains.  The results of the experimental measurements done under this grant prove the conclusions of Cavin et al. are wrong&mdash;there is no fundamental lower limit to energy dissipation in moving charge. Furthermore, very recent experiments at Notre Dame have tested LandauerÆs principle (LP), the refutation of which is crucial to the Cavin argument. These experiments verified that a logic transition can take place with dissipation below kT, as long as information is not destroyed. Thus, charge is a viable state variable for nanoelectronics, and if handled properly can give the ultra-low power dissipation needed for end-of-the-roadmap circuit...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
