<AbstractNarration>Climate change, fire, and human land use are predicted to convert large portions of Amazonian forest into savanna. Although the causes of tropical deforestation are well documented, the amount of forest-replaced by savanna, and the plant species compositions of these savannas, have received less attention. In a region of Bolivia where forests are at risk of replacement by savanna, this research will use satellite images and field sampling to determine how much forest has been replaced by savanna and what grass species grow in these expanding savannas. Differences between grasses should influence whether savanna expands into adjacent forests. This work will measure the characteristics of different grass species to determine what attributes make some species particularly capable of contributing to savanna expansion.  This research will promote international collaboration and ensure that international research opportunities continue to exist for scientists and students in the future. This project will also inform forest management decisions through increased understanding of savanna expansion processes. This information is essential for determining the potential fates of Amazonian forests and the consequences of forest replacement by savanna for potential land uses, biodiversity conservation, and carbon storage.</AbstractNarration>
