<AbstractNarration>GRADUATE TEACHING FELLOWS IN K-12 EDUCATION&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PROPOSAL #: 0742436&lt;br/&gt;PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Deborah Kaminski&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION: Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: Building Bridges from High School to Grad School: Inspiring Students through Discovery-based Activities in Energy and the Environment&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Linking Rensselaer's cutting-edge research to local school districts will introduce high school students to advanced scientific concepts and emerging technologies in parallel with exposing graduate students to a challenging audience for dissemination of scientific research.  The overall theme of the educational program will be Energy and the Environment, a highly engaging and vitally important topic in today's society.  Each Graduate Research Fellow will be paired with a high school teacher, and this team will design and develop activities to effectively deliver scientific knowledge to high school students.  Activities will include case studies, scenario building, interactive games, and an authentic research project, which the students will present in a regional Research Expo. The Fellow/K-12 teacher team will be guided by the Graduate Research Fellow's adviser as well as a Regional Teachers Advisory Group.  Two of the school districts served have large minority populations from inner city environments.  As part of our recruiting effort, Rensselaer's Alliances for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (AGEP) center will identify exceptional minority graduate students who will become role models and mentors for the K-12 students. The project will educate high school students in basic principles of science and engineering, raise their awareness of energy and environmental concerns and technology, and get them excited about careers in science and engineering. Other objectives include improving the communication skills of the graduate fellows and investing them in K12 outreach initiatives.  High school teachers will benefit from access to advanced scientific research and an improved understanding of research methodologies.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The GK12 program at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute has had a profound and lasting effect on its participants including graduate students, high school students and high school teachers.  Intellectual merit The graduate students ("fellows") were paired up with local high school science and technology teachers and were fully immersed in the classroom experience. Working alongside their partner teachers, the fellows developed grade-appropriate activities and lessons that served to enhance the teachers' current curriculum while exposing the high school students to new technologies and aspects of science. With an emphasis on energy and environment, the fellows developed curriculum addressing topics such as renewable energy, energy sequestration, the effect of climate change on economy, and water quality. In this process the communication abilities of the fellows were greatly improved and they also gain a deep appreciation for and commitment to K-12 education.   School year activities culminated with summer experiences for both teachers and high school students during the "Research Week" and summer workshop, which were run primarily by the fellows. In "Research Week" the teachers assisted the fellows in their laboratories, to get a deeper understanding of their research and the processes involved. The week-long summer workshops addressed energy and environmental issues and were attended by both teachers and high school students. Topics have included Think Globally, Act Locally, Innovation in Energy and Environment, Wind Energy and Oceans. These workshops not only benefited the audiences, but the graduate students as well. Each fellow took ownership of his/her presentation and ensured that it was topical and appropriate for the audience. The improvement in their presentation and public-speaking skills was evident at these workshops.  Broader impact Over the course of five-year program, approximatively 5,000 students from various socio-economic and cultural background were directly impacted by DAEE program. Activities developed by the fellows are sustainable and will be continued in future classrooms by the teachers. Furthermore, every teacher who participated in this program has now greater knowledge of newer technologies and research techniques. The teachers have reported that more of their students have applied to higher education institutions in order to pursue studies in STEM. Moreover, the DAEE program has also seen a significant number of girls expressing interest in studying science, possibly as a consequence of role models played by the female fellows.
