<AbstractNarration>The strategies that animals use to extract information from social signals likely differ from the strategies that they use to extract information from the non-social environment.  This study compares strategies for assessing vibrational cues and signals used by embryo and adult red-eyed treefrogs. Embryos use vibrational cues to detect predators, and to escape, but must distinguish these vibrations from harmless disturbances, such as rain.  Adults vibrate their bodies in a dramatic signal used during contests between males over calling sites.  Thus, there are unique opportunities to: (i) compare strategies for extracting information from vibrational signals and cues used in the same environment, (ii) examine how vibrational information is used by embryos and adults of the same frog species, (iii) study vibrational communication in vertebrates.  The proposed research focuses on the newly discovered vibrational display of adults.  The structure of this signal, and the information it contains, will be investigated using video and vibration recordings of aggressive interactions between males.  Then, visual and vibrational parts of the signal will be played back to frogs to explore how these parts interact to carry information, to test whether vibrations help males locate signaling rivals, and to test whether males pay attention to signal frequency and duration.  Comparing the ways animals interpret signals and cues will help us understand how signals evolve.  This project also contributes more broadly to the emerging field of biological vibrations research by developing novel techniques for recording and playback of vibrations.  The research provides opportunities for participation of US undergraduates and high school students in Boston and Panama.  The PIs are committed to broad dissemination of results to both the academic community and the public through professional and educational presentations as well as cooperation with documentary media projects.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
