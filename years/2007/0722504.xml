<AbstractNarration>A group of applied mathematicians in the Department of Mathematics at&lt;br/&gt;the University at Buffalo proposes to purchase a distributed-shared memory multiprocessor cluster,workstations, and supplementary software. The new equipment will be used to support ongoing mathematical research projects in modeling and simulations. These research projects include the study of nonlinear and stochastic effects in fiber optics systems, analysis of coupling and uncertainty in renal hemodynamics, and an investigation of the dynamics and ill-posedness in models of crystalline surfaces especially under conditions of strong anisotropy. These projects share several features. Becauses of the interdisciplinary collaboration of each project, the co-investigators require a computing environment that allows them to rapidly develop initial model systems, usually systems of partial or ordinary differential equations, and explore solutions to these equations without extensive coding. As a model matures, the governing equations may then be solved by moderate-sized numerical simulations. Efficient numerical simulation of these dynamic models requires a computing infrastructure with large memory capacity and high bandwidth. Again because of the interdisciplinary nature of the research projects under study, parameter exploration and model validation require significant computational effort. Moreover, stochastic effects can play an important role in the model dynamics, adding to the computing burden. Comparison of model results with experiments, and communication of these results, is facilitated by advanced visualization software. The cluster to be purchased will serve these requirements, and will significantly enhance the co-investigators? research capabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A group of applied mathematicians in the Department of Mathematics at the University at Buffalo proposes to purchase a distributed-shared memory multiprocessor cluster, workstations, and supplementary software. The new equipment will be used to support ongoing modeling and simulation research in fields of engineering and bio-medical application that are computationally intensive. Because the co-investigators work in highly interdisciplinary fields of study, the mathematical research advances made in these projects quickly impact fields of applied science. The cross-disciplinary nature of the co-investigators provides a stimulating environment for the training of graduate students. The co-investigators also provide opportunities for undergraduates to experience research in mathematics. The proposed equipment will benefit these students - the graduate students in their research careers, and the undergraduate students as they leave the university for graduate study or enter the workforce.</AbstractNarration>
