<AbstractNarration>The goal of this proposal is to investigate alternative carbon-based materials that can be processed at low cost and that can more efficiently convert light into electricity.  The roadblock to developing such materials is our lack of understanding.  In this project recently invented scanned probe microscopes will be used to create images of electrons moving in plastic circuits and in solar cells.  The information will be used to guide synthetic chemists to make improved materials. State-of-the-art variable-temperature vacuum electric force microscopy will be used to probe charge injection and trapping in organic electronic devices, and the local charge mobility in an organic thin-film device will be imaged via a new scanned probe technique that detects local electric field fluctuations.  The results will broadly impact our thinking about organic electronic materials, with application to light emitting diodes and organic solar cell technology.  This project represents a unique opportunity to train graduate students in the arts of advanced scanned probe microscopy and nanofabrication, two skills that appear to be in ever-increasing demand.  In order to assure the broadest possible interdisciplinary training in materials research, students on this project will work on collaborative summer projects with scientists at federal and industrial laboratories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this proposal is to help discover and invent new materials for making more efficient solar cells and more cost effective plastic circuits.  Inventing improved solar cells is crucial because our country needs to develop better, more renewable sources of energy.  If plastic circuits could be developed it would lead to new methods of high interest to industry, e.g., for tracking products and interfacing with medical sensors.  Existing materials are simply not up to these tasks.  Students trained in this area will be highly competitive in the job market.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
