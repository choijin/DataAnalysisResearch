<AbstractNarration>This project will involve investigators from eight institutions working to resolve evolutionary relationships within the euteleost fishes, which represent over one third of vertebrate diversity. An important component will be education of the public on the importance, evolutionary history, and diversity of these animals. Phylogenetic analyses will employ DNA sequence data from 20 genes in 1,500 species representing all euteleost families, and approximately 450 morphological characters from 300 euteleost lineages. Resulting phylogenetic hypotheses will be used to facilitate understanding of the evolution of fish diversity and re-assess and revise the systematics of euteleosts. Research on the euteleost tree of life will be integrated into science education by using euteleost phylogeny as a framework for exploring the evolution of morphological, genetic, developmental, and behavioral diversity of fishes. This will be developed as an instructional guide, a "Fish ToL Activity Book," directed at upper elementary and middle school children and disseminated in non-formal and school settings working in partnership with the National Science Teachers Association Press and the National 4-H Afterschool Council. Undergraduates, graduate students, and postdocs will participate directly in the research project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The euteleosts include some 346 families, 2,935 genera and 17,419 species. Over two thirds of all fishes and nearly a third of all vertebrates are euteleosts, which include most of the economically important fishes such as salmons, basses, cods and tunas. This study will facilitate informed predictions about the poorly known characteristics of most euteleosts and will considerably improve the evolutionary context for understanding model organisms such as zebrafish, pufferfish, cichlids, medaka, and stickleback, which are central to the burgeoning fields of functional genomics, genetics and evolutionary developmental biology.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Euteleosts are the largest group of vertebrates on the planet and their interrelationships are essentially unknown. The Euteleost Tree of Life initiative was a combined morphological and molecular effort to clarify their evolutionary relationships that has produced a comprehensive phylogeny for bony fishes with representatives of all major lineages.  Specific project accomplishments: 1) novel investigations into potential morphological synapomorphies including a developmental series for multiple structures and their homologies; 2) compilation and analysis of physical and developmental characters culminating in a published survey of teleost synapomorphies and new classification for bony fishes; and 3) development and dissemination of high school web and curriculum modules that explore fishes, their relationships and shared characters, as well as supporting the development of tree reading and interpretation skills, and understanding of evolutionary concepts such as natural selection.  Impacts of this work include contributions to the broader ichthyology research community through a better understanding of morphological variation among euteleost clades, and insights into their evolutionary relationships. More broadly, knowledge of the relationships and diversity of fishes can help inform practitioners and policy makers in fishery sciences and conservation. Multiple undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral students were trained and were active participants in this research, and several papers were published by project team members about the educational context of evolutionary trees as part of other related phylogeny projects.
