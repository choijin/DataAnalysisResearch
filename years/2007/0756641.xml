<AbstractNarration>CBET-0756641&lt;br/&gt;Siepmann&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Accurate knowledge of the phase equilibria and other thermophysical properties of complex chemical systems is of enormous fundamental and practical importance. The success of molecular simulation in predicting thermophysical properties and in advancing our understanding of the relationship between molecular architecture and macroscopic observable, depends on the availability of efficient simulation algorithms and accurate force fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Force Field Development. The main goal of this project is to advance the development of the TraPPE (transferable potentials for phase equilibria) force field (FF) which consists of three levels. The first-level (TraPPE UA) is designed for simplicity and computational efficiency with good accuracy and makes use of united-atom representations for alkyl segments. The second level (TraPPE EH) is aimed at improved accuracy for mixtures of non-polar or weakly polar compounds and explicitly includes alkyl group hydrogens and some lone-pair electron and bond-center sites. The third level (TraPPE pol) is directed solely at the highest possible level of accuracy and transferability and here both the van der Waals and electrostatic interactions can respond to changes in the environment. It is proposed to extend (i) the TraPPE UA FF toward the building blocks of common polymers, (ii) the TraPPE EH FF toward rings found in pharmaceutical molecules, and (iii) the TraPPE pol FF to water, alkanes, alcohols, and ethers. Algorithm Development. This project also addresses novel Monte Carlo approaches for first principles simulations of phase equilibria and biased Monte Carlo methods to improve the sampling of phase transfers and spatial distributions in microheterogeneous fluids and crystalline solids. Applications. Molecular simulations using the transferable force fields will be employed as an engineering tool to predict thermophysical properties of a variety of complex systems, thereby adding to the available experimental database. The simulations will also provide a wealth of microscopic level insight into how molecular architecture and composition determine macroscopic phenomena. In particular, simulations will be carried out to investigate (i) solvation in microheterogeneous fluids, (ii) interfacial and surface properties of aqueous mixtures containing non-ionic surfactants and of common oligomers, and (iii) polymorphism and hydrate formation for pharmaceutical solids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Integration of Research and Education.. The PI strives to infuse his teaching of a freshman seminar on the material world and a graduate course on thermodynamics and statistical mechanics with the excitement of discovery by integrating hands-on computational exercises and topical results from molecular simulation research. The PI has participated as science expert/co-presenter for liquids and water in ScienceWorks!, an NSF-sponsored project that seeks to improve the Minneapolis Public Schools K8 science program, and taught hands-on science classes for third graders. Development of Human Resources.  Driven by the university industry partnership, which allows for extensive interactions with Drs. Ross and Schultz of 3M Central Research, St. Paul, MN, the graduate student education can be advanced in a unique and successful way. In addition, this research project will foster the participation of undergraduate students and special efforts will be made to recruit these students from traditionally underrepresented groups. Science and Engineering Infrastructure. The cyberinfrastructure will be advanced by the development of the TraPPE force field made available via a web interface and of the molecular simulation packages MCCCS (Monte Carlo for Complex Chemical Systems) and Car-Parrinello 2000, which are freely distributed via GNU General Public Licenses.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Professor Siepmann and junior researchers in Chemical Engineering, Materials Science, and Chemistry at the University of Minnesota have partnered with co-investigators Richard Ross and Nathan Schultz from the 3M Corporate Research Materials Laboratory in Minnesota to develop transferable force fields and efficient Monte Carlo algorithms and to apply these to investigate a variety of chemical systems of technological and environmental interest.  Molecular-level information on complex chemical systems and processes is  often not attainable by experimental measurements, but can be provided  by predictive simulations using efficient sampling algorithms and  accurate force fields.  This research partnership was supported through a Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) award.  One project area is focused on the discovery of more sustainable processes for the separation of ethanol from water.  The high cost of separating ethanol from fermentation broths by distillation is one of the major obstacles to its economical use as a transportation fuel and a renewable feedstock for other chemicals.  Solvent-based extraction or membrane pervaporation processes can offer significant benefits over the more commonly used distillation.  However, changes in solvent composition and sorbent architecture leading to an increase in the selectivity (e.g., making the solvent more hydrophobic) are usually coupled with a decrease in the capacity.  Predictive simulations for solvent-based extraction of ethanol from aqueous solution using long-chain alcohols as solvents demonstrate that the formation of small hydrogen-bonded aggregates enables selectivity factors in excess of 30 while maintaining relatively high ethanol capacity.  An investigation of the adsorption in silicalite-1 from aqueous solutions indicates very high selectivities for ethanol over water (and methanol, albeit to a lesser extent) and significant deviations from the predictions of ideal adsorbed solution theory due to favorable interactions of ethanol and water in the zeolite framework.  In addition, this university-industry team has developed (i) transferable force fields using coarse-grain, united-atom, and explicit-hydrogen representations for the interacting molecules and for sorbate-sorbent interactions in all-silica zeolites and (ii) Monte Carlo algorithms to allow for the efficient simulations of liquid-liquid equilibria, adsorption from solution phases, multi-component nucleation phenomena, and systems where the interactions are described by Kohn-Sham density functional theory.  The transferable force fields and efficient Monte Carlo algorithms build the nationÆs research capability through advances in cyberinfrastructure and are used by many other research groups.  This collaborative research projected contributed to the training of three postdoctoral scholars, eight graduate students, three undergraduate student, and one high school student (seven of these are from groups traditionally underrepresented in science and engineering).  The results of this research are being disseminated broadly through about 30 peer-reviewed publications and numerous presentations at national and international conferences.
