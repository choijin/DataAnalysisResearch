    <AbstractNarration>This award provides funds for student and postdoc participation in the 2008 Gordon Research Conference on Mechanical Systems in the Quantum Regime. This will be the first conference on this topic sponsored by the Gordon Research Conferences. It is being held during the period February 17 ? February 22, 2008, in Ventura, CA. The conference will involve a broad program that touches upon one a rapidly expanding and potentially transformative field exploring experimental and theoretical advances in quantum aspects of mechanical systems . This is a new research area that has arisen in the past year from a diverse set of communities: quantum optics, gravitational physics, and nanoscale condensed matter physics.. The objective of the conference is to bring together internationally leading scientists as well as young researchers and students active or specially interested in the field of quantum control. The conference shall be a forum to present the newest research results and trends in this rapidly expanding field. The interdisciplinary character of the field will be emphasized.</AbstractNarration>
