<AbstractNarration>Chemistry (12)&lt;br/&gt;This project is adopting a modified problem-based learning (PBL) approach for delivery of analytical chemistry courses at Butler University. It is being implemented within a framework that utilizes multiple, theme-based modular courses. Major components of the framework include: identification of scientific problems through chemical literature and other sources, solving the problems with multiple analytical techniques, analyzing and communicating the results in written and orals forms. These are being carried out through team work and open-ended inquiry-based projects using techniques such as LC-MS, GC-MS, IC-Conductivity, ICP-MS, ICPOES, FT-IR, Luminescence spectrometry and NMR. Modular courses with focus on separation science, forensic analysis, environmental analysis, biochemical analysis and service learning (geared towards K-12 education) are being developed, implemented and evaluated. Each module develops gradually through the semester with students' responsibilities increasing as the semester progresses. This approach is being used for (a) facilitating in-depth training on the whole analytical process while providing hands-on experience with multiple analytical instruments, (b) promoting and developing connections between multiple scientific disciplines, and (c) stimulating students to develop interest in solving scientific problems. Furthermore, both formative and summative methods are being developed to assess learning outcomes. The project also offers instrumental resources for research and teaching of courses in other areas of chemistry as well as other disciplines. Information on the structure and implementation of this multi-modular theme-focused PBL approach is being shared through organized workshops at national and regional meetings and also through publications in peer-reviewed journals.</AbstractNarration>
