<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;CBET-0715260&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Review of Water and Environmental Systems (WATERS) Network&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stephen D Parker&lt;br/&gt;Water Science and Technology Board&lt;br/&gt;National Academy of Sciences&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Water Science and Technology Board (WSTB) of the National Research Council (NRC) is the focal point for studies related to all aspects of water resources under the aegis of the National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Engineering. The WSTB's objective is to improve the scientific and technological basis for resolving important national questions and issues associated with the efficient management and use of ground and surface water resources. In carrying out its responsibilities and in serving the national interest, the Board responds to requests for evaluations and advice through ad hoc studies concerning specific and generic issues in water resources. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is the second step in a two-part effort by the WSTB to provide advice to NSF on the conceptual design of the proposed joint MREFC initiative of the ENG and GEO directorates for the "WATERS Network." This environmental observatory network combines the earlier CLEANER and Hydrologic Observatory initiatives of the two directorates. The WSTB will form a committee that will meet and write a consensus report for the NSF on the conceptual design for the WATERS Network. The study will rely on documents provided by the WATERS Network Project Office, which is funded separately by the NSF as a cooperative agreement involving several academic institutions and which has the primary responsibility for developing the design based on key science challenges and for ensuring that the design has the broad backing of the academic communities it is intended to support. The primary documents on which the review will be based are: (i) an integrated science and education plan, (ii) a science requirements document, and (iii) a conceptual design report. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
