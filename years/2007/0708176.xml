<AbstractNarration>AST-0708176&lt;br/&gt;Shapiro&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theory of cosmic reionization is a critical missing link in the theory of galaxy formation.  Reionization has numerous observable consequences on the spectrum, anisotropy and polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background, on signatures of high-redshift star and quasar formation, and on the mass spectrum and internal characteristics of galaxies.  This project will use cosmological radiative transfer, gas and N-body dynamics simulations to address frontier problems in the theory of reionization and its feedback on galaxy formation in the Cold Dark Matter model, in order to predict these observable signatures.  This includes (1) tests, comparisons, and standards for this aspect of computational cosmology; (2) the first large-scale radiative transfer simulations of self-regulated reionization with sufficient dynamic range; (3) the impact of small-scale structure on reionization; (4) the redshifted 21-cm background; (5) the effect of patchy reionization on CMB temperature anisotropy; and (6) the gas dynamical feedback of the first Population III stars on the second generation of star formation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work involves the pioneering development of computational methodologies and algorithms for incorporating radiative transfer in simulations.  The research will contribute to graduate training and learning.  The team includes under-represented groups and has a significant number of international collaborators.  This activity will enhance the global and the local research infrastructures.</AbstractNarration>
