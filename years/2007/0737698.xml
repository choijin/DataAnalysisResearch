<AbstractNarration>This project is a novel experimental investigation to quantify the role of gravity waves on the dynamics, momentum transport, deposition and subsequent forcing of the Mesosphere and Lower Thermosphere (MLT) region (~80-100 km) over South America, and specifically near the Andes Mountains.  The Andes region is an excellent natural laboratory for investigating gravity wave influences on the MLT dynamics.  During the summer months the dominant gravity wave forcing results from deep convection arising from severe thunderstorms over the continent to the east.  During the winter, strong orographic forcing dominates, due to intense prevailing zonal winds blowing eastward from the Pacific Ocean which suddenly encounter the towering Andes mountain range.  This creates large amplitude waves that have been measured well into the stratosphere but have yet to be unambiguously measured at MLT heights.  There are strong theoretical reasons to expect them to penetrate well into the mesosphere, especially during the winter months.  Building on extensive experience gained as part of the highly successful Maui-MALT program (2002-2006), this project will deploy and remotely operate the Utah State University CEDAR Mesospheric Temperature Mapper (MTM) at Cerro Tololo, Chile (30.1 S, 70.8 W).  The MTM is a robust, high-performance CCD imaging system designed to provide key temperature and intensity measurements on gravity waves using precise observations of two prominent airglow emissions, the NIR OH(6,2) centered near 87 km, and the O2(0,1)Atmospheric band,  near 94 km.  These data afford a unique capability to quantify wave propagation, growth, and dissipation at MLT heights.  It is planned to perform these new measurements in coordination with Na wind-temperature lidar, meteor radar, all-sky imager and other optical instruments as part of a well proven instrument cluster, as employed successfully during the Maui-MALT program.  The primary goals are:  1) To quantify the impact and seasonal variability of a broad spectrum of waves (including gravity waves, tides and planetary waves) over the Andes using coordinated wave, wind, and temperature measurements; 2) To perform a unique investigation of mountain waves present at MLT heights during winter months, quantifying their characteristics and associated momentum fluxes, and comparing with similar measurements during the summertime due to convective forcing.  The broader impact of the project includes strong student involvement, which will contribute to training the next generation of researchers in novel optical measurements and image processing techniques.  In addition, the recognized role of gravity waves in driving the mean and variable structure of the MLT makes an understanding of their various contributions a high priority for the aeronomy community.  In particular, the need to be able to accurately describe these effects in state-of-the-art models has broad implications for predicting their regional, seasonal and global influences under variable solar forcing and climate change conditions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[This new experimental observations program was developed to measure the effects of atmospheric gravity waves (AGW) on the "weather" in the upper atmosphere over the massive Andes mountain range.  AGW are generated by strong thunderstorms and other severe weather disturbances, which provide a very important mechanism for transporting large amounts of energy into the upper atmosphere (called the mesosphere) where they saturate and break (at heights around 55 miles) like ocean waves on a beach.  Strong winds blowing over mountain ranges are also known to generate large-scale AGW whose effects can be felt as unsettling "turbulence" by passengers flying over mountainous regions.  Theoretical studies indicate that these AGW should also be able to penetrate well into the mesosphere, especially during the winter months. However, to date, there are very few measurements of such "mountain waves" in the upper atmosphere.  The Andes region therefore provided an excellent natural laboratory for investigating both types of AGW and measuring their influences on the mesospheric weather.  Our primary research goals were to obtain new measurements of a broad spectrum of waves over the Andes as part of a suite of instruments housed at the Andes Lidar Observatory (ALO) which is a new upper atmospheric observatory located close to several astronomical observatories at Cerro Pach&oacute;n, Chile (30.3?S, 70.7?W, 2530 m), and to perform an in depth characterization of mountain waves present at mesospheric heights.     The ALO building was constructed in August 2009 and houses several optical instruments, including the Utah State University Mesospheric Temperature Mapper (MTM). This is a robust, high-performance digital camera designed to image the AGW structures as they propagate through the mesospheric region and to measure their temperature amplitudes.  The MTM has operated automatically over the past 2.5 years and has successfully obtained over 700 nights of high-quality data characterizing the wealth of AGW structures and their seasonal variability.  These measurements have been obtained in coordination with continuous radar measurements of the background wind fields and with powerful lidar measurements of the winds and temperatures during campaigns, enabling unprecedented investigations of selected AGW events and their influences on the mesospheric weather.

Importantly, a subset of these wave events have been identified as mountain wave signatures and their properties are under detailed investigation.  The excellent quality of the data and results to date have met and exceeded our original research goals.  While several of these studies are ongoing, it is clear that the Andes are a very active and important region requiring further study and a new 5-year program designed to obtain further measurements of the AGW over the Andes and their year-to-year variability has recently been funded.
