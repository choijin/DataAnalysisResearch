<AbstractNarration>  Intellectual Merits. Understanding the relationships between different environments and species traits is a fundamental goal of ecology. It is also vitally important for developing realistic models to predict ecological impacts from global change. Despite the critical role of plant roots in carbon and nitrogen cycles, belowground portions of plants have remained a particularly understudied area of research. &lt;br/&gt;The location of roots in the soil matrix and the complex interactions they form pose methodological and ecological challenges. First, roots are difficult to study because of the challenges of accessing them without damaging them. Second, almost all woody plants form complex symbioses between their roots and fungi to absorb nutrients from soil. More information is needed on the variability of root characteristics and how these characteristics shift when interacting with fungi to predict the effects of global change on these interactions. Third, a better understanding of root characteristics and their interactions with fungi is needed in an evolutionary context. The earliest fossils of roots indicate that these roots formed associations with fungi. In the vegetation that exists today, roots are diverse and one facet of this diversity is their degree of dependency on fungi for acquiring soil resources. &lt;br/&gt;In this two-year project, root-fungal interactions will be characterized. Multiple sources of variation in root tissues will be characterized: variation among co-existing species in a forest, between different forests within a single region (Northeastern US temperate region), among regions of different climates (temperate and tropical), and among diverse species due to their evolutionary relationships. This sampling strategy will be implemented in two field seasons in two sets of woody plants: (1) mature trees at two Northeast U.S. experimental forests and (2) living collections of woody taxa at Barnard College and at two New York botanical gardens. These sampling methods and strategies will be shared with international collaborators working in China and Costa Rica and compilation of a large data set of root traits from the literature and from ongoing sampling efforts can thus be initiated. &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts. This work will be of interest to applied ecologists addressing how mycorrhizal interactions contribute to invasive plant species or attempting to restore woody vegetation in highly disturbed soils. It takes advantages of experimental forests and of living collections maintained at Barnard College and at botanical gardens in New York City. It builds relationships internationally, initially with scientists in China and Costa Rica. The work also provides important training, mentoring, and professional development opportunities for female forest ecologists and undergraduate women, including underrepresented minorities.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
