<AbstractNarration>Abstract 0755094: &lt;br/&gt;This award provides renewed funding for a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program at Rutger's University. The program will support ten students during a ten week summer research program. The intellectual focus of the program is provided by access to the LEO-15 ocean observing platform and related technologies. Advances  in  remote  sensing,  ocean  observatories,  autonomous  vehicles,  numerical  modeling,  and  molecular  biology  are  changing  oceanography.   The  faculty  and  research  facilities  at  IMCS  allow  undergraduates  to  explore  these  technologies  to  understand  estuarine  and  costal  ecosystems.  An  initial  five-day  orientation  introduces  students  to  ongoing  research,  focusing  on  the  continental  shelf  off  New  Jersey,  the  Hudson  River/New  York  Harbor,  and  the  Mullica  River/Great  Bay  systems.   The  two  estuaries  provide  a  sharp  contrast  in  their  human  impacts  on  coastal  ecosystems.   The  orientation  includes  two  days  at  the  Rutgers  University  Marine  Field  Station  in  Tuckerton,  with  hands-on  experience  in  the  coastal  LEO-15  research  area,  and  on  the  Mullica  River. The program will include independent research projects by the students, participation in a bi-weekly summer lecture series on topics such as scientific writing, science careers, ethics and data presentation. It will conclude with a written report and student poster presentations. Students will be encouraged to publish in peer-reviewed journals and participate in national conferences following the summer research program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The site will be supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU Program. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project supported a Research Experience for Undergraduates site at Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey.  This program, named Research Internships in Ocean Sciences (RIOS), provided hands-on research experiences for undergraduate students who are interested in marine science.  The program ran for ten weeks during the summers of 2008, 2009, and 2010.  In total, 33 students from colleges and universities in 17 states around the country participated.  Students received a stipend, and their travel and room expenses were covered under the grant.               When applying for the program, applicants were provided with descriptions of ongoing research projects by faculty in the Institute of Marine and Coastal Sciences at Rutgers and asked to identify potential mentors.  Applicants were screened by a selection committee and ranked on the basis of their undergraduate transcripts, personal statements of their career goals and research interests, letters of reference, and match with a suitable mentor.  Mentors can be faculty, postdoctoral researchers, or advanced graduate students.               The goal of the program was to provide students with an in-depth research experience.  All major phases of conducting research were covered, including writing a proposal describing the planned project and the expected outcome, designing the study, collecting data, analyzing and interpreting data, making an oral presentation of the results of the project, and preparing a professional poster.  The capstone of the program was a poster session, similar to those held at professional marine science meetings.  Posters were judged, and the winner was sent to a national science meeting to present their project.  During the course of the program, students also participated in workshops covering various aspects of a career in science, such as responsible conduct of research and how to apply to graduate school.
