<AbstractNarration>This CAREER award by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program supports work by Professor Ferman Chavez at Oakland University to develop small molecule models for the active sites of oxalate degrading manganese enzymes oxalate oxidase and oxalate decarboxylase. The reactivity of these models towards oxalate will be studied in detail. As an outcome of the proposed investigations, he expects to help clarify mechanisms involved in catalysis for these enzymes as well as provide small molecules with enhanced oxidative activity. The proposed educational component will involve the initiation of a high school outreach program. Experiments and demonstrations related to Professor Chavez's research will be developed to teach basic chemistry concepts to high school students as part of their curriculum. These activities will then be tested in high school classrooms settings in the southeastern Michigan area. Professor Chavez will conduct workshops aimed at high school chemistry teachers featuring newly created experiments and demonstrations. A laboratory workbook and website containing this information will be published.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
