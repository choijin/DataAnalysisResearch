<AbstractNarration>Locomotion accounts for a significant proportion of the daily energy expenditure of many animals. In swimming fish this energy is used by myotomal muscle to generate mechanical power. This creates a wave of bending that passes along the body axis producing lift and thrust. The amount of muscle power generated during swimming has not been quantified, primarily because of difficulties in measuring the regional activity of muscle along the body. Regional measurements of blood flow to the myotomal muscles will be made in swimming trout and eels using injectable microspheres as a blood flow tracer. This will indicate muscle recruitment and energy expenditure along the body axis. By revealing patterns of muscle activity, and combining these data with measurements of muscle power output made in vitro, the mechanical power required for swimming will be determined. Measurements of the oxygen consumption of swimming fish will be used to indicate the metabolic power input during swimming. Comparison of the mechanical power output to the metabolic power input will indicate swimming efficiency. In addition to providing insight into a major vertebrate locomotor mode, improved knowledge of fish swimming performance and energy costs is likely to be of broader, ecological significance. The data collected will be applicable beyond biology, informing biomimetic approaches to robotic design. The proposed work will also have the broader impact of fostering research opportunities for talented young women interested in the biological sciences. The PI works at a single-gender institution and undergraduate students will collaborate on the projects, learning valuable research skills, presenting results from their work at national meetings, and co-authoring papers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
