<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Turull, Alexandre    &lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: DMS - 0757708 &lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Florida &lt;br/&gt;Title: Local and global analysis of groups and related objects, Conference in honor of George Glauberman&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference&lt;br/&gt;"The local and global analysis of groups and related objects", a one week international conference, will be held at the University of Chicago, from March 23, 2008 to March 29, 2008.  The mathematical study of symmetry is called group theory.&lt;br/&gt;One of the great achievements of Twentieth Century mathematics is the complete classification of the finite simple groups, the building blocks of all finite groups.  The first major success of the local and global analysis of groups is precisely the Classification of Finite Simple Groups. The methods involved in this study arise from a tension between the properties of p-groups and those of general groups.  Exciting developments are currently taking place in this area. The restructuring and systematization of the Classification of Finite Simple Groups is progressing at an impressive rate, with different approaches being actively pursued.  Our understanding of the  finite p-groups is rapidly increasing, with important new approaches being proposed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The global/local analysis of finite groups, which is the cornerstone of all work on the classification of finite simple groups, is finding unexpected applications in new areas of mathematics. This conference, in honor of George Glauberman, whose work has had a profound influence on this subject, will bring together experts and young mathematicians in these connected areas to discuss and learn about the different points of view and the different connections. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:  &lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this conference is to enhance research, education and training.  The conference will allow experts to keep abreast of the latest advances in these diverse areas. They will be able to exchange ideas. The conference will be especially useful for young researchers, and students, who will be able to get an overview of these interrelated fields.  The conference encourages the participation of women and minorities. It is being publicized widely through email, mailings, and a web site.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
