<AbstractNarration>A major environmental challenge for our generation is to comprehend and ultimately manage the myriad of changes occurring in the coastal ocean. Understanding how climatic and anthropogenic factors drive these coastal trends requires basic science literacy. The goal of the present project is to increase literacy in ocean science with a focus on understanding coastal trends through partnerships among scientists, educators and the general public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This COSEE Coastal Trends project brings together experienced science educators and coastal ocean research scientists in collaboration to analyze, integrate and interpret current scientific knowledge on ocean science principles and focus on coastal trends. The project will generate educational modules addressing these issues for teachers, students and the general public. The project builds on previous COSEE experience and uses creative partnerships with coastal ocean scientists (e.g., Long Term Ecological Research projects in MA, VA and GA) and end-user groups (e.g., National Park Service, VA Aquarium, National Geographic Society, NOAA NEERS) to develop and deliver unique and exciting educational materials (e.g., video clips, pod-casts, web tutorials) that address National Science Education Standards and Ocean Literacy Principles. Unique Fellowship Teams comprised of an educator, a scientist, a graduate student and an under-represented college student (supported by a science communicator, webmaster and evaluator) will be assembled to develop twelve coastal trend modules (three per year). These Fellowship Teams will serve to integrate research and education to generate Coastal Trend Modules, which will be field-tested in diverse institutes, courses and mentoring activities.  This sequence of synergistic interactions will deliver materials that end-user groups can apply and disseminate to K-12 and public education venues. COSEE funds will be effectively leveraged by fostering synergism with scientists at little cost and by forming broad, creative partnerships. A staggered time-line insures development, delivery, field-testing, evaluation, and feedback. The project's scope is designed to build with increasing experience over the course of its duration. The effectiveness of project institutes and modules will be continually assessed through interactions between external and internal evaluators that optimize feedbacks.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
