<AbstractNarration>Most vertebrates live more than one year and are subjected to varying degrees of seasonal changes in diverse habitats. Animals must also cope with unpredictable events that include stresses from severe weather events, predators and recently, human disturbance, pollution, global climate change etc. Changes in morphology, physiology and behavior that underlie coping mechanisms for predictable and unpredictable environmental changes are regulated by neuroendocrine and endocrine secretions that in turn are triggered by environmental signals. Except for effects of photoperiod, relatively little is known about how environmental signals are perceived and transduced into neuroendocrine secretions. This project is to determine how animals in their natural habitat perceive environmental cues and how this information is processed resulting in responses. The work will involve both field and laboratory approaches that also provide an ideal training opportunity for undergraduate and graduate students. Such an approach is timely given the impact of global change and how organisms in general may be able to cope. Fieldwork will address the degree of seasonality, behavioral modulation and responses to acute stresses in populations of songbirds at comparable latitudes and altitudes in North and South America. Laboratory studies will focus on mechanisms at cell and molecular levels. What environmental cues are important, how are they perceived and transduced into hormone secretions, and how do those hormones then act are the focus of this project.  In addition, the PI has developed an environmental endocrinology course for undergraduate and graduate students (including international courses)and leads a NSF research coordination network. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ One of the major biological problems in the decades ahead is how animals will respond to global climate change. We still know relatively little about how animals deal with changing environments, even before this era of global change. This kind of research requires using animals in natural and captive conditions to determine mechanisms. By perceiving and integrating environmental cues, animals can initiate the proper morphological, physiological and behavioral adjustments in advance, thus preparing for and terminating breeding at the appropriate times. Among different environmental cues used to time life history stages, the annual cycle of photoperiod is the most reliable and commonly used cue by seasonal breeders. How an animal perceives photoperiodic information varies among vertebrates.  Unlike mammals, neither the eyes nor the pineal gland play a critical role of photoperiodic time measurement (PTM) in birds, although they may both regulate the PTM response and/or act as pacemakers in the central clock system.We have investigated what gene networks are changed by exposure to environmental cues such as day length, particularly in relation to reproductive cycles. While reproductive physiology is an area that is much-studied, it has yet to be determined how the timing of breeding and the flexibility of of that timing is accomplished by animals that are both seasonal &amp; aseasonal in their breeding regimes.  In addition to day length cues others such as variation in food/water abundance, temperature, social situations, and/or stress can influence when an animal breeds.  However less is known about how this information is perceived and transduced in the brain. The goals of this project included investigations to explore what pathways for environmental signals exist and how they function. Historically the brain neuropeptide Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone (GnRH) has been generally accepted as the sole-mediator of central regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis involved in development, mature capabilities and termination of the breeding life history stage.  This assumes that GnRH neurons receive input from multiple areas of the brain.  Possibly, groups of GnRH neurons may have specific duties regarding reproductive processes both behavioral and physiological.  How these inputs can regulate GnRH is dependant on three main mechanisms: 1) influencing GnRH gene expression, 2) influencing GnRH peptide release, and 3) influencing the action of GnRH at the level of the pituitary.   We have continued invesigations on a relatively newly discovered brain peptide (gonadotropin inhibitory hormone - GnIH) that we have shown to have marked inihibitory effects on GnRH action and on reproductive behavior.
