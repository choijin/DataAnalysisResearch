<AbstractNarration>Atmospheric carbon dioxide is the main source of carbon for living organisms and is a critical substrate for plant photosynthesis. This research seeks to determine how plants evolved in response to low carbon dioxide concentrations that occurred during the last ice age (18,000-20,000 years ago). During that period, carbon dioxide concentrations were approximately half of the current value, and these low levels greatly reduce the growth of modern plants. In order to understand how plants evolved in response to low carbon dioxide in the past, the proposed research uses plant specimens from two remarkable collections dating to the last ice age: juniper trees preserved within the La Brea tar pits in southern California and kauri trees preserved within bogs on the North Island, New Zealand. These specimens allow for comparisons between ice age and modern trees for assessing the effects of low carbon dioxide on plant physiology, growth, and evolution. Plant responses to changing carbon dioxide will be measured with annual resolution using carbon isotope analysis of tree rings, along with measurements of leaf morphology and seed size. Broader impacts for this CAREER project will involve the establishment of a SEEDS (Strategies for Ecology Education, Development and Sustainability) chapter at the University of Kansas that will strive to increase the number of students from under-represented groups that enter the field of ecology. This chapter will involve mentoring of undergraduates, student travel to national meetings, and a speaker series with minority scientists. From this research, a more accurate understanding of plant responses to past global changes will be acquired, and from this, insights will be gained into the evolutionary responses of plants to increasing carbon dioxide concentrations that are predicted for the near future.</AbstractNarration>

We compared long-term responses of tree physiology, as well as inter-annual variation within individuals, between the last glacial period and modern times. We used stable carbon isotope measurements to determine ci/ca, representing the inter-cellular versus atmospheric CO2 concentration of leaves. This measurement represents plant responses to facilitate carbon uptake for photosynthesis while avoiding excess water loss through leaf pores. We found the first direct evidence that low [CO2] constrained the physiology of glacial trees, as evidenced by low [CO2] within leaves (ci) (Fig. 2) and a dampened response to inter-annual climate variability during the last glacial period (Fig. 3). This is the first direct evidence that "carbon starvation" persisted during the last glacial period. Moreover, our results suggest that the environmental factors that dominate physiology can vary across geologic time scales, resulting in major alterations in physiological response patterns through time.     Physiology of a Glacial Plant Community at the Snake Range, NV:  Comparisons of the physiology of co-occurring plant species in intact communities can improve our understanding of physiological responses to global change, and provide insights into mechanisms that underlie shifts in community composition across geologic time. Using our pack-rat midden collection, we sampled leaves from a mixed, intact plant community in the Snake Range over a ~30 kyr time period. Using stable carbon isotopes, leaf nitrogen content, and stomatal characteristics (Fig. 4), we inferred temporal shifts in leaf-level physiology, and compared those responses to well-documented shifts in species distributions and community composition since the last glacial period. Our results provide new insights into several key aspects of plant and community responses to global change over recent geologic history. In particular, we found evidence that (1) gs (stomatal conductance) and/or photosynthetic capacity decreased with changing conditions since the last glacial period, (2) leaf-level physiology combined with unique life history traits influenced the distribution of...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
