<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program project is to develop experimental and numerical tools to optimize the micro-hot embossing process for amorphous polymers.  Hot embossing is used to impart micro-scale features to polymer surfaces and is important in the optical, electronics, automotive, and biomedical industries.  The research will include an experimental investigation of the effects of surface characteristics in processing, and the results will be used to develop and validate new finite element simulations of hot embossing.  Hot embossing is one of many processes that take place near the glass transition temperature. Current experimental data and constitutive models in this temperature range are limited, restricting the design of hot embossing to costly iterative approaches.  This research aims to address these needs through material characterization and modeling near the glass transition temperature, process-level finite element modeling, and lab-scale embossing experiments for model validation. The educational objective is to integrate the research into existing engineering courses and to develop outreach methods to promote technical awareness and interest in engineering among 8th grade students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research will advance the state of the art in polymer manufacturing by (1) generating new experimental data for polymers near the glass transition, an industrially important temperature range with limited published data; (2) developing a new constitutive model to capture thermoplastic behavior over a wide range of temperatures across the glass transition; (3) providing computational modeling tools for design and optimization of micro-hot embossing; and (4) providing experimental insight into the role of micro-scale surface features in hot embossing.  Hot embossing is an environmentally-friendly alternative for creating surface features and the developed design tools will facilitate the push toward nano-scale features.  The integration of research and education through this award will provide tangible exposure to cutting-edge research through projects imbedded in undergraduate finite element and graduate polymer processing courses.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Experiments, Constitutive Modeling, and Multi-Scale Simulations of Large Strain Thermomechanical Behavior of PMMA  Micro-hot embossing has biomedical applications in areas such as cancer research and device design to promote wound healing.  Hot embossing is a polymer processing technique that replicates a variety of micron and nano-scale surface features, such as microchannels, pyramids, and wells, at a high level of accuracy.  The resulting topographies can then be used to study the motion and growth of cells.  Hot embossing design currently relies largely on trial-and-error experimentation to establish processing windows that will create the desired microfeatures.  However, optimizing this process through experimentation alone can be costly and time consuming.   It is more practical to model hot embossing using finite element analysis, but to do so requires a constitutive model that can capture the materialÆs highly temperature- dependent mechanical behavior around the glass transition temperature.  In hot embossing, the molding process is performed at temperatures above the glass transition, where the polymer can easily flow and fill the fine features of the mold.  The polymer substrate is then held while being cooled below the glass transition, such that the polymer hardens and maintains the relief shape of the die after removal.  During die removal a variety of factors compromise feature replication, such as spring-back and adhesion, yet current finite element models of embossing are unable to simulate these important parts of the process.  The goal of this work was to create the tools necessary to model micro- hot-embossing of PMMA through 3D multi-scale finite element simulations utilizing a new constitutive model that captures the large-strain, temperature-dependent stress relaxation behavior of poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA). PMMA is of particular interest due to its biocompatibility.   A central part of the project was the development of a new constitutive model that is able to capture both the stress-strain as well as stress relaxation behavior of PMMA at temperatures that span the glass transition and at very large levels of deformation.  This model is a huge advance over previous polymer constitutive models that were much more limited.   The model was first validated against experimental data collected by our group.  The model was then used in multi-scale finite element simulations to predict the final shape of microchannels.  Multi-scale simulations were needed because of the significant difference in scale between the substrate (mm) and feature size (nm-&micro;m).    Process-level embossing experiments were conducted to support this modeling effort.  In these experiments, molding and release temperatures were varied to measure their effect on feature replication.  The embossed parts will ultimately be used in directed cell growth studies.  The following five key outcomes capture the success of the project.  1)  New experimental data was collected on how PMMA behaves when deformed and held at very large levels of deformation, and over a wide range of temperatures near the glass transition.  2)  A new material model was developed that we found can capture the materialÆs stress-strain behavior, as well as its stress relaxation behavior, in this industrially-relevant temperature regime.  3)  Experimental embossing results were collected using an industrial press for comparison with finite element simulations.  4)   A multi-scale finite element simulation technique was adapted in order to track the location of a representative microchannel throughout the large deformation that occurs during embossing.     5)   Comparison between the finite element simulations and physical experiments showed that the model is capable of capturing all of the trends seen in the experiments.
