<AbstractNarration>Society is dependent on many engineered systems whose increasing&lt;br/&gt;complexity and inter-connectedness have, in turn, increased their&lt;br/&gt;vulnerability to adversarial attacks.  In many of these systems,&lt;br/&gt;protecting the execution of their computations is as crucial as&lt;br/&gt;ensuring the security of their data.  This research investigates how&lt;br/&gt;to maintain survivable operation of such systems, even in the face of&lt;br/&gt;invasive attacks where computations are intentionally subverted to&lt;br/&gt;interfere with other computations' execution constraints.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this research is to develop new techniques for isolating&lt;br/&gt;the effects of interactions among computations through specific&lt;br/&gt;resources in these systems, including: flexible specification and&lt;br/&gt;rigorous enforcement of computations' execution constraints; explicit&lt;br/&gt;control of all OS kernel components under a single scheduler; detailed&lt;br/&gt;on-line monitoring of computations and their supporting OS kernel&lt;br/&gt;components; automated learning to discover previously unknown&lt;br/&gt;interactions among computations; and formal modeling and verification&lt;br/&gt;of computations, execution constraints, and system components and&lt;br/&gt;resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The expected benefits of this project include: a novel approach to&lt;br/&gt;non-bypassable isolation of computations from the effects of&lt;br/&gt;adversarial attack in which isolation can be enforced flexibly&lt;br/&gt;according to the system-specific execution constraints that must be&lt;br/&gt;satisfied; a high quality open-source software implementation of&lt;br/&gt;kernel-level scheduling and monitoring services that provide and&lt;br/&gt;measure such non-bypassable isolation; new formal models, analyses,&lt;br/&gt;and methodologies for verifiably correct configuration and management&lt;br/&gt;of those services; and empirical studies of the services' ability to&lt;br/&gt;protect computations from interference under a wide range of&lt;br/&gt;adversarial attacks.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Society is dependent on many engineered systems whose increasing  complexity and inter-connectedness have, in turn, increased their  vulnerability to disruption. In many of these systems, protecting the  execution of the tasks they perform is as crucial as ensuring the  security of their data, and since they often compete for common  resources such protection depends significantly on how resources are  allocated among those tasks.    The goal of this research has been to develop new techniques to ensure  timely execution of system tasks, through principled sharing of  resources among them, even when: (1) how long each task will use the  resource is known only statistically (and possibly must be learned as  the system runs); (2) once granted, a task's use of the resource is  not preempted until the task releases the resource; and (3) different  systems may have different measures of how useful it is for each task  to access a resource at different times.    This research has produced several technical contributions towards  that goal: we have established a novel approach for automated  generation and verification of policies for how the use of a resource  can be scheduled rigorously among such tasks; we have identified  explicit structure both in the policy design approach and in specific  policies generated by it, which can be exploited to produce policies  more efficiently and for a wider range of systems; we have shown how  reasonable policies can be generated even when information upon which  they depend must be learned on-line; and we have generalized our  approach to handle cases where the utility of each task having the  resource may vary over time.
