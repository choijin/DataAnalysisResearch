<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;ECCS-0746296&lt;br/&gt;Sharon M. Weiss, Vanderbilt University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merits: The objective of this CAREER proposal is to demonstrate high sensitivity detection of biomolecules on a silicon platform for the development of reliable, portable, and cost-effective biosensors. The demonstration of such a biosensor using silicon-compatible processing techniques could revolutionize medical diagnostics. In this work, the optical properties of porous silicon are utilized for the detection of biomolecules. The pores not only provide a means of improving selectivity by filtering unwanted species, but their large surface area allows the attachment of more biomolecules than is attainable on planar substrates.  The design of the porous silicon sensor as a waveguide enables the majority of the electric field to interact with the biomolecules, resulting in highly sensitive detection. When biomolecules are captured in the waveguide, the refractive index change can be measured by a shift in the waveguide resonance angle. Fundamental studies on how electric field-biomolecule interaction relates to biosensor performance will lead to advanced biosensing technology. Accurate predictions of how increased surface area from the use of porous media can enhance device performance will be valuable across several fields of research from biosensors to solar cells and optical switches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: There is a strong demand for the development of a reliable, sensitive, portable biosensor that is cost-effective for applications in medical diagnostics, environmental monitoring, and homeland security. The proposed research opens the door to breakthrough technology for biomolecular sensing that can tap into the multibillion dollar biotechnology industry. The educational goals of this program include (1) developing a new course highlighting optical properties of nanomaterials; (2) offering summer research opportunities for minority students; (3) participation in hands-on outreach activities at Nashville area schools; and (4) working to sustain interest in physics and engineering for graduate and undergraduate women in these fields.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
