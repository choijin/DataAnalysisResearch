<AbstractNarration>The purpose of this workshop is to develop a framework for moving forward with well coordinated technological, societal, and research activities needed to reach the 10-year objective  of  transforming  the cyber-infrastructure to be resistant to attack. Three synergistic plans are suggested to start simultaneously: a near-term activity of from one to three years, a medium-term effort of two to five years, and a long-term thrust of up to ten years.  Near-term activities will have almost immediate benefits in vulnerability reduction, and the medium- and long-term efforts will result in advances that can augment or replace weak segments of the existing infrastructure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will bring together a relatively small group of experts from government, industry and academe in secure computer systems and networks. They will be required to address, at a high level, a broad range of technical areas and issues associated with the lifecycle processes for large secure systems.  Concerns include elicitation of requirements, specification, design, implementation, configuration management, tests and analysis, certification, deployment and maintenance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary product of the workshop will be a report describing the framework and plan developed by its participants.  It is expected that the plan will include:&lt;br/&gt;* Well defined objectives for the effort&lt;br/&gt;* Methods for assessing overall program progress&lt;br/&gt;* Milestones and graduated objectives to be met as the program progresses&lt;br/&gt;* Characterization of the technological, societal, and research challenges to be addressed&lt;br/&gt;* Description of how ongoing programs will relate to the initiative</AbstractNarration>
