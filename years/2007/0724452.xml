    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II Project proposes a new approach to the problem of creating and editing premium quality computer-generated character animation that will dramatically reduce the heavy labor penalty associated with animation techniques and software tools currently available. The specific technical innovation consists of a generic animation framework that produces high-quality motion through a reduced set of input parameters (compared to keyframe techniques) while providing a high degree of "directability" for the user. Additionally the proposed innovation affords the ability to capture, store and reproduce stylistic motions with a high level of fidelity and repeatability. Style is encoded in both physically- and behaviorally-based time-variable parameters supporting smooth transitions between styles. The theoretical foundation is similar to spacetime approaches yet has major differences that improve usability, flexibility, and productivity. Successful completion of this project will lead to a product that increases the productivity of experienced animators by simplifying the animation process, and enables novice or non-animators to quickly and easily create animated content.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The successful completion of this Small Business Innovative Research phase II project, in conjunction with an appropriately developed user interface, will positively impact the global content creation industry by increasing the ease-of-use for creation of animation compared to the difficult and labor intensive animation processes currently employed. Successful commercialization will expose a much broader consumer market to the art of computer animation. The broader exposure of the solution will allow un-trained and underrepresented groups the ability to express themselves through the art of 3D computer generated character animation that is currently the realm of highly skilled users only. In addition, the increased ease of creating compelling animations will afford the dissemination of animation based information over a broader audience. Finally, the solution will allow animation to be used for applications where it was not previously feasible due to ease-of-use and budgetary constraints opening up new commercial opportunities.</AbstractNarration>
