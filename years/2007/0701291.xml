    <AbstractNarration>The main part of this project concerns certain invariants of the representations of semisimple &lt;br/&gt;Hopf algebras. These invariants, the Frobenius-Schur indicators and their higher analogs, &lt;br/&gt;should give information not only about the representations of a Hopf algebra, but also about its &lt;br/&gt;possible structure and so may help in the classification program. They should also serve as a &lt;br/&gt;tool in proving more general facts about Hopf algebras, by looking for representation-thoeretic &lt;br/&gt;proofs. The project also concerns actions of Hopf algebras on non-commutative algebras, &lt;br/&gt;especially as to when the Jacobson or prime radicals are stable under such actions; these &lt;br/&gt;questions are related to prime ideals and the radical of semidirect products, &lt;br/&gt;and would help in doing ``invariant theory'' for Hopf algebras. Finally some questions will be &lt;br/&gt;considered about twistings of Hopf algebras and of their actions on algebras, as well as more &lt;br/&gt;general questions about which algebra properties are preserved by twisting. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hopf algebras are of interest not only for their own sake, but because they appear as &lt;br/&gt;invariants in other mathematical structures, such as understanding knots in geometry, and &lt;br/&gt;in parts of mathematical physics, such as conformal field theory. Thus a greater understanding &lt;br/&gt;of the Hopf algebras themselves might eventually be useful in these areas. This project will &lt;br/&gt;also involve some women students involved with the Women in Science and Engineering (WiSE) &lt;br/&gt;program at USC.</AbstractNarration>
