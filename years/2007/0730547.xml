<AbstractNarration>0730547&lt;br/&gt;Jaron&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal concerns the development a multi-scale approach to modeling nitric oxide production, transport and metabolism. A total of 5 objectives are stated for this proposal: (1) Expand an existing cell-scale model to include intracellular signaling and extra-cellular transport, (2) Couple a vascular-scale and cellular-scale model, (3) Develop a vascular network-scale model of NO transport, (4) Extend the model to a tissue level scale, and (5) Validate the theoretical simulations with in vitro and in vivo studies. The transport and metabolism of NO plays an important role in many normal and pathological tissue functions. As a result, this study could make important contributions to medicine and vascular physiology in general. The coupling of hemodynamics, multiple chemical reactions, and biophysical processes in an integrated multi-scale model is central to a vast number of important physiological and pathophysiological processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The coupling of the proposed research with existing courses and other education components is a strength of this proposal. In particular, including this work in cellular biomechanics, tissue engineering, and cardiovascular engineering course work will give students an opportunity to learn some cutting edge research. The PIs have a track record of including undergraduates in their research programs. Also, multi-scale and multi-temporal methods are becoming more important in biology and physiology. As a result, this work is likely to impact a number of other areas besides NO metabolism.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
