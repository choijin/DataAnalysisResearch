<AbstractNarration>Proposal: 0723077&lt;br/&gt;PI:  Bridget Rogers&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Vanderbilt University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: MRI--Acquisition of an x-ray photoelectron spectrometer for research and education in inorganic, nan oparticulate, and biological Materials&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purchase of a PHI 5000 VersaProbe x-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) from Physical Electronics is allowed by this grant  for the enhancement of materials research and education in three broad areas:inorganic, nanoparticulate, and biological materials. The variable area analysis capabilities (from approximately 200 im down to 10 im spot size) of this instrument make it ideal for the support of a wide range of cutting edge research topics. Seventeen faculty members whose existing and future programs will benefit greatly from the addition of this XPS on the Vanderbilt campus have been identified. Among the 17 faculty members we have 3 NSF Career award winners, two Presidential Early Career Awards for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE) winners, and two have been recognized by Vanderbilt University with awards for excellence in teaching. This award-winning group of faculty is diverse in many aspects. It consists of 6 Assistant, 4 Associate (early career), and 7 Full professors, with representatives from the departments of Chemical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Biomedical Engineering, Civil Engineering, Chemistry, and Physics. Five are women and one is African American.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;The research that will benefit from having an XPS on campus is just as diverse as the faculty who will utilize the instrument. It falls into three broad categories: Inorganic Materials, Nanoparticulate Materials, and Biological Materials. Projects falling under the Inorganic Materials heading include electronic materials (gate dielectrics, SiC, diamond, and CZT), carbon/cement composites, and ceramics for extreme environments. Projects falling under the Nanoparticulate Materials heading include magneto optical thin films and nanoparticles for the development of fuel cell catalysts and solid-state white lighting. Projects falling into the Biological Materials include DNA-modified surfaces, biomimetic routes for solar energy conversion and metal oxide growth, bone-polymer composites, and nanocrystals to fight breast cancer. The link between all these projects is the Interdisciplinary Graduate Program in Materials Science, of which nearly all of the major users are affiliate faculty. Also, many of the major users are faculty of the Vanderbilt Institute of Nanoscale Science and Engineering (VINSE). A state-of-the-art XPS instrument will not only benefit the existing programs, but will greatly strengthen this multidisciplinary research center.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;The acquisition of this instrument will broadly impact graduate Materials Science education and training at both Vanderbilt University and Fisk University, a historically black institution. In 2004, Vanderbilt and Fisk were awarded an Integrative Graduate Education and Research Training grant.The Vanderbilt*Fisk Interdisciplinary Program for Research &amp; Education in the Nanosciences is tied to the research activities of VINSE researchers at both universities. The students take courses together on both campuses. Scientists from Physical Electronics will work with the PI's to develop a yearly one-day workshop on XPS. Professors Laibinis, Jennings, and Rogers will develop a modular (5 weeks, 3 hours/week) course in XPS analysis to support the Vanderbilt*Fisk IGERT. The focus of this module will be on theory and basic instrument operation. In addition, they will develop a semester long course in Surface, Interface, and Thin Film characterization. Data analysis will be emphasized in both the modular and semester courses. Professor Rogers recently purchased a site license for the surface analysis software CASAXPS to support her research programs. Data from the XPS and her Auger electron spectrometer systems will be used to demonstrate course concepts, and students will be able to perform state-of-the-art data reduction using the CASAXPS software.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
