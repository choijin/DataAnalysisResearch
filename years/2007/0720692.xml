<AbstractNarration>This project strives to improve the state-of-the-art in architectural&lt;br/&gt;simulators in two ways: (i) by enabling users to determine if an architectural&lt;br/&gt;simulator correctly models the key aspects of a real hardware system; and (ii)&lt;br/&gt;by helping simulator implementors to identify weaknesses in their simulators.&lt;br/&gt;This problem is critical because much architectural research today uses&lt;br/&gt;simulations; if the simulators are not accurate then the results from the&lt;br/&gt;simulator may be misleading.  Prior work validates simulators by using&lt;br/&gt;aggregate metrics (e.g., do the simulator and the real hardware execute a&lt;br/&gt;program in a similar number of total cycles?).  This validation does not&lt;br/&gt;consider whether or not the simulator and the hardware exhibit similar&lt;br/&gt;time-varying behavior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A key innovation of this project is that it embraces techniques from the field&lt;br/&gt;of non-linear dynamics.  These techniques are well suited for computer systems&lt;br/&gt;for two reasons.  First, computer systems are non-linear at all levels (e.g.,&lt;br/&gt;the cost of a cache miss is not fixed and instead depends on many factors) and&lt;br/&gt;thus linear techniques will be of only limited use.  Second, many aspects of&lt;br/&gt;computer systems are unknown (e.g., the hardware manufacturer may not reveal&lt;br/&gt;the full specifications of the hardware) or unmeasurable (e.g., it may not be&lt;br/&gt;possible to measure how often a particular event occurs deep down in the&lt;br/&gt;hardware).  Non-linear dynamics techniques are specifically designed to deal&lt;br/&gt;with such missing information.</AbstractNarration>
