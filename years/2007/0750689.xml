<AbstractNarration>This project will determine whether or not Ultra Low Frequency (ULF) cavity mode waves exist in Earth's inner magnetosphere and if they do, how the plasmasphere controls their properties.  The project will make use of ground-based magnetic pulsation measurements from the McMAC magnetometer array.  The ground-based pulsation data will be supplemented with solar wind measurements from the ACE satellite and magnetic pulsation measurements from the Geotail and GOES satellites.  The data analysis will include 3-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations using a realistic plasmasphere density structure.  Cavity mode waves may play an important role in the transport and energization of particles in the radiation belts.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ More than 100 years ago scientists realized that the magnetic field of the Earth exhibits small-amplitude oscillations with periods on the order of a minute.  The oscillations have been termed geomagnetic micropulsations or (more recently) ultralow-frequency (ULF) waves, which constitute an important subject in space physics research.  In general, the waves are excited as the solar wind plasma interacts with the Earth's magnetosphere, a region in space that is influenced by the magnetic field originating from the interior of the Earth. For example, the solar wind dynamic pressure varies with time and the variations can directly excite ULF waves.  Also, ULF waves are excited when the energy of the solar wind stored in the nightside magnetosphere is explosively released to other regions, a process known as substorm. The specific excitation mechanism for each observed wave is a subject of many ongoing studies in the space physics community.     Another important question we ask is how the magnetic field oscillates with the period that is observed.  The short answer to the question is that the magnetosphere is a resonator.  A resonator is an object that oscillates at selective frequencies.  We are all familiar with musical instruments such as the pipe organ and piano, which emit sounds at a particular pitch or tone (frequency in physics terms) when air is blown into a pipe (organ) or a key hits a steel wire tied at two ends (piano).  These are good examples of resonators.  Here, the organ and piano are chosen deliberately to remind you that there are two different kinds of resonators. One is a resonator that involves compressional waves in a gas, the sound wave in the case of the pipe organ. Another is a resonator that involves torsional waves, the transverse oscillations of the wire in the case of the piano.  In the magnetosphere both compressional and torsional waves propagate.  The compressional waves are similar to the sound waves. The torsional waves are similar to the vibration of the piano wire, with the Earth's magnetic field playing the role of the wire. It turns out that resonance of torsional waves is very common in the magnetosphere. By contrast, there has been little direct evidence of resonance of compressional waves. The goal of our research project was to determine if the magnetosphere sustains resonant compressional waves (cavity mode is the term we use below).     The tools we employed in the search of the cavity mode are magnetometers on the ground and satellites in the magnetosphere. In one study, the satellites included the THEMIS probes that traversed the magnetosphere from the region of high plasma density (plasmasphere) to the region of low density (plasmatrough).  The plasmasphere is the most likely region where cavity mode waves are excited.  By comparing magnetic field data from the ground and electric and magnetic field data from the spacecraft we identified a daytime wave event that lasted about an hour. During the event one THEMIS probe was in the plasmasphere and detected a 90-s oscillation of the electric and magnetic fields.  The waveform of the oscillation was identical to that observed on the ground by magnetometers that were close to the spacecraft.  Because the satellite was moving radially, it is evident that the oscillation occupied a large volume of the plasmasphere, as expected for cavity mode waves.  Moreover, the relationship between the electric field and magnetic field at the satellite indicated that the oscillation was standing (as opposed to propagating).  This is exactly the nature of a cavity mode wave. The variation of the amplitude and phase of the cavity mode oscillation with the radial distance was compared with that obtained with a numerical simulation of plasmaspheric cavity modes and an excellent agreement was found between them. We were thus able to conclude, for this event, that cavity mode resonance existed in the magnetosphere.     In other studies conducted within the N...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
