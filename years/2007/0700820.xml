<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merits: This project involves the development of an optical receiver technology that can provide a dramatic leap in performance.  The research approach used is based on a novel amplification device called the Solid-state Impact-ionization Multiplier.  This device employs the same gain mechanism found in avalanche photodiodes but has physical advantages that allow for lower-noise amplification and thus improved receiver sensitivity.  The basic mechanism of the Solid-state Impact-ionization Multiplier has been demonstrated by fabricating devices in silicon and measuring gain and frequency responses.  Computer simulations have been used to design a next generation device capable of high speeds (2.5 Gbit/s).  The premise of this proposed research program is that high-speed Solid-state Impact-ionization Multipliers can be fabricated and integrated with photodiodes and post amplifiers to produce extreme sensitivity optical communication receivers.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: The research program outlined above has significant broader impact.  In addition to advancing receiver and device science and technology, the work will incorporate a strong educational component that will take advantage of the cooperation between BYU and industry partners.  Graduate students will participate in device simulation, fabrication, packaging, and testing.  Undergraduate research will also be integrated into the project and will specifically be involved in the creation of demonstration models that will be used for an outreach program.  This outreach will be centered on BYU's Summer of Academic Refinement (SOAR) program.  SOAR allows hundreds of under-represented minority high school students to spend several summer weeks on the BYU campus preparing for college admissions and learning about different programs of study including those in science and engineering.  Workshops with SOAR students will use newly created demos to introduce them to the principles behind optical communications, optoelectronics, and the specific research being pursued at BYU.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We have demonstrated and published results for the Solid-state Impact-ionization Multiplier operating with gain for DC input signals and low bandwidth AC signals.  These measured results were made for SIM devices that have utilized a Schottky metal contact as an injection point for current into the semiconductor as well as SIM devices using a PN junction injection point.  In our studies of the frequency response of the SIM, we determined that trying to inject current into the SIMs depletion region resulted in an effective resistance at the injection node that could be characterized by Reff = bkT/I, where k is the Boltzmann constant, T the temperature, I the input current, and b a constant greater or equal to 1 that relates to the shape and extent of the depletion region inside the SIM.     We intended the SIM to be useful for both optical communication receivers and for extremely low-current amplification (single photon) applications, but knew that the large RC parameters at the injection node would limit the SIMs usefulness.  With these considerations in mind, we spent a significant amount of time exploring different types of structures to try and reduce the Reff for the SIM.  Current injection schemes we have investigated through modeling and device fabrication include ohmic contact injection, tunneling injection, Zener breakdown schemes, multiple electrodes, and field enhancement. In every case, we reached the conclusion that the best we could do when injecting into a depletion region (required for impact ionization) was something that resulted in Reff = bkT/I.  Two PhD students concentrated on SIM research and were supported by this grant.  Both graduated and are currently working at Sandia National Laboratory.  Three undergraduate students also worked on this project.  All of them are either in graduate school or working for microelectronic companies.  Another outcome of this project was an outreach activity involving the design and construction of portable units that demonstrate optical communications.  The units have been used for visits at local schools, open houses for minority student visitors, and engineering student recruitment events.
