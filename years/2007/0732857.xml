<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This collaborative project will document geographic patterns of genetic variation in both prehistoric and modern human populations along the North Slope of Alaska and assess how the ancient residents of arctic Alaska are related to contemporary Inupiaq populations throughout the circumarctic region. This will be achieved by the characterization of maternally inherited mitochondrial (mt)DNA sequences, paternally inherited Y-chromosome markers, as well as biparentally inherited autosomal genetic markers in both the archaeologically derived prehistoric samples and the contemporary populations of the North coast of Alaska.  Direct comparison of patterns of genetic variation in prehistoric populations and their possible modern descendants, and the placement of this biological variation in archaeological (temporal) context, is a powerful tool for the reconstruction of population history.  Although the prehistoric genetic data will come from well-known archaeological contexts (e.g., Nuvuk), the research team will also directly date a subsample of the prehistoric material to confirm the temporal placement of the samples.  They will also generate stable isotope data from the ancient samples to facilitate reconstruction of prehistoric diets, paleoecology of the region, and contribute to the reconstruction of ancient migration/colonization events. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The data to be generated by this project, on both extant and prehistoric populations, will afford a definitive genetic characterization of the Inupiat people of the northwestern American arctic, and permit testing several hypotheses regarding the origin of the eastern arctic Inuit population.  Additionally, the research undertaken here will permit a much more detailed analysis and understanding of the Thule expansion across the North American high arctic, one of the last great transcontinental migrations and colonization events.  A fuller understanding of this human dispersal will permit us to identify genetic signatures of rapid colonization, replacement versus admixing colonization models, and help clarify the origin and history of North American arctic populations.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We met the primary objectives of this project which were to (1) obtain DNA samples from North Slope residents, past and present, (2) determine the maternal and paternal lineages in these populations, and (3) use this genetic data to determine the evolutionary relationships of the contemporary and prehistoric peoples of the North Slope.   The Northwestern University group was responsible for conducting the research that pertains to the contemporary (i.e. living) North Slope populations, and we report on the results of this research herein.  Specifically, we (1) completed genotyping of variants in the maternally inherited mitochondrial (mt) genome, which define the four primary maternal lineages found in Native North Americans, in all samples collected;  (2) directly sequenced the hypervariable segment (HVS) in the mtDNA genome to identify the maternal sublineages present in the samples; (3) sequenced the entire mitochondrial genome in a subset of these individuals to better characterize the diversity present, as well as the geographic patterns of the observed diversity; (4) genotyped variants on the Y chromosome from all male samples to identify paternal lineages to complement the maternal lineages; (5) conducted population genetic analyses of the maternal and paternal lineages to test models of Inupiaq/Inuit prehistory and history in the North American Arctic.  We found that each community in the North Slope showed genetic ties with other communities in the region while also maintaining some distinctiveness. Maternal lineages were more widely shared than paternal lineages suggesting women have been more mobile in terms of residency than men in this region. Sharing of maternal lineages was more common along the coastline than with interior communities suggesting population movements were more common along the coastline than to/from the interior. We also showed that any mtDNA haplotypes present in the eastern (i.e. Canada and Greenland) North American Arctic are found in the North Slope of Alaska suggesting that Northern Alaska served as a source population for migrations eastward. This pattern hold true for contemporary Inuit populations, Thule populations, and ancient Paleo-Eskimo populations suggesting Northern Alaska is the homeland of populations further east.   One post-doctoral fellow was trained, as well as three additional research professionals were partially supported.  Multiple presentations were made at national and international scientific meetings, and several manuscripts are in preparation for submission to peer-reviewed scientific journals.  We were awarded a supplement on this proposal (along with collaborative project OPP-0732846; OÆRourke PI) to have "return of results visits" to each of the North Slope communities that participated in the study.  During sampling visits and return of results visits local high school and/or college students were recruited to assist in the project.  Our hope is that these efforts foster an interest in science and will lead to future trainees in the sciences for underserved minority populations       Last Modified: 12/06/2013       Submitted by: Geoffrey Hayes]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
