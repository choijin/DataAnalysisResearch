<AbstractNarration>Each year, about one fifth of all of the carbon dioxide that is emitted to the atmosphere through human activities around the world comes from the clearing and burning of moist tropical forests.  During years of severe drought, large areas of forest catch fire, doubling these emissions.  Once burned, forests are more likely to burn again in a vicious cycle of forest degradation that further increases carbon emissions to the atmosphere as it damages rainforests.  This research will shed light on the processes that determine the response of forests to fire, and the likelihood of large-scale "savannization" of the Amazon - the transformation of rainforest into fire-prone brush vegetation.   It will achieve this through field experiments and measurements of burned forests that determine the effects of Amazon forest fire on subsequent invasion by flammable weeds and tree death - two factors that strongly influence the risk of further burning.  The data obtained will be used to modify a vegetation model of the Amazon that will be used to predict the likelihood of large-scale savannization and its potential contribution of carbon to the atmosphere.  Currently, models that predict the future of tropical forests in a warming world do not include fire, weed invasion, and land use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will fill an important gap in knowledge of how tropical forests in the Amazon will respond to climate change and growing economic pressures on tropical forests.  This project also will support international education student exchanges and public-outreach activities aimed at environmental literacy.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

Future projections of vegetation responses to climate change across drier portions of the Amazon require more than simulation of global climate forcing alone, they must also include interactions of extreme weather events, fire, and land-use change. Broader impacts: This project has resulted in numerous broader impacts related to education, outreach, and research facilities.  It has contributed to the training of three US graduate students, one US Hispanic graduate student and post-doctoral fellow, two post-doctoral fellows in the US (one Brazilian citizen, one US citizen), three Brazilian graduate students at US universities and seven Brazilian graduate students at Brazil universities. Collaborations among the principal investigators have led to several other interdisciplinary projects funded by NSF, NASA, CNPq, and the Belmont Forum, which are supporting numerous students and researchers in the US and Brazil. Tanguro Ranch where the fire experiments were performed has become the site of important collaborations among US, Brazilian, and European researchers and educational institutions, important non-governmental policy and research organizations (the Institute for Amazon Environmental Research-IPAM and Alian&ccedil;a da Terra-AT) and a large Brazilian soybean producing and trading company (Grupo Andre Maggi).

These communications have helped spread the importance of fire avoidance and suppression and riparian forest restoration as important forest conservation tools in the Amazon.
