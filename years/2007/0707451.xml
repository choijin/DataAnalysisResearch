<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;In 2000, the international collaboration entitled the "Long-range Plan for the Multinational Coordinated Arabidopsis thaliana Genome Research Project" concluded successfully with the release of the Arabidopsis thaliana genome sequence.  This marked the release of the first complete plant genome sequence and provided a wealth of new information to facilitate both basic research in Arabidopsis and translational approaches in other species.  In order to leverage this new resource, the Multinational Arabidopsis thaliana Functional Genomics Project was initiated in 2001 with the primary goal of determining a function for every Arabidopsis gene by the year 2010. The Project is coordinated by the MASC (Multinational Arabidopsis Steering Committee) which coordinates Arabidopsis functional genomics research activities taking place throughout the world and ensures a high level of international cooperation. The MASC comprises volunteer scientists representing various nations with active Arabidopsis functional research activities.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since 2002, a full-time coordinator has been employed to assist the MASC (and the North American Arabidopsis Steering Committee, NAASC) and facilitate progress on the goals and objectives of the Functional Genomics Project. This award provides funding to support the MASC Coordinator for two more years.  The specific duties of the coordinator include: (1) Function as the Coordinator and Executive Secretary for the MASC and the NAASC, (2) Together with TAIR (The Arabidopsis Information Resource) update, maintain, and expand the MASC websites to inform the research community about various large-scale activities (e.g. mutant collections, genome annotation and ontology improvements, proteome, metabolome, systems biology approaches, etc.), (3) Help organize and secure support for the annual Arabidopsis research conference (held in the U.S./North America for two out of every three years), (4) Serve as the production editor for the annual MASC progress report and other documents that the MASC produces, and (5) Perform outreach activities and act as a contact point between various public and private funding agencies, the MASC, the NAASC, and the research community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  The Multinational Coordinated Arabidopsis Functional Genomics Project has been a model of international research collaboration characterized by open sharing of information, data and research materials. The MASC has played a key role in the success of the Project. The MASC Coordinator will contribute to the continued success of the Project which will be ultimately measured by the community reaching the goal of identifying the function of all Arabidopsis genes by the year 2010.  Establishment and maintenance of functional genomics webpages hosted at TAIR and production and dissemination of the annual MASC report informs the community and the public about ongoing functional genomics projects in the Arabidopsis field.  The internet resources enabled by the coordinator are made available for a broad user group including students, school teachers, and researchers in resource poor countries. The annual International Conference on Arabidopsis Research provides an important platform for the international Arabidopsis community to exchange vital information and highlight progress in the field.  The Coordinator additionally performs outreach to under-represented minorities and scientists at Minority-Serving Institutions, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and 1890 Institutions to facilitate their participation in the annual Arabidopsis meetings.</AbstractNarration>
