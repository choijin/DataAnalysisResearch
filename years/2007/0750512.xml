<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to develop the prototype of a characterization system which can perform IR spectroscopy and imaging at sub-100nm spatial resolution and thus break the 5 micron resolution barrier that has limited IR spectroscopy for the last 50 years. This 50x breakthrough in spatial resolution is enabled by the proprietary technique of Photo-Thermal Induced Resonance (PTIR) whose feasibility has already been demonstrated in the Phase I work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IR spectroscopy is a critical analytical technique which itself comprises a $1 Billion/yr industry. However, its spatial resolution limitation has seriously limited researchers who need information on nanoscale chemical composition. The potential impact of nanoscale IR ranges from new materials discovery to interfacial property improvements in high value applications.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This NSF SBIR Phase II project has focused on developing new technology and instrumentation in order to collect chemical information from a sample at the nanoscale.  The specific technology involves combining Atomic Force Microscopy and infrared spectroscopy.  Conventional infrared spectroscopy is the most widely used technique for chemical characterization, but fundamental limits prevent it from being applied at the nanoscale.  Atomic Force Microscopy can provide nanoscale measurements of the structure of a sample but do not provide chemical information.  The combination of these two techniques allows significant benefits in terms of spatial resolution and the ability to correlate structure with chemical information.  There are billions of dollars of global investments in nanoscience and nanotechnology.  From this, there is a large and growing class of complex materials with physical and chemical structures on the sub-micron length scale designed to achieve specific performance targets.  These materials need characterization at a length scale commensurate with their structure.  The AFM-IR platform developed during this project enables a wide range of high-resolution characterization methodologies.  We have seen significant interest in nanoscale infrared spectroscopy for the development of materials including polymer blends, multilayer thin films, photovoltaics and solar cells, organic LEDs, pharmaceuticals and life sciences, and biofuels research.  Filling this critical gap in the characterization toolset will substantially accelerate the rate of technological and commercial advances in these fields.  During this project, we developed a system which could achieve a spatial resolution 50X better than conventional Infrared spectroscopy.  In addition, this system has the ability to perform simultaneous measurements of the structure, chemical and mechanical properties of a sample.  The technology is rapid and easy to use allowing measurements of a wide range of materials.  Additionally, the system incorporates the ability to measure thermal transitions in the same sample with nanoscale resolution.
