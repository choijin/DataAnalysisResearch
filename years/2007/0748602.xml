<AbstractNarration>The main objectives of this project are: (A) the development of a parameterization method to determine particle nucleation rates with uncertainty bounds from vertically resolved field data, including the 2004 New England Air Quality Study (NEAQS); (B) a sampling campaign that ties together extensive ground-based measurements with information from aircraft vertical profiles; and (C) application of the method to new and existing data to predict new particle formation (NPF) in the continental troposphere.  The sampling plan will leverage existing ground-based measurements and utilize vertical profiling tools from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), in particular their light aircraft Airborne Aerosol Observatory, AAO.  The project includes ten months of ground-based sampling of ultrafine particle concentrations, size distribution, physical properties, sulfur dioxide, and ammonia concentrations and a one-month intensive campaign with the addition of measurements of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and speciated volatile organic compounds (VOCs).  These will be supplemented by vertical profiles of a smaller suite of aerosols and gases using the AAO.  The measurements will be conducted in Bondville, IL to take advantage of naturally occurring horizontal and vertical concentration gradients, as well as other existing measurements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts will be achieved as improved simulation and measurement capabilities for NPF are applied to ongoing efforts to separate the health effects of particles by size (e.g., ultrafine vs. fine) and by source (e.g., in situ nucleation vs. combustion).  Collaborations with researchers from both the particle health effect and aerosol-climate fields will allow them to benefit from the results of this project.  Additionally, an outreach program for high school science teachers will improve science education in Iowa.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ During the period Sept 2008 &ndash; Aug 2014, the Stanier research group at the University of Iowa researched questions regarding ultrafine particles (less than 100 nm) in the atmosphere, with a goal to strengthen the ability of the scientific community to predict the concentration and impact of these small particles.  Ultrafine aerosol particles (UFPs), and the process that creates them from atmospheric chemical reactions (called New Particle Formation or NPF), highly influence the population of aerosol particles in the atmosphere.  Characteristics of this particle population are important to cloud brightness, cloud lifetime, weather, and climate; they are further important to human health effects and lung-particle interactions of UFPs.  The major activities of the research group were to: (1) analyze  data from an important 20-year record of UFPs from central Illinois, and analyze aerosol data from Mexico City collected by our team; (2) deploy aerosol monitoring equipment in a 10-month continuous campaign in central Illinois; (3) customize a 3-dimensional regional simulation of weather, aerosols, and air pollution for prediction of UFPs; and (4) explore the novel idea of UFP creation from silicon through atmospheric chemical reactions.   The research group also designed and hosted a summer professional development workshop for  middle school teachers.   The workshop helped the teachers learn and incorporate the latest scientific knowledge and teaching practices into their classroom units on climate, energy, and weather.  Furthermore, the research team used the equipment and data analysis skills obtained during the project to respond to an air quality emergency in Iowa City in 2012, when large quantities of smoke containing UFPs were emitted from a major tire fire lasting 18 days.   The major outcomes of the research can be divided into scientific outcomes and human resource development outcomes.  Scientific outcomes include:  (a) Detailed characterization of the aerosol size distribution and rate of production of UFPs in the central U.S. and in Mexico City.  In Mexico City, the UFP concentration in spring 2006 was about 20,000 particles per cubic centimeter.  Concentrations each morning in Mexico City were controlled by local emissions, while afternoon concentrations were strongly influenced by NPF which occurred on 38% of the sampled days.  In contrast, the UFP concentration in central Illinois is a factor of four lower, is dropping at 10% per decade, and has important hourly, day-to-day, vertical, and seasonal patterns.    (b) Compilation of a 10-month record of the UFP population characteristics in central Illinois.  This dataset was collected July 2013-June 2014 and the research team is in the process of final quality assurance checks.  It will be made publically available to researchers worldwide through the internet.   (c) Simulation using the nucleation-explicit version of a state-of-science atmospheric and weather simulation tool WRF-Chem predicts many aspects of the UFP population at our measurement sites.      (d) Atmospheric modeling of oxidized cyclic siloxane gases is consistent with a diffuse photochemical source of aerosol Si, and observations performed by our collaborator, Murray Johnston at the University of Delaware, confirm the presence of Si in UFPs likely of photochemical origin.    (e) During an 18-day fire in Iowa City of a landfill liner comprised of 1.3 million shredded tires, emission factors were determined allowing prediction of emission rates and concentrations in future similar events.  Smoke included substantial emissions of SO2, UFPs, and fine particulate matter.  Collaborating groups investigated and published profiles for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, metals, and toxic organic gases.  The measurements characterized many aspects of this source type for the first time, and important differences between the field measurements and widely used laboratory burn results from the 1990s were ident...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
