<AbstractNarration>Engineering - Electrical (55)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is developing and evaluating hands-on modules for use in lecture-based, introductory electric circuits courses. The modules are based upon the problem-based learning framework and they are modeled after the STAR-Legacy cycle.  They start with a challenge to the students and then require them to gather information and to choose, implement, and evaluate a solution.  To determine success, a traditional treatment-control group methodology is being used to measure improvements in learning. In addition to the control group, there are two treatment groups: one where the students are exposed to the modules via simulation and one where the students are exposed to the modules in a hands-on manner. Mastery will be measured via assessment instruments that focus on conceptual understanding of DC and AC circuit concepts. These instruments will help to identify what role these hands-on modules played in improving student achievement and will be used to drive future development of appropriate materials. Coupling the assessment surveys with demographic data is allowing the investigators to examine how improvements in learning vary among diverse populations. They plan to disseminate their modules through conference and journal publications and to promote their use in other engineering programs, particularly with those in Texas.  Regarding broader impacts, the project addresses diversity by promoting pedagogies which research has shown to be effective in the retention of underrepresented ethnic groups and women in engineering. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
