<AbstractNarration>This experimental research program will explore fundamental optical physics and applications using far-infrared terahertz (THz) radiation. The PI has previously extended the concept and utility of parallel-plate waveguides to that of a much larger two-dimensional plane.  Within this plane two-dimensional quasi-optical elements have demonstrated THz guiding and diffraction.   This project will investigate optical physics with recently designed two-dimensional quasi-optical components with negative index of refraction.  Researchers will measure the refractive properties and assess the utility of these extremely dispersive components.  In addition, the program will experimentally measure and theoretically study the propagation of THz surface electromagnetic waves (plasmons) on planar subwavelength arrays of holes in thin metal films. The experiments are designed to resolve a discrepancy with the theoretically predicted very large transverse extent of the THz surface plasmons and previously observed transmission through hole arrays.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program will transform the previously developed technique of waveguide THz Time-Domain Spectroscopy into a new spectral analysis technique with high sensitivity and frequency resolution for sensing and measuring the properties of thin layers of material.  This sensing technology is of great technological importance and the techniques are of major interests to many fields including organic chemistry and molecular biology. The researchers will assess the comparative strengths of sensing techniques using surface plasmons or parallel-plate waveguides in the THz spectral range.   The versatility and usefulness of the two-dimensional waveguide plane for reduced scale instrumentation will be demonstrated.  This project will also provide multidisciplinary research training for students and postdoctoral researchers in optical science, terahertz physics, and molecular sensing.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[One of the most promising and discussed applications of THz spectroscopy is the detection and identification of explosive materials. Previous work has measured the THz absorption of explosive solids, revealing a number of broad features associated with the signature vibrational modes of the material. However, the majority of this work has been performed on disordered polycrystalline pellet samples, resulting in strong inhomogeneous broadening of the absorption features, making their identification more difficult.   We have solved this problem, by our newly developed technique of waveguide THz-TDS, whereby an ordered polycrystalline film is formed on a metal surface and its THz vibrational response is characterized via a parallel plate waveguide (PPWG).  The planar order of the sample together with the formation of micro-crystals of high crystalline quality reduces the inhomogeneous broadening, resulting in considerably sharper and much more identifiable features. We applied our new technique of waveguide THz-TDS to the explosive solids RDX, and TNT, resulting in a dramatic sharpening of the vibrational absorption lines as the films are cooled to near 10 K. The (FWHM) linewidths measured by waveguide THz-TDS are in some cases more than an order of magnitude sharper than corresponding THz measurements with standard pellets of explosives, and reveal a rich, previously unseen, spectrum of approximately 20 narrow vibrational absorption lines between 0.5 and 3.5 THz. This new information can provide an extraordinary precise æspectral fingerprintÆ capable of identification by a series of unique vibrational absorption lines. Such narrow vibrational lines can also provide rigorous input to help guide theoretical modelling and advance the understanding of the vibrational properties of explosive solids.  During this contract we have also developed and  demonstrated a new coupling scheme for high resolution THz spectroscopy of micro-crystalline films using parallel-plate waveguides. Metal flares are used to couple the terahertz radiation into and out of the waveguide. Very good coupling ratios as high as 35% at 1 THz from a collimated free-space beam into a sub-wavelength gap are obtained. This microwave approach is compared in terms of coupling ratio and spectral characteristics to the established technique of quasi-optic coupling to parallel-plate waveguides using silicon lenses. Various samples at room and cryogenic temperatures were measured to show the capabilities of flare coupling for high resolution terahertz spectroscopy.  This easy-to-use and low-cost alternative can match the performance (coupling ratio, spectral resolution, required sample quantity) of the PPWG with lens coupling.     The propagation of electromagnetic waves in the atmosphere is determined by the relatively small frequency dependent index of refraction n(&omega;) and absorption coefficient &alpha;(&omega;).  Because the index is quite small, the refractivity term [n(&omega;) -1] is usually discussed.  Accurate knowledge of the refractivity limits the precision of speed of light measurements, determinations of frequency from highly accurate wavelength measurements, precise radar measurements, synchronization of GPS time and the precision of GPS distance determinations.  The most variable component of the atmosphere is the amount of water vapor, which can change in less than 1 hour.  Even though water vapor is only one percent of the total atmosphere, at 50 % relative humidity (RH) water vapor can account for more than 20% of the refractivity.  The refractivity of water vapor is composed of two parts, a frequency independent part applicable from microwaves up to THz into the infrared and the visible, and a strongly frequency dependent part together with strong absorption in the water vapor rotational spectrum from 0.2 to 10 THz.  Previously, until our recent results described here, all measurements of the refractivity of water vapor, determined the sum of both p...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
