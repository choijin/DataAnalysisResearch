<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;Despite their lack of joints or rigid limbs, soft-bodied animals are capable of complex and precise movements. Such movements often involve a large number of muscles and yet control is accomplished in most cases with relatively few neurons. One ultimate goal of these studies is to understand how flexible movements are controlled by relatively simple nervous systems. This work will use a large caterpillar, the tobacco hornworm (Manduca sexta), because it offers several powerful advantages for analyzing interactions between the nervous system and the mechanical responses of soft tissues. The experiments will use force measurements, motion capture, and recordings of nerve activity, to establish how Manduca controls its movements in different behavioral contexts. In addition, both the encoding of sensory information by stretch receptors, and the responses of muscles to neural stimuli, will be measured during natural cycles of stretching. Together, these experiments will provide a comprehensive description of how soft-bodied legged locomotion is controlled, and provide new insights into the role of soft materials in stable movements. This work will also have broader impacts in the fields of biomechanics, engineering, and robotics. For example, it is important to know how soft tissues contribute to the control and stability of running animals and equally for prosthetic devices. To this end, these studies are being used in collaborative projects to help design and build new types of maneuverable soft-bodied climbing robots. In addition to its intrinsic scientific importance, this research will provide completely new training opportunities at undergraduate, graduate, and advanced levels of education, but most importantly, across biological, mathematical, and engineering disciplines. The work will be carried out in association with a new biology and engineering facility at Tufts which will support cross-disciplinary research and training in all aspects of soft materials and their control in animals and useful devices. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
