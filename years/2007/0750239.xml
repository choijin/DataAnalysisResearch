<AbstractNarration>This award by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program supports Professor Daniel G. Nocera at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for the exploration of efficient, and potentially economical, storage of solar energy in the form of chemical bonds.  Basic chemical systems will be designed to provide multiple (usually two or four) electron equivalents for the conversion of water or hydrochloric acid and light into high energy products (hydrogen and oxygen or hydrogen and chlorine).  Cobalt and rhodium Pacman (tethered diphorphyrin ligands) and Hangman (ligand architectures in which an acid group is positioned in proximity to the metal-hydride site) motifs will be examined electrochemically and photochemically, respectively, for their ability to generate dihydrogen (H2).  Cobalt porphyrinogen systems will also be employed for dihydrogen generation.  Dr. Nocera has been successful in raising public awareness of the global energy problem and the role that chemistry can play in addressing the energy challenge by appearing on national news, TV, radio programs, and other broadcast venues.  He has made significant contributions to curriculum development by producing energy teaching modules for WGBH-TV, the CATALYST Program, and Science News for Kids.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The supply of secure, clean, sustainable energy is arguably the most important scientific and technical challenge facing humanity in the 21st century. The imperative for the discipline of chemistry is to meet this energy need in a sustainable and environmentally responsible way. This research program responds to this obligation by seeking to develop a reaction chemistry that permits H2 generation. But this is not enough. If the link between H2 generation and carbon-based fuel supplies is to be severed, then the oxidative half of any H2 generating cycle must also be solved, preferably using sunlight to drive the reaction. Two logical sources for H2 emerge - H2O and HX (X = halide). Both HCl and H2O splitting store approximately the same amount of energy, which may be released by an appropriately designed fuel cell. For either source, significant fundamental issues confront H2 generation schemes. These issues become immediately apparent when parsed into their constituent redox half reactions. Not only is the reductive generation of H2 from HX and H2O splitting a multielectron event, but so is the oxidative half reaction. It is here that efficiencies suffer. In order to close a catalytic cycle, the M&ndash;X or M&ndash;O bond must be activated. In the case of HX, a two-electron oxidation must accompany H2 generation. With water as the source of H2, the oxidative half of the reaction requires four electrons, and necessarily involves the intimate coupling of electron transfer to proton transfer.  In driving any closed H2 photogeneration cycle, new approaches should be considered that diverge from the typical photochemical strategy of the last 30 years &ndash; namely one-electron transfer reactions of a photo-excited state. The chemistry of solar fuels generation is not only (1) multielectron but it also encompasses (2) coupling to protons to ensure low energy kinetics barriers.
