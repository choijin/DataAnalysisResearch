<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this multidisciplinary activity is to design, make and characterize nanocomposites consisting of multiple metals in a dielectric. The approach will be to use theory and experiments to design and discover novel optical nanomaterials. Optical theory will be utilized to understand the superior absorption of light by plasmons in metal nanoparticles. Hydrodynamic theory and first principles computer simulations will be used guide a knowledge-based approach to the design&lt;br/&gt;of functional nanocomposites consisting of specific concentrations and types of metals in dielectrics. The resulting three dimensional nanocomposite structures will be manufactured by utilizing thin film&lt;br/&gt;deposition in conjunction with laser based pattern formation. These nanomaterials will be characterized by structural and optical techniques in order to test and verify the design as well as manufacturing&lt;br/&gt;processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The benefit of this integrated research activity will be towards advancing the science and technology of cost-effective manufacturing of nanomaterials for applications in optics, plasmonics and nanophotonics. The innovative use of self-organized patterns with a theoretical and practical understanding of nanostructure-optical property correlation will enable cross-cutting engineering and basic science approaches to enable multi-functional nanocomposites. These nanocomposites will find use as broadband solar absorbing coatings for energy harvesting in photovoltaics, as materials for light waveguiding in length scales below the optical diffraction limit, and in integrated Si photonics. &lt;br/&gt;The broader impact from this research will be in the training and education of undergraduate and graduate students in interdisciplinary science and engineering areas of optics, hydrodynamics, materials science and nanotechnology. This will lead to a workforce of highly skilled professionals who will ensure the leadership role of the United States of America in technologies of the future.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
