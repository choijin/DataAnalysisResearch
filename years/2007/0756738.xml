<AbstractNarration>This project focuses on increasing the number of majors and graduates across various STEM areas (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) through the incorporation of activities that strengthen recruitment, retention, and persistence among students.  This is a holistic project that concentrates on all stages of a STEM student's undergraduate experience and combines the strengths of the University's support infrastructure with efforts and expertise of faculty, staff, students, administrators, and the professional community, while building on research, best practices, and local lessons learned.  The major strategies incorporated in the STEP program plan of activities are: a Calculus Bootcamp Summer Bridge Program; an Undergraduate Research Program; Peer Learning and Mentoring Initiatives, Faculty Development Efforts, Development of Learning Communities; and Engagement with professional student organizations on campus.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ MemphiSTEP (MSTEP) is a multi-year project focusing on retention and persistence to graduation to increase the number of majors and graduates across the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) areas at the University of Memphis (UofM).

The project goal is to increase the number of baccalaureate graduates in STEM (Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Mathematical Sciences, Computer Science, Earth Science and Engineering) at the UofM from 225 (Year 1: 2008-09) to 335 (Year 5: 2012-13) then 350 per year for the next five years, primarily through improvements in retention. The project implements the following retention strategies designed to increase graduation rates:  Summer Mathematics Bridge Bootcamp: Refresher program conducted in the summer designed to help boost mathematics skills and facilitate student networking.  Networking Program: Group activities, including mixers, lunch and learn events and field trips to facilitate interactions and collaborations between STEM students and faculty.  Mini Grant Program: Students from registered UofM STEM clubs apply for small grants to conduct events designed to engage STEM undergraduates and boost club membership.  Undergraduate Research Program: STEM students participate in paid research under the supervision of a STEM faculty member over the course of 1-2 semesters (averaging 5 hours per week).  Travel Award Program: Students receive small grants to attend STEM conferences and events to present work and/or network with STEM students, faculty and industry members.  Learning Communities: STEM students take sets of classes together such that they build peer networks while completing classes needed to complete STEM degrees.  Faculty seminar: Monthly seminars (called STEMinars) for UofM STEM faculty to present and discuss effective techniques and developments in STEM education.  UofM STEM graduation numbers increased over the duration of the project and mapped on to projected benchmarks. Three Hundred and Fifty Two (352) STEM degrees were awarded in academic year 2013-14, matching the 350 benchmark for 2013-2014.  Since the onset of MSTEP in 2008-09 there has been a 60%.increase in STEM degrees awarded at the UofM.  In line with graduation trends, the number of STEM students taking part in MSTEP activities more than doubled over the course of the grant (6% in 2008-09; 14% by 2013-14).

There is now a fully staffed, university-funded STEM center - Center for Research in STEM Innovation and Learning (CRISTAL).
