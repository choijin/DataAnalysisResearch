<AbstractNarration>The Design and Analysis of Experiments 2007 Conference (DAE 2007) will be hosted by the University of Memphis in October 31 to November 3, 2007.  This will be the fifth in a series of conferences whose principal aims are to provide support and encouragement to junior researchers in the field of design and analysis of experiments and to stimulate interest in topics of practical relevance to science and industry.  The focus of DAE2007 is on emerging areas of research in experimental design, as well as novel innovations in traditional areas.  The conference will cover topics of importance to the academic and industrial community, such as screening experiments, computer experiments, sequential designs, split plot and split lot designs, designs for biomedical experiments and genetic studies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The design and analysis of experiments is at the foundation of the scientific method. It is used in applications across all scientific disciplines and engineering. It is used throughout business and industry to improve the reliability of processes and equipment and to identify and understand how process factors affect output. It is used in medicine, especially in the design of clinical trials and biomedical experiments and is also used in many other scientific disciplines. The advancement of statistical theory and methodology over the past years has resulted in the development of sophisticated methods capable of analyzing complex experiments. This has given rise to a demand for efficient designs for these experiments. At the same time, a new generation of enthusiastic and talented researchers in design of experiments is needed in the years to come to carry out original theoretical and applied research in the emerging areas. The junior researchers of today need to be nurtured and encouraged to assume this role. For this purpose, DAE2007 will bring together senior and junior researchers and practicing statisticians from universities and industry to discuss research and the future directions of the field.  Additionally, DAE2007 will strengthen collaborative research between academia and industry and will broaden the participation of underrepresented groups, mainly minorities and women. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
