    <AbstractNarration>This project is devoted to the study of stochastic analysis in&lt;br/&gt;infinite dimensions. The main topic is stochastic differential&lt;br/&gt;equations (SDEs) in infinite-dimensional spaces, such as&lt;br/&gt;infinite-dimensional groups, loop groups and path spaces,&lt;br/&gt;non-commutative $L^p$-spaces. The questions of existence and&lt;br/&gt;uniqueness of solutions of the SDEs and smoothness of solutions will&lt;br/&gt;be studied. These solutions will be used to construct and study heat&lt;br/&gt;kernel measures (a non-commutative analogue of Gaussian or Wiener&lt;br/&gt;measure) on infinite-dimensional manifolds such as an&lt;br/&gt;infinite-dimensional Heisenberg group and the Virasoro group. In&lt;br/&gt;general these infinite-dimensional spaces do not have an analogue of&lt;br/&gt;the Lebesgue measure or a Haar measure in the group case. The PI&lt;br/&gt;intends to study Cameron-Martin type quasi-invariance of these&lt;br/&gt;measures. It is an interesting question in itself, and in addition it&lt;br/&gt;can give rise to unitary representations of the infinite-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;groups. It is proposed to study properties of square-integrable&lt;br/&gt;holomorphic functions, including non-linear analogues of the&lt;br/&gt;Segal-Bargmann transform and bosonic Fock space representations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this proposal is in providing a better&lt;br/&gt;understanding of Gaussian-type measures on infinite-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;curved spaces. In particular, the proposed research will connect&lt;br/&gt;diverse fields: stochastic analysis, geometric analysis and&lt;br/&gt;mathematical physics. This research project has broader impacts on&lt;br/&gt;diverse areas of mathematics, and it involves activities which help&lt;br/&gt;to disseminate the knowledge of new findings in the field. The&lt;br/&gt;proposed research is motivated by several subjects.&lt;br/&gt;Infinite-dimensional spaces such as loop groups and path spaces&lt;br/&gt;appear in physics, for example, in quantum field theory and string&lt;br/&gt;theory. The PI proposes to formalize and study some of the notions&lt;br/&gt;used in physics, such as measures on certain infinite-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;spaces. In addition, it has a significant educational component,&lt;br/&gt;namely, it involves two graduate students of the PI.</AbstractNarration>
