    <AbstractNarration>"Proyecto Dinosaurios" is a comprehensive program of scientific research and training for American Hispanic undergraduates, using the extensive collections of dinosaurs at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County. Three students will be recruited from the Los Angeles Community College (LACC) for a year of research, data collection, analysis, and public presentation of results. They will have access to diverse collections and curatorial research, extensive reference collections, and scientific training that is uniquely possible in large natural history museums. A series of comprehensive workshops and the opportunity to participate in weekly seminars will supplement the research activities of the participants. The workshops will provide students with practical knowledge relating to fossil preparation, curation, illustration, and analysis. A two-week field trip in the renowned dinosaur graveyards of Montana will provide students with hands-on experience about how dinosaurs are discovered and collected, as well as the fundamentals of stratigraphy, field data collecting and GPS navigation. The program is designed to encourage research experiences in a natural history museum and as a vehicle to expose students to the professional possibilities for individuals interested in geoscience research and education. Participants will be evaluated periodically by the Principal Investigator as well as with self-evaluative activities.</AbstractNarration>
