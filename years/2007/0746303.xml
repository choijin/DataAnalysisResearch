<AbstractNarration>The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is awarded a grant by the NSF Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program for a promising young researcher to study gene regulatory sequences and their evolution, combined with an educational agenda directed towards training of graduate students and introducing middle-school girls to topics in bioinformatics. The research component will build probabilistic frameworks to discover cis-regulatory modules in metazoan genomes and elucidate how they have evolved across moderate to high divergence times. The computational methods will also explore what a well-studied regulatory system, e.g., fruitfly development, can teach us about the workings of an uncharted regulatory system, e.g., honeybee behavior. From a technical perspective, the novel thrusts will be on (1) multiple species comparison in the regime of poor sequence alignment, (2) adaptive motif discovery that exploits knowledge of binding sites in one species to predict sites in diverged species, and (3) compositional rules of cis-regulatory modules in terms of the types and arrangements of binding sites within them. The educational component focuses on (1) development of an educational software package for probabilistic analysis of regulatory DNA sequences, to be used to train graduate students, (2) outreach activities that motivate middle school girls to consider future careers in science and engineering, and (3) development of courses on bioinformatics at the undergraduate and graduate levels.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This CAREER project led to a diverse range of findings pertaining to how the activity of genes (called ægene expressionÆ) is regulated differently from one cell to another, from one time point to another, or from one environmental condition to another. Key advances made during this project include:     (1)   Sophisticated computational methods were developed for the discovery of cis-regulatory modules, which are segments of the DNA that regulate gene expression.     (2)   New computational methods were developed to understand the functioning of cis-regulatory modules. Such understanding will lead us to better predict the effect of mutations in DNA, such as those found in people with certain diseases. The new methods were based on fundamental physical principles and trained on high resolution data generated by the research community.     (3)   New statistical methods were developed to understand the molecular behavior of social behavior, by analyzing gene expression information from brains of honeybees.     (4)   Computational methods were applied for the annotation of those parts of the genome that are responsible for development of an embryo, using the fruitfly as a model organism, since the study of embryonic development is perhaps the most advanced in this organism.     (5)   The evolution of regulatory sequences was studied in unprecedented quantitative detail, using precise mathematical models of evolution, that were developed in the course of this project.     (6)   Collaborations with experimental biologists were formed in order to test computational predictions made during this project.     (7)   Several graduate students were trained with support from this project, leading ultimately to their Ph.D. dissertation. Several of these students have since moved on to more advanced stages in their academic career, including two students who are on the Faculty at prestigious universities.     (8)   Three high school students and four undergraduate students were mentored in their research activities on problems in bioinformatics.     (9)   Research findings were disseminated through over 20 journal articles and several oral presentations at top departments and conferences.     (10)Computational approaches developed were made available through freely-downloadable code as well as through web servers.
