<AbstractNarration>Technical: This project addresses a critical obstacle to the widespread use of carbon nanotubes, that of controlled sorting. The project approach involves surfactant mixtures and density gradient ultracentrifugation (DGU) to sort single wall nanotubes (SWNTs) by diameter, chirality and electronic structure. Preliminary results for DGU on surfactant encapsulated SWNTs have demonstrated potential for the approach. The following tasks will be pursued: understanding and tuning the structure-density relationship for surfactant encapsulated SWNTs as a function of surfactant type, co-surfactant ratio, density gradient, and pH; optimizing iterative separations where the DGU conditions are sequentially varied to achieve concurrent diameter and metal/semiconductor separation; improved characterization of the structure and properties of chirality-resolved SWNTs using a complementary suite of characterization techniques including optical absorption spectroscopy, photoluminescence spectroscopy, pump-probe spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, scanning probe microscopy, and charge transport measurements; exploring the utility of chirality-resolved SWNTs in a wide range of device and materials applications such as complementary logic, transparent conductors, ultra-fast optical spectroscopy, templated assembly, nanocomposites, multi-analyte biosensors, and cell growth substrates. &lt;br/&gt;Non-technical: The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of electronic/photonic materials science with high technological relevance. An important component of the proposed activity is an education and outreach plan that complements and is well integrated with the research objectives. Education and outreach activities will include: undergraduate curriculum development in the form of nanoscience modules that can be directly inserted into the Materials Science and Engineering undergraduate curriculum; undergraduate research opportunities both in the PI's laboratory and across campus as enabled by the his role as Director of the Nanoscale Science and Engineering Center Research Experience for Undergraduates Program; outreach to pre-college students by collaborating with the Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, and Explorer Scouts on nanoscience events and a Nanotechnology Merit Badge; dissemination to the general public via the PI's membership on the Chicago Museum of Science and Industry (MSI) Physical Sciences Exhibit Advisory Panel.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) have attracted significant attention due to their outstanding multi-functional (i.e., electrical, optical, mechanical, and chemical) properties.  These nanomaterials have many applications such as high-speed electronics, conductive films, photovoltaics, field-emission sources, infrared optoelectronics, sensors, scanning probes, nanomechanical devices, mechanical reinforcements, hydrogen storage elements, and catalytic supports.  This diversity of applications for SWCNTs directly results from the size-dependence of their properties.  However, this size-dependence has also hindered industrial-scale technology based on SWCNTs.  In particular, since synthetic schemes lack control over critical structural parameters (e.g., diameter and chirality), currently available SWCNTs lack homogeneity in their properties, thus limiting their use in real-world technology.  Scalable and economical strategies for overcoming this polydispersity problem is critical for moving SWCNTs from research laboratory curiosities to critical components in high-performance commercially viable technologies.  In this program, density gradient ultracentrifugation has been employed to produce bulk quantities of SWCNTs separated by diameter, chirality, enantiomer, and electronic type.  The resulting monodisperse SWCNTs have enabled a wide range of fundamental studies and prototype device fabrication/testing.  Several publications and patent application resulted from this work and have served as the basis of NanoIntegris (http://www.nanointegris.com/), which is a start-up company that now supplies bulk quantities of high-performance SWCNTs to industrial, academic, and government researchers worldwide.  The results of this research have also been disseminated via a variety of education and outreach efforts including: (1) Research Experience for Undergraduates; (2) Boy, Girl, and Explorer Scout Nano Day; (3) Museum of Science and Industry Physical Sciences Exhibit; (4) Northwestern University Science Policy Action Network.
