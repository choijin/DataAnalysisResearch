<AbstractNarration>This interdisciplinary project investigates human cognition of spaces to improve virtual environments, both from a user and an author's perspective. The objectives are to (1) improve virtual environments so that better learning can occur in them, and (2) develop authoring methods for virtual environments informed by the cognitive demands that people have when learning spaces. This research project should advance the design and authoring of virtual environments by leveraging human cognitive capabilities. The programs seeks to develop a system to increase the user's sense of presence and sensitivity to the environmental scale of virtual environments. It further seeks to develop locomotion interfaces to assist exploring large virtual environments from within small physical ones. A goal is to employ human-centered representations for locomotion in virtual environments and to develop methods for skill acquisition in virtual environments.  This research proposal advances the scientific understanding of human cognition and learning as well.  The research proposes studies that will be informative about the broad role that environmental geometry and self-representation play in perception, orientation, and navigation, while controlling factors that are extremely difficult, if not impossible, to control in the real world. A rigorous evaluation program for all components of the project is planned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The importance of this proposal is that virtual environments provide people with opportunities to experience places and situations remote from their actual physical surroundings.  Virtual environments allow the simulation of real-world events in a controllable and re-usable environment. They potentially allow people to learn about an environment which, for reasons of time, distance, expense, and safety, would not otherwise be available.  Virtual environments could have a huge impact in education, entertainment, medicine, architecture, and training, but they are not widely used because of their expense and delicacy. The research program in this proposal should significantly improve the quality of learning in virtual environments, to reduce the time and cost of authoring virtual environments, and to overcome likely impediments to their widespread use.  Moreover, this proposal builds a scientific program to develop a better understanding of the cognitive capabilities of humans in immersive virtual environments, and does so in a way that will inform the design process for such environments and our understanding of how humans reason about space.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Virtual environments are three-dimensional graphical experiences of places or things that you see as if you were embedded inside a video game. Unlike a video game, they are used for learning or training in situations where it is too difficult or too expensive to learn or train in the real world. Unfortunately, building these virtual environments in a way that people can effectively learn in them is hard. One of the reasons it is hard is that people, for reasons that are not entirely understood, don't experience space and distance in a virtual environment in the same way that they do in the real world. Another way it's hard is that virtual environments are built with equipment housed inside a room. But if we wanted to train over a large area, like a city, we would have to move over that city, which is bigger than the room. We could do that with a joystick or hand controller, as is done in video games, but it turns out to be a lot harder to learn spaces that way than just by walking, so people get easily lost and confused. Other things like treadmills have problems, too.<br />This research project looked at ways of understanding why people find the space of virtual environments so disorienting and what we could do to fix it and create better environments.
