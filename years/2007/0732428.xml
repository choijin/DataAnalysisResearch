<AbstractNarration>Funds are provided to study the impact of physical variability on the processes and structure of the Bering shelf ecosystem, with special emphasis on how freshwater redistributed by the shelf circulation or introduced from sea ice melt modifies stratification and nutrient distributions. The principal investigators inquire how changes in sea ice affect advection and mixing; how variable fluxes of low-salinity, nutrient-deficient coastal waters may affect production; how cross-shelf fluxes are established and altered; how these fluxes might respond to climate change; how the seasonal stratification cycle is controlled; and how the buoyant coastal flow evolves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2008-2010 field effort will focus on the central Bering Sea shelf and will employ both hydrography, including extensive d18O sampling, and a nine-mooring array that spans most of the central shelf. The moorings variously will carry ADCPs, T/C recorders, fluorometers, and temperature chains. The measurements will be augmented by hydrographic and d18O sampling and drifter studies under other support. Analysis will also incorporate wind forcing, coastal discharges, surface buoyancy fluxes, and ice thickness and drift into the synthesized data set and its interpretation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These data, in conjunction with another mooring program funded elsewhere, will provide much of the background circulation and stratification information necessary to place the biological data from BEST in context.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The principal goal of the project was to identify the physical processes controlling the variability of the circulation, nutrients, sea ice, stratification, and water masses of the Bering shelf.  Such identification is necessary to understanding the functioning of the vast Bering shelf ecosystem, including its productivity, trophic structure, and commercial and subsistence fisheries, and to predict the future evolution of that ecosystem under a changing climate.  There were three major activities: field work, data processing, and analysis. The field work included three cruises during 2008-2010 to deploy and recover moored recording instruments and conduct shipborne oceanographic measurements, and twelve cruises during the same years to collect nearly 2300 oxygen isotope samples.  The latter allow distinguishing the effects on ocean salinity of freezing and melting of sea ice from those of evaporation, precipitation, and runoff.  The calibrated and processed data sets were submitted to the BEST program data center for archival, from whence they are readily available.  Our analytical strategy included both statistical and dynamical treatment of the complex data set itself, together with numerical modeling.   Through extensive new measurements and analyses we have substantially increased and improved understanding of the physical processes controlling the variability of the circulation, nutrients, stratification, water masses, and other components of the Bering shelf ecosystem.  This in turn supports ongoing and future investigations of that system, including its productivity, trophic structure, and commercial and subsistence fisheries.  Furthermore, our extensive moored measurements, as well as our very large high-quality O-18 data set, have created an important publicly available resource both for future modeling and for assessing present and future changes in the properties of the shelf waters and their circulation.    Additionally, the variable shelf circulation profoundly affects the distribution of both nutrients and plankton, and therefore the distribution and magnitude of primary and secondary productivity.  Our new understanding of that circulation, and especially of how its variability is forced by the winds on both local and regional scales, and with pronounced seasonal, interannual, and longer term variability, provides significant opportunities for predicting changes in the shelf ecosystem on a variety of trophic levels.
