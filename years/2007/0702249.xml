<AbstractNarration>Demands for online access to large data sets distributed across multiple  machines are prevalent both in large-scale enterprises and in scientific  settings. An example is remote data visualization for large-scale  applications running on peta-scale machines, where researchers are seeking  ways to accelerate the scientific processes they are carrying out via  real-time inspection and validation of the outputs from their running codes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research addresses a basic problem basic problem for the large-scale  data movements implied by such tasks, which is the substantial semantic gap  between application-level data exchanges and the I/O services provided by  underlying hardware and system platforms. For instance, at the device level,  data being moved may be described as a linear sequence of blocks, whereas  the application level views it as highly structured data on which it is  performing a complex checkpoint operation. To help close help close this  gap, for future virtualized execution platforms, this project realizes the &lt;br/&gt;notion of Abstract IO (A-IO) devices, where each such device can be designed  to provide useful new functionality to end user applications. Toward this  end, it exploits new system- and device -level virtualization technologies  to present to operating systems what appear to be physical devices, but are  actually virtual representations of such devices. For such `logical  devices', it then addresses the question regarding where to place their  higher level I/O device functions on future many-core platforms: on the  general computational cores of host machines or on specialized cores &lt;br/&gt;associated with devices. The utility of the approach is evaluated in the  context of two realizations of A-IO based devices (NIC and block device),  and with actual scientific and enterprise applications.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
