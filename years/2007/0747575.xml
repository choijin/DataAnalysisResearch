<AbstractNarration>Statistical learning is widely recognized as a very active area of interdisciplinary research, which lives between statistics, computer science, and optimization. This research offers a host of new statistical learning techniques for solving complicated learning problems, especially for high dimensional and noisy data. In particular, the investigator develops (1). several novel large-margin classifiers which are expected to yield highly competitive classification accuracy, class probability estimation, as well as variable selection; (2). a new regularization approach to estimate the covariance matrix for a class of nonstationary spatial autoregressive model; (3). a novel technique to assess statistical significance of clustering for high dimensional data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the rapid advance of technology, massive and complex data are being generated across many different scientific fields. Analyzing such data becomes more and more challenging. A major goal of this research is to provide a set of flexible statistical learning techniques. These tools should have beneficial impact on cancer research, medical imaging, microarray data analysis and spatial-temporal modeling. The investigator collaborates with a number of scientists in various fields outside of statistics such as biology, computer science, pharmacy, and genetics. The new developments allow scientists to analyze complex data with high prediction accuracy and increased interpretability. Efficient algorithms and software are developed for public use. The integration of the research goals with educational activities aims to help students at graduate, undergraduate, and high school levels and researchers from various disciplines to acquire state-of-the-art statistical learning methods and tools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major goals of this project, "CAREER: Flexible Statistical Learning for Complex Data", was to develop new methodology and theory in statistical learning, to disseminate the new research findings, and to educate students with cutting edge techniques in statistical machine learning.  Intellectual Merit:  During the entire project period, the PI made important contributions in development of methods and theory for the field of statistical learning. In particular, the PI developed new techniques for classification, clustering, and spatial covariance estimation. Many of these new developments have been reported in publications as well as disseminated in research conferences. This project leaded to over 20 publications in major statistics and machine learning journals. Several methods introduced in these publications are now widely used in the community.  Broader impacts:  The developed methods and theory through this project made important contributions to the field of statistics and beyond. Through collaborations with domain scientists such as pharmacy, genetics, the methods have been introduced and applied to other fields. In terms of education, the new research developments of the project were incorporated into the graduate course on statistical machine learning at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Furthermore, the project has directly benefited Ph.D student research training. Four graduated Ph.D students mentored by the PI were involved in the research developments of this project. In addition, the PI mentored two high school teachers for high school curriculum on statistical machine learning and data mining.  In summary, the original proposed goals of this project have been achieved, and the project resulted in fruitful outcomes both in terms of intellectual merit and broader impacts. The project leaded to productive research development and effective training and education in statistical machine learning.
