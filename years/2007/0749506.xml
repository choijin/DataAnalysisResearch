<AbstractNarration>This project will continue work on the development of new ligands for applications in asymmetric catalysis.  Studies will be focused on the application of recently discovered oxazoline derived ligands in enantioselective addition of activated halides to carbonyl compounds.  Additionally, the underlying controlling elements of ligand design will be explored using the modularity of the ligands investigated with the ultimate goal of more predictive power in catalyst design.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Professor Matthew S. Sigman of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Utah.  Professor Sigman's research focuses on the development of new, modular chiral ligands that will contribute to the rapid synthesis of chiral building blocks.  Such building blocks will have an immediate impact on synthesis in the pharmaceutical and agricultural industries.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A centerpiece of modern organic chemistry is the development of new catalytic methods to obtain valuable synthetic intermediates.  To optimize a desired metal-catalyzed process, one explores various reaction parameters including solvent, temperature, metal source, and ligand.  This inherently empirical procedure is often time consuming and can lead to unsatisfactory results for a given reaction.  These issues are exasperated when one considers asymmetric catalyst development, wherein the small energy differences in the diastereomeric transition states (~2-3 kcal/mol) leading to enantiomerically enriched products are not easily rationalized.  Furthermore, kinetic analyses of asymmetric catalytic reactions often reveal the general complexities of catalysis and highlight the importance of the Curtin-Hammett principle, but do not often expose the key catalyst structural features responsible for enantioselection or catalyst performance.  Therefore, the development of new catalytic processes and/or enantioselective catalysts continues to rely on considerable effort and intuition but not generally on quantitative approaches to design and optimization.  This underlying challenge in the field of catalysis leads to the question:  how does one design a new catalyst for a given reaction type without a long-term, empirical investigation of a broad set of conditions and multiple ligand classes?  Therefore, the central goal of our program is focused on developing general techniques that do not rely on detailed catalyst structural information to facilitate the design and optimization of new asymmetric catalysts for synthetically useful transformations.  In the last granting period, we provided a foundation to address this challenging goal where ligands were designed to permit the introduction of systematic changes in structure.  The incorporated ligand substituents were carefully selected to be parameterized using physical organic mechanistic precepts (i.e.,Hammett electronic parameters and Charton/Taft steric parameters).    This approach allows for ædesign of experimentÆ statistical approaches to model the resultant performance of each catalyst set to ultimately predict what type of ligand will result in optimal performance.  Success was found for both the correlation of steric-steric and steric-electronic effects in catalyst performance, providing the foundation for a new approach to catalyst optimization (see attached figure).
