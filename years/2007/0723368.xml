<AbstractNarration>This project is creating a second generation faculty development program to train information assurance (IA) faculty across a range of Maryland colleges and universities. The training program includes four components:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. A seminar series to introduce security related topics to interested faculty;&lt;br/&gt;2. An IA educators forum where more experienced educators can share their experiences teaching information assurance;&lt;br/&gt;3. A research mentorship program, where security researchers invite community college and junior faculty to work jointly with them on research problems in security; and&lt;br/&gt;4. An externship program where advanced faculty will work at CERT on joint research projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project structure ensures that faculty with different levels of skills and experience not only will be able to improve their own skill set, but also to share their knowledge with colleagues from different institutions. This project is led by Towson University and run in collaboration with the other 14 members of the Maryland Alliance for Information Security Assurance (MAISA). Towson University has been a Center of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Education since 2002 and Towson faculty members have extensive experience with this type of faculty development program. Faculty members at a range of institutions, from community colleges through to doctoral universities, are participating in this program through extensive institutional and individual collaborations. As a result of this project, it is expected that the number of MAISA member institutions will increase.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
