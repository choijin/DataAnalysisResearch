<AbstractNarration>Antman&lt;br/&gt;0708180&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     S. S. Antman and his coworkers treat a variety of dynamical&lt;br/&gt;and steady-state nonlinear problems for deformable rods, shells,&lt;br/&gt;and three-dimensional solid bodies that can suffer large and&lt;br/&gt;rapid deformations.  The bodies are composed of nonlinearly&lt;br/&gt;elastic, viscoelastic, plastic, viscoplastic, or magnetoelastic&lt;br/&gt;materials.  In each case, properly invariant, geometrically exact&lt;br/&gt;theories encompassing general nonlinear constitutive equations&lt;br/&gt;are used.  The goals of these studies are to (i) discover new&lt;br/&gt;nonlinear effects, (ii) determine thresholds in constitutive&lt;br/&gt;equations separating qualitatively different responses, (iii)&lt;br/&gt;determine general classes of constitutive equations that are both&lt;br/&gt;physically and mathematically natural, (iv) examine and predict&lt;br/&gt;important kinds of instabilities, (v) determine how existence,&lt;br/&gt;regularity, and well-posedness of solutions of the governing&lt;br/&gt;quasilinear systems of partial differential equations depend on&lt;br/&gt;material behavior, (vi) contribute to the theory of shocks and&lt;br/&gt;dissipative mechanisms in solids, and (vii) develop new methods&lt;br/&gt;of nonlinear analysis and of effective computation for problems&lt;br/&gt;of solid mechanics.  Antman is continuing to make carefully&lt;br/&gt;formulated physical theories accessible to mathematicians, and to&lt;br/&gt;make modern techniques of applicable analysis accessible to&lt;br/&gt;scientists and engineers, with special attention to graduate&lt;br/&gt;students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     S. S. Antman and his coworkers develop powerful new&lt;br/&gt;mathematical methods for analyzing the large and rapid&lt;br/&gt;deformations of solid bodies.  This work has applications both to&lt;br/&gt;new technological materials including "smart" materials and to&lt;br/&gt;old biological materials, such as living tissue.  (Although it&lt;br/&gt;has been known for 50 years how to derive the equations governing&lt;br/&gt;such deformations cleanly from first principles without ad hoc&lt;br/&gt;approximations, the mathematical tools for treating these&lt;br/&gt;equations are only now being developed and refined.)  The&lt;br/&gt;specific problems under study include (1) the deformation of thin&lt;br/&gt;shell-like bodies in a fluid flow, (2) the loss of stability of&lt;br/&gt;such a shell subjected to pulsating pressures, (3) the swimming&lt;br/&gt;of eels, (4) the rigorous justification of useful approximations&lt;br/&gt;for the motions of the body when the loads it bears are applied&lt;br/&gt;slowly or when the loads are very large or when the body is of&lt;br/&gt;light weight, (5) the buckling of shells, (6) strange effects for&lt;br/&gt;spinning bodies, (7) the development and the preclusion of shocks&lt;br/&gt;(which are large and sudden discontinuities in velocity and&lt;br/&gt;deformation), and (8) the construction of effective methods of&lt;br/&gt;computation.  Antman is continuing to make carefully formulated&lt;br/&gt;physical theories accessible to mathematicians, and to make&lt;br/&gt;modern techniques of applicable mathematics accessible to&lt;br/&gt;scientists and engineers, with special attention to graduate&lt;br/&gt;students.</AbstractNarration>
