<AbstractNarration>Interdisciplinary: 99&lt;br/&gt;A 5-year trial of a curricular innovation termed the Engaged Learning Group (ELG) is underway. ELG is distinct from traditional classes in several respects: ELG students live together in a residential community; they remain with their cohorts for four consecutive semesters; each ELG has an interdisciplinary academic focus; and students are mentored through inquiry-based research projects starting early in their college careers. One particular ELG focuses on the topic of energy, and its associated social, political, environmental and economic connections. This project supports the Energy ELG through the purchase of equipment (a model steam turbine, fuel cell demonstrator, alternative energy equipment and a water-source heat pump) and through support for in-depth assessment of ELG learning outcomes. Among these, we determine whether this innovation leads to increased energy literacy and comprehension of the role energy plays in various spheres of life, including government, the environment and the economy. If assessment of the ELG concept shows improvement over traditional course structures, it will be exported to other residential campus settings. The project is also successful at recruiting women. Key results and experiences are disseminated by publication, conference talks, and the internet.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
