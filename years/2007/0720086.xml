<AbstractNarration>The origin of cycles in sedimentary rocks has long been debated. For at least the past few million years a convincing case can be made that the cycles are often controlled by the periodic variations in Earth's orbit and rotation as well as interactions with nearby planets that produce climate variations every 20, 40, 100, and 400 ky. However in more ancient rocks the problem is much more difficult because of a lack of independent age control which leads to a-priori corrections for apparent changes in sediment accumulation rates prior to testing the orbital forcing hypothesis. Recurrent evidence for incompleteness of cyclical records exacerbates the problem, because any strata "missing" within orbital timescales cannot be detected by existing pre-Neogene chronologies. If one could document that these cycles occur in rocks that are 50 million years old, for example, it would allow geoscientists to tell time in rocks for the past 50 million years at unprecedented levels of precision by matching models for Solar System dynamics with cycles in rocks.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We propose a program, of high-resolution U-Pb zircon geochronology to resolve the orbital forcing debate for one of the classic examples of cyclic sediments, the Early Eocene Green River Formation. These spectacularly preserved rocks were deposited in a large lake ca. 50 million years ago. The goal of the proposed work is to quantitatively test, at high precision, the hypothesis that the cyclicity in the Green River Fm. is orbitally forced, where the forcing is achieved through changes in Earth's climate that are paced by the periodic changes in the Earth's orbit. We propose to use U-Pb zircon geochronology from abundant interlayered ash beds to provide at least one age per ~100 ky interval with expected precision of less than plus or minus 50 ky. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition and partially related to the debate about the origin of sediment cyclicity, this research will also test climate's role in the stratigraphic architecture of lacustrine strata. The Early Eocene Climate Optimum is the warmest interval preceding the prolonged cooling that culminated in the current glaciated climate, and thus finding reliable, highly resolved climate records is especially relevant in view of future warmer conditions predicted with anthropogenic increases in pCO2. A highly resolved Early Eocene climate history will have far reaching implications for understanding the effect of climate on mammalian evolution and allow detailed evaluation of the robustness of dynamical models for the Solar System to ca. 50 Ma. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research is an outcome of EARTHTIME (www.earth-time.org), an initiative to bring together a broad cross-section of geochronologists, paleontologists, and stratigraphers with the goal of sequencing Earth history at a much-improved level of resolution. The proposed research will provide a new approach to calibrating the Early Eocene part of the time-scale and will allow for detailed cross-calibration between 40Ar/39Ar and U-Pb chronometers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Eocene (~50 million years ago) Green River Formation is a classic example of apparently cyclic sediments, deposited within a lake with abundant layers of volcanic ashes.  This formation is also famous because it contains abundant "oil shale".  For almost 100 years it has been assumed that the cyclic variations in sedimentary rocks was produced by cyclic variations in climate.  The volcanic ashes represent brief events, and in favorable cases they can be dated with the U-Pb radioisotopic system to very high precision.  Accordingly, the Green River Formation is an ideal place to test the assumptions of astronomically controlled climate cyclicity.   As a first step in an iterative approach, we have collected state-of-the-art U-Pb CA-TIMS (chemical abrasion- thermal ionization mass spectrometry) zircon dates from the Green River Formation at MIT, with precisions of &plusmn;14,000 to 40,000 years for seven volcanic ashes from the Wilkins Peak Member in Wyoming (USA), spanning approximately 2 million years.  We have chosen to study the Wilkins Peak Member of the Green River Formation.  This unit is exposed in Wyoming, and there are also many cores that can be studied and sampled.  Seven weighted mean ages are calculated from overlapping single crystal ages (figure 1), with uncertainties of 14 to 40 thousand years (2s) and all are in stratigraphic order (older strata lie below younger strata). Six of these ages are considered as representing the eruption age, while the seventh one (1448 tuff, taken from a small core sample) may require more analyses for validation. At the precision achieved here it is clear that tuning-based orbital age models deviate from the radioisotopic constraints. We are working to test the possibility that gaps and varying rates of accumulation of the sedimentary record are responsible for the mismatch. Specifically, we are working to identify intervals that need further dating in order to test for varying accumulation rate or gaps in the sedimentary record.  Based on our results, we suggest that this disagreement between the ages and models of sediment accumulation shown in figure 1 reflects the actual age-depth relationship for the Wilkins Peak Member because the individual zircon ages demonstrate lack of any substantial complication and therefore can be taken to represent the actual eruption age for the dated ashes. In spite of the discrepancy between orbital age models and the reported ages, the new data are insufficient to reject the orbital forcing hypothesis outright, but rather suggest alternative age-depth models that include a combination of periodic and non-periodic sedimentation. The alternative age models can be validated, modified or rejected with additional ages having similar or better precision.              Beyond the specific conclusion about the cyclicity of the Wilkins Peak Member, several general conclusions can be drawn from this work:  The current state-of-the-art in high precision CA-TIMS U-Pb geochronology of single zircon crystals provides the opportunity to test tuning of cyclic records at an uncertainty of about single precession period (~20,000 years). Ages with slightly larger uncertainties can be obtained from much smaller core samples, and this finding may lead to greatly expanding the possible application to both marine and terrestrial records. A more rigorous approach for astronomically calibrating the geological timescale is proposed that includes iterations of high-precision dating, followed by refining the calibration and identifying non-periodic sedimentation, including missing cycles and fast accumulation intervals.
