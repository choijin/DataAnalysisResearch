<AbstractNarration>The trophic cascade exemplifies the importance of indirect effects to the dynamics and structure of ecological communities. Classical views of trophic cascades emphasize the positive indirect effect that predators have on basal resources through their consumption of prey. Yet growing evidence indicates that we must refine our view of how different trophic levels are dynamically linked because trophic cascades can also be caused by predator-induced changes in prey behavior such as foraging activity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite abundant theory we have a limited empirical understanding of the factors that shape individual foraging decisions that, in turn, dictate the nature and strength of indirect effects in natural communities. Drs. Trussell and Luttbeg will use a model comparison and null hypothesis approach to explore the relative importance of density (DMIIs) and trait-mediated indirect interactions (TMIIs) to trophic cascades on rocky intertidal shores. Using a tri-trophic food chain as a model system, they will manipulate factors predicted to influence prey behavior and thus the relative strength of TMIIs in trophic cascades. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers will achieve these objectives by addressing the following questions: &lt;br/&gt;1. How do resource levels, prey state, and predation risk shape prey foraging and growth functions? &lt;br/&gt;2. How do resource levels, prey state, and predation intensity shape prey mortality functions? &lt;br/&gt;3. What model best describes the short-term influence of these factors on prey foraging behavior and the strength of emergent indirect effects? 4. Do models supported by short-term data accurately predict longer-term prey behavior and the strength of emergent indirect effects? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will make significant intellectual contributions to ecology by exploring whether attention to individual behavior improves our ability to predict the nature and strength of indirect effects in natural systems. By evaluating alternative models with empirical data, our research is novel and will build a stronger connection between ecological theory and its empirical base. Moreover, because species interactions are central to major issues in ecology, such as the use of trophic cascade theory to manage natural systems, it is critical that we understand how behavior is modified by environmental context. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts are considerable.  The research will allow students at all educational levels to pursue their interests in ecology. Graduate and undergraduate training will occur during all phases of the research. As part of Northeastern?s Young Scholars Program they also will offer a summer research internship each year to a high school student from the Coastal Ocean Science Academy (COSA) that is taught by the Marine Science Center?s Outreach staff. These students are largely members of under-represented groups from Boston area public high schools. In addition to providing these students with plenty of field experience, they also will teach them how to (1) conduct basic statistical analyses, (2) write a scientific paper, and (3) develop and deliver an oral presentation on their internship experience to the Marine Science Center community. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Predator can shape the structure and dynamics of natural communities by eating or scaring ("the ecology of fear") their prey.  In both cases, direct predation and the fear of being eaten can reduce the impact that prey species have on other species in the system, particularly those that form the base of the food.  Although ecologists have long appreciated the effect of predation on communities, it is only recently that we have begun to understand the importance that fear plays in a variety of systems.      This project used a modeling and experimental approach to explore how the relative importance of each type of predator effect can be shaped by other aspects of ecological context such as risk level, food abundance or the availability of shelter for prey seeking to hide from their predators.   Our research utilized the invasive green crab (Carcinus maenas) and its snail (Nucella lapillus) prey, which plays an important role in the structure and dynamics of     Our research found that prey responses to risk do depend on risk level albeit in some counterintuitive ways.  One metric that we have used to assess the stress that predation risk imposes on prey is growth efficiency, which measures how efficiently prey are able to convert ingested energy into growth.  High growth efficiency means that prey are able make the most of what they eat whereas low growth efficiency means that energy devoted to dealing with stress limits the energy available for growth.  In general, predation risk reduces prey growth efficiency but we found that less risk is not necessarily better.  For example, prey exposed to intermittent periods of risk showed the strongest reductions in growth efficiency whereas those exposed to risk 100% of the time did not show the greatest reduction in growth efficiency.  This latter result may reflect acclimation to risk whereas intermittent risk is more stressful because prey do not know what to expect.     Another key result of our project suggests that risk effects are much more important than direct predation effects in determining the spatial distribution of the resources that prey can forage on under risk.  Although researchers working across large landscapes have explored this idea, these studies have been understandably limited in their ability to independently manipulate both forms of predator effect across the landscape of fear that prey must evaluate when making foraging decisions. Our study, while working on much smaller spatial scales, was able to meet this challenge and provides strong evidence that processes operating at small spatial scales may ultimately scale up to drive the overall dynamics of rocky shore communities.     We also continue to develop empirically-based models that can be used to predict when and where risk effects are likely to be most important to the structure and dynamics of natural systems.  One publication describes a model that explores the importance of predator cue properties and other information to the foraging decisions of prey.  A second model will explore how resource levels and prey state (starved versus feed; juvenile versus adult) influence prey foraging decisions.     The results of our research have significantly advanced our understanding of how predators shape the dynamics and structure of natural ecosystems. Our focus on the effects of predation risk on prey, rather than the effects of direct predator consumption of prey, has helped to transform understanding of how predator-prey interactions affect community structure and ecosystem function.     To date, this project has produced 16 manuscripts that have been published in top ecological journals such as Ecology, the American Naturalist, and the Proceedings of the Royal Society of London.  In addition, this award supported the doctoral dissertation research of 3 PhD students and 2 MSc students as well as 4 undergraduate students all of whom were female scientists.
