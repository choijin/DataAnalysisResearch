<AbstractNarration>Despite historical references to the contrary, recent study of Panamanian seaweed diversity has revealed a marine flora rich in species, including species new to science and species that may represent sources of important natural compounds. This project will elucidate patterns of seaweed diversity through intensive SCUBA-based field surveys in the Caribbean Sea and eastern tropical Pacific, live culture of field-collected specimens, and comparisons of seaweed DNA. The work will result in the establishment of a baseline of seaweed diversity upon which environmental change can be assessed, and upon which evolutionary hypotheses can be tested. Specifically, a strategy is outlined to explain why algal species composition on Caribbean and Pacific coasts of Central America is so similar, in comparison to the general pattern of zoological diversity in which distinct (though closely related) species inhabit opposite coasts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A major initiative of this project is to establish a collaborative of seaweed scientists in southern Central America that will promote long-term study of seaweed evolution and biogeography. Over 40 students and scientists (from universities in Panama, Costa Rica, El Salvador, and Colombia, the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, and collaborating American Institutions) will receive training in seaweed identification, molecular systematics and seaweed culturing as part of this research, or through taxonomic workshops. The research will advance an understanding of the distribution and diversity of tropical seaweeds, as well as the biotic history of the Central American Isthmus, and culminate in a series of bi-lingual identification guides to the marine flora of Panama. The Office of International Science and Engineering is co-funding this award to help support US student participation in this international research activity.</AbstractNarration>

Seaweeds can, indeed, have negative impacts in marine ecosystems; some of them can kill coral tissue if they come into direct contact with it, and when seaweeds grow to bloom proportions, usually as a result of high nutrient concentrations, they cause problems for coastal communities that must deal with rotting seaweed and/or wade beyond suspended populations to swim. However, seaweeds should also be recognized as a source of important industrial, biomedical and nutritional compounds, and for their significant contributions to marine communities. Along with phytoplankton and sea grasses, seaweeds form the base of marine food webs and serve as habitat for commercially important fish, crustaceans and molluscs, among others.

Despite a long history of botanical investigation on land, not to mention long term studies of coral reef ecology throughout the region, the marine flora has remained largely unexplored. Prior to our work, visits to the isthmian region were limited to short trips in 1910 by Marshal Avery Howe, a famous botanist working on behalf of the New York Botanical Garden, and then several short visits by now famous marine explorer Sylvia Earle in the 1960s. In the late 1990s and the early 2000s, we began to realize that a rich resource of seaweed diversity was being overlooked. Based on the collective efforts of four institutions supported by this grant, we now estimate that the marine flora of Panama is comprised of over 450 Caribbean species and nearly 200 Pacific species, making it one of the richest marine floras in either the western tropical Atlantic or the eastern tropical Pacific.
