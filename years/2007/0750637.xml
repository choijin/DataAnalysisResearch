<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project aims to develop a new gas separation polymer membrane technology created in Phase I to significantly improve the ability to separate carbon dioxide from methane.  Successful utilization of this new technology to separation of these commercially important gases will provide better performance at lower cost than current methods for separating carbon dioxide and methane. The approach to this problem involves construction of new-to-the-world polymer architecture.  The monomer units, which are the building blocks to the polymer membranes desired, will be individually designed to pass carbon dioxide molecules through the membrane faster than methane molecules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential from the technology developed in the project will be a commercially robust membrane able to resist degradation under operation in real field conditions, which will lead to the production of prototype gas separation modules for field testing and will further expand applications to other gas separations such as oxygen and nitrogen.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ New Synthesis Approaches to Higher Performance, Lower Cost CO2/CH4 Gas Separation Membranes     Tetramer Technologies LLC  657 S. Mechanic St., Pendleton, SC 29670  www.tetramertechnologies.com     Natural gas is the second fastest growing primary energy source in the world. About 17% of the current natural gas production requires pretreatment to remove carbon dioxide to the pipeline specification of less than 2%. Natural gas provides more than one-fifth of all primary energy used in the United States. Of the current commercial membrane applications, the purification of natural gas by the removal of carbon dioxide is the most important gas separation application. The total market for equipment supply for CO2 removal from natural gas is estimated to be more than $2 billion per year, and is growing. The most widely used technology for both large and small units is still amine absorption although the use of membrane technology in these applications has been growing rapidly.     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project involved innovative synthetic approaches utilizing Tetramer TechnologiesÆ specialty polymer platform technology to create commercially attractive membrane materials for removal of CO2 from natural gas.  These new to the gas membrane art polymer structures are differentiated from current commercial products by having higher CO2 permeance and CO2/CH4 separation performance. An added competitive advantage is that these specialty polymers have excellent processing properties that offer lower cost fabrication advantages over todayÆs cellulose acetate and fluorinated polyimide membranes.     This Phase II project was carried out by a joint team of Tetramer and Membrane Technology and Research, Inc (MTR), a leader in gas separation technology, whose members have extensive R&amp;D commercialization experience in membrane products, research and development, organic and polymer chemistry, and thin film research. During this Phase II project Tetramer invented new polymers with excellent permeability and separation performance data.  These data provide a strong economic competitive advantage that will allow us to pursue commercial development of this new natural gas purification membrane product.  The timing is excellent because the need for improved CO2/CH4 membranes matches well with the strong current market interest in (a) upgrading natural gas by removal of carbon dioxide (CO2), (b) utilizing CO2 to recover coal bed methane (c) gas processing unit operations needed to sequester CO2, (d) syngas processing, (e) the use of CO2 for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) and (f) even projects looking at converting CO2 into methane.  Tetramer Technologies greatly appreciates the support of the NSF allowing our researchers to advance the science and commercial potential of CO2/CH4 gas separation membranes.
