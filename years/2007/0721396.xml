    <AbstractNarration>The concept underlying this Small Grant for Exploratory Research is that intrinsic electrical properties (the dipole moment) of the lipid bilayer of a membrane act as a mechanosensor. The hypothesis is that the dipole potential at the lipid-water interface of a membrane can detect and change in response to external forces generated by mechanical stress and fluid movement. The change in dipole potential is detected by sensory proteins embedded in the membrane and converted to chemical signals that generate a signal cascade that is transmitted throughout the cell. This research has the potential to irrevocably alter the view that membrane lipids perform only a structural and protective function. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the research are the potential to change the view of lipid bilayer properties and function, to promote interdisciplinary research and to train students in chemo physical techniques. A strong education and outreach program will involve students from the University of California and High Tech High, both in San Diego. Moreover the results of the research will be disseminated through professional journals, at meetings, and to the public through a WEB site.</AbstractNarration>
