<AbstractNarration>This award supports fundamental research on polishing single-crystal diamond as a means to fabricate diamond micro-endmills. The research objective is to determine the effects of polishing parameters, including polishing speed, polishing depth, abrasive grain size and crystallographic orientation of the polished surface, on the process outcome, including average polishing rate, polished surface roughness, and polishing tool wear. The specific approach will include conducting systematic experiments through the design of experiments technique, developing a simplified model of the polishing process, and evaluating the fabricated diamond micro-endmills by micromachining various features on different materials. The educational objectives are to enhance the future manufacturing workforce, and to improve the existing manufacturing curricula. The specific approach will be to involve the undergraduate and graduate students,  especially from the underrepresented groups,  in this research, and to complement the existing micro/nano-manufacturing course with the knowledge gained in this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the benefits of this research will include facilitating efficient and effective fabrication of three-dimensional micro parts and features for medical, consumer products, military, and electronics industries. Micromachining operations will be enabled in a more predictable fashion. Common problems such as erratic forces, short tool life, inferior surface finish, and burr formation will be minimized, thereby eliminating some of the most profound obstacles that prevent further development of micro-manufacturing. Close collaboration with industry will enable rapid transfer of research/technology to industry. Since micro-manufacturing is viewed as one of the emerging manufacturing technologies, this research is also critical for the United States to retain its competitiveness in manufacturing. Furthermore, the knowledge gained from this work will impact emerging applications of diamond in various fields.</AbstractNarration>
