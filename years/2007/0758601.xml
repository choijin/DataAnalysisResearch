<AbstractNarration>This project will study the higher order Q-curvature equations in conformal geometry and CR geometry. These equations are closely related to the Gauss-Bonnet integral in the case of conformal geometry and to the logarithm term in the Szego kernel in the case of CR geometry. The previous work of the principal investigators has established the significance of these equations in helping to understand the geometry of the spaces in questions. The current project takes further steps to explore the analytic development of these Q-curvature equations and basic questions relating to the positivity of the underlying operators. In the case of CR geometry, the research seeks to relate the Q-curvature equation to the notion of mass for a CR structure. Again the positivity of the underlying operator is the focus of the investigations. A successful outcome would lead to a strong characterization of the standard sphere in complex space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigators of this project have pioneered the use of a natural partial differential equation involving a larger number of differentiations as analytic tools to study the geometry of four-dimensional spaces. The scientific part of the proposal is a natural continuation of this development, where the focus is on verifying certain conjectural pictures of the space-time universe created by physicists.  A good portion of the project will involve the training of the next generation of mathematicians as researchers and teachers of mathematics. The principal investigators will also continue their past record of mentoring a number of successful women mathematicians. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project proposed three areas of investigations and the PIs are successful in carrying out the research in each. We briefly outline each of the three topics below.  The first deals with partial differential equations that arise in prescribing the global invariants of a four dimensional geometric space. The goal is to outline a possible approach to classify such spaces according to the range of values of these conformal invariants which we shall call &sigma;2 integrals. A leading significant result is a finiteness result which says there are at most finite number of possibly different four dimensional spaces whose &sigma;2 integrals lie between specified range. This is strong indication that such a program is likely to bear fruit.     The second part deals with the same question but for spaces with dimensions higher than four. The essential first step is to locate similar global invariants such as the &sigma;2 integrals. This project is successful in locating such invariants and some initial analysis of the associated partial differential equations were carried out four dimension six.     The third part of this research program is concerned with CR-geometry which bears formal resemblence to the conformal structures that were studied in the first two parts. The main problem to be studied is what is call the isoperimetric problem: given a region in this geometry of fixed volume, what is a possible lower bound of its boundary area. This question is fundamental for analytic work to proceed on such spaces.
