<AbstractNarration>Secondary organic aerosols (SOA) constitute the fine particulate matter fraction arising from the photochemical and oxidative processing of atmospheric hydrocarbons.  Being able to predict SOA formation is a needed step forward to more accurate air-shed and air quality models, to predicting the health consequences of small aerosol particles and also their radiative impacts in climate models.  This work will continue development of a semi-explicit kinetic model to predict SOA formation in complex mixtures of biogenic and anthropogenic hydrocarbons, ambient oxidants and also existing aerosols under specified atmospheric conditions, as studied in a smog chamber facility at University of North Carolina (Chapel Hill).</AbstractNarration>

The goal of the research was to develop a predictive model for SOA formation. Ultimately these results could be used in larger airshed models so that the importance, with respect to SOA formation, of different organic emissions and their sources can be estimated.  Approach: In this study we used large outdoor chambers at the University of North CarolinaÃ†s outdoor chamber facility to investigate the SOA forming potential of aromatics which come from man-made mobile emission sources, and isoprene which comes from vegetative emissions. Experiments were done in the presence of an urban hydrocarbon environment, oxides of nitrogen, and natural sunlight.  To develop and exercise a new model, an experimental data base was needed that covers a wide range of conditions. Concentrations in the chamber were also selected so the amounts of aromatic SOA produced were in the range of what might be observed in urban atmospheres.  In response to recent work highlighting the importance of aerosol liquid water content on SOA formation from the oxidative products of organics, the relative humidity of the chamber and the type of initial seed aerosol present were varied to assess their impact on SOA formation.

In the process of this work we have developed an new condensed aromatic kinetic mechanism that predicts both gas oxide of nitrogen and ozone behavior, and particle phase SOA. 2. With respect to SOA formation for isoprene systems, the particle water effect is opposite that of aromatics.  Lower particle phase water seems to associate with more SOA.  We have also made advancements in developing a new isoprene gas kinetics model. 3. In associated studies we  tracked the reactive oxidant species (ROS) associated with different SOA forming systems. ROS is associated with health impacts from particle exposures. We found the aromatic and a-pinene systems in the presence of an urban hydrocarbon mixture tended to yield the greatest ROS. Isoprene was among the lowest. We also observed that aging dilute diesel exhaust in sunlight more than doubles the ROS over a period of 4 to 6 hours This suggests that as diesel particles age in the in the atmospher...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
