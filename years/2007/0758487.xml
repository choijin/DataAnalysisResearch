<AbstractNarration>The proposal focuses on infinite dimensional algebras and infinite residually finite groups and their interactions. &lt;br/&gt;We plan to study the recently discovered families of Lie algebras of infinite differential operators over fields of &lt;br/&gt;positive characteristics which are both nil and of polynomial growth. We intend to continue our work on asymptotic &lt;br/&gt;properties of Golod-Shafarevich groups and the Lubotzky-Sarnak conjecture. &lt;br/&gt;These groups naturally arise in 3-dimensional topology and number theory. This work is also related to the Wigderson's &lt;br/&gt;problem of expanding subspaces in the theoretical computer science. &lt;br/&gt;We will further develop the connections between the Specht Problem and linear representations of Golod-Shafarevich groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We hope that the results of the work on the proposal will lead to solutions of several long standing problems and will have&lt;br/&gt;implications for Theoretical Computer Science (fast expanding systems).&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The PI and his graduate students studied combinatorial and asymptotic properties of infinite groups and infinite dimensional algebras such as : local nilpotence, polynomial growth, Kazhdan property (T), structure and representations of superalgebras.  In a series of two papers written with T.Cortez and J. Anquela we used the Kistrikin-Zelmanov theorem on Sandwich Algebras to prove local nilpotence of the McCrimmon radical of a Jordan system over an arbitrary ring of scalars. Then we used it to prove local nilpotence of nil Jordan systems of bounded index.  In a series of two papers with A. Alahmadi, H. Alsulami and S.Jain we characterized Leavitt path algebras of polynomial growth and determined algebraic structure of such Leavitt path algebras.  Jointly with M. Racine we found an octonionic construction of the exceptional 10-dimensional Jordan Kac superalgebra.  Jointly with C. Martinez we classified irreducible conformal representations of the exceptional superconformal algebra CK(6).  Graduate student Johanna Hennig proved an analog of Lie Theorem for representations of locally finite dimensional Lie algebras. She also answered the question of A. Zalessky about characterization of simple locally finite dimensional Lie algebras of classical type over fields of positive characteristic.  Graduate student Z. Zhang proved Kazhdan property (T) for linear groups of small rank over alternative rings, for example, octonions.  We hope that our results will be used in Combinatorics, Theretical Computer Science and Mathematical Physics.  Based on these findings the PI delivered numerous lectures for mathematicians and general public, including lectures at CIMPA conferences held at mathematically developing countries.
