<AbstractNarration>Short technical abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ability to quantify the concentration of hydrogen and low mass atoms while determining their bonding configuration and depth profile is needed for a wide range of applications in science, engineering and industry. Hydrogen is almost always present in thin films, is often concentrated at surfaces and interfaces, and can affect material properties in a substantial manner. For example, hydrogen can either improve or degrade the performance of microelectronic devices by passivating or introducing defects at interfaces. In other classes of materials, hydrogen degrades mechanical properties and can lead to embrittlement. Hydrogen is also a critical element for future energy use. Hydrogen, carbon, oxygen and nitrogen are the basic elements of polymers, organic, pharmaceutical and biological molecules. Quantitative determination of hydrogen and low mass element concentration is therefore essential for full characterization of thin films and bio-interfaces, which constitute the building blocks for biotechnology. &lt;br/&gt;We propose to construct an integrated ultra-high vacuum chamber that combines in-situ infrared absorption spectroscopy (IRAS) with NRA and ERDA to detect hydrogen, and glancing angle detection (GAD) to detect other low-mass atoms. When combined with the sensitivity of IR spectroscopy to the bonding state of hydrogen and light atoms, ERDA will provide not only critical accurate quantification but also speciation of the types and amounts of hydrogen and other low mass species, thus making it possible to greatly accelerate our ability to understand the basic science behind their materials chemistry, and to yield better control of these species in practical applications. The purpose of the proposed construction project is to provide quantitative chemical and structural information of surfaces, interfaces and thin films (inorganic, organic, and biological) in which hydrogen and light atoms play an important role. The new facility will have a wide-reaching influence on research and education programs within and outside Rutgers spanning a number of areas, including biology, bio-catalysis, drugs synthesis, nano-electronics, silicon-on-insulator (SOI) fabrication, and H-storage. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Short technical abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hydrogen is arguably the most important element in nature; it is part of all fuels and soft matter (plastics, glue, etc.), plays an important role in the properties of hard matter (metal embrittlement, drugs), and is an important source of energy. To understand its role and to take full advantage of its properties, precise measurement methods must use to detect and characterize hydrogen. While is chemical state (bonding configuration) can be determined using infrared spectroscopy (a method to measure the characteristic vibrations of hydrogen), it is much more difficult to measure the total amount of hydrogen within a material, or at an interface. The best method is to send high energy ions into the material of interest and to measure the number of hydrogen atoms ejected (due to the strong collision between the heavy incoming ion and lighter hydrogen atom inside the material).  We propose here to construct an integrated system that combines infrared spectroscopy with various methods based on ion scattering to detect both the chemical nature and quantity of hydrogen in materials. This facility will make it possible to greatly accelerate our ability to understand the basic science behind materials chemistry, and to yield better control of hydrogen for various applications. The new facility will also have a wide-reaching influence on research and education programs within and outside Rutgers spanning a number of areas, including biology, bio-catalysis, drugs synthesis, nano-electronics, microchip fabrication, and hydrogen storage.</AbstractNarration>
