<AbstractNarration>The study of parity nonconservation (PNC) in ytterbium is motivated by the opportunity to probe physics within the atomic nucleus using modern table-top laser-spectroscopy techniques. Atomic PNC experiments are a unique and powerful tool for the study of fundamental nuclear and particle interactions. This is exemplified by the discovery of the nuclear anapole moment (an electromagnetic multipole that violates parity) and the measurement of the parity violating electron-nucleon interaction in cesium to 0.35% accuracy. In atomic ytterbium, the PNC amplitude is enhanced by two orders of magnitude compared to that in cesium. This facilitates measurements of the anapole moments of two nonzero-nuclear-spin isotopes of ytterbium. Furthermore, the broad range of stable ytterbium isotopes is attractive for measuring the variation of neutron radii along an isotopic chain. This project aims at measuring PNC effect in ytterbium to an accuracy exceeding that obtained for cesium.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project is that it may resolve inconsistencies between the theory and measurements of the parity violating weak nuclear interactions and will provide complementary information that is exceedingly difficult to access by other means. These experiments will also yield information on variation of the mean-square neutron radii in a chain of isotopes, which in addition to being a fundamental test of nuclear theory, pins down the density dependence of the symmetry energy of neutron-rich nuclear matter which has impacts on neutron star structure and heavy ion collisions. Importantly, neither the anapole-moment measurement nor the neutron-distribution measurement relies on high-precision theory, although atomic calculations accurate to better than 15% are required to extract the nuclear anapole. The broader impact of an ytterbium PNC experiment extends to a variety of different fields besides atomic, nuclear and particle physics. The theoretical and experimental tools developed for the PNC experiment have an essential significance for projects employing ytterbium for studies of quantum degenerate gases and novel optical frequency standards. New experiments using ultra-cold ytterbium atoms to search for the nuclear electric dipole moment would benefit from the information obtained in this work. A broad international collaboration within this project established between the UC Berkeley group and a number of universities in Europe, Russia, Australia, and India will contribute to new advances in this field and to exchange of new ideas and development of novel experimental techniques. As in the ongoing work, several graduate and undergraduate students will continue to play key roles in the research and collaborations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of the project was measurement of the subtle effect of the so-called weak interactions between atomic electrons and the nucleus. Weak interactions are described by the Standard Model of elementary particle and interactions, and atomic parity-violation experiments can both test the Standard Model and also investigate various nuclear-physics effects, for instance, they can measure nutron distributions within the atomic nuclei.  This project succeeded in obsering and measuring parity violation in atomic ytterbium (a rare earth atom with fully filled 4f shell in its lowest energy states). We have found that the actual parity-violating effect in Yb is as large as was predicted by theory and that our experimental technique is, indeed, capable of measuring parity violation with high precision.  Our results have been reported in five published journal papers, and have been presented at many scientific meetings, for example,  in January 2010, in a series of some 8 lectures the PI gave during his  trip to India and the Netherlands. The post-doc presented the results at  the two leading scientific centers in Israel: the Weizmann Institute and  the Technion.   The project has served as a training basis for a post-doctoral fellow and several graduate and undergraduate students.
