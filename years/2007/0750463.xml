<AbstractNarration>This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program supports investigations by Professor John G. Verkade at the Iowa State University, Ames, Iowa. The intellectual merit of this proposal lies in his current development of two new types of powerful catalysts for industrially important reactions. These catalyst types are based on the new organophosphorus and on the new organo-aluminum compounds he is synthesizing. The structures of these catalyst molecules are designed to incorporate a novel electronic feature that enhances their catalytic activity.  The catalyst molecules are also designed to be attached with strong chemical bonds to special solid supports.  Such solid-supported catalysts can be recycled many times in either batch or flow reactors. A broad impact of the work supported by this award is that, in terms of economic and environmental considerations, methodologies for important organic reactions will be improved through higher catalyst activity (resulting in lower amounts of catalyst required), the absence of heavy (toxic) metals in the catalysts, and higher product yields under less energy-intensive conditions. The award's second impact is that undergraduate, graduate and post doctoral students as well as visiting professors will continue to be educated and trained in this academically and industrially important area.</AbstractNarration>
