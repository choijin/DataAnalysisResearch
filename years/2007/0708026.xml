<AbstractNarration>E&lt;br/&gt;0708026&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The investigator continues work on developing a systematic&lt;br/&gt;mathematical theory of crystalline solids starting from first&lt;br/&gt;principles, with emphasis on understanding the connection between&lt;br/&gt;atomistic/electronic structure models and continuum models.  He&lt;br/&gt;and his collaborators study the continuum limit of electronic&lt;br/&gt;structure models such as models in Kohn-Sham density functional&lt;br/&gt;theory.  They also study numerical algorithms that combine&lt;br/&gt;Kohn-Sham density functional theory and continuum models.  In&lt;br/&gt;particular, they study the accuracy of these algorithms and find&lt;br/&gt;strategies for achieving uniform accuracy.  These issues are&lt;br/&gt;critical for understanding the electronic structure models and&lt;br/&gt;making them powerful and practical tools for material science. &lt;br/&gt;The project helps to provide the microscopic foundation of the&lt;br/&gt;continuum mechanics of solids. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     From a broader perspective, the project serves as an example&lt;br/&gt;of the kind of work that needs to be done in order to establish&lt;br/&gt;the foundation for multi-scale, multi-physics modeling.  It is&lt;br/&gt;now generally recognized across a wide spectrum of scientific&lt;br/&gt;disciplines that the next major advances will come from&lt;br/&gt;multi-scale, multi-physics modeling that integrates models from&lt;br/&gt;quantum mechanics with models from classical or continuum&lt;br/&gt;mechanics.  However, due to the lack of a solid foundation, much&lt;br/&gt;of the current activities in multi-scale, multi-physics modeling&lt;br/&gt;are ad hoc in nature.  Such a practice defeats the original&lt;br/&gt;purpose of multi-scale, multi-physics modeling.  This project is&lt;br/&gt;aimed at establishing the necessary foundation for the case of&lt;br/&gt;crystalline solids.  In addition, interest in nanotechnology and&lt;br/&gt;first-principle-based material design demands a much better&lt;br/&gt;understanding of the connection between the mechanical properties&lt;br/&gt;of solids and their electronic structure.  Traditional concepts&lt;br/&gt;that are often used in continuum theory will have to be modified&lt;br/&gt;in order to take into account the effects at the electronic&lt;br/&gt;structure level.  Establishing such a connection is a major focus&lt;br/&gt;of the proposed project.</AbstractNarration>
