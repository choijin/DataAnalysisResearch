    <AbstractNarration>An award ha been made to the State University of New York at Oneonta under the direction of Dr. Willard Harman for the acquisition of an acoustic sensing system and other equipment for the monitoring of fish, benthic invertebrates and aquatic vegetation in a lake in New York state. Two other universities, SUNY Cobleskill and Cornell University, will participate in the monitoring activities. The research will provide important information on an introduced species of fish, the alewife, which has had major impacts on native lake ecosystems in the past few decades. The instrumentation will be used to train students in ecology and environmental science, in particular in field courses that will allow hands-on use by the students in independent research projects. The three schools have active programs for including underrepresented groups of students to field science.</AbstractNarration>
