    <AbstractNarration>This proposal is submitted with the acknowledgement that there is an urgent need to build the capacity of the national education evaluation enterprise and, more specifically, to increase the presence and participation of culturally attuned and minority represented evaluators. Over the past several years, the Division of Research, Evaluation and Communication, within the National Science Foundation (NSF)'s Education and Human Resources Directorate has supported broadening participation activities focused on capacity building in the field. One specific initiative has been an Evaluation Workshop for minority faculty members who teach evaluation, but are not part of the American Evaluation Association (AEA) or the profession. The goal has been to bring them into the fold and through them alert their students to evaluation methodology and to evaluation as a possible career choice. This proposal requests funds to continue efforts to broaden the understanding of faculty at Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) regarding evaluation as a profession and to strengthen their knowledge of evaluation theory and methods through varied avenues including participation in an NSF/AEA-sponsored Broadening Participation Initiative that will include: (a) sessions and meetings (including a targeted workshop) held at the American Evaluation Association (AEA) 2007 Annual Conference, (b) exposure to the AEA governance and its membership, (c) networking with senior-level evaluation faculty and practitioners as well as previous MSI faculty participants, and (c) attendance at a spring follow up meeting on the main campus of Howard University. Under this Initiative particular emphasis will be placed on exposing faculty to issues related to culturally and contextually responsive evaluation training and practice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A major focus of this project would be to identify and recruit ten MSI faculty who teach program evaluation courses within the Washington, DC/Baltimore metropolitan area. In addition, ten participants from previous NSF/AEA Broadening Participation Initiatives will be recruited to participate in this 12-month effort. Upon completion of this project, it is expected that the selected faculty will be able to (a) utilize the resources and information provided and to effectively integrate theoretical and procedural knowledge gained within their evaluation/research research courses, (b) plan an expansion of evaluation activities at their individual institutions, and (c) participate in collaborative evaluation efforts. A formative and summative evaluation of the project will be undertaken to assess progress and outcomes.</AbstractNarration>
