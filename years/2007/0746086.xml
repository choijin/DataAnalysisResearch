<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: The recent discovery of a new material behavior in which ceramic particles violently eject from the surface when stimulated by a compressive load has prompted the exploration of employing the phenomenon in the design of a tough ceramic.  It is hypothesized that the same material behavior that controls the particle ejecta can be manipulated to arrest cracks in brittle materials subjected to static and possibly dynamic loads.  A doctoral candidate and an undergraduate student are conducting the preliminary and highly novel research that may lead to a new, tough ceramic. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DETAILS:  Research is performed to understand the pressure-induced phase transformation in beta-eucryptite, in the context of developing a new type of transformation-toughened ceramic composite.  Novel composites prepared by incorporating beta-eucryptite particles within a ceramic matrix are prepared and characterized with the goal of controlling the displacive phase transformation from beta- to epsilon-eucryptite.  In addition to training a graduate student and several undergraduates in performing ceramics processing and properties research, a broader educational activity is designed  that ultimately 'ignites' science interest in high school students through a medium that illustrates the connection between minerals and technological materials such as beta-eucryptite.</AbstractNarration>
