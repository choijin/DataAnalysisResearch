<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;Understanding decision making under uncertainty is one of the most important problems in economics. Economists and decision theorists have long sought to develop rigorous foundations for realistic models of how agents perceive and respond to uncertainty. The expected utility theory of von Neumann-Morgenstern, Anscombe-Aumann and Savage has been the dominant paradigm for both theoretical and applied work incorporating uncertainty for over fifty years. More recently, however, important work by economists, decision theorists and psychologists has begun to address serious shortcomings in the expected utility model. Many studies suggest that decision makers routinely and systematically violate expected utility axioms. Examples include misinterpreting small probability events in the case of the Allais paradox, and failing to form a unique subjective prior and use it in a probabilistically sophisticated way in the case of Ellsberg's paradox. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project studies the implications of uncertainty on markets and mechanism design problems for allocating resources. The project focuses mainly on problems surrounding models of ambiguity, which capture settings in which decision makers respond to uncertainty in decision problems but do not form precise probabilistic assessments of randomness in their environments. The project studies decision-theoretic questions involving the representation of such preferences in abstract choice problems as well as the implications of ambiguity on markets and in mechanism design problems. The INTELLECTUAL MERIT of this project is a deeper understanding of the effects of uncertainty on important resource allocation mechanisms. The BROADER IMPACTS of this project include insights into the timing and structure of innovations, the emergence of satisficing behavior in infinite horizon models, and the use of simple mechanisms such as English auctions.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
