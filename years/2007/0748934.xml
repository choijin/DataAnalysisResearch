<AbstractNarration>The purpose of the proposed project is to develop a mechanism to build the capacity of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) to engage in the teaching and practice of culturally competent evaluation, with a focus on Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education programs. The goal is to diversify and build leadership in the field of program evaluation; as well as to strengthen evaluator skills in assessing STEM programmatic initiatives directed towards multiethnic and underrepresented populations. This will be accomplished through three major activities:&lt;br/&gt;(1) collaboration between selected HBCUs to assess current program evaluation efforts and related research and teaching activities on each of the planning group campuses and to identify effective models of evaluation capacity building and networking, (2) the creation of a communications network and mechanism for information sharing regarding evaluation instruction and practice among HBCUs and between HBCUs and other higher education institutions, (3) meeting with representatives from public and private funding agencies, foundations and organizations (e.g., NSF, NAFEO, W. K. Kellogg Foundation, etc,) to promote diversity in evaluation and to share the work of the HBCU - Evaluators Planning Group, faculty evaluators/researchers from six HBCUs, who will coordinate planning activities on their respective campuses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will bring together interdisciplinary teams of evaluators and evaluative researchers who are skilled in various disciplines and methodologies, sensitized to cultural issues related to evaluation methods, and knowledgeable of strategies to make connections between research and practice. This collaborative and multidisciplinary approach provides an opportunity identify and establish common measures across these institutions; discern best practices for engaging underrepresented students in STEM careers related to evaluation; and increase participants' knowledge and understanding of diversity issues in program evaluation. This project will broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in program evaluation, while advancing program evaluation teaching, training, and scholarship. The project also will enhance academic networks as well as partnerships within and across STEM disciplines, non-STEM disciplines, and professional evaluation organizations. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
