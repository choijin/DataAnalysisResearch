    <AbstractNarration>The University of Colorado at Boulder is working collaboratively with the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR) to design and develop a NSDL Curriculum Customization Service, that integrates exemplary NSF-funded science curriculum, NSDL resources, and school district-developed resources into interactive, concept-based Teacher's Guides. The service is being deployed directly to Denver Public School teachers via their school district portal. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is being conducted through a partnership of the university and UCAR with Digital Learning Sciences, the Denver Public Schools (DPS), the American Geological Institute (AGI), and It's About Time/Herff Jones Publishing. The graphical user interfaces and underpinning middleware being developed are supporting: 1) middle and high school Earth science teachers in implementing and customizing standards-based exemplary curricula augmented with NSDL resources; and, 2) school districts with scalable, online teacher professional development. Teachers are able to select and review NSDL resources for curricular alignment, provide formal reviews of NSDL resources, and engage in knowledge-sharing through interactive Teacher's Guides that are dynamically produced through the Service.</AbstractNarration>
