<AbstractNarration>Chen&lt;br/&gt;0724936&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The investigator and co-investigator organize a conference&lt;br/&gt;on the topic "The Interface between Atomistic and Continuum&lt;br/&gt;Theories" under the auspices of the Society for Natural&lt;br/&gt;Philosophy.  The conference themes address mathematical issues&lt;br/&gt;that arise in the development of continuum-level governing&lt;br/&gt;equations (balance laws and constitutive equations) for materials&lt;br/&gt;based on atomistic considerations.  The focuses are on the&lt;br/&gt;relationships between the relevant physical principles used at&lt;br/&gt;atomic and continuum levels, as well as consistency of the&lt;br/&gt;resulting theories.  Basic understanding of the characteristics&lt;br/&gt;of the theories across different length scales is essential for&lt;br/&gt;developing analytical and computational models that are capable&lt;br/&gt;of describing a broad range of material behaviors.  The speakers&lt;br/&gt;invited to participate in the conference are leading researchers&lt;br/&gt;in mathematics, physics, chemistry, and engineering.  These&lt;br/&gt;speakers present their current research on analysis, modeling,&lt;br/&gt;and simulations for various material systems.  The conferences of&lt;br/&gt;Society for Natural Philosophy have a history of being&lt;br/&gt;cross-disciplinary endeavors.  The works presented at these&lt;br/&gt;conferences have embraced a broad spectrum of research topics,&lt;br/&gt;with common emphasis on the application of rigorous mathematical&lt;br/&gt;analysis to the study of physical systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The conference contributes directly to building a solid&lt;br/&gt;theoretical foundation for rapidly developing technological areas&lt;br/&gt;such as nanotechnology, novel materials, and large-scale material&lt;br/&gt;simulations.  As many nations are heavily investing in these&lt;br/&gt;technological areas, the most significant and lasting&lt;br/&gt;developments can only result from progress at fundamental levels. &lt;br/&gt;The theme of the conference reflects the current trend of using&lt;br/&gt;advanced mathematical tools to address critical problems arising&lt;br/&gt;in the modeling of material behavior across widely varying length&lt;br/&gt;and time scales.  The conference promotes the participation of&lt;br/&gt;junior researchers and students, and exposes them to a novel,&lt;br/&gt;important, and rapidly expanding area of science and technology.</AbstractNarration>
