<AbstractNarration>The REU site at the University of South Alabama is an interdisciplinary undergraduate research program designed for students who wish to explore in depth specific areas of protein biochemistry. Every summer, eight students are invited to participate in a ten-week long research intensive experience under the direction of experienced faculty members.  All participants are housed on campus and receive a weekly stipend as well as limited funds to travel to the institution.  Although students are recruited nationally, undergraduates from the Southeastern states and particularly from Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) are especially encouraged to apply. Participants work on a project of their choice with their chosen mentor from the departments of Biochemistry, Biology, Biomedical Sciences, Chemistry, Microbiology and Pharmacology. Participants take a brief course in which they discuss basic aspects of protein biochemistry as well as techniques they will apply during their research experience. Every week, students participate in discussions and presentations by invited speakers on "Ethical aspects of Research and Research Integrity" and attend presentations by all mentors in the REU program. At the end of the program, participants give an oral presentation of their results and write a scientific report summarizing their work which is published in a book and posted on-line.  More information is available at http://www.southalabama.edu/alliedhealth/biomedical/ucur/index.htm, or by contacting Dr. Julio Turrens (jturrens@usouthal.edu).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The central theme of this REU-site is "Structure and Function of Proteins".   Intellectual Merit:  Eight students from various institutions nationwide were invited to participate in a 10-week research intensive experience at the University of South Alabama.  The projects were carried out in various departments (Biochemistry, Biomedical Sciences, Biology, Chemistry, Cell Biology and Pharmacology) and included basic and applied studies in areas of cell biology.   During the program the participants learn how to: a) design and execute experiments, b) write a paper in scientific format, and c) present their results to their peers in a symposium at the end of the program (see pictures).   All their papers are complied in a book which is posted on line and also printed.  Students and mentors receive a copy of the book.  An example of the Proceedings for 2011 can be found in our website: http://www.southalabama.edu/alliedhealth/biomedical/ucur/Book%202011.pdf  In addition, all students participated in s series of weekly presentations devoted to discussions on research ethics and responsible conduct of research.    This full time research experience gives participants an invaluable tool to decide on whether they want to pursue a research career in the future.  Almost 23% of the participants are currently enrolled in PhD programs, 3% in MD-PhD programs and an additional 11.4% are currently pursuing MS degrees.  Another 23% of those participating in the program have not yet graduated.  At least 2 of the students enrolled in a MS in Biology plan to continue to pursue her PhD upon graduation.    Broader impact:  Special effort is devoted to recruiting groups underrepresented in science, including minority and female participants.   In terms of demographics, 20% of the participants were African American, 3% were Hispanic and 3% Native American.  The proportion of female participants was 46%.  Four of the students participating in previous REU sites (one of them Hispanic) have completed or are currently enrolled in the PhD program in Basic Medical Sciences at our institution.   In summary, the program was successful in recruiting minority students.       Last Modified: 02/01/2012       Submitted by: Julio F Turrens]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
