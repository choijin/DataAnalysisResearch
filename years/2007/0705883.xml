<AbstractNarration>Emotion and motivation are fundamental to learning; students with high intrinsic motivation often outperform students with low motivation. Yet affect and emotion are often ignored or marginalized with respect to classroom practice. This project will help redress the emotion versus cognition imbalance. The researchers will develop Affective Learning Companions, real-time computational agents that infer emotions and leverage this knowledge to increase student performance. The goal is to determine the affective state of a student, at any point in time, and to provide appropriate support to improve student learning in the long term. Emotion recognition methods include using hardware sensors and machine learning software to identify a student's state. Five independent affective variables are targeted (frustration, motivation, self-confidence, boredom and fatigue) within a research platform consisting of four sensors (skin conductance glove, pressure mouse, face recognition camera and posture sensing devices). Emotion feedback methods include using a variety of interventions (encouraging comments, graphics of past performance) varied according to type (explanation, hints, worked examples) and timing (immediately following an answer, after some elapsed time). The interventions will be evaluated as to which best increase performance and in which contexts. Machine learning optimization algorithms search for policies that further engage individual students who are involved in different affective and cognitive states. Animated agents are enhanced with appropriate gestures and empathetic feedback in relation to student achievement level and task complexity. Approximately 500 ethnically and economically diverse students in Massachusetts and Arizona will participate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this research is its potential for developing computer-based tutors that better address student diversity, including underrepresented minorities and disabled students. The solution proposed here provides alternative representations of scientific content, alternative paths through material and alternative means of interaction; thus, potentially leading to highly individualized science learning. Further, the project has the potential to advance our understanding of emotion as a predictor of individual differences in learning, unveiling the extent to which emotion, cognitive ability and gender impact different forms of learning.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
