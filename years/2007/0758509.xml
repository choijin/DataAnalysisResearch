<AbstractNarration>Supercells (long-lived rotating thunderstorms) have great impact on society, accounting for the vast majority of significant tornadoes as well as other severe weather.  Recent climatologies and process studies have revealed the apparent importance of supercell outflow temperatures, as well as lower tropospheric vertical wind shear and lapse rates, to tornadogenesis. However, there are still causal links missing from the chain of physical processes that lead to supercellular tornadoes.  This lack of knowledge is important because, without it, the ability to forecast and produce timely warnings for tornadoes (and to avoid false alarms for non-tornadic storms) is unlikely to improve.  The goal of this research is to address this gap in the knowledge base through mobile upsonde measurements during the forthcoming Verification of the Origins of Rotation Experiment 2 (VORTEX 2), and through hypothesis-driven research incorporating both VORTEX 2 observations and idealized numerical simulations. The specific aims of the research are a) to understand the role of cold pool (outflow) dynamics in supercells and tornadogenesis; and, b) to understand storm-environmental interactions in mature supercells in terms of the near-storm lower tropospheric lapse rates. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit. The research will advance understanding of storm-scale processes in tornadic vs. non-tornadic supercells. Outcomes will include the delivery of: an important thermodynamic dataset for all VORTEX 2 Principal Investigators (PIs); results from tests of several hypotheses that have the potential to improve tornado forecasts and warnings. The research and measurements are expected to be significant, because together they will provide insight into key lower tropospheric thermodynamic processes in storms. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Students will gain hands-on experience in storm observing and measurements. The PI will offer a course designed to prepare students for the field phase of VORTEX 2 and to provide a holistic sense of the mechanics of research projects. Finally, the PI will incorporate data and results into his routine courses and into his ongoing outreach effort that targets high school students.  In addition to the routine venues of conferences and peer-reviewed journal articles, the PI frequently interacts with operational forecasters in the southeastern United States</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Supercells (long-lived rotating thunderstorms) have great impact on our society, accounting for the vast majority of tornadoes and very large hail, and also often producing intense local rainfall and damaging non-tornadic winds. Recent climatologies and process studies by other authors have revealed the apparent importance of cold pool (outflow) thermodynamics as well as lower tropospheric vertical wind shear and lapse rates to tornadogenesis.  However, there are still causal links missing from the chain of physical processes that lead to supercellular tornadoes.  This lack of knowledge is important because, without it, the ability to forecast and produce timely warnings for tornadoes (and to avoid false alarms for non-tornadic storms) is unlikely to improve. The project sought to address a part of this gap in the knowledge base through sounding measurements during the Verification of the Origins of Rotation Experiment 2 (VORTEX2), and through hypothesis-driven research incorporating those measurements.  The key outcomes of this award include the following.  Soundings data for the VORTEX2 program were collected, quality-controlled, and disseminated to the community.  Unprecedented measurements of a squall line were used to document an unexpectedly strong and deep pool of thunderstorm outflow.  A theoretical study showed that the lower tropospheric stability has a major impact on the ability of storms to produce intense rotation at the surface, which is a precursor for tornado formation.  A composite analysis of the soundings collected near supercells showed that the environmental parameters that favor tornadoes become even more impressive in the immediate vicinity of the supercells themselves.  A study of a dissipating supercell from VORTEX2 led to development of a new technqiue for model simulations, and revealed the intricate interplay between environmental stability and vertical wind shear in storm maintenance.  Finally, a theoretical study showed the comparative importance of different downdraft-associated processes in the formation of surface vorticity in supercell (again, which is a precursor for tornado formation).  This theoretical work also led to new understanding of the sensitivities of trajectory calculations in the vicinity of supercell thunderstorms.  This project has supported (in whole or in part) the achievement of degrees for Casey Letkewicz (Ph.D., now faculty at US Air Force Academy), Adam French (Ph.D., now faculty at SD School of Mines and Technology), and Matthew Morin (M.S.).  This project also supported the mentoring and development of post-doc Johannes Dahl, who recently accepted a faculty position at Texas Tech University.  Finally, the project provided hands-on field experience and training for 15 student workers during the VORTEX2 field campaign.  One third of these student worker slots were filled by under-represented groups (4 women and 1 African American).  The work under this award resulted in 6 peer-reviewed journal articles, more than 15 conference presentations, a handful of public outreach presentations about VORTEX2, and threads of research that continue toward publication under subsequent NSF grant AGS-1156123.  Soundings data collected during VORTEX2 have been shared with the community and PI Parker has actively participated in subsequent VORTEX2 workshops where post-field analysis is discussed.
