<AbstractNarration>CAREER: Centering the Teaching of Mathematics on Urban Youth integrates educational and research activities with the ultimate goal of improving the mathematics education of students in high poverty, urban high schools. The project is situated in an urban schools context with a specific focus on developing secondary mathematics teachers? capacity for implementing culturally relevant mathematics pedagogy (CuReMaP). CuReMaP consists of three elements: 1) teaching mathematics for understanding, 2) including aspects of the lived experiences of students and their communities as contexts for mathematization, and 3) utilizing mathematics to analyze or describe societal themes or inequities to develop students? awareness, mathematical literacy and sense of agency so that they can fully participate in our nation?s democracy. &lt;br/&gt;The project is organized around two main objectives: 1) to better prepare and support high school teachers to teach mathematics effectively, using a framework of culturally relevant mathematics pedagogy and 2) to gain a research based understanding of the outcomes of culturally relevant mathematics pedagogy for students in high poverty, urban high schools. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The preparation, training, and induction of mathematics teachers to teach in urban schools so that students in these schools have opportunities to successfully participate in mathematics learning is widely recognized as a pressing issue.     My CAREER project was organized to focus on mathematics teaching in urban high schools. The specific focus was on developing practices of culturally relevant mathematics pedagogy; that is,  1) emphasizing studentsÆ academic success in mathematics through teaching for understanding, 2) centering instruction on students by providing students with opportunities to be central participants in the building of mathematical understanding,  and 3) facilitates the development of critical thinking with and about mathematics.    In 2009-2011, I designed, facilitated, and studied a professional development program that supported mathematics teachers at two high schools in low-income, urban neighborhoods. The professional development program consisted of two summer institutes and follow-up on-site learning and support on-site at the schools. In 2012-2014, I designed, facilitated, and studied a revised, one-year version of this program, for mathematics teachers from secondary schools in low-income neighborhoods across the city, at a central but off-site location. For this second cycle of the project, I gathered data on teachersÆ instruction and beliefs from before the professional development, as well as in the school year following the 1-year professional development.   In addition to having a significant impact on about 30 teachers in urban secondary schools in low-income neighborhoods, the projectÆs research has had a broader impact.
