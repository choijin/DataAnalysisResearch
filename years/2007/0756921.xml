<AbstractNarration>The University of Cincinnati's College of Engineering is increasing and retaining to completion the number of underrepresented students in engineering fields.  The project is an outcome a NSF Bridges to Engineering Education (BEE) Planning Grant that held focus group meetings with teachers and administrators from 14 school districts and conducted secondary school and university student surveys.  Based on the findings, an alliance was formed among UC engineering faculty and teachers and administrators from 18 school districts within a 100 km radius of Cincinnati to develop this project that targets the 159,623 students enrolled in these districts' public schools.  The student population consists of about 41% minority and 49% female students, and about 29% of these students have indicated an interest in engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is focusing on recruitment and retention.  Included among the strategies being used are precollege activities, a summer institute for high school students, both six week and one week summer bridge programs, peer, corporate and faculty mentoring, supplemental instruction, and both summer and academic year undergraduate research opportunities.  The first two activities listed are supported by non-NSF funds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This STEP project was started in June 2008 with following goals: (1) increase and retain to completion the number of women and underrepresented minority students in the College of Engineering and Applied Science (CEAS) at University of Cincinnati (UC), and (2) to create the best environment for studying and performing research so that they become well prepared for graduate education and the rigors of the ever-changing global market. The first cohort of 20 students started in the Summer Bridge Program of 2008, and consisted only of minority students. In 2009, we obtained a scholarship grant, Choose Ohio First Scholarship Program (COFSP), from the Ohio Board of Regents. The grant was leveraged to provide scholarships to deserving Ohio-resident STEP students for five-year undergraduate study, and was expanded to include, economically disadvantaged and first generation college bound engineering students, in addition to underrepresented (all women + minority men) engineering students. Using COFSP, STEP Cohorts 2 (2009-10) and 3 (2010-11) were recruited and included 59 and 76 students, respectively. After this STEP recruitment was limited to minority students, and Cohorts 4 (2011-12), 5 (2012-13) and 6 (2013-14) started with 25, 19, and 20 students, respectively, and mostly (90%) consisted of minority students. In 2010-11, COFSP funds were available to recruit 12 transfer students from 4-year and community colleges and also 7 underrepresented students were added to Cohort 2. After 2011-12, when COFSP funds became available due to either STEP students leaving CEAS or being dropped due to non-compliance in participation, replacement students from same cohort were selected. As a result, a total of 5 students were added to Cohorts 3, 4, and 5 in different years. Also for Cohort 6 students, we were able to give the COFSP award to 5 out of the 20 students. In total 17 students in Cohorts 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6 were awarded COFSP when funds became available. Thus, a total of 244 students have participated in the STEP program in CEAS at UC.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The strategies implemented in this STEP project for recruitment and retention included: cohort building, networking, and pathway to graduate school. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cohort building</span> included building productive academic relationships among students, between students and faculty, and between students and the university administration.
