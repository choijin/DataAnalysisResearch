<AbstractNarration>Miami University will conduct an REU site on Ecology in Human-Dominated Landscapes.  Students will spend 10 weeks in the summer engaged in collaborative, multi-disciplinary research emphasizing ecological questions in landscapes heavily influenced by human activity.  The project will recruit a diverse group of students including underrepresented minorities, first-generation college students, and students from colleges with little research opportunities.  Students will conduct individual projects with the guidance of faculty mentors, and be part of a research "cluster" consisting of 3-4 students and their mentors.  Students in a cluster will collaborate, focusing on a theme that ties together individual research topics.  Thus, students will have the opportunity to work in multi-disciplinary research teams, structured similarly to research groups solving real-world problems.  Whole-group activities, including a workshop on the scientific profession, careers in ecology, preparation and delivery of scientific presentations, and other aspects of research will be offered.  Students will participate in sessions on scientific and environmental ethics, and field trips to sites of local ecological interest.  Finally, each student will present his or her research as an oral presentation, an electronic poster, and a written paper that will be developed into a manuscript for publication.  Miami University has excellent facilities for executing this REU site, including a diverse array of human-dominated ecosystems (including a nearby field station), and state-of-the-art laboratory facilities.  Miami has a long and excellent history of involving undergraduates in research.  More information is available by visiting http://www.muohio.edu/ecoreu or by contacting David J. Berg (bergdj@muohio, 513-529-3174).</AbstractNarration>

Colleagues from universities across the United States including Puerto Rico assisted with recruiting.  We made annual recruiting trips to Puerto Rico.  The Director of Diversity Enhancement at Miami recruited for our program at the same time she recruited for graduate programs, recognizing our program as a wonderful opportunity for minority students to learn about research at Miami as a preface to entering our graduate programs.  Participant diversity was high: 58% (14 of 24) of participants were members of minority groups and 54% (13 of 24) first-generation college students. Percentage of stu...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
