<AbstractNarration>The REU Site Program in molecular biosciences at the University of Oregon offers an exceptional opportunity for highly motivated undergraduates to carry out individual research projects. Students conduct research under the supervision of a faculty mentor in areas including molecular and cell biology, developmental and evolutionary biology, neurobiology, computational biology, bioinformatics, biochemistry, biophysics, and structural biology. The 10-week summer program includes an orientation, workshops on experimental methods, group meetings to discuss research progress, faculty seminars, professional development workshops, and field trips. Weekly social gatherings with faculty, postdoctoral fellows, graduate students, and fellow undergraduates provide additional opportunity for students to network with their peers and to learn about research careers. At the end of summer, students present their work as a poster presentation at the Undergraduate Research Symposium. REU students receive a stipend, housing, meals and reimbursement for travel costs. Students from groups underrepresented in the sciences and those with limited access to research are especially encouraged to apply. More information is available at http://biology.uoregon.edu/uoreu/, or by contacting the Program Director, Dr Peter O'Day, at oday@uoregon.edu or (541)346-4518. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The NSF REU Site Program in Molecular Biosciences at the University of Oregon (Award 0755581) provided robust research experiences to 31 undergraduates, who may not otherwise have had such or similar high caliber opportunities, as a strategy for training our next generation of life sciences researchers.  Interns were trained in Molecular and Cellular Developmental Biology, Molecular Neurobiology, Molecular Evolution, Biophysics and Biochemistry, all on projects at the forefront of life sciences investigation.  In a large way, we have met our key goals for these young investigators of a) imparting experience-based education in science research; b) developing appreciation of experimental approaches, strategic design, and creative reasoning; c) developing methodological skills; d) enhancing deductive and inductive reasoning skills; e) enhancing scientific communication skills; f) boosting personal confidence by professional and social interactions experienced researchers; and g) gaining insights into graduate education and research environments. Some research publications will result from these experiences that are of great significance to the scientific bases in these areas of study.  As of this writing, the undergraduate REU interns are at various stages in their educational development.  30 are pursuing careers in life sciences or related professions.  We expect that about 19 will pursue STEM area PhD degrees and become creative, contributing researchers to 21st century life research science and technology.  Regardless of their career paths, all interns have benefited professionally and personally from this rigorous, closely mentored program.  The program has also trained early career scientists to become effective mentors, training for the future face of life sciences.
