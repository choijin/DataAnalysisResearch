<AbstractNarration>The PI's request funding to investigate and quantify the high pressure double pulse LIBS through studies of bubble dynamics and plasma behavior. This effort will guide apparatus and methodology improvements with the goal of increasing the pressure where double pulse LIBS can be effectively used to 250 bar or more. The proposed work will also provide important information about matrix effects at high pressure. The ultimate goal is sufficient understanding of high pressure LIBS to allow its use from an ROV or submersible, and the production of a conceptual design for that purpose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One reviewer said that by significantly advancing our abilities for in situ and continuous chemical analysis of the oceans, the proponents are enhancing society's abilities to understand the ocean. The proponents do this while promoting teaching and learning for graduate students in their pursuit of graduate degrees.  Another said that the authors are involved in training students in the LIBS technique and its applications. This is extremely important for a new technique. A useful technique like LIBS will only gain its full advantage as young people grow into the technique. The authors also demonstrate a great record in terms of publication and disseminating information on their work, so I have high hopes that they will continue this good record with the continuation of this work.</AbstractNarration>
