<AbstractNarration>One of the greatest challenges in biology is to explain the levels and patterns of species&lt;br/&gt;diversity. Hybrid zones, where closely related species co-occur and hybridize, provide&lt;br/&gt;an ideal setting in which to study the processes that generate and maintain species&lt;br/&gt;diversity. This research will combine field observations, controlled laboratory&lt;br/&gt;experiments and modern molecular tools to address fundamental questions regarding&lt;br/&gt;the distributional patterns observed among three topminnow species in the Fundulus&lt;br/&gt;notatus species complex. Throughout the Midwestern and Southern United States, the&lt;br/&gt;species encounter one another in numerous hybrid zones, making them an ideal group&lt;br/&gt;for study.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will comprehensively address the evolutionary history of the F.&lt;br/&gt;notatus species group and will increase our understanding of the role evolutionary and&lt;br/&gt;ecological processes play in producing and maintaining the species diversity we&lt;br/&gt;observe today. Moreover, this research has important conservation implications and will&lt;br/&gt;be of interest to various state agencies. The research program will integrate teaching&lt;br/&gt;and research by involving undergraduate and graduate students in the research&lt;br/&gt;enterprise at the two diverse universities. Personnel active in the research will&lt;br/&gt;participate in existing outreach programs aimed at recruiting underrepresented groups&lt;br/&gt;into the sciences and improving science literacy in pre-collegiate students.</AbstractNarration>
