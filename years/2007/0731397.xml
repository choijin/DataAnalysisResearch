<AbstractNarration>This grant supports the attendance of graduate students to the 51st International Conference on Electron, Ion and Photon Beam Technology and Nanofabrication, 2007, to be held in Denver, Colorado, May 29 to June 1, 2007. In the fields of nanofabrication, electron and ion lithographies, photon and imprint lithographies, particle-beam optics, and forefront applications of nanofabrication, this conference is preeminent. &lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the proposal includes the sharing of research findings and the broader impacts are in the impact on the students involved in the conference.  The students will present their research, which will allow them to practice their presentation and communication skills.  The students will also be involved in a presentation by the conference organizers that will let them learn more about how to organize a conference.  They will learn about putting the conference program together and the organization of the conference venue and other logistics.  This research will have a good impact on the students involved and will help them prepare for future leadership opportunities in professional societies.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
