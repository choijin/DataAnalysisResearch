<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;Georgia Tech proposes to significantly advance the performance of white light emitters by demonstrating a totally new paradigm in optical emitter design, growth and fabrication. The approach will demonstrate improved growth technologies by using 1) lattice matched and strain compensated growth technologies exclusively available at Georgia Tech, 2) lattice matched UV emitter structures resulting in reduced non-radiative recombination, 3) white light emission via a self-fluorescing substrate material.  This goal will be achieved via use of novel substrate that is lattice matched to AlGaN/AlInGaN/AlInN in the wavelength range of ~331 nm.  The final product of this research should result in a white light emitter that eliminates the traditional phosphor approach along with the associated cost, complexity and decreased yield associated with the need for such phosphors. A lattice matched UV emitter is grown using III-Nitride materials on a self-luminescent substrate.  The solid state UV emitter is used to pump the self-fluorescent substrate, which converts the UV light to a broad white light emission.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:&lt;br/&gt; The broader impact of this proposed effort includes outreach to minorities in the form of summer internship participation, education/motivation of high school and junior high students thru the "adopt-a-school" program, better multidisciplinary integration of undergraduate research projects and a traditionally disadvantaged rural Georgia outreach program.  Given the novelty of several of the devices proposed herein, new companies are expected to form, providing an economic benefit as well. The demonstrator devices proposed herein were selected for their importance to industry, impact on society, particularly their biological/medical diagnostic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The core technology proposed herein and resulting device applications will make a lasting impression on the scientific, engineering, economic and educational fields.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
