<AbstractNarration>In response to the national need to improve the quality of science learning, instruction, and assessment, the five-year WestEd-submitted proposal aims at pioneering simulation-based, curriculum-embedded, inquiry formative assessments with immediate, individualized feedback and supporting reflection activities for middle school students in life, physical, and earth science. In a joint effort with AAAS Project 2061, WestEd plans to scale-up exemplars from Calipers I - an ESI-funded demonstration project focused on using simulations to assess complex science learning - and build on a REC-supported project - Validities of Standards-Based Science Inquiry Assessments: Implementation Study. The proposal's objectives are: (1) to develop formative and benchmark simulation-based assessments of science knowledge for key content in physical, life, and earth science, and for science inquiry strategies; (2) to enhance formative assessment simulation modules with immediate, individualized feedback, reflection activities, and supplementary instructional hints; (3) to develop and document technology-based assessment designs and exemplars that take advantage of simulation environments to provide assessment of science standards for formative and summative purposes; (4) to document the technical infrastructure and re-usable designs and processes employed; (5) to provide evidence of the technical quality, feasibility, and usability of the new assessments; (6) to study the influence of formative assessments on complex science inquiry learning; and (7) to link the enlarged collection of Calipers II benchmark and formative and embedded assessments to national science standards and the AAAS item clusters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anticipated products include six sets of validated simulation-based formative assessments, and a scalable model for middle school science assessment. AAAS' reviews (standards alignment), an Advisory Panel, and an external evaluator characterize the proposed evaluation. Dissemination plans include presentations in major professional organizations, sharing of exemplars through WestEd's Center for Assessment and Evaluation of Student Learning site, and linkages to other websites (e.g., AAAS). &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Calipers II: Using Simulations to Assess Complex Science Learning Edys Quellmalz WestEd    The Framework for K-12 Science Education and the Next Generation Science Standards call for integrating understanding of the key ideas of science with engagement in the practices of science. However, currently available science assessments focus on disjointed pieces of knowledge about these ideas and practices that are typically tested in static formats and that do not involve students in active investigations.  The Calipers II project aimed to develop the next generation of dynamic, interactive science assessments. The project designed simulations to present grade-appropriate models of science systems "in action". The assessments targeted understanding of the components, interactions, and dynamic behaviors of science systems and the science inquiry practices for investigating them. The science simulations presented phenomena that are often too big (ecosystems), too small (atoms), too fast, too slow, or too dangerous to observe and investigate directly. Evidence-centered assessment design was used to connect targeted, interrelated science knowledge and inquiry skills to assessment tasks that would require students to use the knowledge and skills, to the evidence from those tasks that would demonstrate progress and learning.   The Calipers II project developed and validated three suites of simulation-based assessments for the middle school topics of Ecosystems, Force and Motion, and Atoms and Molecules. The assessments were designed to be inserted into ongoing curriculum units. Each assessment suite consisted of two or three simulation-based curriculum-embedded assessments followed by off-line reflection activities, as well as an end-of-unit simulation-based benchmark assessment. The curriculum-embedded assessments were meant to serve formative purposes by providing students and teachers with feedback on a studentÆs progress toward understanding the science system and their skill at applying inquiry strategies. The embedded assessments engaged students in active investigation of the science system as they solved an authentic problem. For example, for Ecosystems, students were assessed on their understanding of the components and roles of organisms (consumers and producers) needed to investigate how to restore a grasslands ecosystem ravaged by a wild fire.

Intellectual Merit. The Calipers II project has created a new generation of technology-enhanced assessments that bring best assessment practices into classrooms to transform what, how, when, and where science learning is assessed.
