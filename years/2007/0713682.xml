<AbstractNarration>The mathematics department at Harvey Mudd College in Claremont, CA has been organizing a series of annual mathematics conferences since 1999.  These conferences, unusual because the topics vary from year to year, have been designed to expose faculty, recent post-docs, graduate students and undergraduates to cutting-edge mathematics, and to enhance the Harvey Mudd College research environment by fostering interactions between its students and faculty and the participants of the conference.  Since 2004, these conferences have benefitted from NSF grants which have permitted the conference to grow and attract a national audience.  This award will continue to provide support for four plenary speakers and a contributed poster session. It will also further broaden the geographic participation in the conferences by providing travel support for graduate students and recent Ph.D.'s, with preference given to members of under-represented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By bringing topflight researchers to Harvey Mudd College each fall, the conferences expose participants to a wide range of mathematics. Past topics have included analysis; applied mathematics; differential geometry; applied algebra and combinatorics; mathematical biology; geometry, algebra and phylogenetic trees; scientific computing; and enumerative combinatorics. The planned topics for the conferences covered by this award are public sector operations research, nonlinear analysis, and fluid mechanics. The conferences give rise to activities and projects in mathematics courses taught at Harvey Mudd College, and many Harvey Mudd College undergraduates are in attendance. They also serve as a convenient gathering place for mathematicians and mathematics students in Southern California, fostering interaction and collaboration in several mathematical communities.&lt;br/&gt;With community-wide pre-conference talks that emphasize the impact and beauty of mathematics, these conferences will annually influence nearly 200 people, encouraging mathematical research while also strengthening public awareness of mathematics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[This award helped to       support four mathematics conferences held at Harvey Mudd College       in Claremont, California in       2007, 2008, 2010 and 2011.  These conferences, unusual because the topics vary from year to       year, were designed to expose faculty, graduate students, advanced       undergraduate students and the broader community to cutting-edge       mathematics.  Each conference featured an opening plenary talk       that was free and open to the public and designed for a general,       non-technical audience, as well as four main speakers and a poster       session.  The topics of the conferences were:   2007: Public Sector Operations Research  2008: Nonlinear Functional Analysis  2010: Mathematics of Environmental Sustainability and Green       Technology  2011: Broadening Participation in the Mathematical Sciences   The NSF award covered the expenses associated with inviting four       speakers to present at the conference, and with providing travel       support to young scholars (undergraduates, graduate students and       post-docs) from across the country to attend.  The young scholars       presented their own research during a poster session and had ample       opportunities to network and foster collaborations with other       attendees.  The Harvey Mudd College Mathematics Department was a       co-sponsor of the series.     With community-wide pre-conference talks that emphasized the impact     and beauty of mathematics, these conferences annually influenced     over 200 people, encouraging mathematical research while also     strengthening public awareness of mathematics.
