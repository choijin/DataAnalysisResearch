<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;CT-ISG: Compiler-Enabled Adaptive Security Monitoring on Networked&lt;br/&gt;Embedded Systems&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zhiyuan Li, Saurabh Bagchi, Yung-Hsiang Lu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Department of Computer Science,&lt;br/&gt;Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering&lt;br/&gt;Purdue University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hardware technologies have made steady progress&lt;br/&gt;in miniaturization of sensors and computing/communication devices,&lt;br/&gt;which has driven a trend towards pervasive computing, which is a way&lt;br/&gt;to let computing devices directly interact with the physical world to monitor&lt;br/&gt;the natural environment, to provide building safety, and so on.&lt;br/&gt;In order to make pervasive computing a reality,&lt;br/&gt;it is critical to secure the underlying  networked embedded systems,&lt;br/&gt;because these systems may collect important&lt;br/&gt;environment data upon which time-sensitive decisions are dependent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately, many of networked embedded systems, e.g.  wireless and&lt;br/&gt;wired sensor networks, RFID infrastructure, wireless mesh networks,&lt;br/&gt;have components or links that are openly exposed to potential&lt;br/&gt;adversaries and hence are under constant security threats such as node&lt;br/&gt;capture, denial of service, and intrusion, among others.  To make the&lt;br/&gt;matters worse, many networked embedded systems have much more&lt;br/&gt;constrained resources such as storage, bandwidth, computing power and&lt;br/&gt;energy than computers used in non-embedded applications, e.g. desktop&lt;br/&gt;machines and servers.  Sophisticated computer security schemes&lt;br/&gt;developed over the last few decades are often infeasible on networked&lt;br/&gt;embedded systems, at least not in their original forms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research team of this project&lt;br/&gt;develops a multi-grade monitoring scheme, supported by a new&lt;br/&gt;programming interface,&lt;br/&gt;in which low-cost monitoring activities&lt;br/&gt;are deployed in normal mode of operation of the systems&lt;br/&gt;to detect suspicious symptoms which are possibly, although&lt;br/&gt;not necessarily, caused by security threats. &lt;br/&gt;This effort will lead to much more effective, yet affordable, security&lt;br/&gt;monitoring and defense on networked embedded systems,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
