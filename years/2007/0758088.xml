<AbstractNarration>The research develops a new, broadly applicable, method for precision calculation of properties of atomic systems with more than one valence electron. This method combines the all-order approach currently used in precision calculations of properties of monovalent atoms with the configuration interaction (CI) approach that is applicable for many-electron systems. The main goal of this research is to improve the theoretical understanding of parity nonconservation (PNC) in heavy atoms.</AbstractNarration>
