<AbstractNarration>The objective of this project is to develop chromate-free corrosion hybrid clay/polyimide nanocomposite coatings with improved corrosion resistance and lifetime. The key to achieving the stated goal is effective control of dispersion and structure of clay platelets. Double intercalation polymerization technique involving oxidative intercalation of aniline in the presence of clay followed by condensation polymerization of polyamic acid reaction mixtures in the presence of clay/polyaniline nanocomposites will be used to effectively control the extent of intercalation of clay and improve the dispersion of clay in the polyimide matrix. The polymerization conditions will be systematically controlled effectively control the d-spacing and dispersion of clay. Coatings of the hybrid nanocomposite containing clay with varying extent of intercalation will be cast onto aluminum or steel substrates. The corrosion rate and lifetime of hybrid nano-composite coatings, containing clay with known extent of intercalation will be determined and correlation between the structure of clay and corrosion inhibition and lifetime will be made.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will have a significant impact in the development of environmentally friendly coatings and provide a viable alternative to hazardous chromate coating systems, which have been prohibited by the EPA since 2007.  Corrosion management and protection of metals costs the nation over $20 billion annually.  Successful completion of this research will offer the potential for significant improvements in protection against corrosion and enhancement of coating lifetimes there-by reducing maintenance and equipment down-time costs.</AbstractNarration>

Clay/polyimide nanocomposites   Polyimide/nanoclay coatings and thin films containing about 20wt% of clay were successfully synthesized by solution casting followed by thermal imidization. The extent of imidization of polyimide was correlated to the curing temperature, weight fraction of clay and the nature of clay. Imidization was optimized at 150?C where the highest increase in the degree of imidization occurred. The polyaniline-modified clay/polyimide , PANi-clay/PI nanocomposites produced a much higher increased in degree of imidization, DOI at all the curing temperature and weight fraction of clay tested.  The degree of imidization was correlated with the corrosion potential, Ecorr (Fig. 1). Below DOI of 50% no significant increase in Ecorr occurred. However, above DOI of 50%, corrosion potential increased with increasing degree of imidization (Fig.1).  The corrosion rate of aluminum alloy, Al2024-T3, coated with the nanocomposite decreased with increasing weight fraction of nanoclay (Fig. 2) and attained the lowest value at nanoclay weigh fraction of 20wt%. Corrosion rate of the coated substrate also decreased with increasing degree of imidization.  The nanocomposite coatings containing PANi-clay produced the lowest corrosion rate and highest polarization resistance at a low nanofiller weight fraction of 0.25%. At such a low weight fraction of 0.25% PANi-clay, the polarization resistance of aluminum alloy substrate coated with PANi-clay/PI is as low as that for Al alloy substrate coated with  nanoclay/PI containing &ge; 10wt% of nanoclay (Fig. 3). So extremely low corrosion rate can be achieved by reinforcing PI with high weight fraction, &ge; 10% of nanoclay or by filling PI with very low weight fraction (~ 0.25%) of PANi-clay. It is suggested that at low weigh fraction of PANi-clay of ~0.25 wt.%, the polarization resistance of PANi-clay/PI coated Al alloy substrate reaches its highest value of 108 Ohms, which is similar to the polarization resistance measured for Al alloy coated with nanoclay/PI containing 20 wt.% of nanoclay, and two orders of magnitude higher than that for the same substrate coated with neat PI.  1.1. Corrosion performance of nanoclay/PI coatings  Curing of polyimide and polyimide nanocomposites at 250?C significantly increased both the corrosion resistance and durability. PI coatings cured at 250?C produced significantly higher initial polarization resistance and coating resistance of about 109 Ohms (Fig. 3), which slightly decreased to 108 Ohms after 8 weeks of exposure in a 3.5% salt solution (Fig. 4).  Reinforcement of polyimide with clay significantly improved the corrosion inhibition properties of polyimide. Clay/PI composite coatings cured at 150?C provided significant improvement in corrosion resistance and durability over the neat polyimide coating cured under similar conditions. At higher curing temperature (250?C) remarkable protection of aluminum alloy against corrosion is provided by clay/polyimide composite containing between 2 wt.% clay and 20wt% of clay. The polyimide nanocomposite coating containing 20 wt.% of nanoclay shows a nearly perfect barrier property with remark...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
