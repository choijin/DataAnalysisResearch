<AbstractNarration>The REU Program on Inverse Problems for Electrical Networks will bring eight undergraduates to the Department of Mathematics at the University of Washington in each of the summers 2008-10 to work on discrete inverse problems.  The inverse problem for an electrical network is the problem of finding the conductivity of resistors and shape of a network when the boundary current response to boundary voltages (response matrix) is known. Resistances may be specified by directed or undirected edge functions or vertex functions.  Students will investigate the relation between the response matrix and the geometry of the network. The students will also pursue related discrete problems involving Bruhat orders, Schubert varieties and tableaux.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The students and faculty in the REU program Inverse Problems for  Electrical Networks spent eight weeks in each of the last three summers working on problems related to finding properties of  an  electrical network when certain values of measurements of voltage and current at terminals of the network are known.  There were a total of thirty-eight undergraduate  students, eight graduate student TAs, and five faculty in the program.  The participants discovered how to compute the values of resistances and the shape of an electrical network in certain cases, especially certain types of planar networks.  They also found networks for which this is not possible but for which there is an n-fold set of possibilities (n-1 graphs).  They studied both finite and infinite networks and found results for non-planar graphs. They also studied properties of knots and their projections in the plane.   After the first week each day was organized as follows.  Each student met for a period of forty-five minutes to one hour with one of the faculty or assistants. Students and faculty worked together on the problems. This typically consisted of working on details of computations, testing conjectures with examples, or working on details of proofs.  For the faculty this occupied all of the day.  For the students the remaining time was spent working with other students, writing computer code, consulting texts and journals, or composing the finished paper in latex.  Some of these papers have been submitted for publication in prominent research journals. Each student made several oral presentations to the whole  group.  At these talks the students handed out a printed copy of the talk to the audience.  Many of these students are now graduate students at  prominent research universities.
