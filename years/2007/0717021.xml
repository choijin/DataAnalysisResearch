<AbstractNarration>This project will explore, through a series of observations and experiments on over 300 nesting attempts per year, how climate change will affect Tree Swallows nesting near Ithaca, New York, and their insect prey. The proposed research will network 25 active nests with temperature sensors, motion-detecting web cameras and Radio Frequency Identification readers to provide details on avian responses to environmental change. The proposed research investigates the effects of different thermal environments, not only on the birds directly, but indirectly through observations and experiments on the effects of temperature on insect flight.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The project will directly support five graduate students and nine undergraduates and indirectly support the research of at least 20 more from a diversity of ethnic backgrounds. The Ithaca site will continue to serve as the test-bed for techniques and approaches at other Tachycineta study sites in the pan-American Golondrinas de la Americas research network.  Data from this project will cap a 25-year dataset, made available to the public at the Ithaca page of the Golondrinas web-site: &lt;http://golondrinas.cornell.edu&gt;. This five-year research program is a focused approach to the most pervasive and important environmental concern of our time: global warming and how both birds and insects will respond to it. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

To better understand the swallows in this predator-prey system, we have been studying direct weather effects on foraging behavior: we find that the height and distance that swallows fly in search of prey for their offspring depends much more strongly on daily variation in local weather conditions than it does on the number or age of the offspring being fed or the age of the parent swallows doing the feeding. Another surprisingly strong effect of weather is revealed by a model we are now writing up based simply on daily maximum temperatures and calendar date that can explain a great deal of the annual variation in population lay-date distributions.  These results are valuable contrasts to much of the work we do on variation in individual quality, as we find that when a swallow lays in a give season is the best indicator we have of how many eggs it is going to lay, how strong its immune response to novel antigens is going to be and how well it performs in standardized flight tunnel tests.     Timing of breeding has a important connections to global change. We recently published a comparative paper with colleagues across North America showing that swallow food supplies tend to plateau in late spring after a pretty regular increase early in the season. Thus they are not subject to a sharp peak in food availability for rearing chicks, and, u...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
