<AbstractNarration>CBET-0755104&lt;br/&gt;Karagozian&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study examines the fundamental nature and control approaches of near-field shear layer instabilities for the variable density crossflow or transverse jets. Transverse jets are widely applicable in energy systems, including dilution air jet injection for temperature pattern factor and NOx emissions control, film cooling jets for turbine blades, and hot reactive fuel jets in high speed combustors. Controlling the trajectory, spread, mixing, and temperature or density field associated with such jets could have important implications for improved energy efficiency. These studies build on the PI?s current NSF-funded research exploring shear layer instabilities associated with isothermal, isodensity transverse jets and their active forcing. These suggest that a range of potentially interesting phenomena may be present in the flow field with density and/or temperature variation. For the isothermal, isodensity jet at a fixed jet Reynolds number, the jet transitions from the ?free jet? to the ?transverse jet? as the crossflow velocity increases. Remarkable alterations in the spectral character of the upstream shear layer instability are then observed. The instability near the jet exit develops strong multiple modes that overtake one another in strength for jet-to-crossflow velocity ratios between 10 and 3.5. For lower ratios, the transverse jet shear layer instability develops a strong dominant mode in addition to higher harmonics, suggesting a nonlinear evolution. The alterations in these shear layer modes are seen in experiments, and their character is delineated in and supported by linear stability analyses and 3D numerical simulations. The stability characteristics suggest that at critical velocity ratios, the shear layer changes from being convectively unstable to possibly being absolutely unstable or self-excited. Response of the transverse jet shear layer to low level forcing is consistent with this interpretation. Such stability characteristics suggest reasons for the transverse jet?s ability to mix with surrounding gases in a superior manner to that of the free jet, but also suggest strategies for controlling jet behavior via jet forcing. Low to moderate level sinusoidal forcing can affect jet response for velocity ratios above approximately 3.5, so jet spread and penetration can be improved and controlled. However, for lower velocity ratios, very strong forcing with a prescribed temporal pulse width is required to significantly affect the jet. Based on these observations and the well known transition in instabilities associated with low density or heated free jets, the PIs plan to explore the shear layer instabilities associated with variable density and nonisothermal transverse jets, and to develop procedures for the strategic control of the jet based on specific applications relevant to energy generation systems. It is hypothesized that heated or low density jets in crossflow will experience an acceleration in the development of absolutely unstable flow, that is, the instability will occur at higher momentum flux ratios than in the isothermal case. The PIs postulate that the opposite effect would occur for the instabilities associated with the higher density or cooler jet in crossflow. Thus, for applications involving cooling dilution air jets, film cooling for turbine blades, and hot reactive jets in combustors, different control strategies based on the differing character of the instabilities will need to be developed. The PI?s current NSF project has had significant outreach to and laboratory experiences for local high school students and underrepresented students at other universities. In this project, undergraduates will continue to be trained and employed in the variable density transverse jet studies with hoped for NSF REU support. Outreach presentations and demonstrations will continue for local high school and potentially middle school and elementary school students to compensate for cutbacks in funding by the state of California to the public schools?
