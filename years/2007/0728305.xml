<AbstractNarration>A basic goal of biological oceanography is to understand the abundance and distribution of organisms in the sea. Although the newest generation of ocean observing systems promise higher spatial and temporal sampling rates than heretofore possible, our capability to sense the ocean, in-situ, especially when considering animals of millimeter to centimeters could certainly be improved upon. Acoustic techniques hold promise for fulfilling this goal, however, when used in the traditional manner to monitor only animal backscatter amplitude suffer from many ambiguities. This proposal requests funds to explore a new option: Sensing the reflected sound from a number of different points of view in order to judge size and shape. The theory of tomographic inversion from multiple views suggests that this approach has potential to succeed. If successful, the project will point the way to a next generation of acoustic sensors with increased specificity over existing ones and help to bridge the gap between our ability to characterize marine populations and our interests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a nice educational component to this that includes research experiences for high school students and their teacher plus curriculum development. The development of a functional prototype with a path towards commercialization will be of benefit to the community. This technology could revolutionize our ability to remotely assess zooplankton in the ocean. One graduate student will be trained in acoustic theory and technology development and several undergraduate students will be supported.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Introduction:                    A pervasive goal of Biological Oceanography is to characterize the abundance and distribution of animals in the sea.  Although there is great public interest in the largest animals in the ocean, such as whales, the smaller animals, such as zooplankton, provide a vital link between the plants and the fish and larger animals.  In fact, it is likely that the most numerous multi-cellular animal on the planet is a small oceanic zooplankton, a copepod.              However, despite the paramount importance of these animals, the technology that exists to monitor them is insufficient in order to fulfill the goal of obtaining a thorough understanding of the ocean ecosystem.  The use of echo-sounding acoustic technology has great potential to improve capability and hence, merits study.              In the original proposal that funded the work reported here, Dr. Jaffe proposed that the use of multi-angle wide band echo-sounder technology could improve upon the ability to classify zooplankton into major taxa.  Experimental results, along with simulations, from were demonstrated.  Building upon these results, Dr. Jaffe was funded to build a prototype system, take it to sea, and explore the potential use of this new idea for obtaining better discrimination in characterizing zooplankton distributions in the sea.     Research Plan and Work Accomplished:              During the first two years of the program, we constructed two wide band sets of 4 acoustic transducers and the required electronics that would permit testing of the idea, both in the lab and at sea.  Early on, we also decided to augment the sonar system with a "low power underwater optical microscope" that would permit animal identification from a smaller volume, nearly spatially concurrent with the sonar.  After several tests, a maiden cruise was accomplished in Sept. of 2009.              Although the system performance was up to the engineering specifications, in that single returns from animals smaller than 1 mm were observable, results highlighted the fact that the intersection volume of the multiple sonars was so small that it precluded an efficient way to measure abundance.  We then altered the electronics so that multiple, wide-band, mono-static (same source and receiver) transducers could be used.  This maintains the wide band nature of the system that is still innovative, however, increases the volume of interrogation at the expense of relinquishing the multiple view aspect.  At the same time, we continued to develop an underwater imaging system that would permit concurrent identification of the zooplankton that the sonar was recording individual reflections from.              Both the sonar system with new electronics and the optical imaging system were completed so that they could be deployed in Sept, 2010 on a student-run research cruise in the Santa Barbara Channel.  Both systems worked extremely well in that many vertical profiles were obtained and the concurrent optical images turned out to have excellent resolution and contrast.              Based on these results, an additional project was awarded by the Israeli Bi-National Science Foundation (BSF), so that we could pursue experiments in the Gulf of Aquaba with our colleagues Amatzia Genin (Hebrew University, Jerusalem) and Steve Monismith, Jeff Koseff, and Fiorenza Micheli  (all Stanford professors).  As part of this project, the system was deployed in Eilat, Israel over a 4-month period.  In this case, the two sets of sonars were successful in measuring the reduction in concentration that was the result of the animals being eaten by a group of fish that were stationed over a small outcropping at 20 m depth.  Although the data is still being processed, initial impressions are that interesting and unique information about the fish consumption of the zooplankton will be computable from these data.  A final system deployment, on our autonomous profiling package, FIDO, took place f...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
