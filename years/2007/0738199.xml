<AbstractNarration>Tetrahymena thermophila is an excellent model microbial organism for fundamental eukaryotic experimental cell and molecular biology and for comparative and functional genomics. Tetrahymena is a free-living, non-pathogenic member of a unique group of eukaryotes known as the Alveolata. Because Tetrahymena exhibits remarkable functional conservation at the molecular and cellular level with animals (more so than other model systems such as yeast) and because scientists have developed robust and novel molecular genetic tools for studying its biology, Tetrahymena is an ideal model system for the investigation of animal biology. Tetrahymena is also an excellent model system for general studies of eukaryotes and for studies of related pathogenic organisms such as the causative agent of malaria. The primary goal of this project, a collaborative effort of The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR) and the Tetrahymena research community, is the whole-genome shotgun-sequencing, assembly and annotation of the expressed (macronuclear) T. thermophila genome. The project has three aims: (1) To whole-genome shotgun sequence and assemble the macronuclear genome to a depth of 3.5-fold sequence coverage (Funding for an additional 3-fold coverage has been obtained from the NIH, so the combined result of NSF and NIH support will be 6 to 7-fold coverage.); (2) to annotate and analyze the genome sequence, including the identification of putative genes, prediction of gene function, and other features standard for genomic analysis; and (3) to facilitate user-friendly and free access to the T. thermophila genome sequence and annotation by the creation of interlinked genome databases. This is a Microbial Genome Sequencing Award funded through a collaborative activity between the National Science Foundation and the Department of Agriculture.</AbstractNarration>
