<AbstractNarration>Whitledge 0732773&lt;br/&gt;Univ. of Alaska Fairbanks&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funds are provided to collect, quality control, analyze, and distribute to all BEST investigators the core physical and chemical observations collected on the BEST summer cruise as a service component of the larger ecosystem program. The PIs will also examine the persistence of along- and across-shelf gradients of temperature, salinity, fluorescence, oxygen, nutrients and currents by integrating data from the hydrographic surveys in summer with trajectories from satellite-tracked drifters, data from other cruises, and data from long-term moorings (funded elsewhere).&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This service proposal as a part of the Bering Sea Ecosystem Study (BEST) provided the field collection of hydrography and nutrient samples including quality control, analysis and distribution to all BEST investigators the core physical and chemical observations.  This study examined how sea-ice affects along- and across-shelf gradients of temperature, salinity, fluorescence, oxygen, nutrients and currents by integrating data from multiple hydrographic surveys in late winter and spring with trajectories from satellite-tracked drifters and data from long-term moorings that were funded separately by NPRB.  This service proposal supported the study of the eastern Bering Sea shelf to investigate the productive marine ecosystems with extraordinarily valuable fishery and subsistence resources.  But sub-arctic seas are predicted to be one of the regions most sensitive to ocean warming. Some of the most direct effects of changing climate will be on the extent, duration and timing of sea-ice over the Bering Sea shelf. Sea-ice in turn controls the timing of the spring phytoplankton bloom, water column temperature and salinity, and provides a platform for marine mammals to haul out on. Thus, the most urgent priority of the Bering Sea Ecosystem Study (BEST) was to examine the role of changing sea-ice conditions on the chemical, physical, and biological characteristics of the ecosystem.
