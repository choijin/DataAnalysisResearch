<AbstractNarration>The New York City Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (NYC LSAMP) in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) has spearheaded the increase in CUNY's annual baccalaureate degree production among underrepresented groups (African-American, Hispanic, Native American and Pacific Islanders) from 404 in 1991-1992 at the beginning of Phase I, to 852 in 2002-2003 (Phase III), and recently 633 in 2005-2006 (Phase III). From inception in the 1991/1992 academic year, the Alliance member campuses of the City University of New York have graduated over 9,000 underrepresented minority students with baccalaureate degrees in STEM. At the end of the fourteenth year (2006), the NYC LSAMP involves 17 of CUNY's 18 academic campuses, including the Graduate School and University Center (GSUC), CUNY's Ph.D. degree-granting unit. John Jay College will become the eighteenth member of the&lt;br/&gt;Alliance in Phase IV. The addition now allows for the inclusion of every undergraduate unit in the City University. The NYC LSAMP Undergraduate and Graduate Research Program, continues to be the heart of the NYC Alliance. &lt;br/&gt;Anticipated Outcomes/Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;LSAMP Phase IV will focus on program sustainability, intensify LSAMP activities to raise the graduation rate to 1,500 degrees per year in the STEM disciplines by 2012, increase the rate at which graduates pursue graduate education via Bridge to the Doctorate Initiatives and Bridge to Teaching Initiatives. LSAMP Phase IV activities will build on the successes of CUNY over the previous fifteen years of Phases I, II and III to ensure: 1) a substantial impact on the rate of attendance in STEM graduate programs by program participants; 2) increased rate of graduation of underrepresented minorities at the baccalaureate and associate levels at Alliance member institutions; 3) increased entrance into the teaching profession at the K-12 level and academia by underrepresented minorities; and 4) continuation of work in progress towards the formation of the CUNY Consortium for Minority Participation in STEM (CCMP-STEM), which will constitute the administration, institutionalization and sustainability of LSAMP activities by the City University of New York. LSAMP Phase IV continues the CUNY wide integrative activities started in 1992 and is responsive to changes within CUNY and on the national stage.&lt;br/&gt;Dissemination Activities&lt;br/&gt;The Urban University Series is an integrated university approach towards the recruitment of talented students to the university at the high school level, baccalaureate level, and the graduate level. The Urban University Series highlights the research work done by faculty and CUNY students involved in undergraduate and graduate research at CUNY, and serves as a networking event for minority scientists and engineers. The NYC LSAMP newsletter, published four times per calendar year and distributed nationally, will include profiles of all LSAMP program activities and students. Special supplements (electronic and print) will be produced devoted to the Bridge participants, and will focus on areas such as: choosing a thesis advisor, transition to graduate school, qualifying exams and proposals, and research publications. The NYC LSAMP Newsletter will provide a forum for dissemination of information about the existence, goals and results of the NYC LSAMP program. The LSAMP Virtual Community will be utilized to allows for communication and exchange of data and ideas. The current project (http://nyc-amp.cuny.edu) seeks to augment and couple the goals of LSAMP with the rapidly changing Internet space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
