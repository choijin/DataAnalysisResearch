<AbstractNarration>This project seeks to answer a simple question: how old are potholes and related geomorphic features found in the uplands of the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica? Some research suggests that they are over ten million years old and date the growth of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet, the world?s largest. However, some evidence suggests that these are young, erosional features that continuing to evolve to this day. This project uses cosmogenic nuclide dating to determine the age of the pothole floors. The results are important for determining the ice sheet?s history and interpreting the O-isotope record from the marine sediment cores, key records of global climate. Broader impacts include K12 outreach and incorporation of outcomes into university courses.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Large pothole and channels (~15 m deep) cut into sandstone bedrock within the Dry Valleys of Antarctica have been  used to infer catastrophic subglacial flooding beneath a massively expanded East Antarctic Ice Sheet that overran the Transantarctic Mountains during the middle Miocene (~ 14 million years ago).
