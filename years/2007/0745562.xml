<AbstractNarration>All organisms must adapt to their environment or risk extinction.  Because plants require pollen for seed production, many plant species have adapted to a lack of pollinators by self-pollinating, thus enabling them to produce seeds even in the absence of pollinators.  Self-pollination, however, erodes genetic variation, the raw material for adaptation.  This study examines whether self-pollination constrains the ability of plants to adapt to other important environmental challenges.  Wild monkey flowers (Mimulus guttatus) will be divided into self-pollinating and cross-pollinating lines and their ability to adapt to one of the most serious threats that plants face - insect herbivores - will be tested.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This collaboration unites expertise in plant mating system biology and plant-pest interactions. This study is highly relevant to conservation biology which needs to understand how reduced genetic variation affects adaptation.  Because many of the most important crops are self-pollinating (e.g., wheat and rice) and are constantly bombarded by pests, this study has important applied implications.  This proposal will support a postdoctoral fellow, a research assistant, and four undergraduate students. Supplemental funding will be sought to train additional undergraduates and K-12 teachers. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
