<AbstractNarration>This NSF DR-K12 project falls within the category of Applied Research: Evaluative Studies of NSF Funded Resources and Tools. The overarching goal of this project is to evaluate the assessment components embedded within two NSF-supported mathematics curricula: Everyday Mathematics and Math Trailblazers.  The investigators will apply a comprehensive validity perspective that integrates a variety of empirical evidence regarding the cognitive, psychometric, and instructional affordances of multiple assessments embedded in these curricula as part of their overall instructional design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
