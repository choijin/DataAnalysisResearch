<AbstractNarration>I FEEL SCIENCE: Innovative Flexible Experimental Environment for Learning in SCIENCE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It has been postulated that haptic perception such as force and thermal feedback, combined with hearing, can improve blind students? ability to understand scientific concepts and change their misconceptions. However, how the additional haptic feedback influences blind students? construction of knowledge, meaning making, and conceptual change from their misconceptions still remain unclear. One technological challenge is the implementation of the sense of touch in a way that evokes the tacit, embodied knowledge which has proved useful for formal and informal science learning. This project proposes the Innovative Flexible Experimental Environment for Learning SCIENCE (I FEEL SCIENCE). The primary educational goal of the project is to develop an interactive learning environment that supports science education for blind students through a multidisciplinary, learner-centered approach. I FEEL SCIENCE empowers blind students to actively integrate fundamental science concepts by supporting their hands-on practices with multiple, realistic and compatible sensory feedback such as haptic force and thermal senses. The primary technological goal of the project is to integrate haptic feedback into the I FEEL SCIENCE in a way that evokes tacit, embodied knowledge to support visually impaired students? construction of knowledge, to reduce their misconceptions of scientific concepts, and to improve their attitudes toward science learning. More specifically, this project will investigate and model the cognitive and affective impact of haptic perception on K7-K9 blind students? understanding on heat/temperature and intermolecular forces by assessing the ways that additional haptic feedback during a hands-on experience influence students? construction of knowledge, conceptual change, and attitudes toward science learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of I FEEL SCIENCE lies in its innovative pedagogical approach that is embedded within an experience-based learning environment providing multiple, realistic sensory feedback. The project?s multidisciplinary integration of cognitive ergonomics, accessibility, usability, and instructional design principles is embedded within an environment that facilitates transfer of basic knowledge (e.g., science) for application to advanced technologies to increase STEM accessibility and participation of blind users. The unique learner-centered and participatory design practice that is the driving design principle behind I FEEL SCIENCE will demonstrate successful application of theories and evaluation metrics that are inclusive, pluralistic, and generalizable to many other learning environments. The broader impacts of this project lie in several areas. First, the goal is to disseminate the science learning environment for use nationwide, with additional opportunities for collaboration with blind schools through the establishment of I FEEL SCIENCE. Second, this study will impact science education for blind students by diffusing the knowledge base and practice of STEM curricula involving hands-on practices with realistic sensory feedback locally and nationally. Finally, this work should have an important impact on assistive technology by providing additional method for presenting information non-visually to special needs students. The project?s fundamental mission is consistent with NSF?s strategic objective to ?prepare a diverse, internationally competitive, and globally engaged workforce of scientists, engineers, and well-prepared citizens,? as well as the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) Amendments of 1997 requiring that students with disabilities receive full access to the general education curriculum.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
