<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims to develop a new technology for manufacturing ultra-low dielectric constant materials (e&lt; 2.0) for leading-edge logic devices for the 22 nm technology node and beyond. It is widely recognized that materials presently used in the 90 and 65 nm technology nodes will not remain endlessly effective with further miniaturization of integrated circuits either because they do not have sufficiently low e values, or because their morphological features will not provide acceptable mechanical properties for integration.   This project will investigate a new approach to interlayer dielectrics based on the bottom-up synthesis of honeycomb-like nano-structured films in which porogen component is pre-built into the nano-sized cells and can be decomposed in a strictly controlled manner. This provides geometrically precisely organized closed pores with diameters selected at will from the range of 1-5 nm with precision of +/- 1 nm and separated by the 1-3 nm thin organo-inorganic walls. The proposed research program will have three major parts: (i)bottom-up synthesis of the nano-scaled precursor films, (ii) controlled preparation of nano-porous dielectrics, and (iii) characterization of the obtained products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; While the immediate focus of this Phase I program will be on the interlayer dielectrics for the 22 nm node, it will also have a major impact on efforts beyond this stage and to the ultimate limits of silicon-based computers.  This program will also significantly contribute to expanding our overall knowledge and understanding of nano-structured materials and nanotechnology in general. The Phase I results will provide proof-of-concept data that will be used to design a program for optimization and further improvement of this process and materials.</AbstractNarration>
