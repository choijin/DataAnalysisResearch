<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merits: Fiber optic-based Surface-Enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) probe has many advantages, including immunity to electromagnetic interference, small and compact size, sensitivity, selectivity, multiplexing ability, remote sensing, the ability to be embedded into textile structure and detection of sub-monolayer coverage of molecules at inaccessible locations. A critical aspect of SERS fiber probe is the requirement of a specific surface morphology to achieve reproducible and high levels of enhancement. Most of the current fabrication techniques have difficulty in producing dependable, reproducible, rugged, easily fabricated and relatively inexpensive SERS probe. Recent the PIs have demonstrated that a nanofabrication technique based on glancing angle deposition (GLAD) produces Ag nanorod substrates that exhibit extremely high SERS enhancement factors. Also, in comparison with existing nanofabrication methods, the GLAD method offers several strategic advantages, including: (1) precise control of the size, shape, density, alignment, orientation and composition of the nanorod arrays, and (2) implementation of the method using relatively simple procedures. The overall objective of this project is two-fold: (1) to fundamentally understand how the nanostructural design of metallic nanorod arrays (i.e. their size, shape, orientation, lateral arrangement and composition) influences SERS enhancement; and (2) to develop optimized SERS substrates, including both planar and fiber substrates, and to integrate these substrates into fiber optic-based SERS probes.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The successful development of a practical, simple and inexpensive technique for fabrication of novel nanostructures and integrated fiber Raman probes would have a large and immediate impact in the areas of: i) nanostructure fabrication and engineering, ii) fundamental surface science, iii) analytical spectroscopy, iv) chemical sensing, and v) bioanalytical applications. The PIs will also develop a lab-based nanotechnology course module to help undergraduate and high school students to obtain hands-on experience on nanofabrication. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
