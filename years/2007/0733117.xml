    <AbstractNarration>The proposed research tests the hypothesis that sediment transport dynamics play a role in&lt;br/&gt;controlling the topographic patterning that is crucial to the ecology of the ridge and slough landscape in&lt;br/&gt;the Florida Everglades. Namely, under historical flow conditions, it is hypothesized that sediment&lt;br/&gt;redistribution from open-water slough to vegetated ridge regulated ridge width but that, with drainage and&lt;br/&gt;compartmentalization of the Everglades, the magnitude of redistribution has decreased, permitting&lt;br/&gt;expansion of ridges into open-water sloughs and loss of topographic heterogeneity.&lt;br/&gt;Project hypotheses will be tested through a combination of field and laboratory experimentation&lt;br/&gt;and numerical modeling of the mass and momentum balance equations governing flocculent sediment&lt;br/&gt;transport dynamics and flow in vegetated environments. Experimental analysis of floc transport&lt;br/&gt;mechanics will describe the critical shear stresses and turbulence intensities that entrain size classes of&lt;br/&gt;floc in a deposited bed, equilibrium aggregate size distributions and concentrations resulting from flow&lt;br/&gt;with different shear parameters, aggregate settling velocities, and changes in turbulence and flow profiles&lt;br/&gt;that occur across a ridge/slough cross-section as a result of vegetation and microtopography. To this end,&lt;br/&gt;flow monitoring and a series of transport experiments and tracer tests using natural floc will be performed&lt;br/&gt;in laboratory and field flumes. Funds will also sponsor the execution of complementary science fair&lt;br/&gt;projects by Forest Hill High School environmental science magnet program students, which will focus on&lt;br/&gt;using a rapid-assessment optical technique for developing an organic matter mixing model across a&lt;br/&gt;ridge/slough transect (which can be used as a validation measure for the sediment transport model) and on&lt;br/&gt;elucidating the effects of ambient water quality on flocculent organic sediment transport properties.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit. The proposed research builds upon previous research showing the existence of&lt;br/&gt;sediment redistribution from open-water channels to vegetated environments by producing a model to&lt;br/&gt;predict the magnitude and spatial distribution of sedimentation as a function of flow velocity and water&lt;br/&gt;level. In the Everglades, sediment occurs primarily in the form of organic floccules, the mechanics of&lt;br/&gt;which are not well understood. Similarly, although flocculation plays a dominant role in the suspended&lt;br/&gt;sediment dynamics of rivers, wetlands, and estuaries throughout the world, studies on the impacts of flow&lt;br/&gt;through vegetated environments on sedimentation and transport of floccules and predictive models of floc&lt;br/&gt;dynamics on landscape morphology and evolution are nonexistent. This research develops a set of&lt;br/&gt;laboratory and field experiments designed to address the critical questions about floc transport mechanics&lt;br/&gt;required for model development and an original model of how these mechanics influence landscape&lt;br/&gt;evolution. Thus, the proposed research will set a precedent for improved predictions of sediment&lt;br/&gt;transport and landscape dynamics that will have implications for estuarine science, fluvial&lt;br/&gt;geomorphology, wetlands science, and contaminant transport.&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts - Results of this project will be broadly disseminated to (1) researchers in the field,&lt;br/&gt;through organization of a special session at an ASLO meeting on implications of flocculant sediment&lt;br/&gt;transport for landscape dynamics and subsequent publication of a special journal issue, to (2) policy&lt;br/&gt;makers involved in implementation of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan through regular&lt;br/&gt;participation of the PIs in Landscape Subteam meetings and the Greater Everglades Ecosystem&lt;br/&gt;Restoration conference, and to (3) the general public, through publication of a popular science article on&lt;br/&gt;Everglades landscape dynamics. Further, model results will impact policy and society by leading to&lt;br/&gt;improved recommendations of flow velocities and hydroperiods that should be implemented to restore the&lt;br/&gt;ridge and slough landscape. Enhanced infrastructure resulting from the purchase of a laser diffraction&lt;br/&gt;particle size analyzer will benefit classroom demonstrations, laboratory, and field research at the K-12,&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate, and graduate levels. Research efforts will also enhance collaborative efforts between the&lt;br/&gt;USGS, University of Colorado, and K-12 education and will synergistically complement an existing&lt;br/&gt;USGS project on biogeochemical feedback mechanisms and nutrient transport within the ridge and slough&lt;br/&gt;landscape. Finally, this research enhances the knowledge transfer to future generations of scientists&lt;br/&gt;through a committed partnership with the environmental science magnet program at Forest Hill High&lt;br/&gt;School in West Palm Beach, Florida and by providing research support to a current Ph.D student.</AbstractNarration>
