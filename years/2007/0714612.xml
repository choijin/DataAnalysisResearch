<AbstractNarration>Stiff oscillatory ordinary differential equations are common mathematical models in many important scientific fields, ranging from classical celestial mechanics to atomistic dynamics in modern physics and chemistry.  These models are gaining ever more importance as the computer capability increases.  Numerous simulations based on such systems are being performed in order to predict the nature, for example, of propagation of cracks and dislocations in metals and under what condition certain proteins change shape and take on specific functions that can be used in drug design.  Many fundamental phenomena are generated through delicate interactions between rapid oscillations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The challenge is to simulate these highly oscillatory interactions over physically relevant time without having the quality of the output being damaged by numerical errors.  The research of this proposal aims at developing a new multi-scale computational approach such that the interesting phenomena resulting from interaction between oscillations can be computed accurately and efficiently over long time.  The corresponding mathematical analysis of the algorithms will also be performed.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We conclude that this project is successful both in scientific and in educational aspects. To date, nineteen research ariticles have been either published or in the process of being published in major research journals  and three books have been edited. These results have already been referenced and used by other scientists in the field.

The theories and algorithms developed in this proposal directly relate to many important atomistic simulations that are used in place of actual physical experiments; they will have direct consequences in molecular biology for understanding drug functions at the cellular level, and also in the study of material properties and unstable events such as the formation and propagation of cracks, which may affect electronic components as well as the safety of airplanes.
