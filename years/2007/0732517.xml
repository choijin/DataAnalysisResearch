<AbstractNarration>An Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) for Smart Vehicle Concepts has been established at the Ohio State University.  The I/UCRC will focus on novel and emerging trends in vehicle design where smart structures, next generation suspension or mounting devices, vastly improved actuators or valves, and intelligent sensors will be integrated to develop ground vehicles of the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to providing relevant research results to industry, the Center will be a source of information and education, not only to university students, but also to practicing engineers.  The I/UCRC will help the U.S. automotive industries to remain competitive in an increasingly difficult global economy.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

The SVC launched in July 2007 at The Ohio State University (OSU) with funding from NSF and industrial members. The lead institution (OSU) received significant national visibility through the SVC and attracted an average of nearly twelve full members from 2007 to 2012. Texas A&amp;M University entered into discussions with OSU in October 2007, and a proposal to become a multi-site Center was submitted in March 2008. Texas A&amp;M officially joined the SVC in July 2008.<br /><br />The mission of the SVC is as follows:&nbsp; 1. Conduct basic and applied research in advanced smart materials for application to vehicle sub-systems and components, as well as smart sensors or design/diagnostics&nbsp; methods that could reduce the vehicle developmental process; 2. Build an unmatched base of research, engineering education, and technology transfer with emphasis on improved automotive performance, unprecedented safety improvements and enhanced vehicle efficiency; and 3. Develop well-trained engineers and researchers (at the MS and PhD levels) with experimental and system integration viewpoints to complement theoretical understanding. Basic center expertise includes smart materials, noise and vibration control, nonlinear dynamics, piezoelectric materials, active polymers, and power transmission and gearing, to name a few.<br /><br />Over the life of Phase I, 28 memberships were involved, 14 of which were founding members.&nbsp; Members include: large companies like Honda R&amp;D, Boeing, Goodyear, Moog, Eaton, and Hyundai-Kia Motors; small companies like YUSA and F.tech; government laboratories like Army Research Lab and NASA Glenn, and the Space Engineering Institute; and R&amp;D institutions like the Transportation Research Center, Edison Welding Institute, and MIT Lincoln Laboratory.&nbsp; Three small business members (Advanced Numerical Solutions, Solidica, Lynntech) joined through the NSF Supplemental Opportunities for SBIR Memberships. The OSU site of the SVC generated over $2.2M in industrial membership fees and over $2.6M in additional funds for SVC research.<br /><br />The SVC supported 22 projects at 2 universities, involving the participation of 6 faculty, 25 PhD students, 20 MS students, and 17 BS students. Additionally, the Center produced 13 PhD dissertations, 14 MS theses, and 8 BS Honors theses. Five SVC graduates were be hired by Center industrial sponsors.&nbsp; Three of those became members of the SVC&rsquo;s industrial advisory board. During Phase I, the SVC produced 55 peer-reviewed publications, 65 conference publications, 67 oral presentations at national and international conferences, and 2 invention disclosures.
