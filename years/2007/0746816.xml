<AbstractNarration>The goal of this research is to revolutionize the ability to anticipate tornadoes by developing advanced techniques for statistical pattern discovery in spatially and temporally varying relational data.  These models are applied to complete fields of meteorological quantities obtained through data assimilation and simulation.  Doppler radar data is limited and, while modern data assimilation techniques allow the unobserved quantities to be estimated, the resulting four- dimensional fields are too complicated for the extraction of meaningful, repeatable patterns by either humans or current data mining techniques.  By studying a full field of variables, the models can identify critical interactions among high level features.  The models are developed and verified in close collaboration with domain experts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The interdisciplinary research is used to improve retention and recruitment in computer science (CS).  This draws on recent evidence that underrepresented groups are not drawn to computing careers because they do not appreciate how computing can be used to solve real world problems.  Introducing authentic projects into both early CS and meteorology classes will improve the number of technically trained students in both majors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary broader impact of this research is to society, through the  &lt;br/&gt;potential for reduction in loss of human life, property, and money.   &lt;br/&gt;Models will be made available to operational meteorologists as they are verified.  Another broader impact will come from increasing the number of computing oriented minors and majors through authentic projects.  All data and results will be disseminated through peer reviewed publications and via open source online repositories accessible on the project Web site (http://www.cs.ou.edu/~amy/career/).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goals of this CAREER grant spanned both research and education in an integrated manner.  First, the goal of my research was to revolutionize the understanding of tornadoes by developing advanced techniques for statistical pattern discovery in dynamic relational data.  Second, the educational goal was to draw on students' experiences with severe weather and show them how computer science (CS) can help address complex problems in meteorology in order to improve retention and recruitment for both majors and minors in CS.  I have exceeded the expectations of the grant in several ways, outlined below.   This CAREER created two novel data mining methods for large spatiotemporally varying relational data.  The first is the Spatiotemporal Relational Probability Tree and the second is the Spatiotemporal Relational Random Forest. These methods exceed the proposed goal to vary data temporally because they also cover varying data spatially.  These new models were applied successfully in multiple severe weather domains.  In addition to applying the methods to tornado prediction, I also applied these methods to improve the prediction of severe hail and aircraft turbulence.  The work contributed a new and unique set of high-resolution simulations of the atmosphere.  To study the formation of tornadoes, we have generated over 100 high-resolution simulations that measure every fundamental variable in the atmosphere for a large domain and throughout the lifetime of the storms.  These simulations have been shared with other researchers, increasing our impact.  We have made several significant contributions to education.  As a part of the grant, we developed multiple weather modules for lower-division and introductory CS classes.  These modules demonstrate ways in which CS can have real-world impact to undergraduate freshmen and sophomores in a state where weather prediction is a critical concern.  In addition to the modules, we have developed two engaging serious (educational) games that teach children about meteorological concepts in a fun and engaging way.
