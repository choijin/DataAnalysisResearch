<AbstractNarration>This project aims to control the chemistry in dilute magnetic nanocrystalline semiconductors to manipulate exchange interactions that will lead to materials  employable in future electronic architectures.   By systematically investigating the magnetic, heat capacity, and optical properties of a series of manganese  doped dilute magnetic semiconductor nanocrystals, a self-consistent magnetic exchange model will be developed.  The exchange interactions probed by magnetic and heat capacity measurements are expected to correlate with the magneto-optical measurements.  In combination these methods will allow an understanding of the size dependent changes of orbital interactions in these nanocrystalline materials and will help in the development of new materials for future spin-based electronics and memory-based technologies.  The NSF program will support 3 graduate students, but 6 members of the research group.  In addition the funding will be utilized in direct support of two under represented students to enhance their competitiveness in science by allowing exposure to cutting edge technologies. To enhance cultural diversity and outreach, both groups have historically attracted under represented students to their research and teaching programs.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal develops novel dilute magnetic nanocrystalline semiconductors.  The science builds on the PI's leading developments in these unique materials exhibiting size dependent changes of orbital interactions, properties that may help in the development of new materials for future electronics and memory based technologies.  The technology developed in the proposal will allow the competitiveness of our scientists and thus the US to compete globally.  By systematically investigating the exchange interactions probed by magnetic and magneto-optical methods, the fundamentals of exchange and the control of exchange coupling can be developed.  The NSF program will support 3 graduate students, but 6 members of the research group.  In addition the funding will be utilized in direct support of 2 under represented students to enhance their competitiveness in science by allowing exposure to cutting edge technologies.  To enhance cultural diversity and outreach, both groups have historically attracted under represented students to their research and teaching programs.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

The research increases the sustainability of the materials production and lowers energy costs associated with materials with broad ranging potential for spin based computing ansd electronic applications.       The research resulted in 19 publications, 5 PhD thesis, and 1 MS thesis during the three years of support and more importantly impacted the PhD career of 13 students, 1 postdoctoral fellow, and 2 undergraduate students.  Of these two of the graduate students (Aaron Washington and Donny Magana) are under-represented in the science community broadening participation science.  Dr. Magna won an Oppenheimer Fellowship based on his work on the NSF grant showing the power of student involvement.  Furthermore it is worth noting the recent article on Cr doping of metal  chalcogenide nanocrystals has received external interest from the publication Chemistry Views demonstrating the scientific impact of the research.  Outreach to local schools and classrooms by the PI and participants exposed young students to the ideas of science and the excitement of nanochemistry.
