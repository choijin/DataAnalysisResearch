<AbstractNarration>Dr. Frans B. M. de Waal&lt;br/&gt;Proposal # IOS-0718010&lt;br/&gt;Social Modification of Primate Behavior&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For social animals to react appropriately to each other they need to know about each others'' gender, social status, and the state they are in (such as whether they are hungry, distressed, fearful, or aggressive). This project seeks to establish what brown capuchin monkeys (Cebus apella) know about their group mates. It asks them to indicate, on the basis of portraits projected on a computer screen, which individual monkey belongs to their group. It asks them to rate calls as either aversive or attractive, dependent on the identity of the caller (for example, does a female find the distress calls of her own offspring more aversive than such calls by unrelated juveniles?). And it will ask monkeys to share food with others based on what they know about their hunger state to see if they take the needs of others into account. Available are 30 capuchin monkeys, kept in indoor/outdoor enclosures, trained for temporary separation for experiments. The proposed study will illuminate basic social cognition that is often taken for granted. The laboratory at the Yerkes Primate Center serves the education of a great many undergraduate and graduate students, who obtain valuable training in combination with classes they take. Through his popular books and lectures, the Principal Investigator is at the forefront in communicating findings in animal behavior to a wider public, both academic and nonacademic.</AbstractNarration>

This is relevant to human behavior, because if monkeys decide to help each other or share food we assume they use the same psychology (motivations, emotions, knowledge) as our own species given that we are closely related to monkeys and have very similar brains (the human brain is obviously larger, but does not contain any structures that we do not find in a monkey brain). For example, we have found for example that monkeys are just as sensitive to (un)fairness as humans in that they react with protest to receiving less rewards for the same task than a companion.

This means that they connect two-dimensional images of faces with actual individuals, which is a capacity that we take for granted in our own species, but was never demonstrated before in other primates. The monkeys use holistic information to process faces as demonstrated by the fact that they show the same inversion effect (they have trouble recognizing upside-down faces) as humans.
