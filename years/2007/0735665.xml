    <AbstractNarration>Support is provided on behalf of the Global Emissions Inventory Activity (GEIA) Center for a Summer School to be convened under the joint auspices of the ESF (European Science Foundation), CNRS (Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique) and ACCENT (Atmospheric Composition Change The European Network of Excellence) and will benefit the atmospheric chemistry and atmospheric sciences community. The title of the Summer School is " Surface emissions and prediction of atmospheric composition changes." The summer school will be held in ile d'Oleron, France, September 11-20, 2007 (http://www.geiacenter.org/).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NSF funding will enable U.S. participation in the summer school and will specifically assist with covering the costs of travel and/or conference fees for approximately 10 early career scientists to attend. Early career scientists are defined as students, post-docs, researchers and assistant professors within five years of the PhD or equivalent degree. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Noted broader impacts include the chance for early career scientists to participate and share their research findings within the format of the summer school. Synthesis materials created during the sessions will form the basis for an e-learning module to be placed on a publicly available website</AbstractNarration>
