<AbstractNarration>Engineering - Materials Science (57)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is developing Smart Vibration Platforms (SVP) for distribution and utilization at several diverse types of institutions and undergraduate degree programs.  The SVP is being utilized to teach mechanical engineering dynamics concepts such as damping and structural vibration controls.  The "Smart" part of the platform is based on the utilization of two smart materials: a shape memory alloy, which changes stiffness with temperature, and a magneto-rheological fluid, which provides adjustable damping based on use of an electromagnet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SVP is a creative and easy to use device, and is advancing student knowledge and understanding by helping students experiment with smart materials, vibrations, and controls.  This project is developing and deploying SVPs at six different institutions and extending its implementation to civil, electrical, and materials engineering as well as engineering technology courses.  Using the SVP as a tool, the PIs are creating innovative teaching materials, including demonstrations, hands-on experiments, course modules, and new courses.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Project Outcome Report To keep in pace with the rapid advancement of technology and to meet the emerging workforce and educational needs of U.S. industry, we developed Smart Vibration Platform (SVP) experiments setups for undergraduate engineering students and educators and to improve the existing curriculum to meet the technological challenges of the 21st century.   Activities: In the Phase II project, we 1) Continued the innovation on the Smart Vibration Platform and greatly improved the original SVP based on Phase I experience and feedback. 2) Used the SVP as an enabling tool to develop innovative teaching materials, including demonstrations, hands-on experiments, course modules, and new courses. 3) Improved the learning of diverse student population in not only Mechanical Engineering, but also Civil Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Materials Engineering, and Engineering Technology by using the innovative teaching materials enabled by the SVP. 4) Formed a community of scholars who were interested in improving undergraduate teaching by using in-classroom demonstrations and hands-on experiments and engaged them in educational innovation. 5) Developed expertise for the participating faculty members through training and development initiatives.6) Integrated the SVP with outreach activities to benefit K-12 students and the general public. 7) Used innovative methods to evaluate the effectiveness of the SVP in improving student learning and continuously improve the SVP. 8) Disseminated results and findings of this project to other universities and colleges. The advanced smart materials (i.e., Shape Memory Alloy, Magneto-Rheological fluids, and Piezoceramics) were primarily used to develop and refine the SVP, and the prototype SVP and primary assessment results from the Phase I were used to guide and effectively improve the Phase II expansion effort. Multiple universities actively participated in the Phase II and promoted a genuine education community of learning and teaching the SVP in engineering. Outcomes in Intellectual Merit: This Phase II effort continued to build upon the accumulated expertise achieved in the Phase I study. It greatly promoted the relevance of undergraduate engineering curricula, incorporate modern engineering innovation into the classroom, and stimulate the interest of students. As illustrated in recent engineering education literature, increased student interest and enthusiasm towards course concepts serve to induce an increased proportion of students enrolled in STEM, to complete their technical education, and to eventually compete in the growing technological industry. The influence of this project imparted an innovative SVP-based active learning protocol in the engineering curricula and changed the way engineering educators transform and integrated the new and advanced knowledge to undergraduate education. The end-product of this effort resulted in comprehensive and implementable instructional materials and teaching strategies that efficiently combine advanced technologies (e.g., smart materials) with modern teaching methodology into one multifunctional smart vibration platform. Outcomes in Broader Impacts: With the participation of 19 instructors from 8diverse universities, the innovative and multi-functional Smart Vibration Platforms were integrated and evaluated in 43 courses, directly benefiting more than 1,200 engineering and technology students via hands-on experiments, in-classroom demonstrations, and remote demonstrations via internet, respectively. With participation of a public university with a large minority population, a Hispanic serving university, and two historically black universities, a diverse student population were served and about 500 students were benefit through the hands-on experiments and in-classroom demonstrations, respectively. Through outreach activities such as visiting local high schools and performing demonstrations for visiting k-12 students that about 1,000 K-12 ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
