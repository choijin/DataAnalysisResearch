<AbstractNarration>Arkansas Baptist College will implement a eighteen month planning grant under HBCU-UP.  Arkansas Baptist College, a four year institution in Little Rock Arkansas, offers educational opportunities to all persons seeking an education regardless of age, ethnicity, sex, disability, race, religion, and national origin. Arkansas Baptist College proposes to conduct a comprehensive analysis to evaluate the current STEM programs at the college in order to develop a proposal for a five-year implementation HBCU-UP project. The HBCU-UP planning grant will; 1) assess and evaluate the needs in current and future STEM courses, 2) develop a curricula design and structure plan that will offer STEM degrees, and 3) develop a STEM model of successful learning for minority students. Arkansas Baptist College will collaborate with local business and industry leaders in order to identify the technical employment needs of the community. This planning grant will provide a blue print for improved education in Little Rock and the surrounding community.  The intellectual merit of this project is in the use of data to assess the STEM curriculum needs and develop a plan to improve the STEM programs.  As a result of this planning process the college will be able to prepare a competitive Implementation project proposal which could result in the establishment of new accredited associate and bachelor STEM degree programs at the college.  The broader impacts of the planning grant project is to improve the STEM education and preparation of Arkansas Baptist College students who will enter the STEM workforce or go on for further education.</AbstractNarration>
