<AbstractNarration>This project is concerned with the research and teaching of the&lt;br/&gt;mathematics of stochastic analysis, motivated by a number of timely&lt;br/&gt;application areas. These applications, among them financial&lt;br/&gt;mathematics, telecommunications, risk measure analysis, dynamical&lt;br/&gt;queuing systems, and green-house gas emissions, are key to attracting&lt;br/&gt;young talent towards stochastic analysis, which is an area that has&lt;br/&gt;been rewarded with a number of major mathematical prizes in the past&lt;br/&gt;two years. Some of the technical issues arising from the problems&lt;br/&gt;studied here are: analysis of very heavy tailed distributions;&lt;br/&gt;stochastic partial differential equations; multiscale asymptotic&lt;br/&gt;approximations for jump processes; convex analysis for set-valued&lt;br/&gt;functions; limit theorems for time-changed Poisson process models of&lt;br/&gt;Markovian service networks.  Tools of stochastic analysis are becoming&lt;br/&gt;crucial for a core applied mathematics training, and this RTG aims to&lt;br/&gt;train a number of the future trainers, as well as practitioners of the&lt;br/&gt;skills, with rigorous foundations in this area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expertise in probability, the mathematics of uncertainty, is in great&lt;br/&gt;demand in the US: university mathematics departments and applied&lt;br/&gt;mathematics programs, operation and risk management, financial&lt;br/&gt;regulatory and public policy offices, bio-engineering, and the&lt;br/&gt;telecommunications industry. The initiatives of this project are&lt;br/&gt;designed to attract talented US students to graduate degrees, as well&lt;br/&gt;as postdoc positions and beyond. The RTG's educational emphasis on&lt;br/&gt;mathematical methodology means that we will train people with broadly&lt;br/&gt;applicable technical skills that may later be applied in vastly&lt;br/&gt;different contexts as demands and trends in the workplace evolve. In&lt;br/&gt;financial markets, for example, poor regulation and a lack of&lt;br/&gt;understanding of the risks involved, have contributed to wide-ranging&lt;br/&gt;crises, such as that triggered by the subprime mortgage debacle in&lt;br/&gt;Summer 2007, threatening more and more retirement and endowment funds&lt;br/&gt;and public savings every day. We need to stop this run-away train. An&lt;br/&gt;ultimate goal of this project is to contribute to this effort by&lt;br/&gt;developing new tools and strategies to educate the future scientists,&lt;br/&gt;policy makers and regulators, and potential investors about the risks&lt;br/&gt;and the mathematical language for their description and control. By&lt;br/&gt;focusing on forms of risk which have traditionally remained off the&lt;br/&gt;radar screen of educators and practitioners, e.g. operational risk, we&lt;br/&gt;will raise the level of awareness and make sound controls possible.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Four faculty members in the ORFE department at Princeton University ran a successful RTG in Stochastic Analysis &amp; Applications, that was funded by NSF, with significant university funding support, from January 2008 through July 2015.  This award has helped establish major initiatives in the Mathematical Sciences &amp; Engineering at Princeton.  These initiatives have benefited undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral trainings in the mathematica of stochastic analysis and applications.  Historically, there had been few U.S. national graduate students in the subject matter of the group, and the RTG award was crucial in rectifying this.  Thanks to the RTG specific training, many U.S. RTG supported Ph.D. students went on to careers (both academic and industry) heavily involving the use of mathematics.  Four of the U.S. citizen graduate students who went through the RTG program from start to finish took first positions at Caltech (Postdoc), Cornell (tenure track following a postdoc at Columbia), Washington University St. Louis (tenure track) and Brown (NSF Postdoc).  Additionally, we did not yet have a regular flow of postdocs.  Under the RTG, we trained six postdocs, all of whom obtained good academic positions in Mathematics or Applied Math/Engineering departments (Princeton, Sussex, Sydney, two at WPI and Washington Seattle).  The RTG had many initiatives to stimulate young researchers in scientific workshops, and in particular to encourage under-represented minorities to Mathematics higher education. The PIs set up a Student Chapter of the Association for Women in Mathematics (AWM) within the ORFE department, this inspired an increase in women undergraduate research in the area of the RTG.  The RTG support of the annual Conference for African American Researchers in the Mathematical Sciences (CAARMS), and the dedicated mentoring by one of the PIs (Massey) attracted many undergraduate and graduate minority students to Princeton for short visits to work with postdocs and faculty.  The PIs have all been closely involved in undergraduate research experiences, particularly through Senior Thesis advising.  The RTG led to the creation of a Senior Thesis Writers' Group that has successfully intergrated graduate students and postdocs into the undergraduate senior thesis experience, exposing undergraduates to the modern tools and methods of research.    The PIs also wirked with a number of undergraduate students who stayed to do research over the summer.  They placed particular emphasis on encourgaing talent among under represented minorities, for instance, by supporting their travel to academic conferences.  The PIs also began a Summer School in Applications of Stochastic Analysis.  The first one, on Financial Mathematics, was held June 17-28, 2013, with modern topics in the field, and eight lectures, both internal and external.  There were over 75 early-level graduate students participating, of whom 30 were U.S. citizens whose expenses the RTG supported.  This RTG grant resulted in many publications in peer reviewed journals, over a wide spectrum of applied mathematics and stochastic analysis.  Publicatios involving the postdocs and Ph.D. and undergraduate students supported by the grant covered multi-dimensional risk measures; energy and commodity, dynamic game theory, queueing theory, asymptotic and spectral analysis in financial mathematics, and transaction costs and singular control; filtering and the analysis of partially observed systems; and implied volatility estimation and portfolio optimization in partially observed markets.  The postdocs and Ph.D. students supports by the grant have been invited to present their works in many mathematics departments throughout the country and in international conferences as well.
