<AbstractNarration>To produce more community college STEM transfers to four-year institutions and more STEM baccalaureates, the math and science divisions at three southern California institutions created Talent Expansion in Science and Technology: An Urban Partnership (TEST:UP). This collaborative program involves California State University, Fullerton (CSUF), a four-year, comprehensive university and Mt. San Antonio College (Mt. SAC) and Santa Ana College (SAC), two of CSUF's feeder community colleges. TEST:UP includes joint initiatives to engage, recruit, and retain STEM students and ultimately expand the numbers of STEM transfers to CSUF and other four-year schools. TEST:UP is a coordinated network of administrators, faculty, and staff working closely together to: 1) improve counseling, guidance, and mentoring opportunities and enhance knowledge of STEM careers for students at the two-year institutions, with the aid of a traveling 'academic success coach'; 2) offer STEM learning communities at all three institutions; 3) improve student engagement, learning, and success in pivotal math and science introductory courses at the community colleges through academic excellence workshops (AEWs), supplemental instruction (SI), and tutoring programs; and 4) develop a teaching intern program for CSUF STEM graduate students interested in two-year college teaching careers. All three TEST:UP campuses are institutionalizing effective TEST:UP program components, making permanent changes in their approaches to STEM education and advisement. Additional local colleges are being invited to join the collaboration, extending its influence.</AbstractNarration>
