    <AbstractNarration>The project brings together new and established researchers in the field of cliometrics at three annual Cliometrics Conferences in 2009, 2010, and 2011. "Cliometrics" is economics in the service of history and history in the service of economics. The field of cliometrics evolved in the 1960s from convergent research interests in several fields; most notably economics, history, and statistics, but drawing also on demography, political science, sociology, anthropology, archaeology, and other social sciences. Recently, the field has become more interdisciplinary, as researchers have used methodologies and data from anatomy, climatology, and biology to enhance their cliometrics research. A major task on the cliometrics agenda has been to develop more and better historical data with which to study the evolution and structural dynamics of national economies and the international economies. An understanding of the historical record is crucial for the development of meaningful economic policy today and in the future. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, the National Science Foundation continues its support of cliometric research by sponsoring and providing significant funding for conference and travel expenses for the 2009, 2010 and 2011 annual Cliometrics Conferences. These conferences are committed to open access to those committed to excellence in intellectual inquiry. Twelve papers are chosen from roughly 50 submissions annually. The remaining participants are then selected from those who have submitted papers or applied for attendance. Particular attention is paid to the presence of graduate students and new scholars and those engaged in research in more isolated geographic locations or in smaller liberal arts colleges. The steady mixing of newly trained and experienced researchers creates a unique intellectual environment and increases the participation of potentially under-represented groups in the profession. The organizers also ensure that attendance occurs on a rotating basis to ensure diversity of participation. The conference format-the presenter is allowed a five-minute presentation followed by fifty-five minutes of intense discussion and questions-is structured to bring the expertise of the interdisciplinary conference participants to bear on the research paper and to help train the future teachers and researchers in the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Annual cliometrics conferences have substantial impacts on the research environment for new and established cliometric researchers and on the overall quality of cliometric research. First, they enable a group of graduate students and young faculty to attend a conference which they could otherwise not afford. Funding more established practitioners ensures that a diverse group of scholars engaged in interdisciplinary research arrive prepared with questions, comments, and fresh ideas to enhance the research discussed at the Conference and to ensure that the paper presenters understand the broader implications of their research. Second, authors presenting papers receive intense exposure for their work from an 'expert' group which, without the Cliometrics Conference, could otherwise take several years. Third, all participants benefit by discovering knowledgeable and enthusiastic colleagues and building their research networks. This unique combination of financial support from the NSF and professional support from conference attendees provides young scholars with the stimulation and encouragement to commit themselves to this interdisciplinary field. All papers presented at these Conferences are widely disseminated on the Cliometrics website (http://www.eh.net/Clio) and via the Newsletter of the Cliometric Society.</AbstractNarration>
