<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Fundamental Optical Processes in Semiconductors is planned for July 23-27, 2007 at Big Sky, Montana, and is co-chaired by Hailin Wang (University of Oregon) and Rolf Binder (University of Arizona). Optical processes in semiconductors are of central importance for both basic science and applications.  The field provides the foundation for semiconductor optoelectronics and photonics, and further plays an important role in the emerging areas of spintronics, solid-state lighting, and quantum-information science and technology.  As such, it encompasses enabling technologies for next and future generation devices. The aim is to bring together the leading international groups working in semiconductor photonics, ranging from physics through devices and systems, in a workshop format to present the most recent exciting results and to discuss the future directions of the field.  Since most of the significant conferences in the field have been held in Europe or Asia in recent years, a major emphasis of the meeting is to have a strong US presence; almost all the active US groups will be represented. Graduate student participation is encouraged.  The content of the meeting lies at the cutting edge of optical and nano science and technology, and will provide for the interaction between graduate students and other young researchers, as well as more established figures in the field.  &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: An understanding of basic optical processes in semiconductors is key to the design of ultrafast and ultrabroadband devices exploiting new areas of the electromagnetic spectrum.  Such an understanding also provides a basis for the design of novel devices for solid-state lighting and photovoltaics.  It is also essential in order to take full advantage of novel optical nanostructures, and to enable important schemes for quantum computation.  In this research context, graduate students will benefit by interacting with established researchers in a small-workshop format.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
