<AbstractNarration>EAR-0725019&lt;br/&gt;Duffy&lt;br/&gt;THE SUSQUEHANNA/SHALE HILLS CRITICAL ZONE OBSERVATORY&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The surface of the earth comprises a weathering engine or mill that solubilizes and disaggregates rock to form regolith. Over the long term, the rates of weathering and erosion combine to control the evolution of landscapes and help to define the access, rates of motion, and time scales of water and energy within the Critical Zone (CZ). Despite the importance of these processes, we are generally unable to quantitatively predict the rates or mechanisms by which regolith forms or how it controls water flow. Understanding these rates is of particular importance due to the rapid rates of change of the CZ in response to anthropogenic and climate perturbation. Here we propose a Critical Zone Observatory dedicated to developing this understanding for one of the most common lithologies on earth. &lt;br/&gt;Our Critical Zone Observatory site, the focus of National Science Foundation-supported research since the 1970s, provides long term datasets for hydrological response that will be augmented here by new geochemical, geomorphological, ecological, and soils datasets. The observatory is a small catchment in central Pennsylvania (hereafter termed the Susquehanna/Shale Hills Observatory or SSHO) on Rose Hill Shale. As a tectonically quiescent and relatively pristine watershed, Shale Hills presents the opportunity to investigate the rates and mechanisms of regolith formation on a simple but ubiquitous bedrock lithology. The regolith at the SSHO has experienced at least two potentially significant perturbations in the geologically recent past: a climatic perturbation from peri-glacial to modern conditions and a biologic perturbation from anthropogenic clearing of forests during colonial occupation. The magnitude of these perturbations and their influence on regolith generation afford an opportunity to assess the time scales of response of soil production to both long-term climate change and human activity. &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: To predict the creation, evolution, and structure of regolith as a function of the geochemical, hydrologic, biologic, and geomorphologic processes in our forested landscape, we have created an interdisciplinary team of 14 scientists from 8 universities, 1 federal agency, and 2 national laboratories. This team will coordinate not only the SSHO but also six satellite sites where we will initiate similar but less extensive investigations to explore the effect of climate and composition on shale weathering. Among these, Alabama A&amp;M and University of Puerto Rico are minority-serving institutions that will facilitate the involvement of under-represented groups in Critical Zone science. Scientists and REU students from each satellite site (eighteen students over three years) will work closely with members of the Penn State team on a variety of activities ranging from geochemical analyses of soil and bedrock samples to measurement of soil moisture with onsite detectors. The observational data and model capabilities developed in the proposed effort will be made available through web-services for both time series data and geospatial data through the CZEN cyberinfrastructure initiative. Development of the SSHO on-line information system will be supported by ongoing NSF observatory and cyberinfrastructure grants. It is our vision that the SSHO will become an exemplar for Critical Zone observational and modeling science that will attract many additional investigators from the broader community to test ideas, techniques, and predictions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Susquehanna Shale Hills Critical Zone Observatory is a temperate, forested landscape and provides a multi-disciplinary framework for quantitative prediction of Critical Zone creation, structure and evolution by focusing on pathways and rates of water, solute and sediment flow.  Our focus questions, "How does water sculpt a landscape on shale bedrock"  and "what are the pathways and time scales of transport" have engaged investigations in soil biogeochemistry, hydrometeorology, hydropedology, geomorphology, ecology, geophysics, geochemistry and isotope hydrology.  Collectively, our team has identified primary flow pathways for energy, water and solutes and is working towards closing the water and the elemental budgets within the catchment.   The team has also worked with our international CZO partners in the SoilTrEC project funded by the Eurpean Commision to build catchment flow models at 4 ritical Zone Observatories across Europe: 1) Koiliaris-White Mountains CZO in Crete, 2)  Lysina CZO, Czech Republic; 3) Plynlimon CZO, Wales, UK; 4) Damma Glacier, CZO, Switzerland. The team members are: Christopher Duffy, Nikos Nikolaidis, Pavel Kram, Stefano Bernasconi, Xuan Yu, Daniel Moraetis, Anna Lamacova, David Robinson, Evan Thomas, Maria Andrianaki, Florian Kobierska, Brian Reynolds, Tim White, Lele Shu.  The Lysina CZO catchment, a forested research catchment in northern Czech Republic, provides an interesting example of important outcomes relevant to society, and knowledge transfer through application of the Penn State Integrated Hydrologic Model developed at the Shale Hills CZO to an international CZO. The catchment model simulates how soil moisture, groundwater levels and streamflow respond to variations in weather and longer term seasonal climate change.  The research goal is to assess the impact of long term landuse changes from forest cutting practices, and to assess the impact of soil degradation on the water yield from the catchment. A major finding is that historical tree cutting practices do not seem to impact the seasonal runoff for either the springtime peak runoff or the summer time drought flows (low-flow). This implies that their historical management of selective tree cutting by small patches every 10 years is a sustainable landuse practice with minimal impact on catchment runoff.   Current work is using the catchment model to predict the impact of soil degradation and how soil structure (soil porosity) impacts streamflow.   In conjunction with the State College Area School District, a STEM Academy was created to engage incoming first year high school students with high caliber academic experiences.  Through hands-on activities like measure and monitor soil moisture, collect GPS data, and install a weather station, pre-service and master level teachers along with the high school students learned how to compare the various types of data streaming from the catchment with data collected on their own school premises, thus engaging students in relevant, project-based collaborative research.    Numerous data sets have been collected through sensor measurements and sampling campaigns throughout the funding cycle and are available to the public here:  http://criticalzone.org/shale-hills/data/.  To highlight the benefit of Critical Zone Observatory science, disciplinary research products such as the total tree survey 2008 (doi:10.1594/IEDA/100268), sap flow measurements, and soil moisture patterns have led to novel interdisciplinary findings such as how trees of different vascular anatomy respond to the same wetting and drying events. Lidar data is being used by non-CZO teams to evaluate the impact of climate change on wetlands in the Shaver Creek watershed. Historical hydro-climatic reconstructions provide a virtual data set to study the impact of tropical storms, floods, and drought on the Shale Hills-Shaver Creek watersheds by students and water managers in the Susquehanna RIver Basin.
