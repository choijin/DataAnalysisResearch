<AbstractNarration>The uniqueness of this symposium is in its intent to demonstrate the universality of the surface engineering approach to creating complex and ordered 3D-heterostructures that can find application in a wide variety of technologies crossing the border from inorganic to biological materials and devices.  A self-assembly principle is the clue to the success of biological systems in achieving their excellent materials properties and multifunctionality at a minimal energy cost.  Biological energy conversion systems and super strong and flexible silk fibers are representative exciting examples of the organization-defined functionality in a wide variety of applications.  The organizers comprise an interdisciplinary international team that is well qualified to prepare and conduct the symposium.  All of them are internationally recognized experts in the field of materials science and have numerous peer-reviewed publications and invited conference talks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funding for this symposium will be used to facilitate participation by graduate students, postdoctoral researchers and young faculty with partial compensation of their registration and/or travel expenses to attend the 2007 Materials Research Society (MRS) Fall Meeting.  The recipients will be selected from the pool of applicants on the basis of the quality of their presentations.   Among those are researchers from the groups underrepresented in science.   When applicable, they will be asked to as serve session chairs or discussion leaders.  Established scientists will benefit from high visibility and serve as role models for younger scientists.  This will further encourage both, the young and the established, to continue to make valuable contributions to the field of materials science.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
