<AbstractNarration>The goals of the interdisciplinary research in quantum information science are to understand and demonstrate how quantum phenomena can dramatically advance the fundamental capabilities of information &lt;br/&gt;processing devices. In this context, the investigator seeks to (a) determine the differences between the computational power and limitations of quantum computers and those of classical computers and &lt;br/&gt;(b) to find new quantum speed-ups for classically difficult problems.  Building upon these results, this research explores how these quantum algorithms will allow one to solve more efficiently larger instances of &lt;br/&gt;computationally hard real-life problems, such as those arising in optimization theory, signal processing, and cryptography.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In computational complexity theory, BPP and BQP denote ?Bounded error Probabilistic time? and ?Bounded error Quantum Polynomial time, respectively. Roughly speaking, they represent the classes of problems &lt;br/&gt;that can be efficiently solved on classical and quantum computers. The exact relationship between them remains unknown, although there is strong evidence that BQP is strictly larger than BPP. To understand what features separate these classes, the investigator will determine purely classical (quantum-free) problems in linear algebra and topology that characterize the power of BQP. This research also involves the &lt;br/&gt;examination of the potential (and limitations) of a new quantum method for solving hidden subgroup and shift problems that present a general framework for designing quantum algorithms. This method relies upon &lt;br/&gt;tools from representation theory such as the Schur and Clebsch-Gordon transforms.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The research conducted in this project contributed to the advancement of quantum information science.  This is an emerging field of science and technology, encompassing and building upon the disciplines of computer science, mathematics, physics, nanotechnology, and engineering.  The goals of quantum information science are to understand and demonstrate how phenomena unique to the realm of quantum mechanics can dramatically advance the fundamental capabilities of information processing devices.      The PI and his collaborators showed how to harness quantum effects to obtain more efficient quantum algorithms for several hard computational problems. The PIÆs achievements can be viewed as the development of highly efficient software for future quantum computers. These new quantum-mechanical computers would supersede todayÆs computers such as personal computers or even specialized supercomputers that are bound to operate strictly according to the laws of classical mechanics.      The PIÆs new quantum algorithms outperform their classical algorithms. For instance, the PIÆs and his collaborators found efficient quantum algorithms making it possible to solve important problems in number theory that play an important role in public key cryptography.  They also showed how to use a quantum computer as a universal simulator allowing us to predict the thermodynamic behavior of different quantum systems.  These techniques can also be used to speed-up general optimization methods that are employed to tackle a wide range of computationally challenging problems.     The funds provided by the National Science Foundation were used to support and to train two Ph.D. students, two postdoctoral scholars, two undergraduate students, and three short-term visitors over the four year period of this project.  The research findings were published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at conferences and workshops. All research findings were also disseminated on the platform http://arxiv.org and are freely available for anyone.       Last Modified: 09/27/2011       Submitted by: Pawel M Wocjan]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
