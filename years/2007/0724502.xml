<AbstractNarration>This Phase II SBIR research project will develop direct write copper conductors onto doubly curved dielectric substrates using the Kinetic Metallization (KM) process. There is a need for new processes and methodologies to enable low profile RF systems on current and planned airborne platforms. Low profiles antennas are achieved through integration with structural elements. The concept is referred to as aperstructures, and in this Phase II research the scientific and engineering foundation necessary for robust aperstructures will be laid. Principally, research to establish process-property relationships will be conducted, as well as an investigation of novel material systems. The envisioned result of this research is conformal antennas integrated into the load bearing structures of the application platform. Conformal antennas represent a significant stride forward in the ability to communicate in high bandwidth applications. They also offer lower profiles, lighter weight and greater mission flexibility. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Originally airborne platforms were identified as high benefit early adopters. Targeted markets in the Navy and Air Force have already been identified with customers awaiting the Phase II results to transition the KM process to the manufacture of antennas. Ship systems, land systems, and non-military opportunities such as automobiles and skyscrapers will also gain from the development of this research. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
