<AbstractNarration>0746209&lt;br/&gt;Temenoff&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interfaces between different tissue types are found throughout the body and are crucial to the proper functions of all major organ systems. However, in many cases, it remains unclear how these interfaces form, making it extremely difficult to recreate appropriate interactions between disparate tissues after injury. An anticipated outcome of this project is that a controlled, three-dimensional coculture system as a model for interface development in orthopaedic tissues will be developed. This project is significant because the model system will provide key information about the role of cell-matrix interactions in promoting a gradient of phenotypic expression by mesenchymel stem cells (MSCs) under tensile loading, such as that experienced at the bone-ligament interface in vivo. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The education project includes the creation of new and innovative teaching materials at the high school, college, and graduate levels that will advance understanding and appreciation of the complex processes required to assure safety of modern biomaterials, and highlight limitations of current biomaterials.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Over the course of this project, we have made several scientific discoveries as well as provided many opportunities to train the next generation of biomedical scientists.  In particular, the results from the experiments conducted as a part of this project have shown us that by pulling in a controlled way on adult stem cells from the bone marrow that were embedded in a biomaterial, we could encourage them to become more like tendon and ligament cells.  We have also found that by changing the chemistry of the biomaterial that the cells are embedded in, as well as the biomolecules they are exposed to, we can tune differentiation of these cells down a different path, to form cartilage-producing cells.  Thus, by using specific culture conditions and materials designed in our laboratory, we may be able to better direct the fate of adult, bone-marrow derived cells to help heal a variety of orthopaedic tissue injuries in the future.  This project has provided a means to help train at least 4 graduate students, 4 undergraduate students, and 2 high school students.  All of these students gained exposure to the scientific process as well as learned how to communicate their results in a clear and concise manner.  Thus, this project provided each of them with a strong foundation of scientific skills that they will undoubtedly take with them in the next phase of their careers in the biomedical sciences.
