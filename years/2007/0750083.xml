<AbstractNarration>The proposal requests renewing support for the Science Coordination Office for Astrophysical Research in Antarctica (SCOARA) - an intellectual partnership comprised of all investigators conducting cosmology and astrophysics research at the U.S. Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station. SCOARA enables scientists to work together in coordinating and maintaining shared resources, communicating lessons learned and sharing new knowledge, and providing an effective channel to communicate and discuss the needs of science projects to NSF/OPP and its Antarctic support contractor; therefore, ensuring that the highest quality science is conducted at South Pole. NSF funding for SCOARA is used to maintain common-use scientific equipment shared between projects, and to operate the year-round model machine shop in the Dark Sector. No funds are requested for activities that are covered by individual investigator grants.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The Science Coordination Office for Astronomical Research in Antartica assists science teams and projects to work in the extreme cold and remote environment of the South Pole. SCOARA coordinates specialized resources shared by the scientists, as well as by the entire station. &nbsp;Examples include maintaining sophisticated test equipment, vacuum supplies and electronics. The primary activity of SCOARA is to maintain, supply and staff a precision model machine shop located in the Martin A. Pomerantz Observatory (MAPO) building. A photo of the machine shop is shown in the figure. SCOARA provides a highly trained machinist to staff the shop throughout the year. The machinist is able to build parts and repair equipment throughout the year. This is exceptionally important during the winter, when the site is not accessible. Without the ability to make precision machine parts on site, an unforeseen problem or broken part could lead to a science project sitting idle until a modified or replacement part could be shipped to the site after the station opens for the summer season. This could easily result in a large loss of science and a waste of science funding. The machine shop is also invaluable during the austral summer when the science projects are upgraded. The shop allows broken parts or modifications to parts to be machined immediately, so full advantage can be taken of the short austral summer season.&nbsp;</p> <p><br />During the winter, the SCOARA machinist also designs and machines the pole marker.
