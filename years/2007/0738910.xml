<AbstractNarration>Collaborative Research: Humics and Iron Redox Reactions in Bangladesh Aquifer&lt;br/&gt;Y. Zheng, D. Nemergut and D. McKnight&lt;br/&gt;Elevated concentrations of arsenic (As) in groundwater in many sedimentary aquifers have been observed to occur under anoxic conditions, posing significant threats to human health in some regions of the world. Microbial reduction of As-bearing Fe(III)-oxides has been invoked to explain the enrichment of As, although the mechanisms of Fe(III)-oxide reduction are not fully resolved. One potentially important factor in microbial Fe(III)-oxide reduction is the availability and abundance of complex organic molecules called humic substances which can shuttle electrons between microbes and Fe(III)-oxides. This study evaluates the role of electron-shuttling by humic substances in FeIII-reduction and subsequent As release in Bangladesh aquifers over a variety of chemical, spatial and seasonal gradients. The chemistry of the seasonally variable recharge is hypothesized to structure microbial communities. The microbes, in turn, are hypothesized to regulate local rates of Fe reduction through electron shuttling by humics, ultimately influencing As release to the aquifer. The study seeks to ascertain if Fe(III) oxide reduction is enhanced by electron shuttling of humic substances during recharge to the shallow aquifer, and if electron shuttling is limited in the generally organic-poor sediment further down the flow path . &lt;br/&gt;The study takes place in Araihazar, Bangladesh, where the shallow aquifer has shown a range of As concentrations and recharges rates. In addition to assaying the chemical (pH, Eh, DO, nitrate, Fe, Mn, sulphate) and redox properties (FeII/FeIII, AsIII/AsV) of water and sediment, the study employs fluorescence spectroscopy to evaluate redox state of humics in the field and molecular phylogenetic methods for microbial community characterization. Sediment electron shuttling capacities will also be measured using incubation initiated in the field. &lt;br/&gt;This study provides critical data (e.g., proxies for concentrations of electron shuttling compounds and microbial community shifts) to enhance the understanding of the mechanisms of Fe(III) reduction in a system where seasonal flooding, agriculture, and human waste are simultaneously influencing carbon dynamics. Because of the many important natural biogeochemical consequences of Fe-reduction, our study will have implications for other deltaic environments far beyond the interpretation of As mobility. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[       Research in the floodplain of the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta of Bangladesh has shown that dissolved organic material (DOM) in the groundwater influences how arsenic is released from the sediments and maintained in groundwater through facilitation by microorganisms. The types of microbes found in the sediments vary with the sediment properties, especially the amount of iron oxides present. By using molecular phylogenetic techniques, the microorganisms were described that are able to grow in arsenic-reducing cultures, as well as those that are responsible for arsenic reduction and arsenic trisulfide production. Enrichment experiments using sediment samples from Bangladesh with different grain sizes contained very different microbial communities. For example, iron reducing bacteria were more abundant in sediments associated with high arsenic regions of the aquifer, supporting the role of these organisms in regulating arsenic mobility in the environment. The results provide new evidence to support a dual role of natural DOM in Bangladesh aquifers. In one role, the labile portion of the DOM serves as a readily utilized substrate supporting the growth of iron- and humic-reducing bacteria.  In a second role, the dissolved humic material in the DOM serves as an electron shuttle to enhance the extent of microbial iron reduction. Overall, these biogeochemical processes involving dissolved organic material are important in controlling whether or not the concentration of arsenic is toxic to the people who rely on the groundwater for their drinking water supply.
