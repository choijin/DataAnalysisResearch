<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The primary goal of the Fostering Opportunities for TomorrowÃ†s Engineers (FORTE) project at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee (UWM) was to improve the retention rates and the eventual graduation rate for incoming freshmen in the College of Engineering and Applied Science (CEAS).  This was to be achieved by implementing changes to the first-year program to improve the first-year experience of the students, and to better prepare them for their future studies.  Several issues were identified as problems for first-year CEAS students.  These problems primarily centered on mathematics preparation, first-year mathematics course performance, and lack of connections to CEAS and their particular majors.  The FORTE program was designed to introduce three primary interventions to alleviate these problems, with the intention that more students would then remain in their engineering and computer science studies through graduation.     One intervention was the creation and implementation of a residential bridge program for incoming students who had not placed into Calculus I.  Mornings of this four-week program were devoted to math instruction, while afternoons were devoted to improving the connections of the students to CEAS and each other through team engineering activities.  At the end of the program, students retook the UWM math placement exam.  Typically, 85-90% of the students in the program improved their math course placement after completing the bridge program.  By improving their math placement, students could reduce their time to graduation by a semester or year as they entered CEAS as freshmen that much closer to completing their required math course sequence.  It is expected that a reduced time to graduation will improve graduation rates by decreasing the time and expense needed for a student to receive their degree.     A second intervention was the use of peer-led study groups for the math courses of the first-year students.  Historically, many CEAS students failed to advance through their math course sequence in a timely fashion due to receiving a low grade in a math class.  Peer study groups were seen as an opportunity to facilitate improved learning by having the students learn the material together in a formal, organized manner.  Over the duration of the grant, the study group format evolved into one where students would register for a one-credit course that consisted of the study groups.  As such, students took the study groups seriously, which increased the benefits they received.  By the end of the program, approximately 100% of the first-year CEAS students were participating in the study groups.  While the improvement in course grades varied somewhat, clearly higher grades were received by students who participated in the study groups, in comparison to students in the math courses who did not participate in a study group.     The third primary intervention was the institution of a living-learning community (LLC) for interested first-year CEAS students.  These students lived in a dedicated section of the UWM dorms, and were enrolled in at least one course with other students in the LLC.  Students in the LLC were provided with additional activities to increase their interest in engineering or computer science, and improve their connectedness with CEAS.  Many of the LLC students were receiving academic scholarships from CEAS.  Over the duration of the project, the number of CEAS students living in the LLC ranged from 40 to 72 per year.  Typically, 75-80% of the LLC students remained CEAS students in their second year.      All three of the interventions are considered successful individually, but it is necessary to consider the overall impact of the project in order to assess whether these interventions have improved retention rates in CEAS.  It is important to note that the project team refined the interventions significantly in the first two years of the project; therefore, the first two years of the project saw le...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
