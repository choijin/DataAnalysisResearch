    <AbstractNarration>This STTR Phase I research proposal will develop the means to continuously monitor local and large area thicknesses at high temperatures and harsh operating environments. This will be accomplished by the ultrasonic measurement of instantaneous temperature, by self-calibrating thickness measurements to compensate for temperature variations, by robust sensor attachment methods, by generation of suitable guided wave modes in a pipe or vessel via long delay lines for interrogation of large areas, and by developing signal processing methods for relating changes in guided wave signals to thickness variations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Continuous monitoring of the integrity of critical structures is an ambitious goal which has not yet been achieved for many applications. The primary broader impact of the proposed work is to take a significant step in achieving that goal in the context of enhancing the performance of our nation's energy infrastructure. The proposed monitoring method has broad applicability, not just for high temperature applications but also for any harsh environment (e.g., nuclear, liquid natural gas, space vehicles) and for structures which have inaccessible areas and cannot be disassembled for inspection.</AbstractNarration>
