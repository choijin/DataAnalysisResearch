<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL: This project will support underrepresented invited speakers and graduate students to attend the Frontiers of Electron Microscopy in Materials Science (FEMMS) 2007 conference to be held in Sonoma, CA from September 23-28, 2007. FEMMS is a biennial meeting focused on the most recent developments in the use of electron microscopy (primarily TEM) for materials science. This meeting is particularly timely given the recent expansion in the use of monochromators and aberration correctors and the increasing interest in the use of in-situ methods. The conference is typically attended by ~100 participants. This year the conference will have 54 invited speakers discussing topics that include high resolution imaging and spectroscopy, ultra-fast and in-situ microscopy, 3-D imaging techniques and microscopy at the interface between material science and biology. The conference also features a distinguished lecturer, Professor L. M. Brown, who has been selected for his long standing and exceptional contributions to electron microscopy. The conference has always published a proceedings as a special issue of one of the major microscopy journals (Ultramicroscopy, Journal of Microscopy, Microscopy and Microanalysis) and the intention is to publish this year's proceedings in Ultramicroscopy. Further details about the location, organization and history of the FEMMS conference can be found at the conference website: http://femms2007.llnl.gov/. NON-TECHNICAL: Although electron microscopy is ubiquitous in materials science departments in the US, the rapid development in instrumentation that has occurred over the last 2-5 years means that not all researchers have access to the latest capabilities. One of the main aims of this award is to provide the funds for under represented graduate students (women and minorities) to become educated in these latest capabilities and establish collaborations with the leaders in the field. As such, the intention is for the graduate students who attend the meeting to act as ambassadors for electron microscopy when they return to their universities, ensuring the widest possible impact for the conference. This aspect of the program will be coordinated through a large interdisciplinary program at UC Davis: Nano-materials in the Environment, Agriculture, and Technology (NEAT), which provides a focus for undergraduate and graduate education and outreach programs in all aspects of the nano-sciences. In addition to supporting graduate students, this funding also supports the registration fees for two women faculty. These faculty members are recognized leaders in the field and will act as role models for the graduate students who attend the conference.</AbstractNarration>
