<AbstractNarration>The project is an integrated team effort to comprehensively survey, review, and summarize the biodiversity of terrestrial vertebrates and their parasites in the Philippines. The Philippines has been designated a "megadiverse country" and a "global conservation hotspot" (distinctions shared only with Madagascar), yet its biodiversity remains largely unknown, underappreciated, and undescribed.  This project will survey vertebrate and parasite diversity at more than 50 sites throughout the country- across elevational, climatological, habitat, and seasonal gradients. The results will be an unprecedented collection of finest-quality museum specimens with complete, digitized and web-served accompanying data for an estimated 2500-3000 species.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New biodiversity information products will include digital collection data, faunal summaries, keys and field guides, and descriptions of new host and parasite taxa for use by biodiversity specialists. Second-order results will include conceptual studies, and investigation of emerging infectious diseases presenting immediate threats to amphibian (chytrid fungus), and bird (avian influenza) biodiversity.  By targeting IUCN-categorized "Data Deficient" species and "Key Biodiversity Areas," the project will inform policy makers and the conservation community on a scale never before realized.  This research will provide significant educational opportunities for many undergraduate and graduate students, including numerous Filipino-Americans and other underrepresented groups in science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  We conducted a comprehensive biotic inventory of Philippine birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, and their parasites.  Our work provides crucial new data to biodiversity specialists including modern digitized, geo-referenced, specimen-based data (e.g. vouchered genetic samples and morphological measurements) that provide, via immediate contributions to online biodiversity information products, a fully web-accessible and digitized biological library for systematic, conservation and biogeographical research well into the future. Already, this project has provided remarkable insights into the evolutionary processes of diversification in Asia, the identification and description of many new species, as well as a much improved understanding of the geographical distribution of hundreds of current species.  This information is critically important for informing future conservation decisions. Already, it is clear from our studies that the biodiversity of all major vertebrate groups in the Philippines is woefully underestimated.  At the current rate of species discovery, the Philippines may become recognized as the greatest concentration of vertebrate biodiversity in the world.       This research has accelerated the pace of biodiversity discovery in the Philippines&mdash;but also uncovered some astoundingly distinct new forms of life.  Among the many new species this project produced are truly novel, highly popularized, and publically visible discoveries of vertebrates unknown to science.  These include several spectacular new species of giant monitor lizards (relatives of Komodo Dragons), genetically distinct tarsiers (small nocturnal primates), completely new species of birds, a striking giant, orange-and-white flying fox, and the celebrated rediscovery of the worldÆs rarest turtle. Additionally, these studies have brought the Philippines to the forefront of the attention of the scientific community, with the description of conceptually compelling evolutionary case histories.  These include the oldest known divergence between continental Asian and adjacent island archipelago amphibians, cryptic diversification in Philippine Bulbuls (forest birds), and a lizard test and rejection of DolloÆs Law&mdash;the idea complex morphological structures can only be lost in evolutionary time but never regained. Together Filipino and U.S. based research partners have uncovered whole Philippine radiations of sunbirds, the geographic basis of small mammal radiations, the archipelagoÆs role in producing the fastest-evolving group of birds (the world famous "Great Speciator"), processes of community assembly on islands, climate-driven evolutionary diversification, and the worldÆs first fully characterized "adaptive radiations" of amphibians. Our nearly 200 scientific publications have been covered in the popular press on more than 600 occasions.   In a megadiverse global conservation hotspot like the Philippines, the importance of training opportunities and basic logistic support for learning enhancements cannot be emphasized too heavily.  All of our fieldwork is conducted in collaboration with U.S. student trainees and numerous students from local colleges and universities in the Philippines. Our work has enhanced intellectual exchange between our countries, trained new students, enabled new conceptual studies of the evolutionary processes of diversification in island archipelagos, and provided the raw ammunition for conservation efforts and a greater societal appreciation for terrestrial biodiversity in the Philippines and the greater southeast Asia. Ultimately this work enhances intellectual exchange between university scientists and students, government natural resources specialists, and non-government groups across the historically and culturally linked countries of the Philippines and the United States.
