<AbstractNarration>Understanding the forces that shaped the appearance and development of modern humans has been a leading goal of biological anthropology for decades.  As technology has improved, our capability to investigate key questions about the factors affecting the shape of our anatomy have advanced significantly.  Here, an interdisciplinary team of anthropologists and engineers will use engineering and experimental methods to examine how the shape of the skull has evolved in order to adapt to the forces associated with feeding on different types of food items.  Specifically, the researchers will take a highly interdisciplinary approach to examining whether the skulls of these early humans were well designed to crack open and chew such hard, brittle objects.  Dietary adaptations are thought to have been critical factors influencing the course of early human evolution, so this research project will provide valuable insights into the functional anatomy, diet, ecology and behavior of the earliest human ancestors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With respect to intellectual merit, this project will: (a) examine the functional and evolutionary relationships between diet and skull form, (b) test a leading hypothesis explaining the evolution of the earliest humans, (c) collect and integrate multiple types of raw data critical to an understanding of feeding biomechanics, (d) develop methods for the rapid construction of engineering models that can be applied to research questions in a wide range of disciplines, (e) integrate ecological, comparative, experimental, and engineering techniques for the investigation of evolutionary questions, and (f) rapidly disseminate data, models and findings to the scientific community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With respect to broader impacts, this study will: (a) promote interdisciplinarity, diversity and internationalism in science, (b) collect data about skull biomechanics that are relevant to dentistry and craniofacial medicine, (c) support the research of three junior investigators each in the first year of their academic appointments, (d) support female graduate students at several universities, (e) provide support to undergraduates at a university whose student body has a high proportion of minorities, (f) provide training for international students in developing nations (Brazil, Suriname), which will ultimately support the development of scientific infrastructure and institutions in those countries, (g) provide content to an exhibit focusing on human biology and evolution at the Georgia Children?s Museum, (h) using engineering models, limit the need for, or at least increase the analytical power of, future experimental studies requiring the use of live animals, (i) generate data relevant to conservation efforts by documenting the relationship between ecology and adaptation in certain primates, (j) strengthen collaborations between anthropologists and engineers in ten universities and two countries, (k) heighten awareness in the engineering community about how their methods are applicable to evolutionary questions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ It has long been thought that much of human evolutionary history has been influenced by how and what our early ancestors ate.  Specifically, it has been suggsted that a group of early humans known as australopiths evolved a number of features in their skulls that are adaptations for eating very hard or very tough foods.  However, the very complicated geometry of the facial skeleton has made it difficult to test these hypotheses.  Our project sought to address this issue by using a combination of methods from engineering, comparative biology and ecology.    We first asked whether or not the biomechanics of feeding in primates was strongly influenced by the material properties (i.e., stiffness, toughness, and hardness) of the foods that they ate.  Suprisingly, we found that these variables did not influence feeding biomechanics as much as the behaviors that were employed during feeding (such as the biomechanical differences associated with biting on the front teeth as opposed to the back teeth).  This result suggests that researchers must pay closer attention to fine details of feeding behavior if we wish to understand why dietary adaptations evolve.  The other question we asked was whether or not the very distinctive skeletal traits seen in the skulls of australopiths were adaptations for feeding on hard foods.  We conclude that this is probably the case, and that behaviors involving biting with the premolars were very important in this regard. Interestingly, however, we did not find that the skulls of these species were necessarily especially strong, as had previously been supposed.  Rather, we found that these skull traits enhanced the ability of these early humans to bite forcefully with their teeth.  Some of these traits had the unexpected effect of weakening the skull, and we hypothesize that other traits evolved to reinforce this weakened structure. Thus, the evolution of skull form in early human evolution probably represents a trade-off between the need to produce high bite force and the need to maintain the structural integrity of the bones of the head.  Our project enhanced collaborations between bological anthropologists and engineers at seven universities.  Several graduate students received advanced training in evolutionary biomechanics, including three female doctoral students.  Moreover two female undergraduate students and four female high school students were also trained.  Results were disseminated to the public through both traditional and social media.
