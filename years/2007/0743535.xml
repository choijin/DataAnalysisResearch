<AbstractNarration>Last Modified Date:  12/05/07  Last Modified By:  ARUSSEL    &lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;Abstract &lt;br/&gt;Human activities have drastically altered Earth's ecosystems. Chief among these changes is the alteration of habitats and the conversion of forests, pastures, and rangelands into homes, schools, and commercial and industrial sites. Housing development (hereafter referred to as urbanization) in particular is spreading rapidly. The ecological consequences of urbanization have received considerable attention, but what are the evolutionary implications? Striking examples have shown that direct human actions, such as overharvesting, hunting, and pest management, can affect patterns and rates of evolution in the species that are the targets of these activities. Yet, the degree to which urbanization alters the direction and strength of natural selection on native, non-target species, especially plants, remains largely unexplored. The goal of this study is to understand how urbanization alters patterns of natural selection on a native plant through changes in species interactions, including pollination, floral herbivory, and nectar robbing. The proposed work provides a powerful approach to document changes in the patterns of species interactions due to urbanization, isolate interactions responsible for changes in natural selection using experimental studies, and predict and test mechanisms responsible for such changes. Collaboration with the North Carolina Botanical Gardens will facilitate dissemination of research results to the public, and the principal investigators will present one lecture per year to the local garden club. The project also provides training opportunities to undergraduate and graduate students. Participation in research can be a critical learning experience in the education of many students, and this proposal provides for human resource development at multiple academic levels. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

The availability of land and state-supported infrastructure have, as in many parts of the southeastern US, led to a mosaic of housing sprawl and rural woodlands, with the wildland-urban interface encompassing about 44% of North Carolina. Persistent wooded, undeveloped patches within both newer and older housing developments ("suburban" sites hereafter) lie in close juxtaposition with undeveloped forested patches ("forested" sites hereafter) remaining in suburban areas as planned urban greenspace or as undevelopable land. We examined how urbanization altered plant-insect interactions using the common native perennial vine Gelsemium sempervirens (hereafter Gelsemium) and its pollinators, nectar robbers, and florivores. Gelsemium is the official state flower of South Carolina and thus is a well-known species in the southeastern US.     Our research documented that urbanization is associated with changes in both pollinator abundance as well as changes in plant interactions with nectar robbers and florivores.

Surprisingly, we found that increased pollinator abundance did not alleviate pollen limitation of seed set of Gelsemium in suburban sites. This trend was similar across two other plant species. These results are alarming and suggest that increasing pollinator abundance does not provide increased ecosystem services to native plants growing in the suburban matrix.     We also found that Gelsemium growing in suburban sites received more nectar robbing and florivory. Moreover, Gelsemium growing in suburban sites received more pollen from other plant species; pollen from other species can clog flowers and reduce reproduction. Thus, while suburban sites harbored more bees, this came at a cost of increased plant interactions with damaging species.     Finally, we measured natural selection on floral and defensive trai...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
