<AbstractNarration>Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) has been a very active field in recent years. Two&lt;br/&gt;theoretical techniques, S-matrix theory and effective field theory, allow the systematic&lt;br/&gt;treatment of many-electron systems, with the former being most useful for highly&lt;br/&gt;charged ions and the latter for neutral, few-electon atoms.&lt;br/&gt;Given the success of the theory, another important direction the field is going in is the&lt;br/&gt;use of the high precision of both experiment and QED theory to make atoms testing&lt;br/&gt;grounds for non-QED physics. The most striking use has been parity nonconservation&lt;br/&gt;(PNC) in heavy atoms, and another important use is in nuclear physics.&lt;br/&gt;A first major focus of this research will be in the fine structure of helium as a way of&lt;br/&gt;determining the fine structure constant. The extreme complexity of the electron g-2&lt;br/&gt;approach, recently shown by an error found in Kinoshita?s calculations, indicates the&lt;br/&gt;value of an alternative approach. Independent checks of a recent calculation of&lt;br/&gt;Pachucki are proposed.&lt;br/&gt;A second focus will involve research on highly charged ions, continuing a long standing&lt;br/&gt;collaboration with K.T. Cheng of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Completion&lt;br/&gt;of calculations of the spectra of sodiumlike ions along with extension to copperlike ions&lt;br/&gt;is proposed. Hyperfine splitting in highly charged ions will also be studied.&lt;br/&gt;A third research area is recoil corrections. The treatment of recoil in a highly relativistic&lt;br/&gt;system has been treated only by one other group. G. Adkins and I have been working&lt;br/&gt;on an independent approach to the problem, and continuation of this research is&lt;br/&gt;proposed. Another use of recoil techniques is in the treatment of photon-Z boson&lt;br/&gt;exchange diagrams, which have a binding singularity that has not yet been evaluated in&lt;br/&gt;a Bethe-Salpeter framework.&lt;br/&gt;A final goal, with broader impact, is writing a textbook on bound state quantum field&lt;br/&gt;theory. Most of the techniques used in the research described above have not yet been&lt;br/&gt;well described in textbook form, and doing this, along with giving a much needed update&lt;br/&gt;of Bethe and Salpeter's monograph, is the intention of this work.</AbstractNarration>
