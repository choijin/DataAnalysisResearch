<AbstractNarration>This project is focused on the properties of organic aerosols, which are recognized to be ubiquitous in the troposphere.  The first goal is to explore, through laboratory investigations, how organic colloids in aqueous solutions can alter the basic physicochemical properties of atmospheric aerosols such as their surface composition and hygroscopicity.  The second goal is to extract the required thermodynamic parameters (activity coefficients, adsorption constants, etc.) from the data in order to formulate an equilibrium aqueous solution model for pure organic aerosols as well as mixed aerosols containing both organic and inorganic components.  Water uptake and surface tension of a wide range of organic-containing solutions, representative of mixtures found in atmospheric aerosols, will be measured as a function of pH and temperature.  Surface composition will be probed, and the possible formation of micelles will be studied.  The data will be parameterized for use in the thermodynamic model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The quantitative equilibrium solution model developed under this project for mixed solutions, including organics, should be useful to the atmospheric community for a wide variety of applications.  Broader scientific impacts include an improved understanding of atmospheric aerosols and their effects on climate.  Graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, including members of underrepresented groups, will be supported through this award.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Tropospheric aerosols affect the EarthÃ†s climate both directly, by scattering and absorbing solar radiation, and indirectly, by affecting the formation and properties of clouds. Organics are an abundant component (~30-80%) of submicron tropospheric aerosols, with a substantial portion consisting of large organic molecules called humic substances. The effects of humic substances, and of organic mixtures, on the chemical and radiative impacts of aerosols in the atmosphere are not well understood.    This project examined how mixtures of dissolved humic substances, other organics, and inorganics change the basic thermochemical properties of aerosol droplets in the atmosphere. The focus was on conducting fundamental laboratory investigations involving aqueous solutions containing organic components and mixtures.   We examined how water uptake and the surface tension of single- and multi-component solutions varied with temperature, and with solute concentration.   We found that surface tension and water uptake did not vary measurably with temperature, over a range from ~0-30 C.  This suggests that parameters measured in the laboratory (typically at 20-25 C) can reliably be applied to the cooler conditions that are typical of clouds.   However, interactions between solutes in multi-component mixtures often led to notable discrepancies in both water uptake and surface tension between laboratory measurements and the predictions of currently-used physicochemical models. In particular, we found that in mixtures, the less soluble components tend to contribute disproportionately to the overall decrease in surface tension with increasing concentration. We hypothesize that this is because sparingly-soluble components are more strongly driven to the surface when other solutes are present. This effect will allow more aerosols to serve as cloud condensation nuclei, creating clouds with altered lifetimes and reflective properties.   We expect the results of this project to have an important impact within the global modeling field. The fundamental physicochemical characteristics determined by this project will contribute to more accurately predicting the formation and properties of clouds within global climate change models.
