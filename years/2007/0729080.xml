    <AbstractNarration>The practice of medicine involves the science of prediction. &lt;br/&gt;Prediction depends on clinical or laboratory variables or factors &lt;br/&gt;that are linked to outcome. The most common predictors in cancer &lt;br/&gt;medicine are the three variables: tumor size, regional lymph node &lt;br/&gt;status, and distant metastasis. The three variables are combined &lt;br/&gt;in a bin model to form the TNM Staging system, which is a major &lt;br/&gt;tool used to predict the outcome of cancer patients and guide therapy. &lt;br/&gt;However, the TNM system has only three variables. Therefore, &lt;br/&gt;its predictive accuracy is limited. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research addresses issues of numerical computing and optimization &lt;br/&gt;in developing expanded cancer prognostic systems that can integrate &lt;br/&gt;multiple variables. Two sets of closely related tasks will be investigated, &lt;br/&gt;and they represent two major aspects of the intellectual merit of the study. &lt;br/&gt;One task is focused on how censored survival times and different &lt;br/&gt;types of variables are integrated into a clustering framework that &lt;br/&gt;works for a large volume of cancer patient data. Another task is to &lt;br/&gt;use the developed cluster analysis to establish prognostic systems, &lt;br/&gt;which will provide a more accurate prediction of outcome by taking &lt;br/&gt;multiple prognostic factors into account. The broader impact of this &lt;br/&gt;research includes many aspects. It will have a direct impact on future &lt;br/&gt;staging and classification of cancer patients. The work has general &lt;br/&gt;applications and can be adapted to studies of any non-cancer health &lt;br/&gt;problems. The investigator's study is expected to make significant &lt;br/&gt;contributions to advances in medicine. The research will also have an &lt;br/&gt;educational impact.</AbstractNarration>
