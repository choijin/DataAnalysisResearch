<AbstractNarration>The ability to generalize knowledge from known to novel instances is a critically important property of human learning.  This ability appears very early in development.  For instance, upon learning a name of a new animal, a child can generalize this name to other similar animals.  Similarly, upon learning a fact about a new animal, a child can generalize this fact to other similar animals.  By some accounts, inductive generalization is the only process by which new knowledge comes into the world and understanding of this ability and its development can elucidate a single main theme to cognitive science the question of how people come to have knowledge.  Most importantly, it remains unknown how people move from every-day generalizations which are often based on simple similarity to deep generalizations that are based on abstract knowledge.  The central goal of this research is to understand how the ability to generalize changes in the course of development.  We hypothesize that the development of inductive generalization is driven by the development of the ability to deliberately focus attention on some aspects of incoming information while ignoring others. Eight experiments with infants and adults test this hypothesis by posing three questions: (1) How do children develop the ability to deliberately attend to some aspects, while ignoring others?; (2) How well does this ability to deliberate control attention explain changes in inductive generalization?; and (3) Is it possible to facilitate the development of deliberate attention through attentional training?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results of this foundational research will inform researchers as well as practitioners. First, the proposed project will generate new theoretical and empirical knowledge grounding the development of induction in the development of attention.  This will significantly advance our understanding of the development of several critically important aspects of learning and cognitive development. Second, the proposed project will employ novel methodologies, thus contributing to the methodological armamentarium of developmental and learning research.  And finally, the project may help practitioners of child development and education to better understand how attention affects some important aspects of learning and cognitive development.</AbstractNarration>
