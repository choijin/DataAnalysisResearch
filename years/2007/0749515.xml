<AbstractNarration>In taxonomy "type" specimens uniquely represent and link scientific names to their species. Accurate taxonomic research and descriptions of new species require knowledge of previously described species based on type specimens. This project will produce high-resolution digital images and X-Rays of nearly 2,800 type specimens of fishes in the research collections of the Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia (ANSP). ANSP ranks second in North America in the number of fish types and taxonomic representation: 1,825 nominal species in 42 orders from all over the world. The images and X-Rays will be freely and rapidly available for scientific and not-for-profit educational uses through the ANSP collections Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taxonomists increasingly confront impediments to direct access to type specimens: rising travel costs to museums and added restrictions on lending and shipping alcohol preserved specimens. High-resolution images often provide to researchers sufficient information about diagnostic and other characters to obviate the need for direct examination of specimens. High quality images can be used as illustrations in publications. The images will also serve as a backup in the event of future loss of specimens. Thus, images of the ANSP fish type specimens will be a broadly useful, timely and permanent research resource in systematic ichthyology.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
