<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;This award supports theoretical research and education under the umbrella of &lt;br/&gt;the NSF-wide Mathematical Sciences Priority Area.  This project lies at the &lt;br/&gt;interface of theoretical condensed matter physics and mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;Many interesting phenomena observed in the condensed matter physics&lt;br/&gt;laboratory are dominated by strong interactions or strong disorder.  The&lt;br/&gt;understanding of such systems is typically very challenging, due to the limited&lt;br/&gt;number of  theoretical tools available for their description, standard paradigms&lt;br/&gt;including for example Fermi-Liquid or other independent particle-type&lt;br/&gt;approaches are often not adequate to capture the&lt;br/&gt;The focus of the work supported under this award is the application and the &lt;br/&gt;Development of novel theoretical methods aimed at treating such strong coupling problems.  The focus of the research includes Non-Fermi-Liquid behavior in&lt;br/&gt;Quantum Impurity Problems dominated by strong interactions, localization &lt;br/&gt;Transitions in disordered electronic systems, and systems dominated by the&lt;br/&gt;simultaneous effects of disorder and interactions.  The PI will use methods&lt;br/&gt;ranging from conformal field theory, to the functional renormalization group, and &lt;br/&gt;the emerging field of the Stochastic Loewner Evolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;This award supports theoretical research and education under the umbrella of &lt;br/&gt;The NSF-wide Mathematical Sciences Priority Area.  This project lies at the &lt;br/&gt;Interface of theoretical condensed matter physics and mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;This research focuses on problems at the frontiers of condensed matter theory &lt;br/&gt;that involve materials or nanosystems with unusual properties.  These often arise&lt;br/&gt;as a consequence of strong interactions among electrons.  Disorder, where the&lt;br/&gt;positions of the atoms deviate significantly from highly ordered arrangements,&lt;br/&gt;may also play an important role.  Understanding the effects of these two factors&lt;br/&gt;working in concert represents a formidable theoretical challenge.  The PI will,&lt;br/&gt;develop new theoretical tools, some that benefit from recent advances in the&lt;br/&gt;mathematical sciences, to advance research on the combined effects of strong&lt;br/&gt;interaction and disorder in materials.  This research aims to advance fundamental&lt;br/&gt;science and it interesting and important in its own right.  It may also contribute to&lt;br/&gt;the discovery of new phenomena and contribute to our understanding of complex&lt;br/&gt;materials that hold promise for future technological applications.  This research &lt;br/&gt;activity will contribute to the education of the next generation of condensed &lt;br/&gt;matter theorist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
