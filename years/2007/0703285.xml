<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;PI:  Michael Udvardi (Samuel Roberts Noble Foundation, Inc.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CoPIs:  Rujin Chen and Kirankumar Mysore (Samuel Roberts Noble Foundation, Inc.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Legumes are second only to grasses in importance to humans for agriculture.  Legumes have been an integral part of agricultural systems for thousands of years, and remain important for sustainable agriculture today because they can establish symbioses with nitrogen-fixing bacteria called rhizobia that supply their host plant with reduced nitrogen.  This means that legumes can grow in soils containing little or no mineral or organic nitrogen, without the need to add economically and environmentally-expensive industrial nitrogen fertilizers.  Symbiotic nitrogen fixation in legumes takes place in specialized organs that develop from root cells following contact with rhizobia in the soil.  Rhizobia colonize plant cells in the developing nodules before differentiating into a nitrogen-fixing form called the bacteroid.  Development and differentiation of legume nodules and bacteroids involve coordinated changes in the expression of thousands of plant and bacterial genes.  While tremendous advances have been made recently in our understanding of plant-microbe signaling during the early stages of the legume-rhizobia interaction, little is known about how the plant regulates the massive changes in gene expression that underpin nodule development and differentiation.  This project aims to use cutting-edge gene expression-profiling technology and to develop Tnt1-insertion and Fast Neutron Bombardment (FNB)-deletion mutant populations to identify regulatory genes that re-program plant cells during nodule development and differentiation.  The project will focus, in particular, on transcription factor and miRNA genes, two classes of genes that are known to play leading roles in transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression in plants. Microarray data generated in the course of this project will be available through a project web site, GEO, and the Legume Information Service (LIS; www.comparative-legumes.org).  Flanking sequence data and biological resources can be accessed via the project web site, LIS, the Medicago Genome Project website (www.medicago.org/genome), or by directly contacting project senior personnel and/or the curator of Biological Resources, Dr. Jiangqi Wen (jwen@noble.org).    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research is trans-disciplinary in nature and requires the application of genomics, functional genomics, and bioinformatics with the more classical disciplines of genetics, molecular and cell biology, and plant physiology.  By providing a single training ground at the Noble Foundation, this project will empower postdoctoral fellows, students, and technical staff to learn many of the research skills that are essential for cutting-edge biological research.  This project will also participate in the Noble Foundation's strong student outreach program to maximize teaching and learning outcomes.  Finally, the project will take advantage of existing domestic and international collaborations to strengthen links between scientists in the USA, Europe, and Australia.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Legume plants are important sources of food for humans, feed for other animals, and feedstock for industry.  Legumes have been integral to sustainable agriculture for thousands of years in large part because they can convert atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia, via symbiosis with nitrogen-fixing bacteria called rhizobia, which enable the plants to grow without soil or fertilizer nitrogen.  Legumes are also famous because Gregor Mendel used a legume species, the common garden pea (Pisum sativum), in his experiments in the late 1800s to establish the field of genetics, which has become central to biology and medicine.  Pea mutants were crucial in Mendel's work and legume mutants remain important today as tools to understand fundamental aspects of plant biology.  This NSF-funded project enabled us to develop populations of two different types of mutants in the model legume species, Medicago truncatula, the genome of which was sequenced recently.  The mutants that we produced are helping us and other groups in the USA and around the world to discover new genes required for symbiotic nitrogen fixation by rhizobia in legume plants.  The mutants are also helping many groups to discover genes for other important plant processes, including growth, development, and response to the environment.  We anticipate that the products of this project will contribute to the development and breeding of plants that are more efficient at symbiotic nitrogen fixation, more tolerant of drought and other abiotic stresses, more resistant to pests and pathogens, and more nutritious.  Obviously, these are lofty goals, but it is imperative that we reach such goals in order to feed the growing world population in a sustainable manner that does not degrade the environment upon which we depend.  This project is one of many that together will help us reach these goals.       Last Modified: 11/21/2012       Submitted by: Michael Udvardi]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
