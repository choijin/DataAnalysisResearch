<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0706876&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Igor Mineyev&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main objective of this project is to develop techniques for&lt;br/&gt;constructing metric spaces.  One would like to have nice metric&lt;br/&gt;spaces on which a given group can act, either by isometries or&lt;br/&gt;topologically; and to make them "as canonical as possible".  The&lt;br/&gt;principal investigator's symmetric join construction and the&lt;br/&gt;conformal metric on the boundaries of hyperbolic groups, and&lt;br/&gt;others, were steps in this general direction. Ideally, one would&lt;br/&gt;like to have a functorial construction that associates to every&lt;br/&gt;group in a given class (with a metric on it), say, a uniquely&lt;br/&gt;geodesic metric space with a (cocompact, isometric, properly&lt;br/&gt;discontinuous) action by the group. This seems to be a very&lt;br/&gt;difficult question (this is the kind of things that Perelman's&lt;br/&gt;Ricci flow does to manifolds, and we essentially want its&lt;br/&gt;analogue for general metric spaces).  This question is related to&lt;br/&gt;several major problems in topology and geometry.  Our goal is to&lt;br/&gt;make further progress in this direction. Another goal is to&lt;br/&gt;further investigate how geometry of groups is reflected in&lt;br/&gt;various types of (co)homology, and vice versa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A metric space is one of the most important and most basic&lt;br/&gt;mathematical notions: it is a set of points in which one is given&lt;br/&gt;the distance between any two points, with very natural&lt;br/&gt;properties. All branches of mathematics use this notion. Our&lt;br/&gt;Universe is an example of a metric space, and there is no reason&lt;br/&gt;for it to look like the 3-dimensional Euclidean space at all. We&lt;br/&gt;are interested in understanding what kinds of metric spaces can&lt;br/&gt;possibly be there, and "how good" they can be.  For example, in&lt;br/&gt;order to be "good", one should at least be able to pass from one&lt;br/&gt;point to another by a shortest possible path within the given&lt;br/&gt;space. Manifolds considered by classical Riemannian geometry have&lt;br/&gt;this property. We aim for a generalization of classical geometry&lt;br/&gt;from manifolds to metric spaces. One goal of this project is to&lt;br/&gt;explicitly construct good metric spaces and to understand how&lt;br/&gt;they form.  This simple idea is related to deep questions facing&lt;br/&gt;modern mathematics.  As a by-product, this might give us more&lt;br/&gt;insight to the structure and formation of our Universe. Our&lt;br/&gt;original motivation though is the beauty and mathematical&lt;br/&gt;importance of the problem rather than any particular immediate&lt;br/&gt;application.  (Our Universe is only a special case of a metric&lt;br/&gt;space.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
