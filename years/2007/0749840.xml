<AbstractNarration> With the support of this award from the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry program, Professor Francisco Raymo will explore the synthesis of compounds incorporating a fluorescent group and a photochromic switch in their molecular skeleton.  The fluorophore is designed to emit radiations in the visible region upon excitation at one wavelength (ON).  The photochrome is engineered to switch the emission of the fluorophore off upon excitation at another wavelength (OFF).  On the basis of this unique behavior and the interplay of two exciting beams at ON and OFF, the group will be able to image biological samples with unprecedented resolution.  In fact, they plan to characterize the photochemical and photophysical properties of their  molecular switches first and then assess their potential application as luminescent probes for fluorescence imaging.  Thus, their fundamental investigations should contribute to the understanding of the basic factors controlling the photochemical and photophysical properties of organic molecules, while providing viable operating principles for the design of photoresponsive compounds and materials.  In addition to an immediate impact on the general field of molecular switches, the findings should have more long-range broader impacts in biomedical research. The luminescent switches could eventually evolve into valuable analytical tools for the visualization of biological samples with nanoscaled resolution.  Furthermore, this research program will foster an interdisciplinary collaboration between members of the Departments of Chemistry and Neurobiology of the host institution and contribute to the training of a graduate student and a postdoctoral associate at the interface of chemistry and biology.  Moreover, it will have a significant educational impact on members of underrepresented groups, as a result of the high minority enrollment, most notably Hispanic, of the University of Miami.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit: We developed viable operating principles to modulate fluorescence under the influence of optical stimulations in water, using molecular and supramolecular assemblies of luminescent and photochromic components, and demonstrated that these systems can be exploited to imprint fluorescent patterns on substrates and image intracellular environments.  In addition, we unraveled the stereoelectronic factors regulating the photochromism of a new family of molecular switches and demonstrated that these compounds can be integrated within macromolecular constructs and operated in water.  Finally, we designed valuable strategies to passivate the surface of semiconductor quantum dots with hydrophilic ligands and switch their luminescence with photocleavable components under the influence of optical stimulations.  Broader Impact: Our protocols for fluorescence modulation can be exploited to overcome the diffraction barrier relying on multiphoton excitation schemes.  As a result, our photoswitchable luminescent probes will offer the opportunity to image biological samples with nanoscaled resolution and, hence, have a significant impact on biomedical research.  In addition, our strategy to impose aqueous solubility on semiconductor quantum dots can lead to the development of a new family of biocompatible luminescent probes, based on the outstanding photophysical properties of these inorganic nanoparticles, for a diversity of imaging applications.  Our research program contributed to the training of six graduate students and one postdoctoral associate in the chemical synthesis, structural characterization and spectroscopic analysis of functional molecular and supramolecular assemblies.  In addition, the principal investigator lectured in a symposium on photochromism aimed at the general public within a continuing education program operating at the national level and at an international conference targeted to the general public and high-school students.
