<AbstractNarration>Crayfishes form an integral part of freshwater ecosystems throughout eastern North America.  Despite their importance, they have received little systematic attention compared to other groups of aquatic organisms.  This study proposes to complete a phylogenetic (evolutionary) hypothesis for the second most species-rich genus of crayfishes in North America: Cambarus.  The completed project will consist of three genomic data sets, a morphological character matrix and a phylogeny for these taxa.  The resultant hypothesis will be used to investigate patterns of speciation, biogeography, and life-history evolution.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the proposed research include training co-PI Dillman as a crayfish systematist, exposing undergraduate students to molecular laboratory techniques and phylogenetic methodology, and providing undergraduate students with a greater appreciation for biodiversity within this understudied group of organisms.  The gene regions to be used are the most frequently used genes in systematic studies of North American crayfishes to date.  This increases compatibility of the data to be generated with data previously published.  Given the long-standing interest of P.I. Wood in biogeographic patterns in aquatic organisms (primarily fishes) the use of crayfishes broadens the scope of work in his lab and enhances the opportunity for discovery of more generalized patterns among aquatic organisms.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
