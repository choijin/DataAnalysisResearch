<AbstractNarration>This project is concerned with the approximate solution of certain&lt;br/&gt;systems of evolution partial differential equations (PDE) arising at&lt;br/&gt;the intersection of mathematical physics and geometric analysis.&lt;br/&gt;Such systems of equations, known as Geometric PDE, with both constraints&lt;br/&gt;and gauge degrees of freedom, appear in a wide range of physical and&lt;br/&gt;mathematical problems; examples include Maxwell's equations (or more&lt;br/&gt;generally the Yang-Mills equations on a curved background), and&lt;br/&gt;Einstein's field equations and other Hamiltonian systems with an&lt;br/&gt;infinite-dimensional symmetry group. The Cauchy formulation for such &lt;br/&gt;systems yields a constrained evolution system which has to be augmented &lt;br/&gt;with gauge-fixing conditions in order to get a unique evolution vector field.&lt;br/&gt;The project will involve constructing finite element discretizations&lt;br/&gt;for solving such geometric PDE systems; various techniques for dealing&lt;br/&gt;with evolution systems with constraints will be analyzed, including&lt;br/&gt;constraint-projection using variational techniques (where the numerical&lt;br/&gt;solution is projected back to the constraint manifold after&lt;br/&gt;some number of time steps), the use of special finite elements which&lt;br/&gt;automatically solve the linearized constraints and thereby remain on a&lt;br/&gt;piecewise-linear approximation to the constraint manifold, and finally&lt;br/&gt;least-squares approaches which only control the constraints rather than&lt;br/&gt;enforce them. In particular, stability results guaranteeing convergence&lt;br/&gt;of the numerical solution to the continuum solution will be derived,&lt;br/&gt;at least for the linearized equations.  A posteriori error estimates will &lt;br/&gt;be derived for studying properties of the discretizations, and for &lt;br/&gt;building adaptive methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project involves the design, development, and implementation of&lt;br/&gt;new mathematical and computational techniques for solving a large class &lt;br/&gt;of important, challenging, and pressing mathematical problems in&lt;br/&gt;multiscale and multiphysics modeling and simulation.  The techniques &lt;br/&gt;developed will lead to the aquisition of new knowledge in areas of &lt;br/&gt;science such as relatistic astrophysics, by making possible more reliable &lt;br/&gt;and accurate simulations of phenomena such as gravitational collapse, &lt;br/&gt;nonlinear stability of deformed rotating black holes, binary black hole &lt;br/&gt;collision, and the production and emission of gravitational radiation.&lt;br/&gt;Most of these problems are currently of great interest due to the &lt;br/&gt;recent construction of gravitational wave detectors such as the NSF-funded&lt;br/&gt;LIGO devices in Lousiana and Washington.  The results from this project &lt;br/&gt;will have a broad impact on areas of mathematics such as geometric analysis,&lt;br/&gt;as well as in astrophysics and general relativity.  The methods developed &lt;br/&gt;here will contribute to the advancement of numerical methods for complex &lt;br/&gt;three-dimensional constrained nonlinear dynamical simulations, and the &lt;br/&gt;technology produced will provide powerful tools for the exploration of &lt;br/&gt;models in astrophysics and relativity as well as in some areas of pure &lt;br/&gt;mathematics such as geometric analysis.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
