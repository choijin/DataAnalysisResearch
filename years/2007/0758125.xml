<AbstractNarration>We seek to develop computationally feasible theoretical methods that provide a model-independent, microscopic description of atomic nuclei with controllable theoretical errors across a wide range of nuclei.  This project is highly relevant to forefront problems in nuclear physics, such as the physics of nuclei far from stability, where controlled extrapolations away from stability are essential but have been lacking in theoretical approaches to date.  The development of improved calculations with theoretical error bars will be necessary to provide guidance for the next generation of rare isotope beam facilities and reliable nuclear physics input for astrophysical applications.   Our primary tools to accomplish the objectives of this project will be the Renormalization Group, which enables the forces between nucleons to be evolved to a softer form that is more convenient for large-scale computations, and Effective Field Theory, which provides a model-independent and systematic organization of inter-nucleon forces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will have broader impacts by fostering inter-disciplinary connections and helping to build a strong and youthful scientific community in the United States.  The complementary techniques of Effective Field Theory and the Renormalization Group are widely used in many areas of theoretical physics due to their universality and power of simplification.  Therefore, our use of these modern and general techniques will enhance interactions with other disciplines such as condensed matter, atomic, and high energy theory.  Similarly, the use of coupled-cluster and energy density functional methods for nuclei in this work will foster connections with quantum chemistry.  Finally, the current project will provide graduate students and postdocs with a good balance of formal (analytical) and practical (numerical) work, which will serve as excellent preparation for a career in industry or academia.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In the past decade, renewed interest in nuclear structure and reactions has been fueled by experiments at rare isotope beam facilities, which open the door to new regions of exotic nuclei; by astrophysical observations and simulations of neutron stars and supernovae, which require controlled extrapolations of the equation of state of nucleonic matter in density and isospin; and by studies of universal physics, which unite cold atom and dilute neutron physics. The research under the present NSF award examines how the interplay and coalescence of different threads: rapidly increasing computational power, effective field theory (EFT), and renormalization group (RG) transformations have enabled the development of new many-body methods and the revival of old ones to successfully attack these problems.   The components of the PI's research are grouped into four inter-connected areas; Inter-Nucleon Interactions and Renormalization Group (RG) Methods, Ab-initio Calculations for Finite Nuclei, In?nite Nuclear Matter, and Microscopic Density Functional Theory (DFT).  These areas are connected in the following sense. Ab-initio calculations of nuclei and infinite nuclear matter are complicated by strong short-range repulsion and tensor forces that necessitate highly correlated trial wave functions, non-perturbative resummations, and large (i.e., slowly convergent) basis expansions. The difficulties on the ab-initio end in turn hinder the development of microscopically-based DFT for nuclear systems, which poses a serious problem since DFT is the only computationally-feasible many-body method capable of describing nuclei across the mass table.  However, the non-perturbative nature of inter-nucleon interactions is strongly scale or resolution dependent, and can be radically softened by using the RG to decouple problematic high-momentum states that create these difficulties.  A consequence is that many-body calculations become much more tractable at lower resolutions, resulting in calculations that are amenable to straightforward perturbative methods, simple (i.e., less correlated) variational wave functions, and rapidly convergent basis expansions.   The PI's research has shown that upon evolving the nuclear interactions to lower cuto?s, Hartree-Fock becomes a viable zeroth-order approximation for nuclei and nuclear matter, with rapidly convergent perturbative corrections for many bulk properties of interest. Similarly, dramatic simpli?cations have been observed with "proof-of-principle" variational calculations of light nuclei, and in ab-initio no-core shell model (NCSM) and coupled-cluster (CC) calculations, which can now be extended to larger systems.  Since Hartree-Fock becomes a reasonable starting point for nuclei and nuclear matter, the PI and collaborators have been able to use many-body perturbation theory to provide microscopic constraints for Skyrme-like energy density functionals for nuclear DFT calculations.
