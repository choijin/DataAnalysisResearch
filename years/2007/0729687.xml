<AbstractNarration>This grant is supporting student attendance (36 students) at the 26th International Congress on Applications of Lasers &amp; Electro-Optics (ICALEO 2007). The 36 graduate students are from underrepresented groups and institutions that traditionally lack funding for such support, to attend this conference. The conference will be held Oct 29-Nov 1, 2007 in Orlando, FL. The technical topics and research areas to be covered by ICALEO 2007 are in line with the areas supported by the Divisions of Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation (CMMI) and Electrical, Communications and CyberSystems (ECCS).  The intellectual merit includes providing the students with broader and better information on research areas, as well as momentum and clarity in their career pursuits. Conference planners are organizing a special session to provide graduate students with presentations and discussions with leaders in academia and industry. The purpose of this session will be to give the students a better understanding of the challenges and opportunities to pursuing a career in either academia or private industry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broder impacts of this grant include exposing the student attendees to state-of-the-art research topics and giving them an opportunity to interact with academic and industrial leaders. Priority will be given to the graduate students from underrepresented groups, such as women, African American and Hispanic students, and from universities that lack financial resources. Evaluation of the effort is being conducted.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
