<AbstractNarration>The Experimental Physical Chemistry program of the Division of Chemistry supports the research of Professor Edward Castner of the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology at Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey.  Castner and his research group will study the physical and chemical properties of new classes of ionic liquids.  Time-resolved optical spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy will be used to study the dynamics, interactions, and transport in ionic liquids as a function of temperature.  The research will include the detailed evaluation of the impact of silicon substitutions in alkyl side chains on the properties of these materials and the comparison of intermolecular interactions in ionic liquids with those of isoelectronic, neutral homologs.  NMR diffusion studies of ionic liquids with varying concentrations of water will be used to model transport relevant to ionic liquids in fuel cells.  The overall goal of the work is to study carefully selected ionic liquids and model systems in sufficient detail to lead to better a priori predictions of their properties.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research should provide a better understanding of the liquid properties of ionic liquids, especially their viscosities and conductivities.  Ionic liquids are an important new class of chemical solvents comprised of molten salts that have many special properties.  The unique electrical characteristics of these liquids should lead to their use in improved batteries, fuel cells and solar photocells.  The Castner group will collaborate with a diverse range of researchers, including students, postdoctoral fellows, faculty, and scientific staff at Brookhaven National Laboratory, William Paterson University, and the City University of New York (Hunter College and Brooklyn College).  The project will train undergraduates, graduate students, and post-doctoral researchers in modern techniques in experimental and theoretical physical chemistry.</AbstractNarration>
