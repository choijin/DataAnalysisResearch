<AbstractNarration>Integrative, Hybrid and Complex Systems&lt;br/&gt;University of Utah&lt;br/&gt;Neal K. Patwari&lt;br/&gt;CAREER: RF-Sensing Networks for Radio Tomographic Environmental Imaging&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:  This research focuses on the development of new technologies to ?see? through walls into buildings to show interior structures and the motion of people within the structure.  Rather than relying on a single self-contained short-range radar, this method uses a large-scale network of low-cost sensors as multi-static radio frequency (RF) radars whose pair-wise and spectral measurements can be used to image the environment.  This research lies at the intersection of statistical signal processing and radio propagation and addresses the necessary key advances related to dense networks of RF sensors and accurate statistical channel models.  The proposed research (1) uses extensive measurements to develop valid statistical channel models that depend on the attenuation field, (2) develops and tests estimation algorithms for radio tomographic imaging, and (3) analyzes their estimation performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:  If successful in leading to new tomographic environmental imaging systems, the proposal has the potential to significantly benefit fire fighters, other first responders, and building occupants in emergency situations.  In addition, the research has the potential to benefit other types of communication networks by advancing cooperative spectrum sensing in dynamic spectrum access radio networks and improving channel simulation in multi-hop networks.  The project is a crucial part of the principal investigator?s goal of integrating research and education in signal processing and wireless networks.  This project will lead to a new wireless communication system laboratory, a key part of a departmental curricular initiative to provide students with integrative lab experiences.  Further the project will develop and disperse new interactive modules to be used with students in grades 10 through 12, in particular in programs targeted towards students from under-represented groups, both part of department goals to increase the diversity and the total enrollment of students in electrical and computer engineering.  Undergraduate student research will also be integrated into this project.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
