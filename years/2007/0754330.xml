<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Joshua, Roy&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: DMS - 0754330 &lt;br/&gt;Institution: The Ohio State University &lt;br/&gt;Title: Conference on Algebraic Cycles II: Progress and Prospects&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Organizers: Reza Akhtar (Miami University), Patrick Brosnan (University &lt;br/&gt;of British Columbia) and Roy Joshua (The Ohio State University).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference will bring together &lt;br/&gt;many of the world?s leading mathematicians to survey current developments, &lt;br/&gt;report on recent progress, and anticipate future developments in the field &lt;br/&gt;of algebraic cycles. The conference will also explore connections with arithmetic &lt;br/&gt;geometry and mathematical physics/non-commutative geometry. Progress in algebraic &lt;br/&gt;cycles, with related results in algebraic K-theory, has been dramatic in recent &lt;br/&gt;years. The principal contributors to motivic cohomology which underlies this &lt;br/&gt;progress, Bloch, Lichtenbaum, Levine, Nori and Friedlander have agreed to &lt;br/&gt;participate. Related investigations include the work of Totaro, Weibel and &lt;br/&gt;Esnault all of whom have agreed to participate. Developments in arithmetic &lt;br/&gt;geometry closely related to algebraic cycles involve the work of Colliot-Thelene &lt;br/&gt;and Huber who will also participate in this conference. The connections between &lt;br/&gt;algebraic cycles and mathematical physics/non-commutative geometry have begun &lt;br/&gt;to be explored in recent years. Some of the main players in this emerging field &lt;br/&gt;are Bloch, Esnault and Kreimer: in addition to Bloch and Esnault, Kreimer also &lt;br/&gt;will participate in this conference. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The venue of this conference is The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, &lt;br/&gt;from Monday, March 24 through Saturday, March 29, 2008. The conference plans to &lt;br/&gt;support participation by a number of young people, at both the post-doctoral &lt;br/&gt;and advanced graduate student level, so that it will serve to stimulate &lt;br/&gt;increased interest and participation in these exciting mathematical topics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
