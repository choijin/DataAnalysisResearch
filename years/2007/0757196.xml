<AbstractNarration>This proposal requests continuing support for a program of research for the High Energy Physics group at the University of Chicago in experiments where it has leadership roles, namely the CDF experiment at the Fermilab Tevatron collider, the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, the Double Chooz experiment in France, R&amp;D on of picosecond timing electronics, and, to a lesser degree, the International Linear Collider program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the past few decades, physicists have been able to describe with increasing detail the fundamental particles that make up the Universe and the interactions between them. Much of this success has been due to the Tevatron program at Fermilab with D0 and CDF making major contributions.  This Chicago group, acknowledged to be one of the premier groups in high energy physics, has made vital contributions to the CDF experiment in its construction and operation and in the physics questions proposed as well as in many leadership roles.  In mid-2008 the LHC and ATLAS will start operation and this group is now transitioning into the ATLAS program where it has parlayed its wealth of experience in hadron collider physics into leadership roles, particularly in the calorimeter, software development, and physics analysis areas.  Following a major contributions to the KTeV experiment, Blucher has selected to work within the Double Chooz collaboration and has responsibility, along with Columbia University, for the outer veto system. .The group is well-represented in detector R&amp;D with an outstanding program in the development of picosecond-stable circuitry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On Broader Impacts, the group will continue its traditional .participation in the Chicago Public Schools and the Illinois Math and Science Academy, and with the creation of new outreach and educational programs at the University.</AbstractNarration>
