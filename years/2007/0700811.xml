<AbstractNarration>The investigators study asymptotic invariants of groups. The topics include:&lt;br/&gt;constructing finitely presented groups with "transcendental" properties (infinite&lt;br/&gt;torsion and with Kazhdan property (T) ), residual properties and linearity of&lt;br/&gt;hyperbolic groups, groups with irregular or small Dehn functions and other filling&lt;br/&gt;functions of groups, asymptotic cones of finitely presented groups, and asymptotic&lt;br/&gt;invariants of embeddings into Hilbert spaces (Hilbert space compressions of groups).&lt;br/&gt;These topics are intimately related. For example, Higman embeddings and S-machines &lt;br/&gt;are used to construct finitely presented torsion groups, in the study of Dehn functions,&lt;br/&gt;and in the study of residual properties of hyperbolic groups. The investigators propose&lt;br/&gt;to organize several group theory conferences and attract students to their area of&lt;br/&gt;mathematics. They are also going to give several courses on the topic of the proposal.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;It is a well known point of view after Klein, Hilbert, Einstein and Weil that fundamental&lt;br/&gt;laws describe symmetries occuring in the nature. The symmetry of an object can be &lt;br/&gt;measured by the group corresponding to the object. Groups can be difined either as &lt;br/&gt;groups of symmetries or abstractly by an algorithmic description (generators and&lt;br/&gt;relations). In the second approach, the investigators choose some basic symmetries&lt;br/&gt;(generators) so that all other symmetries are compositions (words) of the basic ones,&lt;br/&gt;and describe certain relations between the basic symmetries such that all other&lt;br/&gt;relations follow from the chosen ones. The geometry of groups given by such&lt;br/&gt;presentations is described in terms of certain asymptotic invariants. The invariants&lt;br/&gt;have been known since the pioneering works of M.Dehn at the beginning of the 20th&lt;br/&gt;century, but the investigators discovered deep relationship between these invariants&lt;br/&gt;and algorithmic problems. The investigators are developing their geometric method&lt;br/&gt;solving old mathematical problems of algorithmic nature and corresponding algebraic&lt;br/&gt;problems about groups.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Group theory is a powerful way of studying geometrical objects through their symmetries, which naturally form a group. Various physical systems, such as crystals or the hydrogen atom, can be analyzed through symmetry groups. Thus, group theory has many applications in physics and chemistry, ranging from the standard model of subatomic particles to cryptography.  Asymptotic invariants of a group estimate the global behavior and the shape of the group as a geometric object. They are also responsible for the complexity of computations in groups. If we know such invariants then we are able to estimate the computational complexity of the main algorithmic problem for groups, so-called word problem.   To explore the complexity of computations in groups we investigate the finite presentations of groups in terms of generators and relations. For example, the discrete group of translations of Euclidean space is generated by three basic translations along the orthogonal axes. If one denote these translations by a, b, and c, then the ''defining relations'' of the group are the commutativity relations ab=ba, ac=ca, and bc=cb, that is., all other relations,e.g. abca=caab follow from the three defining ones.  Of course, this particular example is very simple, and it is easy to decide if two given words in the alphabet {a,b,c} represent the same transformation in the group, i.e , this group has very easy word problem. But  In general, the word problem is much harder. The main difficulty is to compute or to estimate the number f(n) of applications of defining relations one needs (or the volume of the memory a machine needs)  to obtain arbitrary relation of given length n. We have detected groups for which this function f(n) (so-called Dehn function) has extremely broad range between a quadratic function and huge, non-computable functions. Moreover we proved that in this result,one cannot replace ''quadratic'' by ''subquadratic'', i.e. the statement is not improvable.  On the other hand, we discovered that if there is any algorithm solving the word problem in a group G with some space complexity f(n), then the same space (up to equivalence) is sufficient for the work of a primitive algorithm based on defining relations of a bigger finitely presented group.  Among the other results obtaining during the last year, we would like to distinguish the absolutely new class of residually finite groups. (One can use finite groups to solve algorithmic problems in residually finite groups.) Answering a long-standing question,we proved (with Kharlampovich and Myasnikov) that the complexity of the word problem in residually finite groups can be arbitrary high.  Thus the main outcome of our NSF-funded research for the period 06/01/12- 05/31/13 is the finding of applications of  asymptotic invariants of groups to the problems in the theory of computational complexity.   However the main tools of our research were geometrical. In particular, we used the techniques of Van Kampen diagrams developed earlier by our predecessors and by ourselves. In contrast to the classical Cartesian approach, where algebra is applied to geometry, we use geometric method to analyze algebraic relations.
