<AbstractNarration>This project is awarding scholarships to academically talented and financially needy students in the university?s Master of Science in Software Engineering program. The Master of Science program is the only one of its kind in Wisconsin and fills a regional need for professionals with advanced degrees in software engineering. There are two curricular paths for students in the program. The first path is a standard two-year graduate degree for students who have previously completed a Bachelor?s degree. The second path is a fast-track program for students to complete both an undergraduate and graduate program within five years. The scholarships are supporting students in both tracks. Women and students from underrepresented groups are being especially targeted for support. The students are participating in mentoring activities with faculty as part of their graduate program. Alumni and industry leaders in the region are also serving as role models to the students in the program, providing seminars and employment opportunities.</AbstractNarration>
