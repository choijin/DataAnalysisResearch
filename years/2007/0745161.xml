<AbstractNarration>This CAREER project addresses issues related to decision making under uncertainty for climate change. Specifically, the overall objective is to apply science to science policy, to improve the analysis and evaluation of alternate portfolios of technology R&amp;D programs in response to climate change. The specific research objectives are: (1) Investigate the optimal technology R&amp;D portfolio in the face of uncertain climate change, using data derived from prior expert elicitations, and using a multiple model approach; and (2) Provide a vehicle for communication to policy makers and the public, through the design and testing of a decision support system (DSS) aimed at the evaluation of technology R&amp;D portfolios in response to climate change. The specific teaching objectives are: (1) Provide a forum for informal education, putting the DSS on the web next to a carbon footprint calculator, introducing the public to key concepts in climate change, energy technologies, and uncertainty; (2) Prepare case studies appropriate for operations research students at both the graduate and undergraduate level; (3) Provide decision support, including training and information on decision making under uncertainty, to policy makers and stakeholders through the decision tool.</AbstractNarration>
