<AbstractNarration>EAPSI 2007&lt;br/&gt;This award will support a U.S. graduate student to conduct summer research in East Asia and/or the Pacific Rim. The research project will provide the student with a first hand research experience, an introduction to science and science policy infrastructure, and an orientation to the culture and language of the location. The primary goals of the East Asia Pacific Summer Institute program are to expose students to science and engineering in the context of a research setting, and to initiate early-career professional relationships that foster future research collaborations with foreign counterparts.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
