<AbstractNarration>The rise of the Tibetan plateau has profoundly changed the Earth's atmospheric circulation and climate.  For this reason, it has been the prime site to understand the link between tectonics and climate change as well as the processes of continental collision.  There are several competing hypotheses for the rise of the Tibetan plateau: a rapid and broad increase in the elevation of the plateau, an expansion of the plateau by continuous viscous flow of lower crust, or an expansion of the plateau by sequential and localized shear between coherent crust and mantle blocks.   At the center of the competing scenarios is the question whether the plateau has grown upward en masse or outward over time.  The best place to address this question is the northeast Tibetan plateau, where the plateau is at a nascent stage with features and dynamic processes in the crust and shallow mantle that are keys to the understanding of the mechanisms that may have operated for the entire Tibetan plateau.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This collaborative project between U.S. and Chinese institutions acquires seismic data from the northeast Tibetan plateau.  The research includes detailed studies to image the crust and mantle structures in the region, to test the current hypotheses against seismic observations, and to develop new models that integrate seismic observations and other geological constraints.  The research also includes focused studies to analyze regional earthquake activity, which helps to mitigate earthquake hazards in one of the seismically most active areas in the interior of a continental plate.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Tibetan plateau has been the prime site to understand the processes of continental collision, mountain building, and the interaction between tectonics and climate change. Most previous geologic and geophysical studies of the Tibetan crust and mantle structure focused on southern and central Tibet with the primary objectives of understanding the continental collision process, the intrusion of the crustal and mantle material from the Indian plate into the Eurasian plate. To understand the rise and growth of the plateau, we must also understand the geology and dynamic processes at other boundaries of the plateau that control the "escape" of the excess crust and mantle material from the plateau. In this project, we deployed 38 broadband seismic stations in the eastern Tibetan plateau between July 2008 and July 2010.  Analyses of the data show that the stepwise-rise model of Tapponnier et al. (2001), in which the Asian lithosphere subducts to the south in stages, is inconsistent with the observation.  The seismic velocity models show the mid-crust low-velocity zone beneath the Qiangtang and Songpan-Ganze terrans terminates in the vicinity of the north Kunlun thrust fault, an observation that requires significant modification of the viscous-flow model of Clark and Royden (2000), in which the plateau grows by flow in the mid- and lower-crust.  A significant low velocity anomaly of up to -3% is observed in the upper mantle beneath the restraining bend of the eastern Kunlun fault.  This anomaly is interpreted as asthenosphere upwelling resulted from localized detachment of a thickened lithosphere root due to compression at the bend of the fault.      The project supported two graduate students in their thesis research.  It provided training in field seismic work and high-performance computation to several graduate students and postdoctoral researchers.  It strengthened collaboration between the University of Rhode Island (URI), China University of Geosciences Beijing (CUGB), and Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences.  URI hosted a visiting scientist from CUGB sponsored by the China Scholarship Council in 2011-2012.             Last Modified: 08/27/2013       Submitted by: Yang Shen]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
