<AbstractNarration>This project is designed to implement Phase 2 of the ITEST Learning Resource Center at  Education Development Center, Inc. Phase 2 emphasizes technical assistance for ITEST projects and building a national dissemination strategy. EDC provides ITEST projects with a comprehensive collection of Technical Assistance tools, resources, and services designed to support and strengthen the ITEST community by developing an understanding of projects' strengths and needs, addressing areas of highest impact, linking projects to existing resources, and building on the contributions of formal and informal learning environments. Technical Assistance deliverables include annual PI Summits, an ITEST web forum, publications, and a variety of informative online events (panel discussions, peer exchanges, webcasts, discussion lists). Individualized technical assistance for new and returning PIs, increased communication with resource centers for related NSF programs, and a more robust dissemination plan are also new features.  Finally, ongoing project monitoring continues and contributes to the repository of data on ITEST projects including project models, evaluation plans, impacts, communities served, and participants.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The ITEST (Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers) program was established by the NSF in 2003 to address the looming shortage of technology workers in the United States.  Specifically ITEST:   Produces research findings that build knowledge about approaches, models, and interventions with youth and educators that are most likely to increase the nationÆs capacity and innovation in the STEM workforce of the future; Develops, implements, studies and evaluates strategies that encourage youth to develop interest in and to be prepared for careers in the STEM workforce of the future; and  Equips teachers with the resources to ensure that their students consider choosing and are prepared to enter the STEM workforce of the future.    The ITEST Learning Resource Center (LRC) at EDC was established in 2003 to support achievement of the above stated ITEST program goals through:  Increased knowledge and capacity among ITEST PIs and their teams to design, evaluate and refine their work to achieve individual project goals Synthesis, analysis and documentation of the collective experience and results of ITEST projects; and  Dissemination of the knowledge created in the ITEST program to inform the field of STEM workforce development.   The ITEST community includes 193 projects across 42 states helping teachers and students build the skills needed to succeed in a science and technology-driven world. Since 2003 ITEST has impacted 223,800 K-12 students, 8,000 educators and 3,000 parents/care givers.  Combining the best of formal and informal learning, teachers create authentic STEM learning experiences that integrate IT concepts, skills, and applications into their classrooms. Teachers work with students to pursue research questions and deepen their scientific and technical knowledge. Using the same technologies, tools, and methods that scientists use on the job, young people ages 5-18 explore their environment, conduct research, build programmable machines, and create media in school and in community settings after school and during the summer.   Examples of ITEST Results:   ITEST Photonics Leaders II:  83% of students identified STEM-related careers to pursue after college. ITEST GreenFab:  Students outperformed their non-participating counterparts on a statewide Regents exam.  ITEST BuildIT:  Girls using the WaterBotics underwater robotics curriculum demonstrated increased interest in and enjoyment of science.   In addition to serving well ITEST projects and the NSF (see Summative Evaluation Findings below), since its inception, the ITEST Learning Resource Center at EDC became an available resource for national, state and local education departments seeking to strengthen STEM Education.  The LRC offered the models, lessons learned, and expertise gained from nine years of STEM education work with:   Strategies projects that have designed, implemented, and evaluated models that engage youth, educators, family, and other community members in STEM-rich, contextual learning experiences;  Scale-Up projects that are expanding proven STEM practices to engage larger populations of learners;  Research projects that have enriched our understanding of how to enlarge the countryÆs STEM workforce; and  Conferences and workshops that have contributed to the development of a research agenda on K-12 STEM career and workforce education issues.   Since 2008 the LRC created/supported 5 annual PI meetings, 10 topical interest groups, more than 50 one-on-one technical assistance events, 20 conference presentations, 80 products/publications and a website with regularly updated content and interactive space for ITEST grantees to encourage exchange among projects.   The LRCÆs Summative Evaluation by MPR Associates stated that the "existence and quality of the ITEST Community of Practice was the greatest contribution of the ITEST Learning Resource Center. &hellip; ITEST grantees regularly responded in our surveys and interviews that interacting wi...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
