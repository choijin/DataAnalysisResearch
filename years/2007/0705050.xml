<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0705050&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Anatoly S. Libgober&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project deals with the study of topological invariants for&lt;br/&gt;singular algebraic varieties with many ideas motivated by&lt;br/&gt;physics.  One of its goals is to develop new invariants for&lt;br/&gt;singular spaces extending the theory of elliptic genus of&lt;br/&gt;varieties with mild singularities and orbifolds which was&lt;br/&gt;presented in joint works with Lev Borisov earlier.  This will&lt;br/&gt;yields an extension of the previous contributions by many authors&lt;br/&gt;on vertex operator algebras associated to manifolds or orbifolds&lt;br/&gt;and application of these invariants to geometric problems. PI&lt;br/&gt;plans to develop further generalizations of elliptic genus&lt;br/&gt;detecting the torsion in the cobordisms of special unitary&lt;br/&gt;complex manifolds as well as use this invariant in classification&lt;br/&gt;and surgery problems of singular spaces. The principal&lt;br/&gt;investigator will investigate the possibility that the elliptic&lt;br/&gt;genus plays a role in singularity theory beyond classical&lt;br/&gt;applications in Landau-Ginzburg models associated with weighted&lt;br/&gt;homogeneous polynomials. In particular it is planned to consider&lt;br/&gt;the extensions of elliptic genus of Landau-Ginzburg models in&lt;br/&gt;connection with the Arnold-Steenbrink spectrum of isolated&lt;br/&gt;singularities. In another direction, PI plans to study the&lt;br/&gt;homotopy groups of non-simply connected quasiprojective&lt;br/&gt;varieties. In particular the study of characteristic varieties&lt;br/&gt;associated with homotopy groups controlling among other things&lt;br/&gt;the cohomology of local systems will be continued.  A.Libgober&lt;br/&gt;will focus on properties of the Hodge decomposition of the latter&lt;br/&gt;and will study the fundamental problem of realization of these&lt;br/&gt;invariants, i.e. the existence of quasiprojectve varieties with&lt;br/&gt;given characteristic varieties.  As part of this work, PI will&lt;br/&gt;investigate the restrictions on the dimensions of characteristic&lt;br/&gt;varieties in the case of plane reducible curves generalizing&lt;br/&gt;results in the case of arrangements of lines in complex&lt;br/&gt;projective plane.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In general terms the proposal aims to develop new approaches to&lt;br/&gt;the study of geometry of spaces appearing in a variety of&lt;br/&gt;problems in mathematics and such aspects of theoretical physics&lt;br/&gt;as string theory. A new type of data, called elliptic genus,&lt;br/&gt;reflecting geometry and topology of these spaces which appeared&lt;br/&gt;naturally in physics will be investigated from a mathematical&lt;br/&gt;perspective and applied to a wide range of problems in geometry,&lt;br/&gt;topology and singularity theory.  It is planned to study further&lt;br/&gt;generalizations of elliptic genus which should have applications&lt;br/&gt;to fundamental problems of physics.  The realization of presence&lt;br/&gt;of infinite dimensional aspects in geometric issues, on which our&lt;br/&gt;work depends in an essential way, is a novel feature which&lt;br/&gt;emerged in the last 20 years in mathematics and physics. It is&lt;br/&gt;planned to widely disseminate such new viewpoints gaining&lt;br/&gt;strength in contemporary mathematics and physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
