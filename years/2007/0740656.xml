    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop and test a novel system for providing patients in physical and occupational therapy customized visual and aural feedback as a rehabilitation tool. The proposed 'augmented feedback' system will allow therapists to supplement their own verbalized feedback with visual and aural feedback concerning the subtle nature of a movement that is difficult to perceive. As the system uses commonplace computers and displays with either video cameras or webcams, it will be easy to use and its cost will be low making it suitable for widespread use in clinics or in patients' homes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The number of people who see physical therapists is estimated to be 15 million people, is expected to grow as baby boomers age and as technology advances save the lives of a larger proportion of trauma victims and newborns with birth defects. Additionally, recent advances in basic and clinical neuroscience have brought exercise to the forefront as a physiological tool to promote overall 'brain health' and 'behavioral recovery' from neurological impairments due to stroke or Parkinson disease. It is expected that these growing demands and scientific advances will provide even greater utilization of rehabilitation and wellness programs in the future. While computers and modern technology have been used to advantage in research settings, they are rarely used in clinical settings or home settings due to complexity, cost, or limited flexibility. The simplicity, low cost, and adaptability of the proposed technology to a variety of exercises will make it an ideal learning tool for a wide audience and put it within the financial and technical reach of clinics, private health and fitness practitioners, patients, and healthy seniors.</AbstractNarration>
