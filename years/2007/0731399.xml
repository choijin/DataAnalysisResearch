<AbstractNarration>Cedar Point Biological Station is located in the North Platte River valley, Nebraska, with excellent access to a variety of ecosystems and habitats. Cedar Point provides research opportunities for faculty, undergraduate and graduate students as well as a curriculum of advanced course work in field biology, with an established, strong educational program and outstanding record of research productivity. In order to be able to continue and expand its research and educational programs, existing antiquated bath/toilet facilities need to be replaced and additional housing for undergraduate research assistants needs to be provided. The funds awarded will be used to build new wash house facilities and convert the existing wash houses to provide additional undergraduate researcher housing. These renovations address the two most immediate facilities needs identified in a strategic plan for Cedar Point Biological Station. The renovated wash houses and increased housing capacity will improve Cedar Point?s ability to attract and support a variety of programs that make field biology more accessible to the general public, including programs for public school students, workshops for K-12 teachers, and meetings and programs for groups such as the Natural Resources Conservation Service, Audubon Society and Nature Conservancy.</AbstractNarration>
