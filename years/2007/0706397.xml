<AbstractNarration>INTELLECTUAL MERIT:  Living organisms use biomacromolecules to pattern inorganic materials into exquisite structures with nanoscale precision and specific physical function.  The research proposed here utilizes biomolecules and bio-inspiration to develop and integrate novel bio-fabrication processes using genetic engineering tools for building functional multi-component nanostructures.  This collaborative partnership between Duke University and the University of Washington aims to fabricate complex, plasmonically functional inorganic nanostructures using protein-directed immobilization on self-assembled 3D DNA templates.  The study makes use of addressable DNA tile lattices, genetically selected and engineered peptides for nucleating and directed immobilization of specific inorganic materials, and DNA binding proteins (DBPs) to bridge between the two.  Genetically engineered peptides for inorganics (GEPIs) are selected in vivo for their ability specifically to synthesize and/or immobilize nanoparticles of metals, semiconductors, and oxides from electrolyte solutions.  These peptides will be fused genetically with DBPs designed to attach to the DNA tile lattice at specifically addressed binding sites.  Once arrayed on the lattice the GEPIs will serve to precipitate desired inorganic materials under mild conditions at precise locations to produce functional nanostructures with interesting plasmatic properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACTS:   The proposed work will develop new bio-fabrication techniques to create a wide variety of nanophotonic, nanoelectronic, and nanomagnetic devices with high information density.  The fabrication of biomedical devices is an obvious objective, but much broader applications can also be envisaged.  The Duke team will offer summer lab positions to talented high school students from the North Carolina School of Science and Math.  They will also mentor students from the American Chemical Society's Project SEED (Summer Educational Experience for the Disadvantaged).  The Duke PI and Co-PI lead the Duke Nanoscience Seminar Series that disseminates nanoscience research across the campus.  The University of Washington group participates in eight outreach programs on the Washington campus.  These include a summer REU program, an academic year undergraduate research experience program for Native American students, and an NSF-NEU program for curriculum development for undergrads that includes a hands-on scanning probe microscopy lab.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
