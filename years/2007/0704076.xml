<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY: &lt;br/&gt; The goals of this project are to produce and characterize for the first time prototypes of two distinct classes of mechanically linked macromolecular structures:&lt;br/&gt;1. supramolecular block copolymers in which the linkage between the blocks consists of pseudorotaxane or rotaxane units&lt;br/&gt;2. polymeric catenanes in which the integrity of the polymer is due to mechanical linkages between adjacent cyclic units, i. e., true "polymer chains".&lt;br/&gt;To achieve these aims aspects of modern polymer chemistry will be combined with recent advances in supramolecular chemistry. A combination of anionic, atom transfer radical and nitroxide-controlled free radical polymerizations will be employed to prepare well-defined macromolecules with terminal host and guest functionalities; these will then be self-assembled into a variety of non-covalent block copolymers and in some cases  compared to covalent analogs.  The pseudorotaxane structures will be "locked-in" by conversion to rotaxanes through covalent attachment of stoppers. These well-defined new systems are expected to provide unique, reversible control of structure, morphology, rheology and mechanical behavior by response to external stimuli, such as heat, shear, pH, light and solvents. A novel approach to polymeric catenanes or polycatenanes, true polymer "chains", in which each cyclic repeat unit is connected to its neighbors only by mechanical linkages, is expected to produce uniquely flexible macromolecules with a built-in capacity for externally stimulated responses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt; Traditional covalent block copolymers provide multiphase materials with high performance parameters such as appearance, strength, flexibility, barrier properties, retention of shape, etc. for materials used in everyday life, e. g., in adhesives, packaging films, rubbers and impact resistant plastics. The unique mechanically linked supramolecular block copolymers prepared in this effort will provide an entirely new class of such materials, and potentially will greatly improve their processability, recyclability and range of applications, e. g., synthetic muscles, gene and drug delivery, due to sensitive responses to external stimuli. The entirely new class of chain-like materials, the polycatenanes, are expected to exhibit unique mechanical properties, e. g., superb flexibility, again combined with sensitive responses to external stimuli, making them of interest in sensors and actuators, among other applications. The PI is actively associated with graduate and REU programs that successfully seek under-represented minorities and women students. This effort provides research-education opportunities for students in terms of both supramolecular and polymer sciences so that they will acquire a creative, interdisciplinary problem-solving approach, enabling them in their future careers to design, synthesize and implement enabling materials for practical applications such as in the bio- and nano-technology and energy fields.     &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Polymers or macromolecules are involved in every aspect of every day life, from the natural proteins and polynucleotides that make up our very cells to the synthetic materials that perform a myriad of duties in practical applications as structural elements in aircraft and automobiles to rubbers for tires, adhesives, paints and containers, such as milk bottles, to cite just a few.   Chemists are constantly striving to inculcate synthetic polymers with the marvelous range of responses and functions that natural polymers display in complex living systems.  This requires invention of ever more precise synthetic methods and increased understanding of interactions among the molecular components.    The research done in this project was directed at designing improved interactions that allow highly specific and efficient self-assembly processes to take place.  The overall objective is to make new polymeric materials that respond to external stimuli, such as mechanical stress, heat, light, solvent, acidity, etc., in a well controlled manner, displaying a distinct change in physical properties, such as mechanical strength, viscosity, hardness, color, etc.    Specifically these efforts were primarily focused on mechanical linkages involving linear molecules threaded through cyclic ones, so called pseudorotaxanes and rotaxanes.  The project produced some of the best known species for forming such systems.  The work also investigated various ways to incorporate these building blocks into polymeric molecules, so that they would display the desired self-assembly processes, and it was successfully demonstrated that the self-assembly processes did indeed produce pseudorotaxane linkages in a controlled manner, for example to produce AB block copolymers from an A polymer and a B polymer.              The detailed technical results from this project have been reported in 30 publications to date, with several more forthcoming in the next few months. The work was also described in 18 invited lectures and 40 contributed lectures at national and international conferences.              A key element of the project is the support it provided in part for the education and development of highly skilled young people for our ever-advancing technical work force.  Nine (9) undergraduates, four of them females, were engaged in learning organic and polymer chemistry in the laboratory.  It also contributed to the training of graduate students as professional chemists. Two have already received PhD degrees and are employed in the chemical industry and one received an MS degree.  Four others are expected to receive PhD degrees within the next year or so, as a result of partial support from this grant and their technical contributions to the results summarized above.
