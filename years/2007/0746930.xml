<AbstractNarration>Today's world requires that we participate in, comprehend, or otherwise navigate many kinds of networks, including social networks, communication networks, financial transaction networks, gene regulatory networks, disease transmission networks, ecological food networks, sensor networks and more. Observational data on such networks is plentiful, but extracting the relevant data is challenging. Furthermore, this data often has errors, is incomplete and fragmented, or otherwise does not offer a concise and big-picture view of the network that we want to understand and use. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project will develop methods for inferring and representing the essential, underlying network structure that best accounts for observed entities and interactions between these entities. In particular, the proposal introduces a process abstraction called ?graph identification,? which is composed of more basic processes for identifying observed entities that are equivalent, identifying links (i.e., relationships) between entities from observed interactions, and simultaneously classifying many entities into classes based on their interconnection structure. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A computational challenge of this project is integrating these basic processes, each of which has been studied by the PI and others, to achieve accurate solutions to the overall graph identification problem, in a manner that is efficient and scalable. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research has broader impacts for basic science, national security and a better understanding of privacy issues in today's networked society.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We are being deluged with data.  However, in order make sense of data, and gain the greatest possible benefit from the data, we need methods which are able to tease out and make inferences about the real world entities and relationships which gave rise to the data.   The research in this project was the first to view this problem as a complex statistical inference problem, which we refer to as graph identification.  We developed new computational techniques that were able to perform graph identification at scale, and showed its applicability across a wide range of domains.  An extremely important component of the problem is entity resolution, the problem of determining when two nodes are referring to the same real-world entity. We defined and developed new algorithms and theory for relational entity resolution.  We also developed novel techniques for determining which nodes or edges in the graph are most useful for obtaining additional information.   Graph identification has several important broader impacts including: 1) proper graph identification is required in order to make the correct conclusions from data; 2) graph identification has important privacy implications &ndash; in particular, we showed that understanding the ease at which graph identification can be performed on leading social networking sites is an important concern, and 3) education of a diverse collection of students, at all stages of their careers.  This project resulted in over 20 publications, 1 book, 4 thesis, 6 tutorials, and over 25 invited talks and lectures.
