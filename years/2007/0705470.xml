<AbstractNarration>Wets&lt;br/&gt;0705470&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The investigator studies two classes of issues related to&lt;br/&gt;stochastic optimization problems -- decision-making under&lt;br/&gt;uncertainty.  Both come with nontrivial modeling, theoretical,&lt;br/&gt;and computational challenges.  The first part of the project&lt;br/&gt;deals with an extension of the stochastic programming and&lt;br/&gt;variational analysis methodology to deal with a large class of&lt;br/&gt;variational problems in a stochastic environment, which could be&lt;br/&gt;called stochastic equilibrium problems.  They include variational&lt;br/&gt;inequalities, cooperative and noncooperative games, Walras-type&lt;br/&gt;equilibria, solving inclusions, and fixed point problems, when&lt;br/&gt;some of the components of the problem are stochastic.  The goal&lt;br/&gt;here is to develop a theory that leads to implementable numerical&lt;br/&gt;procedures.  The second part of the project deals with making the&lt;br/&gt;methodology of stochastic programming more accessible to a wider&lt;br/&gt;range of users, namely with the design of procedures that allow&lt;br/&gt;the user to describe the uncertainty when only (very) limited&lt;br/&gt;data are available about the random parameters.  This is&lt;br/&gt;particularly critical when the uncertainty is to be revealed over&lt;br/&gt;time (or space) and the decision maker can use this information&lt;br/&gt;to select recourse (adjusting) decisions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Almost all important decision-making problems, except&lt;br/&gt;possibly a few that are purely technical in nature, involve some&lt;br/&gt;level of uncertainty about some of the parameters or components&lt;br/&gt;of the problem.  For example,&lt;br/&gt; (a) setting monetary or economic policy requires taking into&lt;br/&gt; account uncertainty in the economic and financial markets,&lt;br/&gt; (b) selecting a master scheduling plan in manufacturing requires&lt;br/&gt; taking into account uncertainty in the market's response,&lt;br/&gt; (c) the choice of an environmental protection plan needs to&lt;br/&gt; balance changing atmospheric conditions with sociological and&lt;br/&gt; economic impacts, all involving various uncertainties,&lt;br/&gt; (d) policies issues related to energy supply require taking&lt;br/&gt; into account world market price vagaries as well as potential&lt;br/&gt; technological innovations,&lt;br/&gt;and so on.  Deterministic models for such problems, even when&lt;br/&gt;including scenario "analysis," lead to so-called optimal&lt;br/&gt;decisions that almost never are robust, sometimes are even&lt;br/&gt;seriously misleading.  So it is crucial to take uncertainty into&lt;br/&gt;account when setting up either optimization or equilibrium&lt;br/&gt;models.  Using tools of variational analysis, algorithmic&lt;br/&gt;procedures developed for solving (nonconvex, finite-dimensional)&lt;br/&gt;variational inequalities, and approximation schemes for&lt;br/&gt;stochastic optimization problems, the investigator develops&lt;br/&gt;theoretical results and computational tools to solve such&lt;br/&gt;fundamental problems and to improve the modeling of the&lt;br/&gt;uncertainty components.  An important issue, both for stochastic&lt;br/&gt;optimization and for equilibrium problems in a stochastic&lt;br/&gt;environment, is the modeling of the uncertainty.  In practical&lt;br/&gt;situations, sufficient data are not always available to justify&lt;br/&gt;the use of classical statistical methods.  The investigator&lt;br/&gt;studies "lack of data" issues, examining techniques that allow&lt;br/&gt;the user to incorporate other information in the estimation of&lt;br/&gt;the distribution of the unknown parameters. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
