<AbstractNarration>This proposal aims to advance substantially the field of colloids in liquid crystals through the study of magnetic inclusions in nematic liquid crystals. While most previous research on colloids in nematics has focused on spheres, the proposed experiments will elucidate the behavior of aspherical particles. The additional degrees of freedom associated with the orientation of an aspherical particle can lead to new forms of nematic-mediated interactions with interesting and potentially useful consequences. Through precision measurements employing high-speed video microscopy and time-resolved external magnetic fields, the static and dynamic properties of such suspended particles and the surrounding liquid crystal matrix will be elucidated. The proposed experiments will address five specific areas: (1) the orientation-dependent energy of isolated cylinders with homeotropic anchoring; (2) pair interactions between such cylinders; (3) the dynamics of suspended cylinders and spheres; (4) the behavior of disk-shaped inclusions; and (5) the deformations of soft colloids. This project, which combines themes in liquid crystal physics, magnetism, and nanofabrication, will be a joint effort between two investigators with the complementary expertise needed to address these problems and with a strong track record of collaboration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: By investigating in detail the mechanical coupling of magnetic particles to&lt;br/&gt;nematic order and by exploring new particle geometries, this work will have potentially significant impact on both the research on and the technology based on liquid crystal&lt;br/&gt;nanocomposite materials. The broader impacts of the project will also include research training and education for graduate and undergraduate students in physics. To help promote the participation of women in science, female high school students will be recruited through the&lt;br/&gt;Women in Science and Engineering (WISE) Program, a Johns Hopkins University outreach initiative, to participate in the research.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Nematic liquid crystals are fluids composed of rod-shaped molecules in which the molecules prefer to orient along a common direction.  When a particle is suspended in a nematic, it can disrupt this ordering, leading to unique forces on the particle that can have striking and unexpected consequences.  Investigation of these effects provides both unique perspectives into the fundamental science of these technologically important fluids as well as new avenues for applications, for example in the spontaneous assembly of nanometer-scale and micrometer-scale structures.  This grant has provided funding for experimental studies into the behavior of aspherical particles suspended in nematic fluids.  This Project Outcomes Report focuses on two major components of the research:   Manipulation and Organization of Nanowires.    In our experiments, we have demonstrated that particles suspended in nematic fluids in which the orientational ordering of the molecules varies spatially will be driven spontaneously to those regions where the disruption in the ordering that the particles introduce is minimized.  We have further shown how this phenomenon can be exploited to manipulate and organize nanometer-scale particles into predetermined configurations.  As an example, Image 1 displays microscopy photos in which small magnetic wires (circled in red for clarity) have assembled themselves within a nematic whose molecular ordering is patterned into stripes.  The precision with which the particles are positioned in such experiments indicates the promise of this technique for genuinely nanometer-scale technology.  In another potential direction for application, recent studies have shown that the local orientation of the nematic molecules can be extremely sensitive to chemical or biochemical changes at a nearby surface, such as the binding of a protein.  Hence, the strategies we have developed for magnetic nanowire manipulation could be applied to drive wires preferentially to sites of chemical and biochemical activity, thus providing a new method for sensing such activity and coupling to it magnetically.   Viscous Drag in a Nematic Fluid.  When an object is pulled through a fluid, if feels a drag that opposes the motion.  In a nematic liquid crystal, the anisotropy created by the molecular ordering can fundamentally alter the nature of the drag that the fluid imposes.  One particularly intriguing case concerns the drag on a particle in a nematic when the pulling force is at an oblique angle to the nematicÆs ordering direction.  For such conditions, theoretical calculations have predicted that the force from the nematic will not strictly oppose the pulling force, but will have a perpendicular component that causes the object to move at an angle to the force.  Using magnetic nanowires suspended in nematics, we have demonstrated experimentally the existence of this "nematic lift" force, as illustrated in Image 2.  We have further shown how the magnitude of this lift is sensitive to manner in which the liquid crystal molecules orient at the particle surface, which in turn depends on the surface chemistry.  This sensitivity could thus form the basis for a new approach for sorting nanometer- and micrometer-scale particles based on their surface properties.   In addition to the potential technological applications described above, another broader impact of the activities pursued under this grant has been the exposure to scientific research that they have provided to high school students.  For example, Dan Borgnia, a student in Baltimore public schoolÆs Ingenuity Project, participated in experiments to investigate the behavior of disk-shaped particles in nematics.  Dan submitted a report based on his work to the 2010 Intel Science Competition, for which he was recognized as an Intel National Semifinalist.
