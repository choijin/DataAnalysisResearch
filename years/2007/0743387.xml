<AbstractNarration>Wetlands have long been recognized as significant habitats where organic matter and other materials are stored and transformed.  While their quantitative importance is well-established, it is less clear why certain wetlands carry out these functions to a greater degree than others.  This research will test the idea that the actual location and configuration of patches of vegetation within tidal wetlands influences the extent of alteration in water quality.  In the simplest case, patches closest to the actual point where water exchanges between the wetlands and the mainstem Hudson River should have the greatest effect on concentrations of dissolved oxygen and nutrients.  In contrast, patches at higher elevation are less frequently inundated by tides and therefore should have less influence.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wetlands are rigorously protected by law and frequently the target of restoration efforts to improve the services they provide to wildlife, water quality and human society.  Prioritization of protection efforts and design of restoration plans presupposes a solid knowledge of what factors control how well these ecosystems perform these functions.  This research addresses such controls and will directly involve teachers and employees of resource management agencies in both field work and data analysis.  This real-world experience should improve the ability of teachers to prepare lessons illustrating ecological principles and give managers a firm rationale for protecting these valuable ecosystems.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     Tidal freshwater wetlands of the Hudson River carry out several important ecological functions including nursery areas for small fishes and contributing to improved water quality.  We examined the capability of these wetlands to remove nitrate as tidal waters enter and exit a range of wetlands.  Nitrate is often the most common form of fixed nitrogen in water and soil and may cause water quality problems where overabundant.  While all wetlands showed some ability to reduce nitrate concentrations during tidal exchange it was obvious some were far more effective than others.  It turns out that the prevalence of certain kinds of vegetation, the common cattail for example, were associated with greater nitrate removal and so tidal marshes with more of these plants were more effective at nitrate removal.  These plants typically occur on the higher parts of the marsh surface and our findings raise the question of whether these plants can persist as se-level rises.      We have communicated our results to the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation who are responsible for managing natural resources so they can include this information in future policy decisions.  Knowing which of the ecosystem values of wetlands may be at risk in the future will enable proactive management.      Part of the field work for this research was carried out by public school teachers who collected water samples associated with different parts of the marsh.  They found that water draining small creeks deep within the marsh had the lowest levels of nitrate, helping us understand how these wetlands were working.  These teachers have  prepared lesson plans derived from their research experience thus helping students appreciate what human benefits are provided by marshes.
