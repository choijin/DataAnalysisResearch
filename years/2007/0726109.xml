<AbstractNarration>Funds provided by the U.S. Army Research Laboratory will fund a project, "Algorithms and Software/Hardware Infrastructure for Distributed Miniature Robots", at the University of Minnesota research site of the Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) for Safety Security and Rescue.  The project pursues research into a hardware/software infrastructure to improve robotic response capabilities in the case of robot teams.  The project builds on the current scout robot research and proposes some innovative robot designs that depart from the shape and functionality constraints of the initial platform.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
