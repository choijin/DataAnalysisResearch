<AbstractNarration>Biological Sciences (61)&lt;br/&gt;This project is developing frameworks for reasoning that organize standard content around basic biologically significant scientific principles by designing: a) respiration, photosynthesis, and genetics related computer-gradable homework questions as teaching/assessment items and b) sequences of questions for use in lecture with personal response systems (clickers).  These items can be used as formative assessment tools to determine students ability to integrate specific biological content (facts) into key concepts (TIME items), Tracing (keeping track of) Information, Matter, and Energy. The TIME items are being introduced into a spectrum of courses: a genetics course at Lansing Community College, and introductory biology courses and a higher level genetics course at Michigan State University.  The efficacy of the TIME items for teaching are being evaluated by: a) following student performance on questions designed to measure principled reasoning and b) determining the validity of the items as assessment tools by interviewing students as they work items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The intellectual merit of this project arises from its grounding in learning theory, its basis in extensive research on students' thinking, and the wide applicability of its approach. The research being done includes both qualitative and quantitative analyses that provide others a basis by which to evaluate this approach and replicate it as appropriate. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The project has a potential for broad applicability because it is being developed and tested in a continuum of courses and at two very different institutions.  Members of the biology education community are beginning to use these frameworks for reasoning in their assessment work in classes as varied as genetics (to interpret student responses to questions in a genetics concept inventory), cellular respiration and photosynthesis, and faculty workshops in ecology (the associated diagnostic question clusters), and generally to enhance development and analysis of efforts for STEM course reform (the frameworks for reasoning and summative assessment items).&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
