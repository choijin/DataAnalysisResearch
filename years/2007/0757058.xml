<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;LIGO Continuing Operations&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The LIGO Laboratory will continue operation of the LIGO observatories at Hanford, Washington and Livingston, Louisiana and the associated science programs at Caltech and MIT over FY 2009 ? FY 2013. The effort includes:&lt;br/&gt;- The maintenance and operation of the LIGO sites and interferometers,&lt;br/&gt;- Research and development to support advanced interferometer technology and provide potential backup approaches for Advanced LIGO should the need arise,&lt;br/&gt;- Instrument science and the analysis and interpretation of data,&lt;br/&gt;- A visitors program that was previously partially funded by separate grants but which will be incorporated into the proposed program,&lt;br/&gt;- An expanded education outreach program to fully use the LIGO facilities,&lt;br/&gt;- Contributions by the LIGO Laboratory in data management, information technology support, and general support to the LIGO Scientific Collaboration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LIGO is currently operating the three initial LIGO interferometers at the two LIGO observatories in Hanford, Washington and Livingston, Louisiana.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: LIGO fostered the creation and development of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC), which consists of more than 563 researchers from the LIGO Laboratory and from 55 external institutions in the USA and abroad. The creation of the LSC has enabled broad participation in LIGO and promoted the growth and development of experimental gravity research in the USA. There have been new faculty appointments at LSC and other institutions that have made significant and strategic intellectual investments in the emerging field of gravitational-wave astronomy. The LSC will guide gravitational-wave research and define the developing program of improvements in the state of the art.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: The LIGO Laboratory also will build upon its program of education at each of the four laboratory sites, communicating the excitement experienced by LIGO scientists to young people from elementary to graduate levels. Community outreach activities will be extended to include new demonstration and interpretive programs. LIGO collaboration with industry will encourage new technologies and applications stimulated by the extraordinarily precise measurements required for observing gravitational waves.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ NSF's Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) produced two of the most spectacular scientific results of the 21st century, opening a new observational window on the Universe. Gravitational waves emitted during the final instant of the collision of two black holes (figures 1, 2) were detected by LIGO in late 2015, almost exactly 100 years after Einstein predicted them.  This was followed in the summer of 2017 by the first detection of two colliding neutron stars, an event that was subsequently detected by its emissions across the entire electromagnetic (EM) spectrum (ranging from gamma rays to radio waves).   Each of these detections has in their own way revolutionized our understanding of the Cosmos and have ushered in the era of gravitational-wave astrophysics and multi-messenger astronomy. Answers to longstanding fundamental questions about the nature of gravity, black holes, neutron stars, gamma ray bursts, and even the origin of the elements have been uncovered through the observation of these two events.  Additional detections of black hole collisions with LIGO and its partner Virgo in Italy have firmly established gravitational waves as a unique and powerful tool in the astronomical observatory arsenal. NSF's LIGO is significantly advancing our knowledge of the fundamental nature of gravity and has opened an entirely new window into the high-energy, 'dark side' side of the gravitational-wave Universe.    These long-awaited discoveries required instruments capable of measuring changes in distances with incredible precision--comparable to measuring the distance from the earth to the sun to the precision of the diameter of a hydrogen atom--and were the result of a highly successful multi-decade dedicated partnership among the NSF, Caltech, MIT, and the LIGO Scientific Collaboration, a large group of scientists, engineers, and students around the world.  The LIGO detectors employ precision laser interferometry to compare the time-varying changes in distance between pairs of isolated 'test masses' -- mirrors suspended under ultra-vacuum over a 4 km long baseline. By arranging two such baselines at right angles, the changing strains produced by gravitational waves are read out as a fluctuating difference between the arms' lengths.  Several advances in precision interferometry were enabled by this award, enabling the LIGO Hanford and Livingston Observatories to become the most sensitive gravitational wave detectors in the world.  Support from this award enabled the LIGO Open Science Center to provide public access to LIGO data to a broad user community with the aim of making scientific analysis with LIGO data accessible to professional scientists as well as amateur scientists and students with a wide range of backgrounds.   During the award period, the LIGO Laboratory hosted education and public outreach programs that reached more than 140,000 visitors at and around the two observatories at Hanford, WA and Livingston, LA.  The Hanford and Livingston LIGO Observatories utilized dozens of educational partnerships to deepen and extend their outreach program and developed active teacher programs impacting nearly 2500 teachers through professional development workshops.
