<AbstractNarration>Physics (13)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project improves the teaching of quantum mechanics at all levels of the undergraduate curriculum by exposing students to experiments that concretely illustrate some of the most surprising and abstract features of quantum mechanics.  The project develops a set of introductory optics experiments and activity-based curricular materials that provide students with the necessary skills to perform and understand the more advanced quantum mechanics experiments by adapting a series of photon quantum mechanics experiments used at the sophomore and the junior/senior level. Student understanding of quantum interference as well as student attitudes and excitement about quantum mechanics are assessed.</AbstractNarration>
