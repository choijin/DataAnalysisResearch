<AbstractNarration>During the summers of 2009-2011, the Department of Biological Sciences at Marquette University will sponsor a 10-week summer NSF-REU site for eight undergraduates who have completed their sophomore or junior years. This program enables students to carry out independent research projects under the direct supervision of a faculty mentor. Students will choose from a variety of projects using cellular and molecular techniques to address biological questions in a range of organisms. With "hands- on" experience the students will develop a realistic view of scientific research, its pace, its demands, and the thrill of discovery. Essential written and verbal communication skills will be developed through weekly journal clubs, laboratory group meetings, and brown-bag research lunches. Students will present their findings at a poster session and at an undergraduate research symposium during weeks nine and ten, respectively. Workshops on research ethics, graduate school admission, and career options will also be offered. Social activities will be interwoven throughout the program to promote camaraderie amongst faculty, Marquette students, visiting scientists, and the REU participants. Housing, a stipend, and meal and travel allowances are provided. Travel funds will also be available for REU students to present their work at national meetings during the academic year. This program is intended to encourage students to pursue careers in science and research and to foster the participation of members of underrepresented minority groups and students from colleges with limited research opportunities. More information is available at http://biology.marquette.edu/biosummer or by contacting the Program Director, Dr. Gail Waring at gail.waring@marquette.edu.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
