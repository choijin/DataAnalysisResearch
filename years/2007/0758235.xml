<AbstractNarration>-functions play a unifying role in number theory, as they connect many otherwise different problems.  Recently it has become increasingly apparent that L-functions most naturally fit into families, and that many properties of an individual L-function can be studied through the family.  In particular, the study of mean values of L-functions can be used to understand the sizes (such as nonvanishing and subconvexity) of L-functions at special values, which have great arithmetical interest.  Furthermore, there is evidence that some families are connected to other families, a property that has been detected through careful evaluation of certain mean values; for example, Motohashi's celebrated exact formula connecting the fourth moment of the Riemann zeta function to the Hecke-Maass L-functions associated to the full modular group.  The PI intends to investigate certain higher moment problems using techniques from analytic number theory to gain insight into higher degree L-functions.  Furthermore, the PI seeks to develop new formulas connecting families of L-functions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Riemann zeta function is the basic example of an L-function.  The distribution of the prime numbers, the fundamental particles of the integers, are intertwined with properties of the Riemann zeta function, as predicted by the Riemann Hypothesis.  The Riemann zeta function itself is just one part of a complex web of L-functions that themselves interact in mysterious ways.  This project aims to further the understanding of the Riemann zeta function and its generalizations, especially by finding new links between different kinds of L-functions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit This project was focused on statistical properties of so-called L-functions.  These L-functions encode interesting information about the whole numbers 1,2,3, etc.  For instance, the simplest L-function, the Riemann zeta function, helps us to understand how the prime numbers are scattered amongst all the positive numbers.  This is important for modern cryptography which uses large primes to encrypt and decrypt messages (such as credit card numbers) for secure transmissions over the internet.    The prime numbers are difficult and interesting to study because, although they are deterministic, in many ways they behave randomly and it is illuminating to model them as such.  L-functions also have this feature of being deterministic but behaving randomly.  One of the best ways to study such random numbers is to understand their "moments" (such as their expected value or standard deviation). Broadly speaking, this project concerned the study of different moments of families of L-functions that have connections to different areas of arithmetic or even physics.  Broader Impacts The PI was involved in organizing a special seminar at Texas A&amp;M University that was focused in large part on enhancing communications between graduate students, post-doctoral researchers, and faculty in number theory.  The seminar was an opportunity for students and postdocs to practice speaking in a friendly and informal setting and to interact with faculty.  The PI also gave lectures on cryptography to middle school students at a summer enrichment program at Texas A&amp;M.  The PI furthermore gave two public presentations on cryptography: one at the Texas A&amp;M SEE-Math open house in Summer 2009, and one at the Texas A&amp;M Math mini-fair in Spring 2009.
