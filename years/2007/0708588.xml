<AbstractNarration>Matalon&lt;br/&gt;0708588&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The objective of the project is to enhance physical&lt;br/&gt;understanding of the intricate processes occurring in combustion&lt;br/&gt;at the microscale, in order to support and guide ongoing&lt;br/&gt;experimental efforts in this area.  Mathematically, the problems&lt;br/&gt;require finding solutions to coupled, highly nonlinear partial&lt;br/&gt;differential equations, further complicated by inevitable&lt;br/&gt;temporal variations, multi-scale processes, and nontrivial&lt;br/&gt;boundaries.  Tractable problems require judicious modeling&lt;br/&gt;efforts in order to capture the main features of the phenomena&lt;br/&gt;under consideration.  The simplified models are addressed using&lt;br/&gt;appropriate analytical or numerical strategies in order to&lt;br/&gt;provide solutions that enable comparing the theoretical&lt;br/&gt;predictions with experimental observations.  The investigator&lt;br/&gt;examines two sets of problems.  The first set is associated with&lt;br/&gt;premixed combustion in an excess-enthalpy combustor where the hot&lt;br/&gt;combustion products are recirculated to heat up the fresh&lt;br/&gt;reactants, thus enhancing the burning rate and heat output.  The&lt;br/&gt;second set of problems is associated with nonpremixed combustion&lt;br/&gt;in a confined slot, where the mixing zone and the resulting&lt;br/&gt;diffusion flame spread over the entire length of the reactor&lt;br/&gt;channel.  The goal is to study the structure, properties and&lt;br/&gt;dynamics of flames in such configurations and identify conditions&lt;br/&gt;for steady burning, onset of instabilities, flashback or blowoff,&lt;br/&gt;and flame extinguishment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Combustion is a subject of great economical and societal&lt;br/&gt;concern.  Despite the continuing search for alternative energy&lt;br/&gt;sources, combustion still provides the majority of the energy&lt;br/&gt;consumed today.  It is therefore important to ensure that&lt;br/&gt;combustion processes are utilized in the most efficient way, and&lt;br/&gt;in such a way as to minimize undesirable effects on the&lt;br/&gt;environment.  Recent development in the field of microscale&lt;br/&gt;combustion has been motivated by the increased need for smaller&lt;br/&gt;scale and high density power sources and by the fact that&lt;br/&gt;hydrocarbon fuels have enormous advantages over batteries in&lt;br/&gt;terms of energy storage per unit mass.  There are, however,&lt;br/&gt;important issues that need to be addressed in order to render&lt;br/&gt;this technology practical and efficient.  Beyond the difficulties&lt;br/&gt;associated with fabrication, fundamental questions concerned with&lt;br/&gt;the underlying combustion physics need to be overcome.  The&lt;br/&gt;development of combustion systems at the microscale requires&lt;br/&gt;deeper understanding at the fundamental level of fluid flow in&lt;br/&gt;microchannels, heat and mass transport at the small scale,&lt;br/&gt;combustion in small volumes and complex geometries, thermal and&lt;br/&gt;chemical properties of the wall materials, and fluid-wall&lt;br/&gt;interactions.  Mathematical modeling plays an important role&lt;br/&gt;towards this goal; it provides means to explain experimental&lt;br/&gt;observations and identify the physical mechanisms responsible for&lt;br/&gt;these observations.  The investigator, building on his earlier&lt;br/&gt;contributions to fluid mechanics and chemically reacting flows,&lt;br/&gt;studies the peculiarities of combustion at the microscale in&lt;br/&gt;order to improve physical understanding of these phenomena.  By&lt;br/&gt;guiding and supporting the ongoing experimental efforts the&lt;br/&gt;project has an immediate effect on advancements of this new&lt;br/&gt;technology. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
