<AbstractNarration>This CPATH collaborative project develops the models for extending Penn State's successful institutional transformation based on building system of systems to other institutions of higher education.  The first phase of the project is aimed at adoption of strategy at Georgia State University.  The second phase involves systemic programmatic evaluation of the strategy in both settings. The third phase targets extending the strategy to include an open source element. The Penn State transformation strategy, Augmenting Education of Systems-of-Systems Professionals (AESOP), prepares computing professionals who can build and support large and complex systems. The strategy contains five major elements including organizational, curricular, active learning, problem-based learning, and experiential learning components.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project stems from the strong research team, the soundness of the combined activities, and the timeliness of the systems of systems focus to address critical information systems education issues. The research team members have solid research records in both enterprise integration and in education.   The strategy that is being adopted, evaluated, and extended has a sound research basis and offers the possibility of new research results that can be incorporated by others.     &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this project stem from the dissemination of the results and learning resources on a wide scale. The project extensions to both higher education and industry partners offers many unique models which may be of value as national models. Thus the project has the potential to impact the preparation of a cadre of computing professionals who can provide leadership in a wide range of application fields and thus enhance an area of significant national need.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes Report for Award #0722112  Learning to Build Systems of Systems  The overall goal of this project was to develop and transfer models of Penn State University's pedagogical practices for courses related to building systems of systems to other institutions of higher education. The partner in this endeavor was the Department of Computer Information Systems at Georgia State University. The concerns related to Systems of Systems were considered important because students often find it difficult to deal with the complexities of large and evolving Systems of Systems.  The project involved a number of tasks. Pedagogical practices at Penn State about techniques such as problem-based learning and experiential learning were codified. Faculty expertise was shared with the teaching teams at Georgia State to introduce these practices in multiple courses. The Georgia State faculty team developed content for multiple courses related to Systems of Systems and introduced these pedagogical techniques in these courses. Multiple evaluation procedures and instruments were created for these practices, both at Penn State and at Georgia State, with the involvement of experts from Educational Psychology. These were tested and applied to assess student learning outcomes.  An example of the resources created for self-directed student learning (including helping with techniques such as problem-based learning) were audio-narrated slides that the students could explore as a supplement to their learning. The figures titled "Audio-Narrated-Slides-1" and "Audio-Narrated-Slides-2" show snapshots of these resources.  For problem-based learning as a pedagogical technique, the project lead to creation of a framework called PBL-SoS: problem-based learning for Systems of Systems. The framework provided guidance for structuring efforts related to implementing problem-based learning in the context of teaching concepts related to Systems of Systems. The figure titled "PBL-SoS-Framework" shows the framework.  Outcomes related to the introduction of problem-based learning were assessed by examining student learning, specifically about learning concepts. Student learning outcomes are difficult to assess because of difficulties related to identifying specific contributions of pedagogical techniques to learning outcomes. We followed an experimental technique that measured before and after understanding of concepts. The results showed that it might be possible to employ problem-based learning to improve student learning outcomes at least in some cases.  Learning about building systems of systems is difficult also because of the unique circumstances presented by each organization. Prior knowledge is, then, sometimes difficult to reuse.

Soft skills are extremely difficult to quantify and assess because of difficulties associated with definition and their multi-dimensional nature. The tool and the underlying evaluation scheme, developed with an expert in educational psychology, tried to overcome these concerns with a scenario-based approach. The tool prompted students with scenarios and allowed educators to assess the outcomes based on different dimensions. The dimensions were grouped in two super-categories: (a) inter-personal relationships, and (b) understanding the organizational environment. Examples of dimensions included: handles conflict maturely, monitors and corrects own and team performance etc. The ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
