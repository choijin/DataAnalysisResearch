<AbstractNarration>Further development and application of a cross-discipline theoretical framework for&lt;br/&gt;two-atom, few-atom, and many-atom quantum systems is proposed. The theory, the&lt;br/&gt;multiscale quantum-defect theory, asserts that universal properties exist at different&lt;br/&gt;length scales for such systems, and provides methods to uncover and study them.&lt;br/&gt;It has been developed by the P.I. over the past few years, and has been demonstrated&lt;br/&gt;explicitly for two-atom, few-atom, and many-atom quantum systems. The proposed&lt;br/&gt;research is expected to lead to the development of a new theoretical framework for&lt;br/&gt;studying strongly-coupled many-atom quantum systems and highly excited clusters,&lt;br/&gt;including a first microscopic quantum theory of liquids that goes beyond the liquid&lt;br/&gt;helium. It is also expected to lead to much improved understanding of fundamental&lt;br/&gt;atomic and molecular processes that include, e.g., the interaction and scattering of polar&lt;br/&gt;molecules and the Feshbach resonances in nonzero partial waves in&lt;br/&gt;ultracold atomic interactions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This research intends to better understand how atoms interact with each other, how this interaction may be altered or controlled under different external conditions, and the consequences of such interactions on chemical reactions, few-atom systems, and many-atom systems.  It is driven by the belief of the PI that it is the degree we understand fundamental atomic and molecular interactions and processes that will ultimately determine the degree to which we can understand the world around us. This belief, which used to be regarded as self-evident, is increasingly being questioned, both by the public and within the physics community, as reflected in the lack of positions, support, and funding for theoretical atomic and molecular physics.  Within the physics community, theoretical atomic and molecular physics is regarded as an old subject, and therefore nothing substantially new is to be expected. In public perception, there are always other areas, such as energy crisis, nano-science, biophysics, that better capture peopleÃ†s imagination.  Our research intends to show that theoretical atomic and molecular physics remains highly relevant, and is still a major bottleneck in understanding the world around us, be it chemistry, condensed matter, or biology. We hope to do this by showing that there can indeed be substantially improved understanding of atomic and molecular processes, in such a way that will impact our understanding of chemistry and condensed matter systems.  Within this context, the projects within this funding period have achieved the following results.  (a)    They have substantially improved our understanding of atom-atom and ion-atom interactions at low temperatures, including analytic description of atom-atom interaction in the quantum regime, and analytic description of how such interaction can be tuned or altered by an external magnetic field. Understanding at such a level is essential for a better understanding of few-atom and many-atom quantum systems.  (b)    They have laid the foundation for a more systematic and unified understanding of atom-atom, ion-atom, electron-atom, atom-molecule, and ion-molecule interactions.  (c)    They have demonstrated the implications of the theory by establishing a new framework for the quantum theory of chemical reactions, which shows considerable promise in overcoming two fundamental difficulties facing existing theories. One difficulty is the availability and/or the accuracy of the potential energy surface. The other is the exponential growth of the Hilbert space beyond the two-body quantum systems.
