    <AbstractNarration>An award has been made to Saint Olaf College under the direction of Dr. Greg Muth to acquire a molecular imaging system for use in biology and chemistry research and teaching. The system will allow researchers to make digital images of various kinds of gels used to study proteins and nucleic acids (DNA) in cell biology and chemistry. Research includes study on gene regulation in protozoa, antimicrobial compounds in bacteria, and proteins important in the structure of cell membranes. The images produced by the system can be share over the internet through an associated computer system. Such imaging systems are essential tools in courses on cell biology, biochemistry, and analytical chemistry. The college has a very active program of student research and regularly sends students on for careers in research and graduate study.</AbstractNarration>
