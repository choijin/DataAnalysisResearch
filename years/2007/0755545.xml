<AbstractNarration>Our overall goal is to have 10 students per year for three years (at least 70% from underrepresented groups) actively participate in a nine-week summer research experience that inspires them to proceed into graduate study and to enter sustainable water resources careers. To achieve this, our Site will provide undergraduates with water resources (both water quantity and water quality) research experiences that: (1) develop students' skills in scientific methods, and equipment and instrumentation use; (2) lead students to greater independence in pursuing their research interests; (3) assist qualified students with under-realized potential in cultivating their capabilities; and (4) offer students professional development and teamwork training through shared activities. The University of Idaho project team includes several NSF-sponsored researchers who solve complex problems of current significance in well-instrumented experimental watersheds using leading-edge tools and techniques. Participants in this REU Site program gain first-hand insights into scientific procedures while earning a competitive edge in entering and successfully completing graduate programs and successful careers in water resources. They will achieve this by selecting and participating in research projects under the direction of faculty competitively funded by NSF, USDA, USGS, and NOAA. The students will participate in both laboratory and field studies. Many of the field experiences will be conducted in watersheds throughout the northern part of Idaho. Watersheds in Idaho are typically of mixed usage including agriculture, forestry, public lands and urban landscapes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU site is co-funded by the following NSF programs: Division of Earth Sciences, Directorate of Engineering, and EPSCoR.</AbstractNarration>
