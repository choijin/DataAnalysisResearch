<AbstractNarration>When speakers refer to things in the world around them, they must constantly make choices about how explicit to make their references, choosing between forms like "Clinton", "the senator from New York", and "she". As listeners hear these references, they have to figure out which person the speaker is referring to, despite the fact that the input itself is often insufficient to identify a unique referent.  It has been proposed that this is possible because speakers and listeners keep track of which entities are likely to be in the focus of attention of discourse participants, which allows speakers to use less specific forms (e.g., "she"), and listeners to understand them. However, there are many unanswered questions about exactly how speakers and listeners model this joint focus of attention, and how individual, internal processing effort and focus of attention impact reference production and understanding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates how reference processing is influenced by both public, shared information about the attention of discourse participants, and non-public, non-discourse-based attention and processing effort. It offers a comprehensive examination of the interaction between individual attention and linguistic information, by simultaneously studying the processes of reference production and comprehension, and by adopting techniques from the visual attention literature to manipulate focus of attention. Comprehension studies use eye-tracking techniques to understand the judgments that occur within a few hundred milliseconds. The findings of this project will contribute to a mechanistic understanding of the common and yet pragmatically complex human ability to communicate reference.</AbstractNarration>

These questions are important because they concern the fundamental mental processes that we use for all language tasks &ndash; reading, writing, talking, learning. Even though weÆre not aware of how attention guides language use, building explicit models of these processes will guide educators, clinicians, and artificial intelligence engineers.  Findings from this project contributed to these debates in several ways:  1) Reference processing is related to attention.  In order to test the hypothesis that discourse focus is related to psychological attention, this project used a variety of manipulations of attention that are orthogonal to the discourse itself. If the relevant type of attention for reference processing is a linguistic category, and not psychological attention, then only discourse manipulations should matter.

A central debate about language use is whether production and comprehension processes are extensively driven by considerations of the attention and knowledge of oneÆs interlocutor, or whether it is driven primarily by automatic internal processes. Findings from this project demonstrated that the addresseeÆs attention does affect acoustic reduction (Rosa, Finch, Bergeson, &amp; Arnold, in press, LCP), but possibly by facilitating language production processes (Arnold, Kahn, &amp; Pancani, 2012, PBR). This was consistent with a large set of findings...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
