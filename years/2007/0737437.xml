<AbstractNarration>The University of Pennsylvania is partnering with the School District of Philadelphia to (1) improve 9th and 10th grade student performance in science, (2) increase student knowledge of nanotechnology and bioengineering, (3) enhance student skills at using information and educational technologies, and (4) increase student awareness of post-secondary educational opportunities and careers in science, technology, and engineering. Teachers are producing grade-appropriate, problem-based, standards-aligned nanotechnology/bioengineering learning activities, using specific educational and information technologies to promote learning, and becoming more aware of post-secondary science, engineering, and IT educational opportunities and careers. The school district is creating a framework for providing students and teachers with opportunities to learn more about STEM and IT education and careers. Lastly, the project is measuring the impact of project activities on student learning and teacher classroom practices for the purpose of scaling the program to the district level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is working directly with four teachers (two from 9th grade and two from 10th grade), one guidance counselor, and 10 students from each of 18 schools in the Philadelphia school district during summer workshops. Follow-up activities with the 72 teachers during the school year include Saturday workshops, online communications and support, field trips, and a community expo. Indirectly, the project will impact approximately 8,000 students in the district. The evaluation plan is studying all stakeholders and measuring changes in student knowledge, skills, and attitudes, as well as teacher knowledge, attitudes, and practice.</AbstractNarration>
