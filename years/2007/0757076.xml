<AbstractNarration>This Type 2 project intends to collect survey data about college student progression toward degrees in science and engineering fields.  The researchers are examining differences in student to student attributes and educational practices in undergraduate courses that are related to student decisions to continue study in STEM fields.  The study uses a national sample of 2004 students as a baseline and follows these students up to 6 years after college entry.  This project extends a similar analysis on health issues separately supported by NIH.  The associations that will emerge from this analysis of students in 680 4-year colleges are intended to advise other researchers and the STEM community about institutional, classroom, and student practices that appear to be related to improving student performance in college STEM classes.  One particular question is an analysis of programs that assist students in overcoming racial isolation in the STEM fields.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project provides new empirical and descriptive information about the conditions that are correlated with choosing careers in science and technology fields of today's undergraduate students.   The researchers are situating their study within other known studies of student progression toward a degree in science and technology fields.</AbstractNarration>

This report summarizes several of these products and findings.

To better understand how the structures of opportunity within institutions influence studentsÆ probabilities of completing STEM bachelorÆs degrees within six years of entering college,  we administered a survey of "Best Practices in Undergraduate STEM Education" in 2009 to four-year colleges and universities that participated in our student surveys from 2004-2008. Deans and department chairs in STEM-related disciplines were invited to respond to questions regarding the types of programs their department and/or campus offered to support undergraduatesÆ learning in STEM.

Within institutions, undergraduate research programs significantly improve studentsÆ odds of persistence in their STEM majors. Additionally, our research indicates that the probability of intending to pursue a graduate or professional STEM degree are improved by 14 percentage points among STEM students who participate in undergraduate research experiences. Undergraduate research participants also receive an advantage of 10-14 percentage points in...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
