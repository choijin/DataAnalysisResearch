<AbstractNarration>In a major breakthrough during PI's prior funding period, the PI and collaborator Robin Young accomplished the explicit construction and proof of the existence of nonlinear time periodic solutions of the compressible Euler equations.   These solutions describe new shock-free waves that propagate through an oscillating entropy field without breaking or dissipating,  and thereby give a theoretical basis for the possibility of dissipation free, long- distance signaling.  The waves transmit information according to a fundamentally new mechanism---compression and rarefaction are balanced along every characteristic,  the waves propagate at a new speed, (different from a shock or sound speed), and sound waves move through periods  at speeds that can be commensurate or incommensurate with the period.  The period determines the speed of the wave crests, (a sort of observable group velocity), but the sound waves move at a faster speed, the usual speed of sound, and this is like a phase  velocity.   Part I of this proposal is concerned with both the  &lt;br/&gt;mathematical investigation and numerical simulation of these new  waves.    In particular, the mathematics shows that the waves can be  computed by a perturbation series which is given in closed form starting from linearized solutions that display the structure of the nonlinear waves, and this is the basis for a proposed numerical  simulation.   Part II  addresses problems of shock-wave propagation in General Relativity (GR).  This includes a program to numerically simulate a physically realistic cosmological shock-wave that could arise from Guth's well known inflationary spacetime.  The point of departure here is prior joint work with PI's collaborator Joel Smoller in which we introduced a physically believable, mathematically rigorous  shock-wave  refinement of the Standard Model of Cosmology.   We propose to  numerically refine this model by incorporating a more realistic equation of state and thereby resolve secondary waves in the problem.  Our goal is to use this accurate simulation as a baseline  for comparison with observational data.   Part II also addresses  shock-wave propagation and black hole formation in GR, and Part III concerns resonant interactions  in classical fluids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The compressible Euler equations of gas dynamics resulted from Leonard Euler's successful attempt in 1752 to complete Newton's program to give a correct version of the Newtonian laws of motion  &lt;br/&gt;that apply to continuous media.   For Euler, these equations  represented the nonlinear theory of sound waves.   Euler's great  achievement was to derive the nonlinear equations from physical principles, and then to show that in the limit of weak signals the theory recovered D'Alembert's principle that sound waves were approximately sinusoidal  oscillations in the pressure that propagate according to the linear wave equation.  Thus our new construction of sound waves for the fully nonlinear equations in Part I resolves in the affirmative the most basic question one would ask about the nonlinear theory of sound waves---do the nonlinear equations support oscillatory solutions that propagate like the sinusoidal waves of the linear wave equation?  Interestingly, these solutions appear to be ubiquitous, despite two centuries of work suggesting that such time periodic solutions might not be mathematically possible. The PI believes that an understanding of these new waves will have a significant impact, and may well change our point of view regarding the fundamental wave propagation mechanisms in nonlinear hyperbolic systems.  When Einstein's ideas about time and space are incorporated into the compressible Euler equations, one is led to general relativity and the Einstein equations for a perfect fluid.  In Part II, our proposed numerical simulation of a possible cosmic shock wave, is motivated by our idea that a secondary (rarefaction) wave,  &lt;br/&gt;that would be reflected back from the shock in the refined model, might account for the anomalous acceleration of the galaxies within classical GR, without the cosmological constant.   If our model is  &lt;br/&gt;correct, then the universe after the Big Bang begins inside a White Hole, (the time reversal of a Black Hole in which everything is exploding outward), and eventually evolves into something similar to the late stages of a classical, localized explosion: a finite mass of bounded extent, evolving behind an outgoing shock wave, all expanding into an empty space beyond.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The accomplishments in this proposal established the groundwork for four new current PI research projects.   The first began with the proposal (with Smoller) to investigate the possibility that ``simple waves'' from  the radiation epoch of the Big Bang might explain the anomalous acceleration of the galaxies without Dark Energy.   The idea originated from PI and collaborator Smoller's expertise in the mathematical theory of shock waves, c.f. Kurt Friedrichs,  John von Neumann, Peter Lax and James Glimm.   One of the lessons of this theory is that highly nonlinear conservation laws are ``dissipative'', and this dissipation drives complicated solutions to decay to simple wave patterns, solutions on which the equations reduce to functions of a single variable, (in technical terms, to an ODE).   PI began with the idea that the epoch of the Big Bang when everything was pure radiation, (up to about 300,000 years), is precisely described by highly nonlinear equations for which decay to simple waves should apply. The proposal evolved from a problematic numerical project based on PIÆs prior investigations into shock waves in cosmology, a topic of prior NSF support, into the precise identification of a family of exact solutions of the Einstein equations of GR for pure radiation, unique in the sense that they both reduce to ODE's, and perturb the Friedmann spacetimes of the Standard Model of Cosmology (SM).     This was clarified in a publication in PNAS and culminated in a long publication in Memoirs of the AMS providing a comprehensive analysis of properties of these solutions relevant to PI proposal that these are prime candidates for time-asymptotic waves at the end of the radiation epoch.  This was groundwork for PIÆs recent discovery (with Smoller and Vogler) of an instability in the Friedmann universe of the SM in the zero pressure epoch after radiation,  the epoch when the galaxies formed.   Since unstable solutions are typically not observed in nature, this groundwork was the basis for PIsÆ new program:    To identify a new instability in the Friedmann space-time of the Standard Model of Cosmology, to deconstruct it, to identify mechanisms that trigger it, and to derive predictions from it.   The work addresses the fundamental question as to whether it is reasonable to expect to observe an unperturbed Friedmann universe, with or without Dark Energy, on the scale of the supernova data.   A short description of PI's new program was an invited contribution to the 2015 Einstein Centennial Jubilee edited by ST Yau, Harvard University.     The second topic (with Freistuehler) addressed the longstanding problem of how to describe viscosity and heat conduction in relativistic fluid dynamics.   Classically, dissipation is described by the Navier-Stokes equations, equations which also describe turbulence, and to which there is associated a million dollar Millennnium Prize for resolving the issue of singularities.  The natural relativistic version of these equations (derived by Eckhart, Landau and Weinberg), violates Einstein's speed of light bound.   PI's original proposal was to address the causality question for the equations of pure radiation, equations that have no classical limit,  proposing to construct all possible dissipation mechanisms, and then look to restrict them by the requirement of  causality.   We fully resolved this problem for the equations of pure radiation, in a wonderful paper published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society.   In this paper we showed that a causal relativistic version of the Navier-Stokes equations for pure radiation is uniquely determined by the condition that the second order system, with dissipation, be symmetric hyperbolic in the sense of Hughs-Kato-Marsden.   Indeed, a principle of Applied Mathematics is that all physical equations should be symmetric hyperbolic.   In the case of pure radiation, all the dissipation parameters are determined by the three free dissipation parameters of the clas...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
