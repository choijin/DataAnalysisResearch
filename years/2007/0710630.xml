<AbstractNarration>Nature has provided some sophisticated examples of complex, but effective materials design for mechanical strength, toughness, thermal insulation and fluid conduction. These designs can be replicated to produce ceramic materials using wood as a template. "Biomorphic" SiC ceramics can be formed through the controlled pyrolysis of wood to provide a carbon scaffold for infiltration by a silicon-containing liquid or gas. The silicon reacts with the carbon to form SiC with a complex cellular microstructure reminiscent of the wood. The porous SiC structure, with its open channels, provides a useful scaffold for further infiltration by metals resulting in a new class of composite materials for enhanced mechanical robustness, electrical or thermal conductivity. It is the goal of this work to establish new directions in composite materials produced with naturally derived scaffolds. Because silicon carbide and its precursor carbon are extremely versatile materials in which properties can range from insulting to highly conductive, and from hard to lubricious, studies focus on the use of silicon carbide and carbon scaffolds for composite design. Biomorphic composite materials are compared to synthetically derived structures in their thermal, electrical and mechanical response. The objectives of this work are three-fold: (1) To identify optimal alloy systems, based on thermodynamic considerations, and develop processing methodologies for SiC/Si and C/Cu biomorphic composites, (2) To characterize the thermal, electrical and mechanical properties of biomorphic-based composite materials and contrast them with synthetically derived composites, and (3) To use microstructural-based finite element analysis to predict optimal composite microstructures and to understand the behavior of complex composite microstructures in their thermal, electrical and mechanical response. The project is done in conjunction with Universidad de Sevilla (processing and microstructural characterization) and Universidad Politcnica de Madrid (mechanical properties and modeling)  in Spain and the Ioffe Physico-Technical Institute (electrical, thermal, and elastic properties) in St. Petersburg.  Northwestern focuses on C/Cu materials, their mechanical and thermal properties, and modeling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The collaboration among Northwestern University, Universidad de Seville, Universidad Politcnica de Madrid, and the Ioffe Physico-Technical Institute offers significant inter-university training of students.  Since porous ceramic materials play such an important role in applications from sensors to fuel cells to insulation, a joint effort among collaborators to create a course on porous materials is planned. Course materials will be developed and distributed via the web to augment dissemination. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is co-funded with the Office of International Science and Engineering.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

Graphitization of Biomorphic Carbon   Although wood and other cellulose-based materials are predominantly carbon, the carbon atoms resulting from the controlled pyrolysis of wood are not arranged in any regular order compared to graphite, where carbon atoms organize in hexagonal arrays. To take advantage of graphite's properties, a technique that converts wood to graphite has been adapted at Northwestern for biomorphic materials and results in graphite with a natural honeycomb-like structure (See image).  Unlike petroleum-based materials, wood-based materials do not lend themselves to graphite formation, even at very high temperatures. However, using a liquid nickel-based catalyst and controlled heating conditions, wood-derived scaffolds showing similar graphite content to petroleum-based graphite were produced at temperatures of 1600?C. In contrast, existing methods for the conversion of amorphous carbon to a more thermally conductive graphitic carbon often rely on high temperature processing, usually in excess of 3000?C.  Composites Derived from Wood-Based Carbon and Graphite The composites produced in this study were composed of porous biomorphic scaffolds of silicon carbide or graphite, and a metallic secondary phase of aluminum or copper.  Instead of a traditional distribution of fibers or particulates, these composites rely on the porous microstructure of the biomorphic scaffold to define the structure of the second phase, where the metal infiltrates æfiber-likeÆ channels.  Biomorphic silicon carbide/aluminum composites were examined for interest in mechanical behavior, where they were found to be more effective than composites of the same chemistry made with whiskers or fibers.  As modern electronic devices continue to decrease in size, new methods are needed to eliminate heat produced as the devices operate. Silicon carbide/copper and graphite/copper biomorphic composites, such as the ones developed in this research, are especially attractive for managing heat flow. These materials are also lightweight and malleable. Wood, as the graphite source, also adds value because it is a renewable resource. Processing of these composites was challenging because, in the case of biomorphic silicon carbide/copper, a detrimental chemical reaction occurred at elevated temperatures, or in the case of biomorphic graphite/copper, the copper would not adhere to the graphite. To circumvent these challenges, a room temperature electroplating process was developed at Northwestern to fill high-aspect ratio channels, and modeled to predict conditions where channels would be fully filled.  In conjunction with scientists at Oak Ridge National Lab, the thermal conductivity of these composites was evaluated. Biomorphic silicon...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
