<AbstractNarration>Switching networks serve as the core of network switches and routers, and communication &lt;br/&gt;subsystems of multiprocessor and multi-computer computing systems. There has been a &lt;br/&gt;growing interest in developing high-speed switches for multicasting. A wide class of &lt;br/&gt;applications, such as teleconferencing, video distribution, LAN bridging and distributed &lt;br/&gt;data processing, require multicasting communications. The essential network components &lt;br/&gt;for such applications are multicast switches. Rearrangeable nonblocking (RNB) multicast &lt;br/&gt;switching networks are used for packet switching, and strictly nonblocking (SNB) and &lt;br/&gt;wide-sense nonblocking (WSNB) multicast switching networks are used for circuit switching. &lt;br/&gt;Optimal RNB multicast switching networks have been constructed for a long time, and it &lt;br/&gt;was shown that the lower bound for the cost SNB multicast switching network is O(N^2)&lt;br/&gt;in 1980. Thus, for scalable circuit switching applications minimum-cost WSNB multicast &lt;br/&gt;switching networks are the only solution. Multicast networks (a.k.a. generalized &lt;br/&gt;connection networks, generalized connectors, distribution networks) were first formally &lt;br/&gt;introduced in English literature by Masson and Jordan in 1972. Until now, the WSNB &lt;br/&gt;multicast switching network with lowest cost remains to be Pippenger's network designed &lt;br/&gt;in 1973. It has been a general belief that Pippenger's network is very difficult to &lt;br/&gt;improve. One of the major goals of this proposed research is to seek WSNB multicast &lt;br/&gt;switching networks better than Pippenger's network. In addition, we also consider &lt;br/&gt;constructing optimal or near-optimal nonblocking multicast switching networks under &lt;br/&gt;routability and optical implementation constraints. All problems considered are &lt;br/&gt;constrained optimization problems with important implications. This proposed work not &lt;br/&gt;only has significant theoretical importance but is also of practical value.&lt;br/&gt;In the last 33 years, no progress on WSNB multicast switching networks better than &lt;br/&gt;Pippenger's network has been reported. The intellectual merit of the proposed research &lt;br/&gt;lies in the attempt of tackling a long-standing open theoretical problem, and its related &lt;br/&gt;problems arising in new network technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
