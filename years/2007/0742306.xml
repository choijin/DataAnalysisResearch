<AbstractNarration>GRADUATE TEACHING FELLOWS IN K-12 EDUCATION&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PROPOSAL #: 0742306&lt;br/&gt;PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Julie Westerlund&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION: Texas State University&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: Project Flowing Waters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project Flowing Waters is an interdisciplinary program which uses aquatic sciences to integrate water-related research and inquiry-based teaching into K-12 classrooms.  Project Flowing Waters is a collaboration between Texas State University Departments of Biology and Geography, and the San Marcos, Texas CISD 6-12th grade teachers and students.  Faculty and graduate students from Texas State University will work hand-in-hand with San Marcos CISD teachers to develop 6-12th grade student skills and knowledge of physical, chemical, and biological aspects of aquatic systems in order to improve interest and performance in STEM areas.  In turn, Texas State graduate fellows will obtain teaching skills necessary to transmit knowledge and expertise to broader audiences.  A focal point of the program is the San Marcos River, which flows through Texas State University and the San Marcos community.  This watershed is a precious and unique natural laboratory that permits integration among several disciplines, including aquatic ecology, geology, fluvial geomorphology, and conservation biology.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Principal benefits and broader impacts of Project Flowing Waters include graduate fellow development of communication, collaboration, team building skills, and understanding of inquiry-based teaching.  Inquiry-based teaching and participation in the graduate fellows' cutting-edge research will be used to convey the excitement of the scientific process to &gt;4000 San Marcos CISD 6-12th grade students, of whom 72% are ethnic minority groups and 54% economically disadvantaged.  An enduring impact of Project Flowing Waters is a strengthened university-community partnership that will lead to extensive and sustained collaboration and institutional commitment.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

As the name Project Flowing Waters indicated, the conceptual focus of the program was the integration of water-related science research and teaching, including aquatic biology, aquatic ecology, population genetics, fluvial geomorphology, conservation biology, and river restoration. The focus on water-related science has special relevance in central Texas.

The river and its watershed provided a unique and easily accessible natural laboratory. The Texas State doctoral program in Aquatic Resources provided depth and breadth of knowledge in water-related sciences.  The interdisciplinary nature of Project Flowing Waters offered an innovative and unique opportunity for the professional development of graduate fellows and teachers and the education of students.

Pam Guettner, SMICSD Director of Curriculum and Instruction:  "The Project Flowing Waters grant partnership between Texas State and San Marcos CISD is an example of a collaboration with student success at the heart of it.  The resident scientists [GK-12 Fellows] on Goodnight, Miller, High School, Pathfinder, and Pride campuses have been phenomenal.  They bring their love for science into the classroom through research based instructional strategies, by conducting science experiments with students, and by planning and arranging science field trips.  These scientists are positive role models and mentors for our students."  Short video overview of Project Flowing Waters at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QG7pbiiNkRk  Five-year outcomes of Project Flowing Waters:  GK-12 Fellows:  26 Texas State University GK-12 Fellows have engaged over 5,000 mostly Hispanic, economically disadvantaged, and at-risk students in hands-on science instruction in the local San Marcos community Fellows have authored or co-authored over 40 articles in peer-reviewed regional and national science journals. All of the Fellows indicated in interviews and focus groups that participating in Project Flowing Waters improved their confidence and effectiveness in interacting and communicating with a wide variety of people.  They are now better able to understand their audience and keep them engaged, and also better able to explain information in multiple ways.  Fellows have gained an appreciation of the importance and effectiveness of inquiry-based learning. One fellow described how she now approaches a teaching opportunity by first developing the questions she wants students to consider and then identifying the information and activities that will support their inquiries.  This is the complete opposite of how she formerly developed lessons.  Almost every fellow noted the GK-12 experience made them better teachers, no matter who they are teaching.  Fellows reported greater understanding of how public schools work and the tremendous pressures on teachers.
