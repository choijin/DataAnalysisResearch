    <AbstractNarration>Project Summary: The goal of this Small Business Innovative Research Phase I project is to develop an efficient, monolithic white light emitting diode utilizing a multilayered InN-based quantum dot device structure. An unprecedented range of photon energies can be emitted by embedding InN-based quantum dots within a wide band gap nitride barrier. This approach also avoids fundamental problems associated with the growth of thermodynamically unstable InGaN alloy compositions. While the synthesis of high quality InN has proven challenging via standard growth techniques such as metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD), our preliminary investigations have confirmed that InN nucleates via the strain-induced Stranski-Krastanov&lt;br/&gt;growth mode with visible emission. A key objective of this Phase I project is to demonstrate self-assembled InN quantum dot structures with strong red emission that can be combined with layers emitting at shorter wavelengths to achieve white coloring in a single p-n junction device.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This SBIR project to develop InN-based quantum dots is part of a larger effort at Kopin to harness nanosemiconductors for efficient solid-state light and power generation. Three-dimensional carrier confinement in quantum dots is predicted to significantly enhance the performance of traditional semiconductor devices. The material properties of InN-based quantum dots give unparalleled flexibility in designing advanced, high-performance devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Efficient white light emission for solid-state lighting can be obtained by engineering selfassembled quantum dot structures with dots tailored to emit at red, green, and blue wavelengths. All told, an effective InN-based quantum dot manufacturing process could impact multiple markets with billions of dollars in yearly revenue.</AbstractNarration>
