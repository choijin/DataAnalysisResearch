<AbstractNarration>The IMPACT LA program places Computer and Information Science and Engineering  graduate teaching fellows in STEM middle- and high-school classrooms within the East Los Angeles area.  Graduate fellows conduct research and develop related hands-on activities in the areas of image processing, information hiding, 3D computer graphics and computer vision techniques, embedded computing, sensor networks, and bioinformatics.  Fellows work closely with G6-12 teachers to develop the hands-on activities designed to enhance the educational experience of G6-12 students and increase their interest in STEM-related fields.  Through technology education courses and workshops, California State University, Los Angeles (CSULA) faculty train fellows to improve their communication, collaboration, and teaching skills.  The program goals are achieved through a strong partnership between CSULA, the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) District #5, local industry, and minority serving organizations such as HENAAC and MESA.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this program are to increase the number of underrepresented minority students who pursue college degrees and careers in STEM and to strengthen the research and teaching skills of the graduate fellows.  LAUSD District #5 is composed of 89,702 students where 96.6% are underrepresented minorities.  Fellows will be placed in Roosevelt High School and its two feeder middle schools, Stevenson and Hollenbeck.  As a United States Department of Education Accredited Minority Postsecondary Institution and Hispanic Serving Institution, CSULA has a large number of minority undergraduate Computer Science and Engineering students who will be encouraged to participate in the IMPACT LA program as graduate fellows.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The IMPACT LA NSF GK-12 Program goals are to enhance STEM curriculum, inform and inspire students about careers in science and engineering, and improve the graduate fellow's ability to communicate their research to a broad audience. These goals are aligned with those of the National Research Council report on Successful K-12 STEM Education which identified the need to "Expand the number of students who ultimately pursue advanced degrees and careers in STEM fields and broaden the participation of women and minorities in those fields."  Since 2008, the IMPACT LA NSF Graduate STEM Fellows in K-12 Education (GK-12) Program at California State University, Los Angeles has been working to achieve these goals by partnering graduate fellows with middle and high school science and math teachers within the East Los Angeles area.      Between 2008 and 2014, the IMPACT LA program supported twenty-nine graduate fellows.  The fellows conducted mastersÆ research with their Cal State L.A. faculty mentors in a wide array of STEM disciplines, including Computer Science, Computer/Electrical Engineering, Bioinformatics, Biomedical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Civil Engineering, Biology, Chemistry, and Physics and Astronomy. Unlike most graduate students, the fellows also worked in their partner teacherÆs classroom as visiting scientists and engineers for 10 hours per week throughout the entire school year.  In the classroom fellows presented their research, conducted research-related activities, talked about their college experience, and assisted the teacher through lectures and other activities.  The students also visited the Cal State L.A. campus during the IMPACT LA Open House where they were able to visit their fellowÆs research lab, see other fellowsÆ labs, learn about pathways to college, participate in a fun engineering challenge, and hear about different engineering and science careers from industry representatives.     The IMPACT LA Program, Improving Minority Partnerships and Access through CISE (Computer, Information Science, and Engineering)-related Teaching in Los Angeles, has a specific mission to serve underrepresented minorities.  Cal State L.A. is a United States Department of Education Accredited Minority Postsecondary Institution and Hispanic Serving Institution. The IMPACT LA program partnered with seven different schools in the surrounding East Los Angeles area whose student body were on average more than 95% underrepresented minorities (predominantly Latino), 86% economically disadvantaged, and 27% math proficient.   Both the teachers and the fellows were excellent role models for these students.  Over the six years, the program supported 16 math and science teachers, of which 75% were Latino, who are passionate about providing their students with opportunities to pursue STEM careers.  Of the 29 fellows, 45% were engineers and 55% were scientists, 60% were underrepresented minorities, and 38% were women.       The IMPACT LA Program developed a variety of outreach events to inspire underrepresented minorities to pursue careers in science and engineering, including the IMPACT LA Summer Camp, the IMPACT LA Open house, as well as the Family Science Nights conducted in a partner middle school.  Over the six years, the IMPACT LA program reached out to more than 5,000 students from partnership schools and local communities. The feedback from the outreach events was overwhelmingly positive.  Furthermore, the impact of the fellows in the classroom was even more significant.  Overall, our results showed a positive change in studentsÆ perspectives towards scientists/engineers accompanied by a deeper understanding of STEM careers.  Based on pre and post survey results, studentsÆ interest in STEM careers increased between 1% and 11% over the years with an average increase of 4%.  Our data also shows on average, a 4% increase in studentsÆ response to the question "I like engineering."      The program also had a significant impact...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
