<AbstractNarration>Casazza&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0704216&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The investigator and his colleagues work on designing&lt;br/&gt;Hilbert space frames for applications. This involves working&lt;br/&gt;directly with the groups needing such frames such as Siemens&lt;br/&gt;Corporate Research, the Bio-Medical Engineering Center at&lt;br/&gt;Carnegie Mellon University, and the Digital Signal Processing&lt;br/&gt;Center in the Electrical Engineering department at Rice&lt;br/&gt;University. One project involves designing frames and algorithms&lt;br/&gt;for doing signal reconstruction without phase. This project is&lt;br/&gt;designed to remove certain background noises from a signal so&lt;br/&gt;that the voice signals are clearer. Another project involves&lt;br/&gt;answering the question: What is the role and what can imaging do&lt;br/&gt;for systems biology?  The goal is to have distributed yet&lt;br/&gt;integrated large bioimage databases that would allow researchers&lt;br/&gt;to upload their data, have it processed, share the data, download&lt;br/&gt;data as well as having platform-optimized code, all in a common&lt;br/&gt;format. A third project involves doing signal reconstruction with&lt;br/&gt;erasures.  The investigator has designed a system that accounts&lt;br/&gt;for erasures without any extra coefficient calculations, which is&lt;br/&gt;both fast and accurate.  This method needs to be custom designed&lt;br/&gt;for the myriad of applications where there are transmission&lt;br/&gt;losses or erasures.  Another project involves designing "fusion&lt;br/&gt;frames" for problems in distributed processing.  This requires&lt;br/&gt;designing localized frames that globally fuse data both quickly&lt;br/&gt;and accurately -- especially in the face of losses. These are&lt;br/&gt;used for a variety of problems including sensor networks. &lt;br/&gt;Another project is geared to finding equal-norm equi-angular&lt;br/&gt;Parseval frames and mutually unbiased bases. These frames are&lt;br/&gt;used in quantum state tomography, quantum cryptography and&lt;br/&gt;foundational issues in quantum mechanics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The signal reconstruction project is designed to clean up&lt;br/&gt;certain types of audio signals that have noise embedded in their&lt;br/&gt;phase to present a clearer signal.  Another project involves&lt;br/&gt;sensors that are used to observe the world around us.  The amount&lt;br/&gt;of sensed data that is currently being collected is more than can&lt;br/&gt;be collected in one place for analysis.  The investigator and his&lt;br/&gt;colleagues are designing intelligent ways to reduce the amount of&lt;br/&gt;raw data that is analyzed, and this necessitates understanding&lt;br/&gt;the nature and role of the redundancy in the measurements. &lt;br/&gt;Making mathematical contributions to our fundamental&lt;br/&gt;understanding of redundant information could advance the&lt;br/&gt;engineering solutions to problems in environmental monitoring&lt;br/&gt;(including agricultural technology), military surveillance,&lt;br/&gt;understanding the operation of sensory neural systems, and&lt;br/&gt;improving general data collection methods that efficiently turn&lt;br/&gt;the analog events in the natural world into digital signals ready&lt;br/&gt;for analysis. Bioimaging has a serious need for accurate&lt;br/&gt;classification, some of which involves life and death decisions&lt;br/&gt;and are currently very sensitive to misclassification (such as&lt;br/&gt;false negative decisions in detecting cancer).  The goal here is&lt;br/&gt;to design systems that are able to classify with close-to-perfect&lt;br/&gt;accuracy.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
