<AbstractNarration>The PIs  propose a broad program of research in theoretical physics which aims to extend the recent advances in string theory, particle physics and cosmology, and to apply them to ongoing experimental programs.  One of the most important tools for understanding Gauge Theories is the connection between Semiclassical Gravity in anti-deSitter Space  (AdS) and the correlation functions of the conformal invariant gauge field theory that lives on the boundary of the Space (CFT), namely the AdS/CFT correspondence.   In particular, they plan to continue to study the dualities between gauge and string theories.  They intend to both deepen the insight into the origins of these dual relations and the reasons for their success as well as broaden the scope of their physical applications. The intend to study, in this framework,  the confinement problem (why we don't find quarks in a detectro) and hadronic spectra, inflationary cosmology and cosmic strings. New areas will be in the areas of particle model building beyond the Standard Model which display Supersymmetry breaking, understanding the dynamics of the Quark-Gluon Plasma and other aspects of many-body physics.  An important new component of the group?s research activity will be field theoretic particle model building and LHC (large Hadron collider)  physics. The group plans to develop new tools for LHC data analysis that will be crucial in identifying new physics. This will be based on a mass-shell approach to analyzing the data which is free from theoretical bias.  The group will be involved in collaborations and exchanges of ideas between particle phenomenologists, experimentalists and string theorists, which they hope will facilitate the discoveries at the LHC. The group will also will pursue other interesting applications of Quantum Field Theory including the physics of heavy-flavored baryons, and turbulence. &lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this project is to prepare post-docs, graduate students, as well as advanced undergraduates, to do successful research in theoretical physics. The group is involved  in organizing and lecturing at summer schools, organizing and giving public lectures, and informing the general public about recent research advances. The group is in the process of  expanding these outreach activities to include lecturing at minority High Schools and Junior colleges. The group runs the PITP summer school which has  a special program of outreach to women and minority graduate students.</AbstractNarration>
