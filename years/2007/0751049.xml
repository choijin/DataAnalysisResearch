<AbstractNarration>This project supports research in Embedded and Reconfigurable Computing Research (E&amp;RC) by providing the research community with a suite of benchmarks that are specific to E&amp;RC. The community resource funded by this award, ERCbench, will permit researchers to estimate and compare performance, power, and resource usage of their work to other existing and proposed solutions. It will permit them to test new architectures, CAD algorithms, and systems software techniques on a variety of real-world applications for intelligent, embedded devices in areas such as bio-medicine, transportation, environmental monitoring, and communications. These applications tend to focus on low-power and high performance such as in emerging technologies in: multimedia cell phones and personal digital assistants, wireless medical devices, wearable computers, intelligent security devices, 3D gaming systems, automotive computers, and education devices. These systems typically require programmability, complex computing capabilities, and very low power operation. They also use hybrid applications, where part of the application is implemented in one or more types of hardware structures (either fixed custom or reprogrammable logic), and part in software.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although there are benchmarks in various embedded systems arenas, this project entails development of much needed benchmarks in Embedded and Reconfigurable Computing that include hardware/software co-design and reconfigurable computing systems along with associated wrappers, tests, data and other components. The project team will make the benchmark suites available for general use via the project website.</AbstractNarration>

This is a community resource designed to aid researchers in the embedded and reconfigurable computing areas. The suite includes a variety of applications from a diverse set of areas, such as image processing, video processing, audio processing, wireless communication, and encryption.
