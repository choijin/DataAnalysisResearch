<AbstractNarration>     In symbiosis a minimum of two organisms co-exist, linked in one entity.  Symbioses greatly influence carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus cycling on earth and affect the outcome of competition and succession in ecosystems.  In a coral reef, the symbioses between hard corals, soft corals (octocorals), sea anemones and zooxanthellae (algae) create an ecosystem, supporting tremendous diversity.  Coral research predominantly focuses on hard corals, while research on octocorals lags behind.  With climate change and the decline in hard corals, octocorals may provide a critical role in maintaining diversity of organisms on coral reefs. &lt;br/&gt;     This research will focus on the symbiosis between Caribbean octocorals and zooxanthellae (Symbiodinium sp.) and will determine how changing environmental parameters may affect octocoral-zooxanthella symbioses.  The genetic identity of the zooxanthellae and the physiology of octocoral species and their zooxanthellae will be determined.  In addition, the effects of changing environmental parameters such as seawater temperatures, exposure to ultraviolet radiation, and increased ocean acidification on the physiology of octocoral-zooxanthella symbioses will be determined.  These data are crucial to understanding and predicting the survival of octocorals and of Caribbean coral reefs.&lt;br/&gt;     Symbiosis in the classroom will be taught using student created interviews of people in their community and responses will be gathered using personal response systems ("clickers").  This approach, termed 'you and symbiosis,' will be taught at the undergraduate level then modified for K-12.  Examples of topics include: the legume Kudzu; humans and their gut flora; and West Nile virus.  A laboratory course will provide students experience with molecular and physiological techniques applied to research of symbioses.  &lt;br/&gt;     By merging research and innovative teaching techniques to show students and the public the applicability of symbioses to their lives, individuals may develop greater personal interest in coral reef ecosystems.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The research aimed at understanding the current state and the future of Caribbean reefs.  Studies examining the symbiosis between Caribbean gorgonian corals and their dinoflagellate mutualistic endosymbionts, Symbiodinium spp., are sparse, even though gorgonian corals blanket the landscape of Caribbean coral reefs.  Furthermore, in stark contrast to the decline in hard coral cover, gorgonian coral cover has remained constant or actually increased.  The grant aimed at understanding gorgonian symbiosis, both at ambient conditions and under environmental conditions associated with global climate change.  Furthermore, the data collected assessed the gorgonian coral, Symbiodinium and host-symbiont (holobiont) parameters thereby providing a holistic approach, an approach that is not often taken in coral studies.  It was found that at ambient conditions gorgonian coral species vary in their biochemical composition with the dry weight of some species dominated with skeletal material while others having more protein, lipids and carbohydrates.  Gorgonian coral species were subjected to multiple stressors: elevated temperature, exposure to ultraviolet radiation, lower pH conditions, increased nutrients, and physical injury.  One overarching and significant finding that emerged is that Caribbean gorgonian octocorals respond to environmental stressors by acclimating.  Many of the measured parameters are not affected, while other parameters respond in such a way that, overall, the environmental changes do not detrimentally affect these symbioses, although variability of response exists between gorgonian species.  For example, physical damage led to an immune response in one gorgonian coral species, but not in the other studied species.  On the other hand, the microbial consortium did not significantly change due to injury in both species.  Hence, despite their differences, both gorgonian species handled the potential stress brought about by injury.  Furthermore, the effect of environmental changes varies seasonally, illustrating the importance of conducting studies throughout the year.  As part of the pedagogical aspect of the grant, a new teaching approach, Class Generated Community Clicker Cases (CGCCC) was developed.  The CGCCC approach is an innovative way to integrate and capitalize on the strengths of both case studies and audience response systems (clickers). The cases in the CGCCC approach are about the students and their network of family and friends.  Using clickers, students report their case answers during the class period, thereby generating the information discussed in class. This teaching approach can be utilized across multiple disciplines.  Furthermore, during exams answers to the test questions were collected via clickers.  Utilizing clickers on tests is novel and enables asking multiple formats of fill in the blank questions on a computer graded exam.  Therefore, exams administered in classes with a large student enrollment can now transcend the confinements of multiple choice questions.
