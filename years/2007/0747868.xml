<AbstractNarration>The research of this Career proposal focuses on the very early universe, and lies at the interface between cosmology and particle physics. Very soon various new detectors based on the land and in space will measure the parameters describing the present universe with increasingly high precision. These measurements can then be used to test theories of the primordial universe, whose properties are directly determined by fundamental physics. &lt;br/&gt;The interests of the PI straddle questions involving the present and initial states of the universe, and the evolutionary history that connects them. The proposal covers broad but overlapping areas of cosmology: inflationary dynamics and observational constraints, the termination of inflation and preheating, and the cosmological consequences of candidate fundamental theories.  The focus will be to understand and test classes of models, rather than single, overly specific scenarios.  The broader implications of this proposal concerns &lt;br/&gt;the development of materials to be used the new Sloan Digital Planetarium. &lt;br/&gt;The PI is developing a program called "Real Time Relativity for use in the new Yale digital planetarium". This program will create a "Mr. Tompkins" universe where the speed of light is slowed to the point where cars and planes would undergo significant relativistic distortions, and can also be adapted to simulate events such as particle collisions, or relativistic astrophysical phenomena. This package allows the user to interactively specify their trajectory in real time, and thus makes full use of the semi-immersive environment provided by a digital planetarium. Presentations can be tailored for use with the general public, high school students and undergraduates, and will thus significantly add to the impact of what will be a major new facility here at Yale. The "shows" will be made freely available, and will hopefully inspire others to explore the full potential of these systems.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

This course was taken by 12 students (roughly 50%  of the annual number of physics majors at Yale), and received enthusiastic  reviews. Most of these students are likely to go on to graduate study. In  future years the class will alternate with a graduate general relativity class,  with a greater focus on theoretical physics.  This course obviously drew  heavily on my own research background in cosmology, and I frequently  assigned homework that made contact with accessible pieces of the  research literature in the field.     Finally, I am particularly pleased that I have been able to mentor a number  of undergraduate research projects in theoretical cosmology. Three of these  projects have led to published papers (arXiv:1005.1921, arXiv:0812.0825  and arXiv:1012.5299])  So far these students have all gone on to graduate  school in cosmology or theoretical physics, often winning prestigious  scholarships (Marshall Fellowship, NSF graduate fellowships, etc.), and it  is clear that their undergraduate research experiences have played a  significant role in their developing scientific careers.   Findings:  Showed that decaying primordial black holes can generate a) a significant gravitational wave background (albeit at very high frequencies) and b) that these black holes can lead to a temporary period of matter domination before the onset of nucleosynthesis. Showed that previous arguments regarding the 'naturalness' of different inflationary models do not lead to firm conclusions about the amplitude of the expected gravitational wave background in the early universe, contrary to claims in the literature. Showed that 'slow roll reconstruction' is an optimal approach to solving the inverse problem for inflation, and that adding a constraints based on the duration of inflation significantly improves this process. Showed that previous approaches to the 'in-in' formalism (as applied to multi-vertex diagrams in cosmology) can be substantially improved, and that in some cases previous methodologies lead to erroneous results -- especially in diagrams with two external legs. Developed and released PSpectRe, a sophisticated pseudo-spectral code for the simulation of nonlinear scalar field dynamics in the post-inflationary universe. Showed that in a large class of models, inflation can be followed by an oscillon dominated phase, in which most of the mass-energy is tied up in oscillons, localized excitations of a nonlinear scalar field.
