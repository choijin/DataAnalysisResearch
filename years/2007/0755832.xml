<AbstractNarration>Rapid Climate Change (RCC) has serious consequences for indigenous peoples in the north not only for their life ways and resource utilization but also with respect to ethnic mobilization and conflict. The "dynamics of Circumpolar Land Use and Ethnicity" (CLUE) project is a combination of research and education in partnership with northern indigenous peoples of Russia that will investigate the relationship between resources and ethnicity of indigenous circumpolar societies confronting RCC, as well as their agency on the global stage to secure land and resource rights. Because Fennoscandia and Alaska have in some respects developed the discourse of indigenous rights more fully than Russia, the bulk of the fieldwork will be done in Russia with materials from Fennoscandia and Alaska serving as comparisons. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Starting with the premise that when nation states define which indigenous groups can access land resources and the usage such access entails, a circular dynamic is formed whereby categories of people (and even historically well-defined groups) aspire to be "recognized" according to these state legal criteria. The CLUE project will explore the ways in which climate change adds additional pressure to this state defined system of land access and use.  One example of such pressure is that as RCC increases the growing season and the agricultural line pushes northward it intersects with indigenous reindeer pastures, affecting local peoples' herds, which are already under stress from winter temperature fluctuations. These intersections, catalyzed by RCC, create  new disputes not only about land use but also about the definition of "indigenous" itself.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to an investigation of how RCC and the discourse of RCC affects indigenous resources and resource use, CLUE researchers will investigate the concept of "indigenous people," their rights according to international covenants, and the different meanings of the concept in different national settings.  Finally, the CLUE project team hopes to explore other arenas of ethnic discourse such as environmentalism, often with global roots and funding, and resource extraction in the north as well.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CLUE has been sponsored as a full proposal by the IPY Joint Committee and is endorsed by the Russian Academy of Sciences and the Russian Association of Indigenous Peoples of the North (RAIPON). Through its educational outreach component, CLUE will train local indigenous students and incorporate them into project as full research assistants.  Finally, this research hopes to give a "voice" to indigenous concerns and serve to facilitate communications between different levels of local, state, and global decision making.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ There  are many points revealed by this work of significance for research into  post-Soviet conditions for the "small peoples" of the Russian North.  A  wide array of economic structures empower and constrain  their subsistence and living conditions, and these range far beyond the  usually noted sovkhoz, kolkhoz, and obshchina forms.  The same  structural terms, are often used interchangeably, when in fact the  actual structure at hand may be quite distinct from any  of them.  New forms evolve, but prior forms also remain intact.  Often  stakeholders hardly know what their encompassing economic structure is,  or how it is meant to function.  How things actually function bears  little resemblance to how they are supposed to  function according to laws and regulations.     The  Russian State has declared ownership of all its lands, and as the State  needs revenues, it is of course prone to dispense resources to those  multi-million dollar businesses eager to exploit traditional  landscapes. Under harsh economic pressure, the State has withdrawn its  supportive infrastructure to the far-flung native settlements it once  created, unless these are of use as nodes in the service of extractive  industry.  As the State removes its formerly  protective hand and opens the door to foreign investment (in  partnership with Russian firms, of course), native settlements are  abandoned or sink to their knees.  Local indigenous organizations that  try to win sympathy for indigenous claims will lead a tenuous  existence. They might well win some short-term subsidy gesture for  promotion of cultural activities.  For a number of the lingering  settlements we visited, however, they are likely to become "ghost  towns", and their inhabitants have frequently already established  family roots in the larger cities where chances of employment are  better.  However, "outside" workers with better education gain the best  positions in the settlement.  Most outsiders contract for only a few  years and, because of their "hardship posting" are  able to advance their careers dramatically and return south with much  improved pension plans.  Former rural-dwelling families increasingly  split their residence patterns between those who rely on the  infrastructure of the larger cities and those who still  access their local, land-based, food resources.  Commonly these split-living arrangements generate an ever-increasing gender asymmetry with  women and children in the larger towns and men on the tundra.     There  are a great many other developments and issues following in the wake of  the demise of the Soviet Union for the small peoples of the north,  which cannot all be recounted here.  These pertain not  only to resource extraction but also to census politics, involving the  federal recognition of certain peoples and the lands designated for the  exercise of each people?s  special rights, but also by extension, matters concerning an individual?s accredited ethnicity&mdash;the  reasons for aspiring to a particular ethnicity, as well as the rules  for ascribed ethnicity .  CLUE researchers have also documented and  analyzed changes in language use, belief systems and formal religious  affiliations.  Team members have published extensively  on all of these issues.     The CLUE project has found these northern communities in a decisive period of rapid direct human induced change--at speeds far in excess of what one can account for under the rubric of "rapid climatic change." This in no way diminishes the importance of research into the causes and effects of rapid climate change, but it does in turn occasion important theoretical  reflection about the perspectives of contemporary research devoted to  these (and other) peoples.  Crass greed camouflages itself readily in  the forest of environmentally noble policies and  utilitarian ideals.             Last Modified: 10/31/2016       Submitted by: Hugh Beach]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
