<AbstractNarration>PI: James Birchler, University of Missouri-Columbia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development of plant artificial chromosome technology will establish methods to introduce whole suites of traits into plants. Artificial chromosome platforms will be produced by introduction of the specialized ends of chromosomes, called telomeres, through transformation of maize. Introduced telomeres cause the modified chromosome to truncate. If this occurs near the centromere, the part of the chromosome required for transmission of chromosomes during replication and cell division, a minichromosome is formed. The goals of this project are to optimize the artificial chromosome technology in maize. Specific goals include 1) determine the optimal size of the introduced telomere for minichromosome formation 2) add visible markers to track transmission of the minichromosome between generations 3) add a cassette to permit future modification of the minichromosome 4) determine how many artificial minichromosomes plants will tolerate 5) add a selectable marker to ensure minichromosomes will be transferred in crosses for corn breeding.  Artificial chromosomes have the potential to improve plant resistance to insects and disease, enhance biofuels production, and enable sustainable agriculture including reducing the needs for herbicides and fertilizer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will involve training at the postgraduate, graduate and undergraduate levels. Outreach will involve organizing a conference on transgenic crops and artificial chromosome technology with involvement of journalism students to develop science-reporting skills. Education of the general public about transgenic crop issues will be fostered by participation of the principal investigator in the "Saturday Morning Science" lectures at the University of Missouri. The outreach activities will bring together scientists to discuss plant transgenics and artificial chromosome technology, provide opportunities for high school and undergraduates to learn about this field, foster the development of science journalism and communicate issues of plant biotechnology to the general public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Information about methods to produce engineered chromosomes and the availability of the various materials generated will be available at http://maizeminichromosomes.missouri.edu. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

Agrobacterium and biolistic telomere mediated truncation methods to produce engineered minichromosomes were compared. A method of co-bombardment of constructs and free telomeres to produce engineered minichromosomes was used and minichromosomes were recovered from this approach and their structure analyzed. A proof of concept that minichromosomes could be modified in vivo using site specific recombination to remove the selectable marker was conducted.

Transformed maize lines were recovered that express Cre recombinase and phiC31 integrase that can be used for modifications of minichromosomes in the future. A test of the accumulation limits of engineered minichromosomes derived from the maize B chromosome, which undergoes nondisjunction and therefore can be increased in copy number was conducted. The maximum number that was accumulated was 19. Thus, the output from minichromosomes could be increased, if so desired, by accumulating multiple copies as long as gene silencing is avoided.
