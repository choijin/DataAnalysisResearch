    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II research project is to develop full size electrochromic (EC) window glazings with superior performance and durability due to the incorporation of sputtered nanocomposite thin film materials. These window glazings can be electronically darkened to control solar light and heat in buildings and vehicles. The new materials and processes will be tested for prototype glazings followed by the development of a robust manufacturing process with optimum product yield and reliability. Numerical simulation techniques will be used to model how process input variables impact product attributes with a goal of minimizing device variation and optimizing performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The performance and reliability improvements achievable from this SBIR project are essential for widespread acceptance of electronically tinted windows. The improved transmission properties and more neutral coloration obtainable with nanostructured materials are highly desired commercial features. A successful project will lead to widespread adoption of EC windows and enable annual energy savings of up to 0.7 quad to occur sooner. This corresponds to a reduction in carbon emissions of ~10.5 million metric tons per year. In addition to architectural windows, deposition technologies for nanostructured films can improve the performance of transportation windows, flat panel displays, and alternative gate oxides for advanced CMOS technology.</AbstractNarration>
