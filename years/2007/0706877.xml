<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0706877&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Brooke E. Shipley&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI proposes to study algebraic derived equivalences using&lt;br/&gt;methods from homotopy theory.  Specifically, the main project&lt;br/&gt;proposed here is to consider when an equivalence between derived&lt;br/&gt;categories can be realized by an underlying richly structured&lt;br/&gt;equivalence.  The PI and Dugger have shown that certain derived&lt;br/&gt;equivalences of differential graded algebras (DGAs) can only be&lt;br/&gt;realized by "topological equivalences" (involving tilting&lt;br/&gt;spectra) which arise by considering DGAs in the broader context&lt;br/&gt;of ring spectra.  One goal of this project is to produce simple&lt;br/&gt;invariants for detecting topological equivalences of DGAs.&lt;br/&gt;Another goal is to extend the study of topological equivalences&lt;br/&gt;to DG-categories.  In on-going joint work with Dugger, the PI is&lt;br/&gt;also investigating an exotic example of two derived equivalent&lt;br/&gt;DGAs with no underlying structured equivalence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research projects involve the interplay beween the&lt;br/&gt;study of algebraic structures and topology, the study of shapes&lt;br/&gt;or spaces. Algebraic topologists use algebraic structures to&lt;br/&gt;describe and simplify topological phenomena. In a project on&lt;br/&gt;realizing derived equivalences, the investigator hopes to use&lt;br/&gt;techniques developed in algebraic topology to attack questions&lt;br/&gt;which originate in algebra.  The PI also plans to organize&lt;br/&gt;conferences which will help to train graduate students as well as&lt;br/&gt;disseminate results.  In addition, the PI will continue to be&lt;br/&gt;involved with several organizations which promote the&lt;br/&gt;participation of women in science.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
