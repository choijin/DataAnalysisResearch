    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Research Innovation (SBIR) Phase I project will develop extrudable high performance solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) nanocomposites with high room temperature (RT) conductivity for lithium ion polymer battery applications. The proposed technology aims to offer a high performance SPE that will favorably compete in the secondary battery market and provide a safe alternative to lithium ion batteries that have problems with volatile liquid electrolyte leakage and fire hazards. The technology proposed herein aims to create a nanocomposite containing high concentrations of conductive moieties able to withstand thermal processing and provide a wide temperature use range. It is anticipated that the Aquazol-based copolymer nanocomposites will result in the first SPE with RT conductivity greater than currently available materials in an easy to process form. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development of a high performance solid polymer electrolyte that can compete with lithium ion and gel electrolytes without the safety and fire hazards has significant market value. Potential applications include high performance solid state batteries, chemical sensors, electrochemical capacitors, energy conversion by the fuel cells, electro-chromic displays or windows and analog memory devices. Significant environmental benefits are provided due to the limited quantities of volatiles used in the synthesis of copolymers and SPE nanocomposite production. In addition, these proposed novel Aquazol-based copolymers are a new addition to the family of poly(2-ethyl-2-oxzoline) products commercially available and their chemical and physical properties may find applications in fields such as personal care and medical products.</AbstractNarration>
