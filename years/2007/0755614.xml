<AbstractNarration>The PI proposes to investigate the properties of four dimensional theories with N = 1 supersymmetry which are obtained from compactifications of string theory. Another topic of investigation will be the connection between geometry and string theory. Another objective will be to study a particular generalization of "mirror symmetry," a duality between typically topologically distinct spaces. The PI also hopes to study heterotic string compactifications with fluxes which involve understanding  manifolds that are not of the usual Kahler variety. Other directions of this research include studying a class of string vacua derived from "hybrid"  Landau-Ginzburg models.&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this proposal are that the PI proposes a series of intensive two-week summer schools for visiting grad students and postdocs to teach relevant advanced mathematics to young physicists. This series of summer schools will help to fill what the PI perceives as a significant pedagogical gap in the training of young persons in this field namely the lack of schools to teach the advanced mathematics needed to make progress in formal string theory. The research advocated in this proposal is multidisciplinary in nature involving collaboration with mathematicians with expertise in geometry&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant supported research into string theory, the leading contender to reconcile and unify general relativity and quantum field theory, the two leading developments of twentieth-century physics.  Specifically, this grant supported research into `compactifications' of string theory, in which one derives four-dimensional physics from a ten- or eleven-dimensional spacetime by making the ansatz that the larger spacetime is the product of a small compact space with the four-dimensional spacetime.  Properties of the low-energy four-dimensional physical theory, such as the spectrum of particles, are determined by the geometry and topology of the small compact space.     The work performed over the course of this grant has covered several different areas.  One set of papers concerns compactifications of `heterotic' string theories, and quantum corrections to couplings in those theories.  Those quantum corrections can be described by a deformation of a mathematical theory known as `sheaf cohomology,' and so can be of interest to both physicists and also mathematicians.     Another set of papers concerned the `Fayet-Iliopoulos parameter' in supersymmetric extensions of general relativity.  In supersymmetric theories (theories with a symmetry relating bosons and fermions) containing vector (gauge) fields but which are not coupled to gravity, this parameter is ubiquitous.  In analogous theories coupled to gravity, it has been unclear whether this parameter really exists.  Part of the work performed clarified this issue, by arguing that the parameter does exist in theories coupled to gravity, but is quantized.     Another bit of supported work studied possible deformations of heterotic string compactifications in which certain background fields (fluxes) had been turned on.  Understanding the allowed deformations was an old unsolved problem, and we proposed a solution.     Several other papers were written concerning a variety of other topics, ranging from properties of certain special quantum field theories called ``topological'' field theories, to certain discrete degrees of freedom called ``discrete torsion.''     In addition to the papers outlined above, this grant also directly, partially, supported one postdoc, Robert Karp, as well as partially supported 31 graduate students attending a summer school, and also provided summer funding for two other graduate students.  During the period of this grant, the PI was also involved with organizing several conferences and summer schools, and gave 22 technical talks on the papers produced above; no grant money was used to directly support those activities.
