    <AbstractNarration>Mifflin&lt;br/&gt;0707205&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This project is concerned with solution of difficult&lt;br/&gt;optimization problems. Solving such problems efficiently&lt;br/&gt;involves exploiting at least one of two types of naturally&lt;br/&gt;occurring structure, one implicit and the other explicit. These&lt;br/&gt;structures are related by the result that problems with&lt;br/&gt;explicitly known separable structure can be transformed via&lt;br/&gt;decomposition techniques (involving independent subproblem&lt;br/&gt;optimization) to equivalent nonsmooth problems with implicit&lt;br/&gt;VU-shape structure. For many objectives with the latter&lt;br/&gt;structure the investigator and his colleague undertale&lt;br/&gt;significant further development of a bundle-based method that&lt;br/&gt;employs a V-model of the objective and a U-model of an associated&lt;br/&gt;Lagrangian. This rapidly convergent algorithm takes advantage of&lt;br/&gt;past research that defined a structure that is special enough to&lt;br/&gt;give "primal-dual tracks" to minimizers and general enough to&lt;br/&gt;include many applications. The new work involves numerical&lt;br/&gt;testing on practical problems where the cutting-plane nature of&lt;br/&gt;subgradient bundling along with U-Hessian estimation allows our&lt;br/&gt;algorithm to follow a primal-dual track without having to know it&lt;br/&gt;explicitly. A significant component of the work is to extend the&lt;br/&gt;method to run on nonconvex functions and have provable&lt;br/&gt;convergence to stationary points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The computational methods developed here are significant&lt;br/&gt;because they can be applied in many practical situations&lt;br/&gt;including some having broad societal impact. A new application&lt;br/&gt;involves a complicated objective that is used in many&lt;br/&gt;applications such as economic and geophysical modeling,&lt;br/&gt;computer-aided design, and image analysis. Nonsmooth&lt;br/&gt;optimization developments also make feasible the application of&lt;br/&gt;decomposition techniques to large or complicated models such as&lt;br/&gt;those occurring in operations management, telecommunication and&lt;br/&gt;traffic assignment, manufacturing, civil infrastructure design,&lt;br/&gt;structural engineering, finance, and strategic planning. Such&lt;br/&gt;models illustrate the need to make trade-off decisions when&lt;br/&gt;considering conflicting criteria such as simultaneously having&lt;br/&gt;high reliability and low cost. Such an area of application is in&lt;br/&gt;power system planning subject to environmental protection&lt;br/&gt;constraints. These problems naturally decompose into higher&lt;br/&gt;level problems of deciding which types of power generation plants&lt;br/&gt;to build and lower level ones of deciding how to best operate the&lt;br/&gt;various units to meet daily energy demand. Additionally, this&lt;br/&gt;project fits in well with ongoing efforts in high-performance&lt;br/&gt;computing, because future decomposition applications will utilize&lt;br/&gt;parallel processing or networks of computers to solve very large&lt;br/&gt;or complex decision-making problems.</AbstractNarration>
