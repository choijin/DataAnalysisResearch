<AbstractNarration>Data transfer is a defining task of a network. This project, uswarm, proposes a novel data-transfer architecture inspired by recent, tremendously successful swarming systems such as BitTorrent. The project pursues the following, rather exploratory, question: can swarms form the basis of a universal data-transfer architecture for a future Internet and if so, what is an appropriate architecture? Natural systems with swarm-like properties are known to be extremely robust both for an individual and for the system as a whole. The technical motivation is to make Internet data transfer: 1) scalable, 2) fault-tolerant, and 3) incentive-compatible, a trio of properties difficult to achieve using existing solutions. The research underlying uswarm will: 1) develop an in-network BitTorrent-like substrate deliver practically all data, not just large files, 2) exploit in-network storage and locality of data accesses, 3) analyze availability and human wait-time improvements of one large integrated swarm as opposed to BitTorrent-like isolated swarms, 4) analyze new traffic engineering knobs and routing choice naturally enabled by uswarm, 5) develop novel incentive strategies for integrated swarms accounting for network-level incentive issues, 6) analyze the interaction of selfish behavior with routing and congestion control using game-theoretic techniques. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: If successful, this project will fundamentally improve Internet data transfer by enabling: 1) critical information dissemination resistant to denial-of-information attacks, 2) delay-tolerant network applications, and 3) novel social networking applications. The proposed work includes undergraduate as well as international teaching and outreach activities integrated with the proposed research activities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project was to design, analyze, and implement a data  transfer architecture for the Internet based on swarms. This project  sought to integrate BitTorrent-like swarming ideas into general-purpose  Internet data transfer while taking into account the incentives for end  users, ISPs, and content providers. We sought to achieve this research  goal through a combination of architecture design, analytical modeling,  and prototype development. To this end, we made research contributions  focusing on enhancing swarming for end-users, content publishers, and  ISPs respectively.  (1) Improving swarming for end-users:   (a) We developed a model for content availability in swarming systems as  a function of the seed or leecher arrival rate, the time the spend in  the system, their upload bandwidth capacity, and the size of the file  being downloaded?  (b) We used the model to study the impact of bundling on content  availability and found that bundling, somewhat surprisingly,  exponentially reduces content unavailability for unpopular swarms.  (c) We designed and implemented a system that enhances incentives in  peer-to-peer live streaming compared to state-of-the-art research and  commercially deployed alternatives.  (d) We developed an Internet information plane that allows peer-to-peer  applications to efficiently obtain rich information about Internet path  properties enabling them to make better peer selection decisions.  (e) We analyzed the loss of efficiency in swarming systems that rely  only on direct reciprocity or a tit-for-tat-like strategy compared to  indirect reciprocity strategies and showed that the loss factor is at  most two.  (2) Improving swarming for content publishers:   (a) We designed and implemented a system that optimizes the allocation  of server bandwidth across multiple swarms in managed swarming systems.  Compared to state-of-the-art systems, this system uses less measurement  data, converges to a near-optimal allocation quickly, and can optimize a  variety of sophisticated multi-swarm objectives.  (b) We developed a model to analyze when a swarm is self-sustaining,  i.e., it needs little or no server bandwidth to sustain itself while  allowing peers to complete downloads.  (c) We analyzed incentives for content publishers to strategically use bundling to meet their economic goals.  (3) Improving swarming for networks:  (a) We analyzed the impact of location diversity, i.e., the ability to  download content from multiple potential locations, on network traffic  engineering, i.e., determining how to route traffic in a network so as  to prevent hotspots. Location diversity is characteristic of swarming  systems as well as more traditional content delivery networks. Our  results showed that location diversity significantly improves the  capacity of a network and can simplify network traffic engineering.  (b) We studied fundamental properties of multipath transport protocols  that shed light on multipoint-to-point transport characteristic of  swarming systems.  The research contributions describes above  resulted in many publications at premier networking venues including a  Best Paper Award at ACM CoNEXT 2009 and papers at USENIX NSDI, IEEE  INFOCOM, ACM SIGMETRICS among others.
