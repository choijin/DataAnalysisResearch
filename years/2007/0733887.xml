<AbstractNarration>The EDGE (Enhancing Diversity in Graduate Education) Program, introduced in 1998 with funding from the National Science Foundation, is a transition program for women designed to improve retention rates in graduate programs in mathematics. The program provides a supportive and positive learning environment for its women participants, one-half of whom are from underrepresented groups, in the summer prior to graduate school.  The EDGE Summer Program helps students anticipate and prepare for first-year difficulties. Support continues in the first year of graduate school by insuring that students have local mentors and are integrated into the social and academic community of their departments.  The EDGE Program addresses barriers that have been identified by many studies as detrimental to the success of women and minorities in graduate school, and provides new models for overcoming those barriers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This collaborative project between Bryn Mawr and Spelman Colleges will build on nine years of experience to advance the program's goals of improved retention for women and minority students, and further development and dissemination of effective models to achieve this goal.  The four major components of the project are: (1) renewal of the EDGE Summer Program for four years, 2008-2011; (2) concurrent workshops for targeted graduate and undergraduate faculty aimed at promoting collaboration among the EDGE Program and these departments; (3) a conference "Promoting Diversity at the Graduate Level in Mathematics: A National Forum" at the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute (MSRI) in Summer, 2008 (jointly funded by the National Security Agency); and (4) "Second-Generation" EDGE activities, including continuation of Regional Mentoring Clusters that extend the EDGE mentoring model to advanced graduate students, postdocs, and junior faculty in close geographical proximity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will ultimately diversify the mathematics community by creating models for mathematics programs and organizations that allow people from all backgrounds and cultures to thrive, advance, and contribute to the profession.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Mathematics Departments of Spelman College and Bryn Mawr College established, in 1998, a program to support women as they make the critical transition from college to graduate school to earn doctoral degrees in the mathematical sciences.   The resulting structure, called Enhancing Diversity in Graduate Education (EDGE), has grown into a nationally recognized, award winning program that provides academic enrichment, mentoring, networking and support intended to keep students actively involved in graduate work until degree completion.  The broader impact of this project is to diversify the mathematics community by the creation of models that support people from all backgrounds and cultures to thrive, advance, and contribute to the profession.     The major activities of this NSF project have been: (1) annual four-week summer sessions to assist with the transition to graduate school;  (2) mentoring activities that create a community of support for students during the graduate school years; (3) a national conference, "Promoting Diversity at the Graduate Level in Mathematics: A National Forum" and the resultant conference proceedings; and 4) a 2013 summer research program for undergraduate women.   Major outcomes:  As a result of the above activities this project has served:  to further  diversify the mathematics community at the level of Masters and Ph.D. holders  to provide new insights on issues that matter to women and underrepresented groups in their pursuit of advanced  degrees in the mathematical sciences   to disseminate  components of the model program and to contribute, through presentations and publications, to the national dialogue regarding attrition and  effective graduate program enhancements.   to encourage undergraduates to consider graduate school through a research experience.    From 2008 &ndash; 2012, an average of 14 beginning graduate students entered the EDGE Program each year.   The participants are all women, a group which is not equitably represented among U.S. doctoral recipients in the mathematical sciences.  Among all EDGE women, approximately 49% are from African American/Caribbean, Latino/Hispanic/Spanish origin, or American Indian/Alaskan/Hawaiian  populations,  groups much more severely  underrepresented in the mathematical sciences.    This commitment to diversity among the EDGE participants, as well as its faculty and staff, has always been a cornerstone of the EDGE Program.  Between its founding in 1998 and July 2012, 175 women entered the EDGE Program.  Of those EDGE participants who entered prior to 2007, almost 90% earned a graduate degree, demonstrating a very low attrition rate.  In addition, 40% had earned the doctorate degree by 2012, with many others still enrolled in graduate programs.   Among the Ph.D. recipients, 38% were from the underrepresented populations above. These rates, along with the responses of the doctoral recipients who completed the EDGE Ph.D. Survey, point to the effectiveness of the academic enrichment and mentoring activities.      The major contributions of this project have been to increase the diversity of graduate degree holders in the mathematical sciences: 1) by enhancing the ability of a diverse group of women to succeed in their respective graduate programs, and 2) by providing new perspectives on the challenges to diversity at the graduate level in mathematics.  Through the EDGE summer session for new graduates students, the electronic forum for maintaining connectivity through the EDGE website, and the mechanisms for follow-up mentoring of EDGE students, the structures established through the EDGE program have made a positive difference to many women and students from groups currently underrepresented at the graduate level in mathematics.  It is expected that this program will result in an increase in output of mathematical sciences doctorate from those underrepresented groups.    Results of this project have been disseminated through a conference proc...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
