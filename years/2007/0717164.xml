<AbstractNarration>Biological soil crusts are topsoil organo-sedimentary assemblages of microorganisms that are prevalent in arid lands, where the lack of water restricts the development of much higher plant cover. This study will build on a previous survey of microbial biodiversity in North American soil crusts by including the Mohave and Chihuahuan desert regions. With the addition of these data the hypothesis that there exists a great biogeographical divide in the distribution of microbes between hot and cold deserts can be tested. Research activities will include attempts to bring into culture a variety of microorganisms that have been detected but not yet studied. In all approaches, a combination of DNA-based methodologies and traditional microbiological and systematic techniques will be used. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A sustained effort in inventorying and describing microbial populations of soil crusts is crucial in order to understand the biogeochemical functions of deserts at large, and to safeguard them in the face of ever increasing anthropogenic disturbances. These efforts will likely enhance management and preservation of arid land ecosystems. Because the trial and error approach is not appropriate for ecosystems that are inherently slow-growing, such as soil crusts, explanatory and predictive abilities have to rely on a thorough mechanistic understanding of the environmental constraints and functional properties of these ecosystems, which hinges heavily on available inventories of the microbial diversity that sustains them.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The study of the geographical distributions of species (or biogeography), and how these distributions vary in time or as a response to external forces (such as environmental change) is one of the basic aspects of organismal and environmental biology.  Biogeography provides crucial scientific information that environmental managers and policy experts use in decision making.  While biogeography is a mature science as it pertains to plants and animals, the application of this discipline to microbes has lagged behind terribly, because until recently it was impossible to detect the presence of particular microbial species directly and with sufficient ease so as to delineate their distribution. In arid lands, where plant growth is restricted, microbes take over some of the "ecosystem services" that plants impart in less extreme climates, such as soil fertilization with organic matter and nutrients, or imparting soil with resistance to erosive forces.  This makes it the more important to understand the biogeography arid land microbes.      In our project we proposed to use high-throughput DNA-based techniques combined with traditional approaches in microbial ecology to study the biogeography of the microbes that make up the "biological soil crusts"of arid lands in Western North America. These are environmentally important parts of the soil that contribute to rangeland fertility, water retention, and soil erosion resistance.  We postulated a simple question: is there a "great divide" between the microbes present in Northern, cooler deserts and those in hotter more Southern provinces?      We conducted continental scale surveys of various types and detected interesting patterns of distribution for some types of microorganisms.  We found that the fungi, for example, tend to have distributions that correlate with the standard delimitation of biogeographical provinces, like the Sonoran, Chihuahan deserts or the Colorado Plateau.   Among organisms that are relevant to the nitrogen cycle, we found a trend for replacement of the Archaea ammonia oxidizers with bacterial ammonia oxidizers as one moved North.   For many other bacterial groups, our current methods proved insufficient to detect any patterns, if they existed, with one very important exception: the cyanobacteria. These organisms are photosynthetic and are in fact the ones that form the soil crusts themselves, in this sense being the basis for all other microbes and all ecosystem services that the crusts ultimately provide.  Cyanobacteria showed very clear patterns of distribution that matched the "great divide" hypotheses.  In fact, for the most common species of cyanobacteria we could not only prove the differential distribution between Northern and Southern sites, but we could also obtain evidence that this was due mainly to differences in temperature adaptation rather than to rainfall or other environmental factors.  Also importantly, the differences in temperature sensitivity between species was such that one could logically predict vast geographical shifts as a results of expected global warming for the next few decades. This is a first for keystone microbial species, and even when the environmental consequences of this predicted shift are yet to be gauged, it may be a transformative result in highlighting that the neglect that microorganismal distribution shifts have experience so far was not inconsequential.   Our results were published in the premier science magazine, Science, and attracted quite a bit of attention from the press worldwide.  Our efforts in research were inextricably woven with those in education: graduate and undergraduate students participated directly in the research. Three Ph.D. students involved in the program graduated successfully, and two of them just started their own laboratories as assistant professors in institutions of higher education.
