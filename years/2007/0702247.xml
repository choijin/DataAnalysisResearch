<AbstractNarration>The Partnership for Environmental Technology Education (PETE), in conjunction with the Advanced Technology Environmental Education Center (ATEEC), is implementing a comprehensive program designed to strengthen environmental science and technology programs at the nation's Tribal Colleges. Under the guidance of a Tribal College Steering Committee, the project provides one-on-one technical assistance to nine Tribal Colleges and develops an Environmental Fellows Institute for tribal college faculty, as well as for a limited number of high schools and 4-year colleges that have articulation agreements with Tribal Colleges. Additional deliverables include an expanded Best Practices Guidebook for environmental technology programs and online resources. Project outcomes are being disseminated to all 34 Tribal Colleges, as well as the 1,200 members of the American Association of Community Colleges. This project serves Tribal Colleges across the nation by making their environmental science and technology programs reflect the beliefs and contributions of Native people.</AbstractNarration>

Supplemental Funding  In July 2010 National PETE applied for and received supplemental funds from NSF to hold a needs assessment workshop for Pacific Rim Community Colleges. The long-term goal was to assess the interest and potential to develop a full Pacific Rim Environmental Capacity Building ATE Project, to assist in the environmental areas of wastewater, solid waste, nonpoint source pollution, drinking water and overall terrestrial pollution. The needs assessment was held in March 2011 with participation by Kirk Laflin, Zetra Wheeler, Ellen Kabat-Lensch, Sarah Gross, and representatives from Guam Community College, University of Guam, American Samoa Community College, Northern Marianas College, and Honolulu Community College. Outcomes included overwhelming enthusiasm and support in favor of developing such an initiative, particularly as a combined initiative with Tribal Colleges (since the two populations face very similar struggles in regards to environmental education).    Environmental Program Summit &amp; Program Materials Distribution  To extend technical and program assistance in a more comprehensive manner, PETE hosted a summit June 20-21, 2012 in Minneapolis, MN ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
