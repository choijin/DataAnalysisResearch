<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0753874&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Donald Babbitt, Srinivasa R. Varadhan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main theme of the conference will be important recent results&lt;br/&gt;and outstanding problems in the fields of representation theory&lt;br/&gt;of finite and infinite dimensional Lie and super-Lie groups, and&lt;br/&gt;its applications to quantum computing, geometry, physics, and&lt;br/&gt;differential equations, the different areas being unified under&lt;br/&gt;the over-arching theme of symmetry manifested in geometric&lt;br/&gt;actions of groups and their representations. The speakers will be&lt;br/&gt;internationally recognized researchers in these fields and the&lt;br/&gt;audience is expected to be a mixture of senior researchers in&lt;br/&gt;these fields together with advanced graduate students, postdocs&lt;br/&gt;and junior faculty who aspire to make or already are making&lt;br/&gt;important contributions to these fields. There will be travel&lt;br/&gt;funds made available to select participants of the latter group&lt;br/&gt;with a special emphasis on women and underrepresented&lt;br/&gt;minorities. It should be pointed out that four of the twelve&lt;br/&gt;speakers are women. The background to the conference consists of&lt;br/&gt;the work on supersymmetry pioneered by the physicists such as&lt;br/&gt;Zumino, and Ferrara (both speakers at the conference), and the&lt;br/&gt;work of the mathematicians Kac, Moody, and others who brought&lt;br/&gt;focus to infinite dimensional Lie algebras and their applications&lt;br/&gt;to quantum field theory. In the 1990's the group theoretic point&lt;br/&gt;of view was applied successfully to the theory of meromorphic&lt;br/&gt;differential equations and their moduli. Very recently important&lt;br/&gt;new progress has been made by the development of a supersymmetric&lt;br/&gt;Mackey theory and its applications to super particle&lt;br/&gt;classification, by work on differential Galois group theory of&lt;br/&gt;difference equations, and by the work on the foundations of&lt;br/&gt;super-geometry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Symmetry is one of the most fundamental and useful notions in&lt;br/&gt;both mathematics and theoretical physics. For example it explains&lt;br/&gt;the mysteries of the periodic table of chemical elements such as&lt;br/&gt;why hydrogen and oxygen combine to make water. An example of&lt;br/&gt;symmetry is the following; consider an ordinary square made with&lt;br/&gt;wire, rotate it 90 degrees about its center and notice it comes&lt;br/&gt;back onto itself although the molecules of the wire have&lt;br/&gt;moved. Do it again, you still get the same square. When you do it&lt;br/&gt;the fourth time, i.e., you rotate it 360 degrees the molecules of&lt;br/&gt;the wire come back to where they started. In mathematical&lt;br/&gt;language this says that &amp;#147;the cyclic group of order 4&amp;#148; is&lt;br/&gt;the symmetry group of the square. It is a wonder that the notion&lt;br/&gt;of symmetry and group can be extended and enriched to explain&lt;br/&gt;complicated sub-atomic physical phenomena as well as solve&lt;br/&gt;fundamental problems in mathematics coming from areas such as&lt;br/&gt;cryptography. The symmetries to be considered in this conference&lt;br/&gt;are part of this same story. Of perhaps particular interest is&lt;br/&gt;the theoretical notion of supersymmetry used in the study of&lt;br/&gt;sub-particle physics. The founder of this notion, B. Zumino, will&lt;br/&gt;speak at this conference. It is presently a theoretical&lt;br/&gt;hypothesis that many believe to be true but which awaits&lt;br/&gt;experimental verification. It is one of the main goals at the&lt;br/&gt;European Center for Nuclear Research (CERN) in Geneva to use its&lt;br/&gt;multi-billion dollar Hadron Collider which comes on line in 2008&lt;br/&gt;to experimentally establish the supersymmetry hypothesis.

This award is funded jointly by the&lt;br/&gt;programs in Geometric Analysis, Probability, and Algebra, Number&lt;br/&gt;Theory, and Combinatorics.</AbstractNarration>
