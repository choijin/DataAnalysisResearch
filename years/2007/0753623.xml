<AbstractNarration>SES-0753623&lt;br/&gt;Gail Smith &lt;br/&gt;CUNY &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SES-0753656 &lt;br/&gt;Janet Weiss &lt;br/&gt;University of Michigan Ann Arbor &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SES-0753628&lt;br/&gt;Steven Salley &lt;br/&gt;Wayne State University &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SES-0753641 &lt;br/&gt;Karen Klomparens &lt;br/&gt;Michigan State University &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The City University of New York (CUNY), the University of Michigan (U-M), Michigan State University (MSU), and Wayne State University (WSU) are among the Top 25 Institutions awarding baccalaureate and doctoral degrees in the social, behavioral and economic (SBE) sciences to underrepresented minorities. In addition, these institutions have documented success in meeting AGEP goals in the STEM (science, technology engineering and mathematics) fields. CUNY is currently part of a MAGNET/STEM AGEP alliance partnered with the New Jersey Institute of Technology, Polytechnic University and Stevens Institute of Technology. U-M, MSU and WSU partner with Western Michigan University to form the Michigan AGEP Alliance (MAA).  CUNY and the Michigan AGEP Alliance (MAA), consisting of the University of Michigan, Michigan State University and Wayne State University combined efforts and formed a new regional alliance to advance the production of underrepresented minorities (i.e., African American, Hispanics, American Indians, Asian/Pacific Islanders) in the social, behavioral and economic sciences (SBE) at the B.S. through Ph.D. and early career levels.  Alliance institutions are both sharing resources and best practices across the alliance and including SBE fields in existing AGEP programs. The CUNY/MAA Alliance for the SBE sciences has increased participation in summer research programs, expanded recruitment and research opportunities for social sciences students, further developed targeted relationships with minority-serving institutions, provided across the alliance student mentoring and mentoring training for faculty, coordinated skill building workshops to help ensure graduate study success and enhanced fellowship support.  It has also expanded student support groups, teaching opportunities, teacher training workshops, students' attendance at professional workshops, and postdoctoral and early career education.  This grant funds a continuation of these efforts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Project broader impacts will be through the institutionalization of a larger pool of individuals studying and conducting research in the SEE disciplines through the utilization of effective strategies that will attract, motivate, and train domestic talent, especially among underrepresented minorities, women and persons with disabilities. The result of these activities will be to advance understanding of the role of the social and behavioral sciences in the nation, as well as to strengthen the national workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

All doctoral students in Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences (SBES) fields in CUNY/ MAA (CUNY/Michigan AGEP Alliance) were eligible to participate in all program activities. Students in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) disciplines also participated.  The major goals of the (SBES) Alliance for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (AGEP) program grant awarded to the CUNY Graduate Center were 1) to increase the applicant pool of students from historically under-represented groups in the Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences and, importantly, 2) to increase the number of doctoral degrees conferred in this demographic and to prepare them for professional careers, especially in the academy.  Through proactive recruitment that targeted underrepresented groups in SBES, CUNY was able to increase minority applications and to lift enrollments in this demographic in absolute numbers from an average per year of 196 in the pre-grant period to an average of 245 in the final grant period--- up by 25%.

The majority of these support services have been institutionalized.  Students from all SBES fields who participated in these activities, but especially those from the funded disciplines, which included anthropology, criminal justice, economics, educational  psychology, political science, psychology, sociology,and urban education, benefited academically and socially, as well as financially.  Intellectual merit: Participating students met regularly in monthly colloquia not only with doctoral students from their own discipline, but with those from other SBES disciplines, as well as from their peers in STEM fields.  In discussing their research, students learned how disciplines other than their own advance knowledge and benefit society.  Additional interdisciplinary perspectives for broader impact were afforded through the annual conferences held at the CUNY Graduate Center at which undergraduates, graduates, postdoctoral fellows, faculty, administrators, and policy makers from around the country presented  their research, shared views and engaged intellectually on panels and in workshops.
