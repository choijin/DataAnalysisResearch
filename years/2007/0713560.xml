<AbstractNarration>Severe physical and cognitive disabilities make it difficult or impossible to perform activities of daily living (ADL). The primary objective of the proposed interdisciplinary research and development effort is to assist persons with physical disabilities to perform ADLs using a smart 9-degree-of-freedom modular wheelchair-mounted robotic arm system. The user interface will employ a haptic device with force reflection. Advanced control algorithms for combining the mobility of the wheelchair with the manipulation of the robotic arm will be developed; and sensor-based velocity scaling and assist functions will be used to enhance manipulation range and accuracy for the severely disabled.  This will be done by addressing a set of fundamental human-robot coordination and control issues: (1) design of system architecture for sensor assisted scaled teleoperation and (2) combined mobility and manipulation in a task-optimized control scheme. This work will provide a broader impact to both the engineering community and the health sciences community by innovative research in rehabilitation robotics and its integration with education at the undergraduate and graduate levels.  Besides assisting people with disabilities to do activities of daily living, the proposed project would strengthen their job prospects by providing better solutions to improve work place performance.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project is to design a smart wheelchair mounted robotic arm (WMRA) system that can enhance the capabilities and reduce the mental burden for wheelchair-bound persons with disabilities. We designed and built a smart and modular wheelchair mounted robotic arm system that is capable of performing intelligent tasks autonomously or with operator assistance.  A.    Research Activities:  1-      Hardware Development: Two prototypes of robotic arms with 7 joints are designed and built. Each robotic arm is attached to a power wheelchair for user operation. An ergonomic gripper was designed and developed specifically for Activities of Daily Living (ADL) tasks. Vision and laser range finding capabilities have been added. A Central Control Unit with emergency stop functionality was designed for each prototype. A wiring harness was designed and manufactured for the prototypes. A modular headrest assembly has been designed and mounted to the WMRA platform, and Kinect sensor is mounted on it for depth information. The wheelchair was modified to include sensors for wheel motion and computer-based control of the wheelchair motion.  2-      Theoretical Contributions and Application to the WMRA: Theoretical work is made and implemented on the WMRA that gives the needed flexibility to the manipulator to avoid joint limits, obstacles, singularities and to increase its maneuverability. Furthermore, the wheelchair itself carries mobility capabilities and was utilized to expand the armÆs workspace by combining the mobility of the wheelchair and the manipulation of the arm in a single control algorithm. Theoritical work and implementation also included providing and optimizing two trajectories (for the wheelchair and for the arm) to be followed with maximum leverage possible. A real-time software control system has been developed and implemented to provide quick response to userÆs commands. Wheelchair localization and mapping was developed to enable the wheelchair to build a map of the environment and localize itself in that map for navigation.

This helps users with tremor and it enhances the ability of users with limited upper body motion to easily control the WMRA.  3-      Virtual Reality Simulation: A 3D virtual reality simulation environment for ADL tasks was developed and modified to be used with human subjects to virtually perform specific tasks in the virtual environment before performing them using the physical WMRA system.  4-      User Interface: Several user interface options were implemented, including a spaceball, a joystick, a touch screen, voice command and eye tracking system. The most notable user interface implemented for people with severe disabilities, such as ALS patients, is the brain computer interface (BCI). The scene streaming from the onboard camera is adaptively segmented to a grid of cells that contain the segmented objects. The user communicates a choice of object and task using BCI that utilizes the userÆs EEG signals from the brain and enables individuals to communicate with WMRA without using any neuromuscular function.
