<AbstractNarration>Recent advances in multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) technology show that much higher spectrum efficiency and capacity gain can be achieved by the use of multiple antennas at a node. The benefits of substantial improvement in capacity at no cost to additional spectrums have positioned MIMO as a breakthrough technology in wireless communications. Although MIMO is an active research area in the wireless communications community, there is very limited knowledge on how to apply MIMO technologies to improve network capacity in a multi-hop wireless network environment, perhaps because unlike existing wireless mesh networks, which are conceptually simple and relatively easy to characterize, the mathematical characterization of a MIMO-based mesh network involves space domain and requires complex matrix operations. Specifically, the unique MIMO channel matrix and potential spatial multiplexing introduce new research problems at multiple layers. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project aims to systematically address fundamental theories and algorithms for future MIMO-enabled mesh networks. Specifically, there are three main thrusts in this project: (1) developing tractable cross-layer matrix representation and theoretical models from a networking perspective; (2) conducting analysis of theoretical bounds and capacity limits for MIMO networks; and (3) developing distributed algorithms for MIMO networks.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;An important objective of this project is to develop cross-disciplinary educational materials and courses. The plan is to bridge the gap between computer networking and wireless communications curriculums via new cross-disciplinary courses. In addition, this project also includes research experience for undergraduates and special opportunities for under-represented students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
