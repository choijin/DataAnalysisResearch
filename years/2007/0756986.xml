<AbstractNarration>Through a partnership with three community colleges (Columbus State Community College, Stark State College of Technology and Washington State Community College) the Ohio State University is working in three distinct socioeconomic regions of the state to recruit and retain a broad population of STEM majors. A summer bridge program with curricular and industrial or research internship components introduces pre-college students to career options and guides them into appropriate secondary school and post-secondary options aimed at reducing the necessity for remediation at the college and university level. A second bridge program for transfer students from community colleges is reducing the barriers to success at university. Finally, peer-mentoring and academic support structures are in place within all of the collaborating institutions to maintain continuous support for the students through graduation. The intellectual merit of the project's activities rests on the large scale implementation of successful approaches for supporting a broad range of STEM students. Strong disciplinary faculty involvement and collaboration across the four campuses is also present, as well as significant institutional support. The broader impacts of the project lie in its establishment of a successful model of collaboration across STEM disciplines and among constituent two-year colleges and a major university. Secondly, the project has a self-sustaining capacity through the training of students to be mentors before they graduate and the provision of opportunities for them to continue mentoring after graduation.</AbstractNarration>

The intellectual merit of the project was a coordinated effort to increase STEM retention and degree completion at all partner institutions with an emphasis on first-generation students and underrepresented populations. Over the 6 years of offering the bridge program at OSU, the demographics were 60% URM, 45% Female (underrepresented in engineering), and 41% First-generation.  The 2009 baseline STEM population at OSU overall was 8% URM, 32% female and 17% first generation. STEM degree completion increased at all institutions during the award period (Figure 1).  The change in number of STEM majors at each institution is also shown. The small 8% change at OSU represents over 1000 students while the 6% decrease at Washington State Community College represents 13 students  The CSCC OSTEP program implemented numerous changes to campus, including a summer bridge (first-time for the institution) and STEM club that together comprise the STEM program.  CSCC and OSU also leveraged a Choose Ohio First (COF) scholarship program through the Ohio Board of Regents called "Future Scientists of Ohio" (FSO).  These scholarships were offered to CSCC OSTEP participants and qualifying students could also get an equivalent scholarship at OSU after transferring. Through these changes, the CSCC OSTEP students performed considerably better either graduating or transferring than the control group as shown in Figure 2.

At WSCC, the percent of students moving on to Calculus II from Calculus I increased from 12% to 31% and 50% of incoming students tested higher on the Math Compass as a result of OSTEP activities. WSCC and OSU physics instructors have developed a collaborative teaching program.  The physics instructors collaborate to introduce WSCC physics students to the workings of a four-year university by synchronizing their academic calendars and using the same course materials to prepare them for eventual transfer to a four-year institution.  Continuity has greatly enhanced the program by having the same physics instructors involved from both institutions since the program inception.  Physics students from WSCC have participated in recitation activities on the OSU campus, as well as campus tours.   The FSO participants at CSCC were also tracked for graduation rate (Table 1). The 2010 entering cohort of students from CSCC did not participate in the CSCC OSTEP program but the 2011 cohort did participate.
