    <AbstractNarration>A major objective of the Chemical Oceanography Gordon Research Conference is to bring together every two years leading members of the scientific community, graduate students, and post docs to discuss new, cutting-edge research projects in marine chemistry within an informal setting. In 2007, the Chemical Oceanography Gordon Research Conference will be held August 5-10, 2007 at the Tilton School in New Hampshire. The theme of the conference will be "Scientific Diversity of Chemical Oceanography" and will emphasize the large diversity in problems, techniques, and disciplines addressed in the field of chemical oceanography. Presentations and discussions at the 2007 Gordon Conference will center around the following session topics: (1) Gases in the Ocean; (2) CO2 and Productivity; (3) Nutrients: Phosphate/Nitrate/Nitrite Isotopes; (4) Sediment Geochemistry; (5) Marine Chemical Technology and Sensors; (6) Marine Organic Geochemistry; (7) On the Road towards GEOTRACES: Global Trace Element and Isotope Distributions; (8) Microbes, Metals, and Biota-metal Interactions; and (9) Geochemical Paleoclimate. The Chemical Oceanography Gordon Research Conference has become recognized as an important venue to exchange ideas in the interdisciplinary field of marine chemistry and to forge new scientific alliances. For this reason, the National Science Foundation, along with the Gordon Research Conference, will co-sponsor the participation of 15 graduate student/post docs and 32 invited speakers/discussion leaders in the 2007 Chemical Oceanography Gordon Research Conference.</AbstractNarration>
