<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;PI: Robert A. Bindschadler &lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 0732906&lt;br/&gt;Collaborative With: McPhee 0732804, Holland 0732869, Truffer 0732730, Stanton 0732926, Anandakrishnan 0732844 &lt;br/&gt;Title: Collaborative Research: IPY: Ocean-Ice Interaction in the Amundsen Sea Sector of West Antarctica&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Office of Polar Programs, Antarctic Integrated and System Science Program has made this award to support an interdisciplinary study of the effects of the ocean on the stability of glacial ice in the most dynamic region the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, namely the Pine Island Glacier in the Amundsen Sea Embayment.  The collaborative project builds on the knowledge gained by the highly successful West Antarctic Ice Sheet program and is being jointly sponsored with NASA.  Recent observations indicate a significant ice loss, equivalent to 10% of the ongoing increase in sea-level rise, in this region. These changes are largest along the coast and propagate rapidly inland, indicating the critical impact of the ocean on ice sheet stability in the region.  While a broad range of remote sensing and ground-based instrumentation is available to characterize changes of the ice surface and internal structure (deformation, ice motion, melt) and the shape of the underlying sediment and rock bed, instrumentation has yet to be successfully deployed for observing boundary layer processes of the ocean cavity which underlies the floating ice shelf and where rapid melting is apparently occurring.  Innovative, mini ocean sensors that can be lowered through boreholes in the ice shelf (about 500 m thick) will be developed and deployed to automatically provide ocean profiling information over at least three years.  Their data will be transmitted through a conducting cable frozen in the borehole to the surface where it will be further transmitted via satellite to a laboratory in the US.  Geophysical and remote sensing methods (seismic, GPS, altimetry, stereo imaging, radar profiling) will be applied to map the geometry of the ice shelf, the shape of the sub ice-shelf cavity, the ice surface geometry and deformations within the glacial ice.  To integrate the seismic, glaciological and oceanographic observations, a new 3-dimensional coupled ice-ocean model is being developed which will be the first of its kind. NASA is supporting satellite based research and the deployment of a robotic-camera system to explore the environment in the ocean cavity underlying the ice shelf and NSF is supporting all other aspects of this study.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts:  This project is motivated by the potential societal impacts of rapid sea level rise and should result in critically needed improvements in characterizing and predicting the behavior of coupled ocean-ice systems.  It is a contribution to the International Polar Year and was endorsed by the International Council for Science as a component of the "Multidisciplinary Study of the Amundsen Sea Embayment" proposal #258 of the honeycomb of endorsed IPY activities.  The research involves substantial international partnerships with the British Antarctic Survey and the University of Bristol in the UK.  The investigators will partner with the previously funded "Polar Palooza" education and outreach program in addition to undertaking a diverse set of outreach activities of their own.  Eight graduate students and one undergraduate as well as one post doc will be integrated into this research project.   &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Ice flows from the interior of Antarctica to the coast and then forms ice shelves (floating masses of ice with ocean water beneath).  These shelves act as buttresses or supports holding the interior ice in. If removed, the interior ice can flow faster, resulting in more-rapid sea level rise.   The goal of this project is to understand the interaction of the ocean and ice (heat, mass and salt fluxes) at the sub-ice-shelf boundary and to incorporate this knowledge into a coupled model that includes dynamics of the ocean and of the ice along with their interaction.  In this project, we focused on the Pine Island Glacier (abbreviated PIG).  PIG is a fast-flowing (and rapidly-changing) glacier in West Antarctica that is responsible for a significant fraction of the mass loss from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS). Because PIG has a large and active ice shelf, it was a prime target for investigating the links between ocean properties and circulation and ice shelf stability.  In order to accomplish this goal, we conducted a multi-pronged effort to map the ice shelf with radar (with the help of the NASA Operation Ice Bridge project and the British Antarctic Survey airborne radar facility); we next mapped the underside of the ice shelf - the cavity beneath the ice shelf that contains ocean water - using seismic measurements.  Finally, we drilled a hole through the ice shelf to deploy instruments that could measure the temperature, salt-content, and flow speed of that ocean water.  We deployed GPS and seismic instruments and left them in place after we had left the field site.  We successfully measured and quantified the ice shelf and the sub-ice-shelf cavity with radar, seismic, and gravity methods.  We found that all three need to be brought to bear in order to make a complete picture of the system.  We successfully drilled through the PIG ice shelf and profiled the ocean water beneath (for the first time ever in Antarctica).  We found that there was significant inflow from the open ocean that affects the melt-rate of the ice (and in turn the stability of the ice-shelf/glacier system).  We engaged graduate students and early-career scientists to work in the field on the data afterwards.  We engaged with the public with a web presence and social media such as blogs.  The success of this project depended critically on support from the civilian contractors and the military partners who enable science in Antarctica, and we thank them for their invaluable help.
