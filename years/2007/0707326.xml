    <AbstractNarration>Exploring the course of human evolution extends beyond the discovery and description of the fossils of early humans. To understand the evolutionary processes that led to key human features such as upright walking, a large brain, tool manufacture and use, and behavioral flexibility, it is necessary to develop a context for these innovations. What were the environmental forces that shaped and directed human evolution? Human evolution is a consequence of the interactions of early hominids with their physical and biological surroundings and there is a need to specifically reconstruct these parameters in association with discoveries of hominids. Documenting paleoenvironments at a relevant scale in the terrestrial record and developing causal links between evolution and environmental change, however, remains difficult. As a result, aspects of human evolution have been interpreted in the context of environmental data from the marine record, which provide a detailed record of large scale climatic change. This approach is valid only if links between global or regional phenomena and specific shifts in local hominid ecosystems can be demonstrated. &lt;br/&gt;This proposal seeks to address directly these issues by examining a series of environmental indicators to develop a high-resolution paleoenvironmental framework for a hominid-bearing sequence in the East African Rift Valley. This can then be linked to global climate changes. The work has at its focus a 2-3 million year old sedimentary sequence exposed in the Tugen Hills, a fault block within the rift valley near Lake Baringo in Kenya. This sequence exhibits abrupt and repeated cycling of major freshwater lake systems reflecting fluctuating climatic conditions. In recent research, this project has established a clear link between these short term oscillations (every 23 thousand yrs) and Milankovitch cycles that result from variations in the solar radiation received at the top of the atmosphere, controlled by variations in the geometry of the earth''s orbit. These changes represent the major driving force in the earth climate system through time, including glacial-interglacial cycles. Thirty-six vertebrate fossil localities, including three hominid sites, can be linked directly to this sequence, providing an opportunity to establish patterns of response by animals and vegetation to these short term shifts. &lt;br/&gt;This research represents the first attempt to develop multiple environmental and ecological indicators that can be linked directly to Milankovitch cycling in a terrestrial rift valley context. These data will be used to generate insights into the evolutionary response of hominid ecosystems to these pervasive climatic oscillations over the last six million years in Africa. While these data relate directly to fossil hominids and their vertebrate communities in the Baringo Basin, linking local ecological shifts with orbitally-forced patterns of insolation affords the prospect of extrapolating the affects of climatic oscillations on terrestrial ecosystems regionally in the past. With these data, we can begin to formulate high-resolution models for interpreting correlations between climate and human evolution, and elucidate the role of environmental change as a potential driving force in mammalian evolution in general and human evolution in particular. This research will foster highly interdisciplinary and collaborative studies, essential in developing perspectives of the multi-dimensional links between evolution and ecology. The project outlined here represents an ideal forum in which to generate and integrate research ideas cutting across traditionally disparate academic disciplines. The study will broaden opportunities and enable the participation of graduate students as well as research personnel from the National Museums of Kenya.</AbstractNarration>
