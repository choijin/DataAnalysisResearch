<AbstractNarration>The University of Arkansas will provide an integrated research experience for three cohorts of 10 undergraduate students, each working with federally recognized Native American Tribes in Oklahoma, Nebraska, and South Dakota.  Students will begin with a two-week immersion course on Experimental Design and an Exploration of Sustainability Ethics across cultures (Module 1), followed by a six week Research Experience (Module 2), and concluding with a one week intensive program in Data Analysis and Scientific Communications (module 3) where students will draft, review, revise, and submit written and oral reports of their work. The focus of the work will be measuring, managing, and restoring ecosystem services in a sustainable framework. The REU program will develop student skills thru the process of developing testable hypotheses, collecting and analyzing data, and communicating results in both oral and in written form.  The cohort groups will work with a faculty advisor from the Project Team, as well as Environmental Program Officers within the Cherokee, Pawnee and Santee Sioux Nation Tribal programs.  The program will emphasize the process of science, the ethic of sustainability, and the cultural connections of ecology with tribal traditions. Students will work with faculty and graduate students on projects ranging from GIS-land use analysis to nutrient spiraling in streams to bird/mammal surveys in riparian zones. More information is available at http://www.baeg.uark.edu/REUSustainableTribes/, or by contacting Dr Marty Matlock at mmatlock@uark.edu or 479/575-2849.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The University of Arkansas conducted a ten-week Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) during the summers of 2008-2010 which  provided opportunities for field- and laboratory-based research in measuring and designing ecological services.  The program was designed for undergraduate students having completed at least three semesters of coursework. Specific efforts were made to recruit Native American students and other under-represented groups in STEM fields.  Under the supervision and mentorship of University of Arkansas Faculty, thirty-nine REU students conducted a total of twenty-three scientific investigations across a range of topics, including Ozark cave water quality, Ozark bird ecology, sustainability of water resources for the Cherokee Nation, growth and production of biofuel from algae, and the use of nanoparticles to enhance biobutanol production.  While some students arrived to the REU with basic scientific research experience, most had minimal exposure to the scientific method. During the first week of the program professors and instructors from a variety of fields led the students through discussions and lectures in order to provide them with the conceptual framework needed to conduct research. These activities included information on basic lab procedures, computer software training, literature research methods, and ecology topics among others. This specific program also included ethics and culture topics such as "Exploration of Sustainability Ethics Across Cultures". In addition to faculty-led seminars, REU students participated in guest lecturers from a mixture of sources including the University of North Carolina, the Natural Resources Department of the Cherokee Nation, and the Cherokee Native Art and Plant Society. The lectures offered to the students were an integral part of the overall research experience.  Our goal was to identify those students who showed promise and drive but perhaps needed the intense emersion experience that the REU provides in order to find their passion and focus.  While three cohort groups of thirty-nine students is too small of a sample to determine if this goal is being met, the anecdotal evidence supports the effectiveness of this approach.  To date, students from this REU program have achieved significant thresholds in their scientific careers including publication in peer reviewed journals of three articles with REU students as lead authors. Also, seven students have made presentations at national conferences, and at least nine so far have entered graduate school, studying science.
