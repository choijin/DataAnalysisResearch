    <AbstractNarration>The funding is to support the Gordon Research Conference on Protein Folding Dynamics addressing the methods and models of protein folding. The meeting will take place at the Four Points Sheraton Harbortown, Ventura, California from January 6-11, 2008.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Protein folding is a multidisciplinary area of research addressing one of the fundamental problems in biology. Technological and theoretical advances have altered our view of how protein folding occurs. &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact of the Activity: The Gordon Research Conference in Protein Folding Dynamics, is a relatively new conference, set up to specifically bring experiment and theory together to explore advances in the field, and as a forum to discuss fundamental problems from polypeptide energetics and dynamics; to chaperone assisted folding. Additionally, it supports a number of young scientists to attend and participate in the meeting. The priority will be given to students from less well-represented institutions and/or research groups to give these young people the opportunity to participate and contribute to the meeting.</AbstractNarration>
