<AbstractNarration>Through an integrated program of classroom, field, and laboratory experiences, REU/RET participants will study biogeochemical cycles and their influence on ecosystem dynamics over time by examining carbon cycling and storage in soils and sediments in headwater watersheds. Students will examine the impacts of different surface coal mining methods on carbon budgets and erosion in forested and mined watersheds in the Southeastern Kentucky Appalachian Region employing the technique of carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analysis of soils and sediments. Up to 24 undergraduate student and 10 teacher participants will each develop an independent research project related to carbon cycling; collect field soil or sediment samples, prepare and analyze samples on an isotope ratio mass spectrometer, interpret the data; and then present their results at an in-house conference.  The educational strategies focus on student-mentor scientific interaction and student-cluster investigation of the environmental sciences from a carbon cycling perspective.   The intellectual merits include advancement in undergraduate education as well as scientific publication by undergraduate authors and faculty mentors.  Scientific advancement will include gaining a better understanding of advantages/disadvantages of carbon and nitrogen isotope measurements for soil organic carbon and lignite investigations.  In addition, the factors impacting carbon storage and turnover on mined sites will be statistically analyzed and used to better understand environmental processes.  Finally, the carbon flux as induced by erosion of mined lands will be quantified under different management scenarios, and the efficacy of isotopic measurements to understand the quality of carbon and nutrients transported in coal mining watersheds will be advanced.  Broader impacts include participation of underrepresented groups including students and teachers from the Eastern Kentucky Appalachian Distressed Communities.  In addition, a broader impact of the research will be benefits to society that include budgeting the impact of coal energy harvesting on the environment.  Finally, this research will enhance the teaching and research infrastructure at the University of Kentucky and Eastern Kentucky University.</AbstractNarration>
