<AbstractNarration>Michigan Technological University will collaborate with David Heil and Associates to implement the Family Engineering Program, working in conjunction with student chapters of engineering societies such as the American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE), the Society of Hispanic Professionals (SHP) and a host of youth and community organizations. The Family Engineering Program is designed to increase technological literacy by introducing children ages 5-12 and their parents/caregivers to the field of engineering using the principles of design. The project will reach socio-economically diverse audiences in the upper peninsula of Michigan including Native American, Hispanic, Asian, and African American families. The secondary audience includes university STEM majors, informal science educators, and STEM professionals that are trained to deliver the program to families. A well-researched five step engineering design process utilized in the school-based Engineering is Elementary curriculum will be incorporated into mini design challenges and activities based in a variety of fields such as agricultural, chemical, environmental, and biomedical engineering. Deliverables include the Family Engineering event model, Family Engineering Activity Guide, Family Engineering Nights, project website, and facilitator training workshops. The activity guide will be pilot tested, field tested, and disseminated for use in urban, suburban, and rural settings. Strategic impact will result from the development of content-rich engineering activities for families and the dissemination of a project model that incorporates the expertise of engineering and educational professionals at multiple levels of implementation. It is anticipated that 300 facilitators and 7,000-10,000 parents and children will be directly impacted by this effort, while facilitator training may result in more than 27,000 program participants.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of the Family Engineering program is to actively engage elementary-age youth in exploring engineering activities and career opportunities with their parents.  The program addresses both national and global needs for increasing the number and diversity of individuals interested in and skilled in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).  Family Engineering promotes 21st Century skills of inquiry, creativity, teamwork, and collaborative problem solving and can be used by individuals and organizations to plan and conduct successful community outreach events that increase public understanding and appreciation of engineering and the role it plays in everyday life.  Modeled after the popular publications Family Science (1999) and Family Math (1986) a new publication titled Family Engineering:  An Activity and Event Planning Guide (2011) serves as a valuable resource for professional engineering societies and student chapters of those societies as well as formal and informal educators who want to host a Family Engineering event in their community.  With support from the National Science Foundation, hands-on activities that introduce families to traditional and integrated engineering disciplines and concepts were developed by a team of experienced curriculum developers. The activities  have been reviewed by professional educators and engineers and have been field tested at over 40 events in California, Connecticut, Georgia, Michigan, Mississippi, Puerto Rico, Utah, and Wisconsin to determine their suitability for a wide range of settings and audiences.  Formative evaluation guided development and once completed, summative evaluation conducted by an independent evaluation team measured program impact and the efficacy of the programÆs design, resource materials, and event formats.  Findings indicate that Family Engineering activities and events are fun and engaging, result in families having an increased appreciation and understanding of engineering, and parents gain an increased confidence and willingness to encourage their children to consider a career in engineering.
