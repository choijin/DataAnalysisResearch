<AbstractNarration>In this project, a team of investigators will develop new algorithms and software to simultaneously align DNA sequences and reconstruct phylogenetic trees. This methods and theory-oriented project addresses an important problem in phylogenetic reconstruction: relatively poor performance of existing tools in the face of insertions, deletions, and duplications in large datasets. This project will develop a simultaneous approach to DNA sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis that will allow researchers to overcome these problems. Specific goals for the project will be to develop a portal and open-source software for simultaneous alignment and phylogenetic analysis, develop new simulators to model DNA sequence evolution, establish a working group on alignment methods with the Assembling the Tree of Life (AToL) community, and develop training programs in alignment and phylogeny estimation with outreach activities to minority institutions. The project includes many members of the Cyberinfrastructure for Phylogenetic Research (CIPRES) project and will provide significant new analytic capabilities for that data resource. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By making simultaneous alignment and phylogenetic analysis feasible for very large datasets, this project will provide software tools that will serve a broad community of researchers conducting phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequence data. These tools will enable consideration of DNA regions for phylogenetic analysis that cannot be aligned using existing tools. An open-source, portal interface will open multiple sequence alignment and tree-building to a broader range of users and engagement of existing AToL users will provide input and evaluation early in the software development process.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Leebens-Mack lab has contributed to the NSF-funded research grant Large-scale simultaneous multiple alignment and phylogeny estimation by providing collaborators with insights into the utiity and usability of software being developed by the grant while at the same time reaching out to colleagues and students across the life sciences to help them understand how these tools can be used to better understand the processes that generate biological diversity.  Intellectual Merit - The research performed by this grant has greatly advanced biologists' ability to use massive and growing sequence datasets to generate multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic trees.  By placing gene sequences into phylogenetic trees, researchers are better able to understand how genetic changes following gene duplication and speciation events are contributing to increased biological diversity and the evolution of new gene functions.  This historical perspective on biological diversity is producing new insights into the molecular basis of adaptations to the biotic and abiotic challenges faced by all organisms.  In some instances, this insight is leading to the development and refinement of agricultural commodities and medical treatments.  Broader Impacts - The tree of life provides a powerful historical context for organizing and understanding the massive amount of data being generated across the life sciences.  In addition to the impact that the research tools developed by this project are having on our ability to organize data within a historical context, the active-learning teaching tools we have developed are helping students and colleagues better understand how to use comparative approaches to address both fundamental and applied research problems.  For example, our analysis tools have been used to place millions of protein coding gene sequences derived from hundreds of green plant species (from algae to flowering plants) into gene trees and help molecular biologists identify previously unknown light-sensing molecules to be used in the emerging field of optogenetics - http://braveneuroworld.org/using-optogenetics-scientists-control-brain-cells-with-algae- genes-and-light/ .
