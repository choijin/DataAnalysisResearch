    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0707068&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Stephan Stolz&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In previous joint work with Peter Teichner, the principal&lt;br/&gt;investigator was successful in collecting evidence that elliptic&lt;br/&gt;cohomology is closely related to super symmetric field theories&lt;br/&gt;by showing that the partition function of a super symmetric field&lt;br/&gt;theory of dimension 2 is an integral modular form; the space of&lt;br/&gt;super symmetric field theories of dimension 1 is homotopy&lt;br/&gt;equivalent to the infinite loop space determined by the real&lt;br/&gt;K-theory spectrum and that a 0-dimensional super symmetric field&lt;br/&gt;theory over a manifold represents an ordinary cohomology class&lt;br/&gt;(with real coefficients). These advances support the belief of&lt;br/&gt;the principal investigator that he and Peter Teichner have found&lt;br/&gt;the right way to incorporate `super symmetry' and `locality' in&lt;br/&gt;Graeme Segal's definition of quantum field theory. The principal&lt;br/&gt;investigator is optimistic that this might be the crucial step&lt;br/&gt;necessary to solve the two decade old problem of how to relate&lt;br/&gt;field theories and elliptic cohomology. A particularly&lt;br/&gt;interesting aspect is that the `push forward' maps in these&lt;br/&gt;cohomology theories seem to correspond to physicists'&lt;br/&gt;quantization procedures via functional integrals, which are&lt;br/&gt;mathematically not well understood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The last two decades have seen very fruitful interactions between&lt;br/&gt;theoretical physics and topology. On a philosophical level this&lt;br/&gt;is not surprising since topology can be understood broadly as the&lt;br/&gt;study of `qualitative' aspects in mathematics, and it is to be&lt;br/&gt;expected that it is the QUALITATIVE aspects of a complicated&lt;br/&gt;quantum system (i.e., the aspects that don't change when varying&lt;br/&gt;the parameters of the theory) that should be easiest to&lt;br/&gt;analyze. This interaction has deeply influenced both areas with&lt;br/&gt;physicists using sophisticated tools from topology, and&lt;br/&gt;topologists incorporating ideas from quantum field theory. The&lt;br/&gt;principal investigator hopes that relating super symmetric&lt;br/&gt;quantum field theories of dimension 0,1 and 2 to well- studied&lt;br/&gt;objects in topology, namely `generalized cohomology theories'&lt;br/&gt;will significantly strengthen that interaction by bringing the&lt;br/&gt;calculational power of algebraic topology to physics and the&lt;br/&gt;physical/ geometric meaning of these cohomology classes to&lt;br/&gt;topology.</AbstractNarration>
