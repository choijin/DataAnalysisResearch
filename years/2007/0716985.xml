<AbstractNarration>One of the greatest challenges in biology is to explain the levels and patterns of species diversity. Hybrid zones, where closely related species co-occur and hybridize, provide an ideal setting in which to study the processes that generate and maintain species diversity. This research will combine field observations, controlled laboratory experiments and modern molecular tools to address fundamental questions regarding the distributional patterns observed among three topminnow species in the Fundulus notatus species complex. Throughout the Midwestern and Southern United States, the species encounter one another in numerous hybrid zones, making them an ideal group for study. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will comprehensively address the evolutionary history of the F. notatus species group and will increase our understanding of the role evolutionary and ecological processes play in producing and maintaining the species diversity we observe today. Moreover, this research has important conservation implications and will be of interest to various state agencies. The research program will integrate teaching and research by involving undergraduate and graduate students in the research enterprise at the two diverse universities. Personnel active in the research will participate in existing outreach programs aimed at recruiting underrepresented groups into the sciences and improving science literacy in pre-collegiate students. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
