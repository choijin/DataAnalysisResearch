<AbstractNarration>Large-scale applications distributed across thousands of machines over the wide area network are difficult to build and maintain.  To enable sharing &lt;br/&gt;of data across machines, many applications use specialized storage and data transfer tools such as a DHT, scp or GridFTP.  Although file systems are &lt;br/&gt;successful in becoming a common building block for cluster applications, it remains unclear if file systems could provide similar benefits to wide area distributed applications.  This research describes a novel wide-area file system, WheelFS, that allows distributed application developers to use a generic file system interface to store and share application data easily among wide-area machines. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two new approaches make WheelFS attractive for use by distributed applications. First, WheelFS provides semantic cues for application developers &lt;br/&gt;to express desired tradeoffs among failure resilience, data consistency and file system performance at the granularity of individual files and directories.&lt;br/&gt;Second, WheelFS optimizes wide area data transfer by writing application data &lt;br/&gt;to local disks and reading a cached copy from a nearby machine whenever possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project demonstrates the uselessness of WheelFS via the experience of building a number of distributed applications, such as a cooperative web cache, a data-intensive Grid application, a distributed digital library and a&lt;br/&gt;PlanetLab measurement utility.</AbstractNarration>
