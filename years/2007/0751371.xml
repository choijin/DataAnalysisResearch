<AbstractNarration>The IEEE GLOBECOM 2007, sponsored by the IEEE Communication Society, will be held at the Hilton Washington Hotel in Washington DC from November 26-30, 2007. This is an IEEE Communications Society flagship conference on advanced communications technologies that brings 1500 to 2000 researchers and practitioners from around the world to present their most up-to-date results and achievements of the field. The organizers of this annual IEEE GLOBECOM conference have endeavored to provide professionals with a cutting-edge forum to exchange and publish their work and ideas. This year's GLOBECOM is a special occasion for the technical community because it is the 50th GLOBECOM conference since its inception in 1958. &lt;br/&gt;The General Chair of the IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 conference is Mr. Jerome Gibbon, a well-respected leader of IEEE in the Greater Washington DC Area. The General Vice Chair is Mr. Karl Rauscher of Alcatel-Lucent Bell Laboratories. The Technical Program Chair is Professor Sherman Shen of Waterloo University, Canada. The Call for Papers and the remainder of the organizing committee information can be found at http://www.ieee-globecom.com/2007. &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt;The NSF funding provides 10 to 12 US-based graduate students with the opportunity to attend a leading international conference in communications and networking research. Students will be exposed to state-of-the-art research in the field and will be able to discuss research topics of interest with leading researchers from all over the world. The IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 offers not only opportunities to present technical papers, but also a wide range of other educational events such as workshops, panels, tutorials, industry presentations, posters and keynote speeches. &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts &lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this funding includes the creation of opportunities for graduate students conducting research in the field of advanced communications and networking to attend one of the major conferences in this field. The grant will enable the students to develop a deeper understanding of the research world and allow for opportunities to interact with their peers and fellow researchers from other institutions, to meet with leading researchers and to grasp the state-of-the-art advances in the communications and networking industry. There will be ample opportunities at the conference for the students to network with their peers and leaders of their respective sub-fields in a relaxed atmosphere. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
