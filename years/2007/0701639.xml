<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0701639&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Yehuda Shalom&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research aspects of the project revolve around two main&lt;br/&gt;related themes. The first pertains to Kazhdan's property of&lt;br/&gt;linear groups over arbitrary finitely generated rings. Our recent&lt;br/&gt;result that under certain conditions on n and the ring R, the&lt;br/&gt;group of determinant one n by n matrices over R has this property&lt;br/&gt;(fixed point for any isometric action on a Hilbert space),&lt;br/&gt;involves a mixture of K-theoretic and analytic tools. It promotes&lt;br/&gt;fundamental questions and speculations about both the nature of&lt;br/&gt;these groups, and property (T). The second topic addresses a well&lt;br/&gt;known question of Zimmer from 1979, on the subgroup structure of&lt;br/&gt;arithmetic groups, which has been touched so far by only one&lt;br/&gt;author.  The question seeks refinement of Margulis' celebrated&lt;br/&gt;normal subgroup theorem, to the understanding of almost normal&lt;br/&gt;subgroups, i.e., ones which intersect their conjugates in a&lt;br/&gt;finite index subgroup.  We plan to pursue a new approach which on&lt;br/&gt;one hand leads to entirely new results and phenomena even for the&lt;br/&gt;simplest arithmetic groups, and on the other to many intriguing&lt;br/&gt;natural problems. The group theoretic notion of bounded&lt;br/&gt;generation turns out be deeply related to both aspects of the&lt;br/&gt;project, although it arises from different sources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mathematical notion of a group is one of the most fundamental&lt;br/&gt;ones in the sciences in general and in mathematics in particular,&lt;br/&gt;enabling one to rigorously treat as well as capitalize on&lt;br/&gt;symmetries of various structures.  A distinguished class of&lt;br/&gt;groups in mathematics is formed by the arithmetic groups, which&lt;br/&gt;appear and are fundamental in many mathematical areas including&lt;br/&gt;geometry, number theory, algebra and even combinatorics and&lt;br/&gt;computer science. One main purpose of the project is to expose&lt;br/&gt;and study entirely new features of these groups, which were not&lt;br/&gt;seen previously in other groups as well. Another main goal is to&lt;br/&gt;make first systematic study of a wider family of groups,&lt;br/&gt;generalizing the arithmetic ones, and try to bring to bear some&lt;br/&gt;of the rich theory and powerful tools which have been developed&lt;br/&gt;over the past half a century in the more classical setting.  This&lt;br/&gt;would have many potential applications in those areas where&lt;br/&gt;arithmetic groups have already proved to be a fundamentally&lt;br/&gt;important object and tool.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
