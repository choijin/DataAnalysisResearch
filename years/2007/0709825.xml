<AbstractNarration> Different plant species emit different types of gases to the atmosphere.  Thus, a shift in plant community composition can result in large changes in an ecosystem's production of reactive atmospheric compounds, some of which are key precursors to tropospheric ozone formation.  This grant supports an investigation into how the unique physiology of the invasive legume kudzu (Pueraria montana) contributes to changes in ecosystem-scale fluxes of nitrogen trace gases in the eastern United States.   Nitrogen oxide emissions by kudzu will be measured in a common garden setting under a range of moisture conditions, as well as in paired invaded and un-invaded sites in the field.  A suite of nitrogen cycling variables will also be measured to provide a context for the gas flux measurements. &lt;br/&gt; Throughout much of kudzu's range, nitric oxide is the limiting precursor to tropospheric ozone formation, which is detrimental to human health even at low levels, contributing to asthma, increased susceptibility to respiratory illnesses, and permanent lung damage. Collecting nitrogen oxide emission data across a range of temperatures and moisture treatments will be combined with on-going measurements of kudzu isoprene fluxes to develop an ecosystem-scale model able to predict how kudzu affects ozone formation and air quality.  Public outreach will include talks to school and civic groups, and undergraduate students will be mentored in the practice of science.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
