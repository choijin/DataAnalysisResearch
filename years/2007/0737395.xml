<AbstractNarration>Chemistry (12). This collaborative project is seeking to improve the quality of STEM education by incorporating innovative modules focusing on nano- and bio-nanotechnology and related fields throughout the undergraduate chemistry curriculum. The research expertise at a private graduate institution is being used to develop similar faculty expertise at a public four-year college and a community college. Laboratory modules, originating from research projects on nanomaterials, are being developed and tested in courses at the three institutions as a means of stimulating student interest in nanotechnology, nanoscience, and bio-related areas. This collaboration is creating a network of practicing educators across a diverse set of campuses who can share expertise as they implement new guided inquiry-based teaching strategies. Project goals include (1) engaging undergraduate STEM students in the active learning of important nanotechnology concepts and applications in modern society; (2) demonstrating that nanotechnology is truly interdisciplinary and relevant in general, physical, inorganic, analytical and biochemistry laboratories.  The Broader Impact of this project lies in the education and training of students and teachers in the emerging field of nano- and bio-nanotechnology across ethnically and academically diverse student populations as well as in promoting student entry into nanotechnology and related fields.</AbstractNarration>
