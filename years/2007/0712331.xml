<AbstractNarration>This proposal will provide partial support for the Third International Conference on e-Social Science, to be held at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan on October 7-9, 2007. This conference will bring together roughly 300 leading researchers in cyberinfrastructure and social science, along with a number of program officers from the National Science Foundation and other relevant federal agencies. This conference continues a series initiated at Manchester, UK, which hosted the first two instances. The intent of this meeting is to bring together experts on cyberinfrastructure with social scientists with the goal of creating better mutual awareness, harmonizing understanding, and instigating coordinated activities to accelerate research, development, and deployment of new environments to support social science.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By hosting the third international meeting in the US, our hope is to increase the visibility of e-social science activity among US researchers This will have benefits in terms of introducing innovative practices to researchers and students within the US, as well as increasing and improving the collection of social science data, with the expectation that social scientists will be able to address a new range of socially-relevant questions and issues. Our goal is to attract mainstream social scientists and to introduce them to work in e-social science, with the expectation of initiating new collaborations that will apply cyberinfrastructure to exploration of novel social science research agendas.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
