    <AbstractNarration>Proposal 0725478&lt;br/&gt;"Natural and Artificial Intelligence An International Workshop at Oxford University (Oxford)"&lt;br/&gt;PI: Paul R. Cohen&lt;br/&gt;University of Southern California&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal will subsidize in part the participation of experts from the U.S. in a three-day workshop to be held June 24-27, 2007 at Oxford University in Oxford, England. The primary objective of the workshop is to bring together two remote scientific communities in artificial intelligence/cognitive science and behavioral ecology to discuss various aspects of cognition in humans, other animals, and artificially intelligent systems. The goal is to elucidate general cognitive principles what the workshop organizers term universal models of cognition that apply in humans, animals and AI systems. A secondary goal of the meeting is to help establish collaborative research relationships among scientists in the contributing fields and among researchers from the US, Europe, and other countries. The workshop will involve approximately 30 experts from AI, cognitive science, behavioral ecology, and psychology. Approximately half will be from the U.S. This award will be used to help defray the costs (airfare, hotels, meals, etc.) for the U.S. attendees.</AbstractNarration>
