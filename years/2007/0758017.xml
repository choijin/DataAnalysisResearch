<AbstractNarration>PROPOSAL NUMBER: 0758017&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION: University of Chicago&lt;br/&gt;NSF PROGRAM: PHY - PARTICLE ASTROPHYSICS&lt;br/&gt;PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Olinto, Angela V.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TITLE:  The Highest Energy Astroparticle Physics&lt;br/&gt;                 &lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a proposal to continue the participation of the University of Chicago (UC) in the Pierre Auger Observatory (PAO). The observatory is designed to study the origin and nature of the highest energy particles ever observed, namely cosmic rays with energies greater than 10^19 eV, by measuring their energy, their composition, and the distribution of arrival directions with large statistics and careful control of systematic effects.  The Southern PAO, nearing completion in Malargue, Argentina, is the first hybrid detector to combine the two best-developed techniques of measuring showers caused by ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs). The observatory detects shower particles that reach the surface with a surface array and the longitudinal development of the shower through the fluorescence produced in the atmosphere. This combination is essential for accurate energy measurements and reliable composition studies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The integration of theory, observations, and experiments at UC into a single effort has greatly benefited both the research goals and the training of students by involving them in all aspects of science: from the construction and operation of the PAO to the analysis of its data. This project will solidify the international leadership in the analysis and interpretation of the PAO data at UC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The discovery of the origin of the highest energy particles will impact both astrophysics and particle physics. The Southern PAO has had a major impact on public education and outreach throughout the participating countries across the globe: from Argentina to Vietnam. In collaboration with the Auger Visitors Center, the Malargue Planetarium, and the Adler Planetarium, the UC effort strengthens the depth of physics and astrophysics content of the education and public outreach efforts by promoting the 3D and 2D visualizations developed at UC of the highest energy showers, their detection methods, and possible cosmic origins. In collaboration with the American Natural History Museum, the group will develop a Science Bulletin that will further provide the public access to this fascinating mystery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

The group is part of an international collaboration that built the Pierre Auger Cosmic Ray Observatory the largest observatory of cosmic rays ever built, covering 3,000 square kilometers of the Argentinean pampas. The Auger Observatory observed the largest number of particles at the highest energy frontier of physics, above 1018 eV (an Exa-electron-volt).  Cosmic rays are studied over a vast energy range.  At moderate energies, their properties are well measured by satellites and high-altitude balloons.  Protons are the dominant particle type, with only minor components of other nuclei, and those cosmic rays are known to originate in our Galaxy, probably through processes associated with supernova explosions.  At the extremely high energies studied by the Auger Observatory, the flux is less than 1 cosmic ray per km2 per year, so Auger detects them indirectly over an area of 3,000 square kilometers. Identifying the type of particle relies on measuring how deep into the atmosphere the measured cascade of particles penetrates.     The distribution of the highest energy events in the sky (above 55 Exa-electron-volt as shown in figure 1) shows that cosmic rays of ultrahigh energies are not arriving equally from all directions in the sky. The departure from isotropy is subtle, however current data show hints of clustering similar to the distribution of galaxies in the nearby extragalactic universe.
