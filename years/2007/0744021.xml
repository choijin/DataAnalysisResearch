<AbstractNarration>0744021&lt;br/&gt;Romanowicz&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award, jointly funded by NSF and the USGS, will permit the Berkeley Seismological Laboratory of the University of California at Berkeley (BSL), in collaboration with its commercial partner, Metrozet, LLC (Torrance, CA), to develop and test new mechanical sensors for the Streckeisen STS-1 Very Broad-Band (VBB) seismometer. The STS-1, widely viewed as the finest VBB sensor in the world, is currently the principal seismometer used by the Global Seismographic Network (GSN) and several other global or regional seismic networks. Its continued operation is critical to future, fundamental research in a number of important disciplines within seismology. These include studies of the earth's deep interior, the determination of source processes of very large earthquakes, and tsunami warning.  However, the STS-1 is no longer manufactured commercially.  The ultimate goal of the team is to develop a design that allows an integrated, triaxial STS-1 sensor to be manufactured, sold, and supported at a cost that is competitive with current (lower performance) sensors.  Of equal importance is that the new sensor be available with shorter leadtimes than is typical with many past and current sensors.  This work will also provide significant educational and training opportunities for seismic instrumentation engineers, postdoctoral researchers, and graduate students at UC Berkeley.</AbstractNarration>
