<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to investigate and develop III-V compound semiconductor based devices integrated on a manufacturable silicon platform. AmberWave Systems has developed a novel selective epitaxy technique known as Aspect Ratio Trapping that involves selective deposition of compound semiconductors on high aspect ratio trenches in silicon.  In this project, basic devices will be fabricated and characterized followed by realizing III-V resonant tunnel devices with silicon circuitry. &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: The ability to form a wide variety of heterostructures on silicon is critical for enhancing the performance of integrated circuits for future information technology revolution as scaling of silicon devices is approaching fundamental limits. This proposal encompasses a strategic and synergistic partnership between a small innovation company, AmberWave Systems, engaged in cutting edge advanced semiconductor substrate engineering and RIT that has a highly recognized microelectronic engineering program with a student run integrated circuit laboratory. This proposal will facilitate this partnership in achieving critically needed breakthroughs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The technology developed under this proposal will have far reaching implications in new areas of high frequency mixed signal, optoelectronic, photonic system on chip technologies as well as in extending silicon beyond the perceived technology roadmap.   The students will be exposed to an R&amp;D environment and experience technology development while learning advanced techniques.  The company will get access to an established integrated circuit fab where a significant amount of R&amp;D work can be performed involving faculty and students.  The outreach activities will be targeted at involvement of high school teachers and attracting minority and inner city students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
