<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Ramakrishna&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a dearth of American women and underrepresented minorities (African-American, Latino-American and Native American) completing doctorates in the mathematical sciences overall, and even fewer completing their degrees at top tier programs. Our proposal, the Summer Mathematics Institute at Cornell (SMI), is aimed at underrepresented groups, but will be open to all talented students who do not have access to a full range of advanced mathematics courses at their undergraduate institutions. Each year we will run an eight-week summer program for 12-14 students. Students will take a rigorous course in algebra or real analysis, with the subjects alternating yearly to allow the possibility for some students to attend the program twice. We expect that most of the first time participants will be in between their junior and senior years, although we will also consider finishing sophomores who have already had a course in that year's topic. Students will also participate in a research project, working in groups of 3-5. While some students may do original research, we imagine that in most cases students will be engaged in the process of rediscovering results that have already been published.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To excel in a top tier research oriented doctoral program graduate students must negotiate the transition from undergraduate mathematics problem solving to engaging in the abstract reasoning required in graduate course work and learn to communicate mathematical ideas.  Failure to make this transition inhibits performance in both course and seminar work and is a serious obstacle to success in graduate studies. A thorough grounding in the core subjects of real analysis and algebra is essential for pure and applied mathematicians. Inadequate preparation significantly hinders entering and completing graduate school. This situation is particularly salient in the case of minority students, many of whom begin graduate study after coming from colleges with limited resources to teach advanced math courses. Indeed, we have seen students at Cornell experience this difficulty in both our pure and applied programs.  SMI will facilitate these students' transition to and success in graduate school by broadening their knowledge of mathematics, strengthening their understanding of basic concepts, enhancing their communications skills, and providing an experience of mathematical research and learning what to expect in a challenging doctoral program.  SMI participation will both improve students' chances of gaining admission at a top tier graduate program and their chances of success upon enrolling in graduate school. As we anticipate that perhaps 3-5 students in each class will attend SMI for two summers, we expect that over _ve years we will train approximately 55 students. Ultimately, SMI will help widen the talent pool from which American mathematics will draw.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
