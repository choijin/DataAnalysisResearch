<AbstractNarration>Project Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first years of the new century have seen new and unexpected events in state-level support to science and technology-based research and development in the United States.  Most dramatically, since 2003, several states have appropriated funds for embryonic stem cell research, and other states are considering such support.  In California, voters considered a closely fought initiative, Proposition 87, that would have provided an astonishing $1 billion for alternative energy research.  These and other initiatives mark a departure from the historical science policy roles of the states within the American federal system, and denote a dramatic increase in scope and scale of state support to research.  For the last 25 years, science and technology (S&amp;T) policies in the states have centered on issues of technology-based economic development (TBED).  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal science policy objectives of the states have been related to economic development and job creation.  Their focus has been on the commercialization of new knowledge through technology transfer and the support and development of local industries.  During this period, the paradigmatic relationship among state governments, the national government, and the research community has been one of 'partnership.'  However, these recent developments appear to represent a distinct divergence from the past and suggest the emergence of a new role of the states.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This pilot project will document trends in state S&amp;T policies through an analysis of publicly available data at the state and national levels.  It will create the dataset necessary for a preliminary test and refinement of four hypotheses that attempt to explain recent trends in state S&amp;T policy.  The results of this pilot study will inform the development of a research plan for field work to support further analysis and development of an empirically-based conceptual framework for better understanding recent activity.  The ultimate goal is a set of recommendations for improving state-level infrastructure to better suit the new roles of states in S&amp;T policy. There is a long-standing need, as identified by the Carnegie Commission on Science, Technology and Government in 1992, for stronger state-level institutions to provide science-based support to decision making.  By articulating a better, empirically-based theoretical framework for understanding S&amp;T policy at the state-level and by characterizing both the need and evolving best practices, this project can have a major impact on S&amp;T policy practices in the states, and provide guidance for a new stage in state-federal relations in the science policy arena.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
