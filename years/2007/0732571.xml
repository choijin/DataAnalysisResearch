    <AbstractNarration>This award supports a scientific conference entitled "2007 Atmospheric Chemistry Gordon Research Conference." The conference will be held in Montana (August 26-31, 2007). The conference will be convened under the auspices of the Gordon Research Conferences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the activities includes discussion of the role of atmospheric chemistry in climate change, new atmospheric chemistry findings in gases and particles, formation and composition of particles in remote and polluted areas, emerging issues in upper troposphere/lower stratosphere atmospheric processes and new result from space-borne platforms. Noted broader impacts include the chance for junior scientists to participate and discuss their findings within the format of the conference, by assisting with the costs of travel and/or conference fees for approximately 25 junior scientists to attend the special Atmospheric Chemistry Colloquium for Emerging Senior Scientists (ACCESS) colloquium held immediately prior to the Gordon Conference. The participation of leading international scientists as well as traditionally under-represented groups (in the geosciences) is also appropriate. The Gordon Conference in atmospheric chemistry traditionally has good gender diversity representation and strives towards increasing the participation of underrepresented groups</AbstractNarration>
