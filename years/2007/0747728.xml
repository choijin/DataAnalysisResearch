<AbstractNarration>0747728, Sun&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Engineered quorum-sensing systems are expected to be effective tools for the production of protein therapeutics and pharmaceuticals in E. coli. These systems are highly modular, and can be used in yeast, insect, and mammalian cells to regulate the production of human therapeutic proteins. In addition, this project will generate information about the molecular mechanisms of natural quorum-sensing systems, which are commonly used by infectious bacteria to regulate pathogenesis. Therefore, insights gained during this project will be valuable for the design of effective quorum sensing inhibitors to control a variety of infectious diseases. Quorum sensing has also been used extensively in constructing artificial genetic circuits, and engineered quorum-sensing systems will be valuable tools for the fine-tuning of circuits with applications in gene and bacterial therapies targeting cancers and HIV. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The education plan includes the development of bioengineering courses and mentoring of graduate and undergraduate students. A course in Molecular and Systems Biotechnology for graduate students and Introduction to Biomolecular Engineering for undergraduate students has been developed by the PI. A bioengineering laboratory course is also being developed.&lt;br/&gt;.</AbstractNarration>

Through the support of this award, we engineered such a bacterial communication system referred to as LuxI-LuxR quorum sensing system and demonstrated the applications of the engineered systems. We engineered the enzyme LuxI and transcription factor LuxR using directed evolution, a highly successful protein engineering approach, and generated various mutants with modified activities. These variants were used to construct and modify the outputs of an array of artificial genetic circuits, including genetic positive loops, genetic AND gates and genetic oscillators. Our work demonstrates that these genetic parts can be very useful tools for constructing and modifying genetic circuits capable of inter-cellular communication. In addition, protein engineering methods developed in our work can be used to engineer other quorum sensing systems, enabling engineering of a series of similar quorum sensing systems to modify their properties. By engineering quorum sensing, it is likely that an enhanced understanding of the molecular mechanism of this bacterial communication mechanism can be achieved. Because quorum sensing is very important in the process of bacterial infections, our work may help the development of novel antibacterial agents for fighting infectious diseases. The PI of this project used research results generated from this project to develop one undergraduate course and one graduate course, and such an effort enriched the diversity of the Chemical Engineering curriculum.
