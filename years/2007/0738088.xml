<AbstractNarration>Auburn University plans to establish a research site of the Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for the Wireless Internet.  The research at Auburn University will address several important areas in the next generation wireless Internet and will complement the research capabilities at the existing research sites.  The theme of the research will be cross-layer optimization of coexisting wireless systems.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a research site of the I/UCRC, Auburn University will be able to expand the base of technologies that the faculty and graduate students have been addressing at the system level.  The research will benefit the society by providing efficient and low cost wireless systems.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Auburn University obtained an NSF grant for a new I/UCRC site to join the consortium of universities with Polytechnic University as the lead university forming the Wireless Internet Center for Advanced Technology (WICAT).

Industrial members are: Agilent Technologies, Roper industries (through its subsidiary, Landis+Gyr (acquired Cellnet), in Atlanta, GA, Neptune Technology Group), Telcordia Technologies, Texas Instruments (India), and Transwitch Corporation. The two governmental organizations, both located in Huntsville, Alabama are: US Army Space and Missile Defense Command (SMDC) and US Army Aviation & Missile Research, Development, and Engineering Center (AMRDEC).   The Auburn University WICAT site conducted research in three primary areas focused on cross-layer optimization of coexisting wireless system design: The three areas focused were: hardware design and test, networking and applications. The research activities at the Auburn site dealt with the optimization of various parameters that affect wireless system performance in the hardware, network and applications domains.   Hardware design and test: Integrated circuits are a major component of the hardware in wireless systems. Because of compactness, portability and minimal battery power requirements, circuits tend to be very dense, use mixed analog and digital components and have acute requirements on energy efficiency. Auburn University WICAT site specializes in the area of radio frequency integrated circuit (RFIC), digital and mixed analog-digital circuit design and test. Device level technologies considered were CMOS (suited for commercial applications) and silicon germanium (SiGe) which achieves high performance but cost is very high (used mostly in defence industry).   Networking: The scarcity of bandwidth, battery power and radio spectrum combined with channel interference problems prevent wireless networks to reach the performance levels of wire line networks. Degradation in performance affects the quality of service experienced by applications.   Networking issues researched at Auburn were: Wireless communication technologies suitable for cognitive and heterogeneous networks, energy efficient multi-user channel estimation, cross-layer design and optimization to achieve significant performance gains and wireless multimedia communications where path diversity and advanced coding techniques are exploited for robust video communication in multi-hop wireless networks.     Applications: Collaborative distributed mobile robots are deployed for reconnaissance and disaster recovery.  Optimal tradeoffs between the amount of communication, power consumption, and search effectiveness were studied by carefully designed distributed algorithms.   Auburn is committed to education and training in all of the above three areas of research.   Outreach Activities:   A pilot project for building broadband wireless data networking capability in the Black Belt region of Alabama was successfully conducted in 2009 by Prof. Prathima Agrawal and her graduate students.
