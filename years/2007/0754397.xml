<AbstractNarration>CBET-0754397&lt;br/&gt;Knopf&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs plan to look at microchannel reactors utilizing catalyst monoliths for low pressure drop, microchannel heat exchangers for precise temperature control, and active forcing (low-amplitude, low-frequency oscillation) to control gas/liquid distribution, mixing, surface wetting and rates of mass transfer. The active forcing mechanism is scaleable and adaptable to any multiphase reacting system. They will explore underlying mass transfer/fluid flow/ kinetics behavior of the reactors through studies of model gas/liquid reactions, with flow visualization and CFD modeling of the microchannels. The industrial partner, Mezzo Technologies, will provide the micro-heat exchangers and assist in system evolutionary design and fabrication.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs plan to study the effects of active forcing via pulsed flow, varying both amplitude and frequency independently in a catalyst monolith reaction system. Based on preliminary work on the systems airwater (mass transfer, flow visualization) and รก-methylstyrene hydrogenation (reactor studies), they expect enhanced gas-liquid mass transfer, more precise temperature control (due to the micro-heat exchangers), more uniform flow distribution of both gas and liquid, and faster liquid surface renewal than existing heterogeneous catalytic gas/liquid reactor systems, whether based on structured catalyst packing or not. These fundamental issues will be addressed for both a complex hydrogenation (soybean oil) with multiple reaction paths and one of high molecular weight and viscosity (polystyrene hydrogenation). In both cases, gas-liquid distribution and surface wetting strongly affect observed reaction rates. The combination of improvements made possible by active forcing and better distributor design can result in higher observed rates, less catalyst deactivation, and improved selectivities in these serial reactions, where intermediate products are desired. Possible outcomes will be examined through a combination of kinetics, mass transfer, flow visualization, and catalyst characterization experiments. Moreover, the simplified geometry (relative to chaotic systems such as packed beds or bubble columns) allows a more straightforward modeling for the smooth channels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Merit:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;C&amp;E News recently reported that the microreactor market is growing to $100 MM. Monolith microreactors are easily scaleable from gram to tonnage production. Ongoing efforts to use microchannel reactors for both rapid catalyst screening and chemicals production have largely ignored catalyzed gas/liquid reactions. This project contributes to microreactor infrastructure by exploring how structured microchannel reactors can best be applied to such processes. Catalyzed gas/liquid (and sometimes solid) reactions of edible oils and macromolecules figure prominently in future biofuels and biorefining processes, and this project addresses such reacting systems in structured microreactors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will educate graduate and undergraduate students in microreactor and micro heat exchanger design, and heterogeneous catalysis. Students will work several weeks each year at Mezzo Technologies gaining first-hand experience in microfabrication. Mezzo Technologies will gain valuable expertise incorporating heat exchangers in microreactor systems. Undergraduates will participate through an REU supplement and the LSU Chancellors' Future Leaders in Research Program. Results of this work will be incorporated in both graduate and undergraduate classes taught by the PIs, through teaching modules and through a mini-design project that will be made available publicly. The PIs will also develop a video module on microreactor technology for broader dissemination through existing LSU K-12 STEM programs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A novel microchannel reactor has been developed that utilizes monolith catalyst supports for low pressure drop, microchannel heat exchangers for precise temperature control, and active forcing (low- amplitude low-frequency oscillation) to control gas and liquid distribution. The reactor can be used for hydrogenation and partial oxidation reactions or for rapid catalyst screening.      As shown in Figure 1 the microchannel reactor consists of stacked layers of cross-flow heat exchangers, commercial monoliths and a gas plenum (distributor).  Any combination and number of monoliths and heat exchangers are possible.  In a current version, the channel diameter of the monolith is 1.59 mm, with typical diameters ranging from 0.5 to 3 mm.  Each channel in the monolith is aligned with an identically sized channel in the microchannel heat exchanger.   This allows creation of a "stacked microreactor" of alternating monoliths and heat exchangers. The microchannel heat exchangers control temperature to within 0.1 K, and the monolith design provides low pressure drop.  Our current temperature limit is 500o C and pressures 50 &ndash; 75 bar are possible.  The use of heat exchangers ensures accurate temperatures in lab studies, eliminating any "hot spots".  The microchannel reactor assembly in Fig. 1 shows ~806 channels (31 x 26), although larger numbers of channels are possible.      Figure 1 Microchannel Reactor Assembly     Ideally, one would like the walls of the monolith, and consequently the pores of the catalyst washcoat, to be coated with (on average) as uniform a liquid layer as possible.  Continuous renewal of liquid is desired.     This brings us to one novel aspect of the new microchannel reactor.  In Figure 2, the gas distributor for the stacked microreactor is shown; it is of the same design as the microchannel heat exchanger.  Microholes in the plenum allow gas to be introduced into every channel of the monolith.  However, even with gas fed to every channel through a microhole, microreactors have some channels with little or no gas flow.  Small differences in pressure drop and surface tension create preferential gas flow.                Figure 2 Gas Distributor and Monolith Breakaway     We have discovered that gas and liquid flow in each microchannel becomes uniform and controllable, either in cocurrent or countercurrent flow, if the microreactor system is subjected to small sinusoidal fluid phase oscillations of amplitude between 0.1-10 mm at frequencies of only 1-30 Hz.  The piston (not shown in Figure 2) is located slightly below the plenum.  The range of forcing is dependent on many factors including channel diameter, liquid viscosity and gas feed hole diameter.  This uniform gas flow can be conceptually explained.  On the down stroke of the piston, the liquid phase is pulled through the microchannels.  The channels become liquid rich.   On the up stroke of the piston there will be some up-flow of liquid in the microchannels.  However, the channels will become predominately gas-filled.  In much the same way that a water aspirator is used to pull a vacuum (Bernoulli effect), the up-flow created by the oscillation creates a gas rich channel.     This system is self-triggered and controllable at the appropriate forcing frequency.  The up-stroke provides the ideal environment for gas-limited hydrogenation reactions in monoliths; thickness of the liquid on the walls during the up stroke is minimized.  The void fraction in the channels can be controlled by a combination of gas flow rate, amplitude and forcing frequency.  Figure 3 shows the effect of both the down stroke and up stroke oscillations on the microreactor system.  The down stroke shows no gas exiting the channels while the up stroke shows a uniform explosion of gas flow from each channel.   Figures 3b and 3c show that the 2.46 mm amplitude is sufficient to force most of the liquid from the channels on the up stroke &ndash; leaving the channel and pore environment gas...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
