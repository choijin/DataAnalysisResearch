<AbstractNarration>The supplement will allow the college to examine its STEM program&lt;br/&gt;specifically focusing on Mathematics 120 (MATH 120). This course is the lower level remedial&lt;br/&gt;math course. Available statistics show more than half of all incoming students need this course&lt;br/&gt;and of these, half will fail the first attempt. For the CCCC students, this course is truly the&lt;br/&gt;critical gateway. To graduate, transfer to a four year college, and enter a STEM career, the&lt;br/&gt;student must succeed in this course.&lt;br/&gt;Through this grant, the college will pilot innovations in its math instructional delivery&lt;br/&gt;and identify critical changes needed in the infrastructure of the college to foster student success.&lt;br/&gt;The college fully expects the lessons learned in this project will have widespread application to&lt;br/&gt;first other STEM courses, but ultimately to all courses offered by CCCC. This is in keeping with&lt;br/&gt;the college's belief the STEM courses are a critical core element of the college. The college will&lt;br/&gt;use the prior three years as baseline data for purposes of comparing the test areas of this grant.</AbstractNarration>
