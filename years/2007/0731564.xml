<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of Wisconsin Madison's Undergraduate Research and Mentoring (URM) program will provide research experiences and trained mentors to motivate and prepare undergraduate students beginning their sophomore year to succeed in emerging, interdisciplinary areas of biological sciences research. The primary goal of the program is to directly prepare a more diverse population of students to pursue and complete graduate education. The project aims to achieve this by: 1) recruiting a diverse group of program participants; 2) building a multiyear, graduate preparatory program that prepares students to do interdisciplinary research in the biological sciences; 3) providing mentor training that focuses on mentoring students in interdisciplinary research; and 4) evaluating and disseminating our methods and products. Students who are members of underrepresented groups in the sciences, from economically disadvantaged backgrounds, have transferred to UW-Madison, or who have a registered disability are especially encouraged to apply. NSF funds will provide two years of research support to program students, with continued support in the third year provided by the host laboratory, or the UW-Madison Undergraduate Fellowships Office. Mentors will be drawn from new and interdisciplinary areas and will be trained in the Wisconsin Mentoring Seminar. The program includes an undergraduate seminar series designed to help students find an appropriate mentor and establish a positive relationship with him/her, acclimate to the research community, learn about laboratory safety and the ethical conduct of research, and generally get the most out of their research experience. In addition, URM students will engage in leadership experiences, peer mentoring, GRE preparation workshops, giving presentations at research conferences, and designing and organizing monthly student meetings attended by all program participants. To learn more, please visit the program website (http://www.wisc.edu/cbe/urm/) or contact the Program Director, Dr. Janet Branchaw (branchaw@wisc.edu, 608/262-1182).&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
