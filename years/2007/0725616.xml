<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;ECCS-0725616&lt;br/&gt;D. Goeckel, University of Massachusetts Amherst&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of this project is motivated by the desire for extremely wideband communication system architectures, which have the potential to achieve accurate positioning, material penetration, overlay with other wireless communication systems, and the support of many users in a given area.  Thus, the research objective is to solve the challenges of low-power high-performance transceiver architectures that are scalable to extreme bandwidths.  The project considers a novel framework that solves the difficult channel estimation problem in such architectures by sending a reference signal that is slightly shifted in frequency from the data signal.  This allows for efficient data recovery with a simple low-power receiver.  This project will address the key research challenges within this framework. In systems with extreme bandwidths, there is significant in-band interference, and thus the systems aspects of a multi-channel receiver for interference rejection will be developed. The efficient support of many users through varying frequency offset signatures and corresponding receiver architectures will also be developed.  Next, the fundamental performance limits of this simple system versus the optimal achievable for any system will be considered.  Finally, a wireless testbed built upon the proposed framework will be used to both characterize performance and allow verification of the theoretical approaches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impacts of this project center around: (1) the social and economic impact of simple, low-power communication architectures with the advantages of extreme bandwidth as discussed above, and (2) the education of graduate and undergraduate students in a compelling technology area.  In particular, such extremely wideband systems are attractive for a wide variety of applications, particularly those that require accurate positioning in addition to extremely robust communication.  The project will also support significant graduate student research on the theoretical topics, and continue an extensive and successful program of diverse undergraduate research through wideband system design and construction.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Due to the multitude of radar and communication applications that have been introduced over the years, the radio spectrum has become very crowded, particularly at the lower frequencies (&lt; 10 GHz) where radio propagation is generally more favorable.  Hence, it is often difficult to find a frequency allocation for new applications, particularly if a large bandwidth (&gt; 0.5 GHz) is desired.  But it is larger bandwidth systems that provide the opportunity for higher data rates, more reliable communication, and accurate ranging.  Ultra-wideband (UWB) systems provide the opportunity for large bandwidth radar and communications in the crowded spectrum by using a very low-power signal with power spread across an extremely large bandwidth (multiple GHz).  Hence, rather than avoiding all of the currently allocated bands, UWB systems overlap many other bands but with such a low power density that the impact is minimal.  In 2002, the FCC approved low-power UWB communication and measurement systems over the 3.1-10.6 GHz band.  Whereas the wide bandwidth of UWB systems allows for a number of potential advantages, it also makes system design challenging.  In particular, reflections from objects in the environment result in a severely distorted received signal from which it is difficult to extract the transmitted data with a low-power receiver.  Previous efforts had employed a system of two pulses termed a "transmitted reference" (TR) system: one fixed reference pulse to sound the channel and a second pulse to carry the data; however, the requirement for a wideband delay line at the receiver made this approach infeasible for low-power integrated receivers.  The frequency-shifted reference (FSR) ultra-wideband system was conceived at the University of Massachusetts as a solution to the robust low-power UWB receiver problem.  In contrast to the TR-UWB system, the FSR-UWB transmitter offsets the reference and data pulses by a slight frequency shift, which is easily processed at the receiver.  The result is an extremely low-power UWB system architecture that was readily built in hardware and validated.  This grant supported two research endeavors:  (1)  Research on the FSR-UWB concept, including optimizing the system design and understanding its theoretical underpinnings.  (2)  Research on other emerging areas where employing a clear understanding of circuit capabilities and limitations can have a significant impact on high-level system design.  A number of technical and broad theoretical advances on the FSR-UWB system were obtained.  The technical advances included optimization of the FSR-UWB receiver, where optimal filtering and integrator timing results were obtained.  The FSR-UWB transmitter was also optimized: (1) making the system more robust to nonlinear amplification (by reducing the peakiness of the FSR-UWB signal), and (2) motivated by discussions of TR-UWB during the IEEE 802.15.4a standardization process, hybriding the FSR-UWB scheme with a standard coherent UWB transmission scheme so that a single transmitted signal can be decoded with different levels of performance based on a receiver's hardware complexity budget.  The main theoretical advance was developing an understanding of FSR-UWB and follow-on schemes of other researchers (code-shifted reference (CSR) and code-multiplexed (CM) UWB) as instantiations of a more general approach to noncoherent UWB communications.  The main emerging area considered was everlasting security in wireless communication systems where the eavesdropper has a significant advantage over the intended recipient.  In particular, data security is an important emerging area with clear societal interest, but in wireless communications, where the transmitted signal is not tightly physically-constrained, data security can be challenging.  This is particularly true when an eavesdropper might be much closer to the transmitter than the intended recipient and hence receive a much stronger signal.  In such situa...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
