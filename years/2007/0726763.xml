<AbstractNarration>This research addresses the mechanism of coupled oscillations in calcium ion and cellular ATP/ADP driven by mitochondria, which is directly related to the defect in pulsatile insulin secretion in&lt;br/&gt;diabetes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The oscillation mechanism is studied at different scales, from an individual mitochondrion, to the coupling among multiple (100 to 200) mitochondria in a single cell, to the coupling among multiple (1,000 to 10,000) cells in a single pancreatic islet.  After initially developing a rigorous mathematical modeling framework for multiscale modeling and simulation, the framework is applied to develop a model for the&lt;br/&gt;oscillation mechanism in a single mitochondrion.  These models are then coupled together using spatial information to represent multiple mitochondria and the coupled oscillation in a single cell.  Finally, massively parallel computation is used to simulate the coupled oscillation among multiple cells in a single pancreatic islet.  This project rigorously tests the hypothesis that synchronization of the oscillations at all scales is necessary for the correct secretion of insulin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
