<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a novel processing technique to form silicon carbide (SiC) boules for wafer production. The technique uses high-purity gas precursors and has the potential to economically produce large diameter SiC boules with low contamination levels and reduced defect levels. In this project, SiC boule growth using gas-phase precursors will be developed for commercialization of 150 mm SiC wafers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SiC is a wide bandgap compound semiconductor with high thermal conductivity, high breakdown electric field strength, thermal stability and chemical inertness. SiC-based electronics are of great interest because they can significantly outperform conventional semiconductors under high-temperature, high-power, high-radiation, and corrosive conditions. Potential products based on SiC include engine control eletronics, turbine engine sensors, power switching devices, microwave electronics, and many others.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Broader Impacts  SiC is a wide bandgap compound semiconductor with high thermal conductivity, high breakdown electric field strength, thermal stability and chemical inertness.  Wide bandgap semiconductor devices allow the next step in performance to be taken in many areas, such as power electronics, rf and microwave devices, and solid state lighting.  The greatest impact of wide bandgap devices is the contribution to energy efficiency.  After many years of research and development commercial SiC based devices are becoming increasingly available, but the impact has been somewhat muted due to the substrates on which they are built, 4H-SiC.  After 30 years of development the use of SiC substrates continue to be restricted by high defect densities, small wafer diameters, and high cost.  These issues can be traced back to the crystal growth process employed to produce the 4H-SiC boule.  In this NSF SBIR Phase II project, SiC Systems studied and developed a new crystal growth technology that is designed to address each one of the issues that exist in todayÃ†s SiC substrate supply (quality, diameter, and cost).   Intellectual Merits  This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addressed a novel processing technique to deposit silicon carbide (SiC) boules for wafer production.  Currently SiC boules are produced using sublimation techniques from solid SiC source materials.  Sublimation boule growth requires high temperatures (&gt; 2000 &ordm;C) and is plagued by high defect and contamination levels.  The deposition technique developed by SiC Systems uses of high-purity gas precursors for high-purity crystal growth and is engineered so that the gas-phase temperature and substrate temperature are decoupled, allowing for the growth of single crystal SiC with reduced stress.  Additionally the deposition system has proven to be scalable with the capability of producing large-diameter wafers (&gt;150 mm).  The main focus of this project was the optimization of growthrate, crystal quality, and chamber runtime.    In this work the process windows for high-rate single crystal SiC deposition where identified, and the chamber design was optimized for extended runtimes required for boule production.  Through the NSF Phase II funding, the transformational 3C-SiC boule growth technique was developed to a suitable level to justify further pursuit of commercialization of SiC substrates using the innovative method.
