<AbstractNarration>This project will develop an adaptive, scale invariant material model based on microstructural information that will efficiently account for and predict the material and mechanical behaviors inherent in Random Fiber polymer Composites (RaFC). The proposed framework uniquely incorporates representative volume elements (RVE) and independent state variables (ISV) The successful development and implementation of the proposed model depends on: (i) the fundamental theory of ISV, which provides a carrier and invariant algorithm to bridge the micro phenomena building up to macroscopic behaviors; (ii) a quantitative micro description of the geometry and the structure by a set of generalized RVEs, which compose unified geometric primitives used to construct and characterize RaFCs. These primitives also provide an ideal approach for systematically investigating the relationship between microstructure and damage mechanisms. The major intellectual merit lies on establishing an interdisciplinary program to create and tailor a state-of-the-art computational model that integrates material science and applied mechanics to provide a comprehensive analysis tool for RaFCs. This program will provide the underpinnings for understanding more fiber reinforced material systems such as biomaterials and carbon nanotube composites. &lt;br/&gt;The societal impact lies in that the innovative and comprehensive approach taken by this work creates enabling technologies for better material characterization. Improved material modeling results in creative product design, improved efficiency, increased applicability and decreased environmental burden. Educational impact will be also significant since the students involved will intern at Ford Research Labs.  Participation of undergraduate female and minority students will be actively recruited to perform experimental and modeling tasks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The main objective of this search program is to develop the analytical and computational tools required for analysis and design of production grade Random Fiber Composite materials. The work focused on understanding and modeling material damage initiation at the micro-scale level and the subsequent propagation to the macro-scale, where it begins affecting the component's structural integrity. Given the inherent complexity and relative lack of repeatability in the material manufacturing process, reliable analysis and design tools need to be developed to enable rapid analysis for a variety of configurations. As such, the more emphasis is put, during the initial research effort, on developing algorithms capable of quickly generating complex geometries of composites with random fiber orientations and, second, on determining the relevant minimum size of the Representative Volume Element that accurately describes the macro-level homogeneous material behavior, while maintaining the number of micro-scale variables at an acceptable level from the point of view of computational resources available presently.  The most significant findings about our work include the development of methodology using the degradation of constituent's moduli approach and cohesive zone model that was applied to study of damaged behavior of random chopped fiber reinforced polymer composites. It allowed for prediction of effective elastic stiffness as well as strength of the composite materials. The specialty of this finite element model for the RAFC composed of four aspects. (i) It captures the damage mechanisms separately including matrix cracking and fiber breakage from the microscopic constituent level. (ii) It generates a geometric model numerically to describe the heterogeneity of the material accurately. (iii) It models the interfacial debonding with cohesive elements and traction-separation cohesive laws, which are paramount to obtain accurate damaged behavior of RAFC. (iv) It accounts for residual thermal stress effects to correctly assess the initiation and evolution of damage because the thermal cycle during process will induce residual thermal stress.  Our approach has demonstrated that is very promising to characterize the damage behavior of RaFCs and especially those with complex geometry as the ones found in, for example, aerospace and automotive industry but also can be applied to tissues in biomedical engineering field. To this end, the project has initiated collaboration with the Biomedical Engineering (BME) department in order to develop a model that will simulate the extension and local stress field of axons found in spinal cord. The axons are surrounded by glia and both these constituents operate as a long fiber composite with random tortuosity. We hope that our RaFC mode will aid in realizing he abovementioned goals.  Three PhD, one MS and four undergraduate students have been professionally trained and mentored to this project and related research. The students have been working as a multidisciplinary team to solve research aspects but also have put personal time in outreach activities related to the project. These students are currently successfully employed in industrial and academic positions. Also during this project the PI visited two local middle schools (East Brunswick and New Brunswick Charter School) in which she talked to the students about engineering and the variety of composite materials application in everyday life. The PI recruited two high school students who worked in her labs (during the summer) during the first and second years of the project. GCBS although charter school has a lot of minority kids that most are coming from financially strained homes. The PI's team tries not only to tutor but also to provide role models for these kids.       Last Modified: 04/21/2014       Submitted by: Assimina A Pelegri]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
