<AbstractNarration>Peter Jung and Khaled Machaca&lt;br/&gt;Proposals IOS-0744798 and -0744581&lt;br/&gt;Collaborative: Modeling of Calcium Signaling differentiation during Oocyte maturation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A unique opportunity to offer novel approaches toward the understanding of developmental aspects of one of the most important cellular signaling systems, calcium signaling, has developed from the interaction between a computational biological physics laboratory and a cell biology laboratory.  The notion of a calcium signal refers to a transient increase of free cytosolic calcium ions.  Ca2+ signals span a wide range of spatial and temporal scales, which endow them with the specificity required to induce defined cellular functions.  For example, localized Ca2+ release through ryanodine receptors in vascular smooth muscle leads to relaxation, whereas global sustained Ca2+ signals lead to contraction. The molecular mechanisms, however, by which signaling specificity is achieved during development remain poorly understood. While this field of research has been driven so far predominantly by methods of cellular and molecular biology, this project will add a new set of tools - mathematical and computational modeling from the nanometer to the millimeter scale - that can offer new venues to explore changes in the complex intracellular Ca2+ signaling network during development. In terms of scientific Broader Impacts, the results from this work will have implications for a large variety of cell types since calcium signals are ubiquitous and regulate a plethora of cellular functions including neurotransmitter release, contraction of smooth muscle cells and fertilization. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The educational Broader Impacts of this proejct are enhanced by the interdisciplinary nature of the work.  The project will foster interdisciplinary training of undergraduates, graduate students and postdocs. Trainees at different levels of their career from two different institutions, will acquire expertise in both mathematical and experimental approaches.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Calcium is an import cellular signal for many biological processes such as contraction of heart cells and signaling between neurons in the brain.  It also acts as a signal of life, as massive calcium waves sweep egg cell after fertilization, triggering embryonic development. Calcium signals span a wide range of spatial and temporal scales, which endow them with the specificity required to induce defined cellular functions.  For example, localized calcium release in vascular smooth muscle leads to relaxation, whereas global sustained calcium signals lead to contraction.  To trigger embryonic development, the fertilization wave is required to maintain high calcium levels for minutes in order to activate the egg. The molecular mechanisms, however, by which signaling specificity is achieved during development are poorly understood.   While this field of research has been driven so far predominantly by methods of cellular and molecular biology, we added a new sets of tools complementing methods of cellular and molecular biology - mathematical and computational modeling from the nanometer scale to the cellular scale.   The computational modeling in conjunction with experimentation at a collaboratorÆs lab led to new and significant insights, which couldnÆt have been obtained in any other way.  Since calcium signaling is a universal signaling mechanism, those insights obtained specifically for oocyte maturation (and the methods to obtain those), may carry over to other cell types like heart cells, pancreatic cells or liver cells and be beneficial for the understanding of calcium signaling and related pathologies in those systems.  As a matter of fact, one of the graduate students, who have obtained his Ph.D. funded by this project, was hired immediately after his graduation as a postdoctoral associate to investigate calcium sparks in heart cells, the building blocks of the contraction waves.  My other graduate student, who also obtained a PH.D by conducting research associated with this project, was hired as a postdoctoral associate in a neuroscience lab to investigate the role of calcium signaling in the immune system using computational   This project has offered highly interdisciplinary opportunities in education and research for graduate students across the domains of physics and biology and generated a new breed of graduates, who took career paths in the life sciences enriching those with a set of unique skills. Two physics graduate students obtained their Ph.D. through research on this project.
