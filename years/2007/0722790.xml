<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;Through this MRI proposal, the New Jersey Center for Science, Technology, and&lt;br/&gt;Mathematics Education (CSTME) is requesting instrumentation to establish a multi-TeraFlop cluster computer, the Kean Terascale Cluster (KTC) at Kean University to support faculty and student research. Faculty using the cluster study a variety of topics,and this resource would directly support research in the areas of Meteorology,Bioinformatics, Astrophysics, and Nonlinear Optics. In addition to supporting the research and mentoring interests of faculty,&lt;br/&gt;acquisition of the cluster would allow the CSTME to expand its programs and research in computational mathematics and science to support its newly founded Computational Mathematics degree program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;Computational science provides a powerful means for analyzing a variety of challenging problems in both basic and applied research from many disciplines, and there exists a national shortage in the resources available, both in individuals and infrastructure. The CSTME is engaged in outreach and training efforts to remedy the situation through participation in the National Computational Science Institute and the SCXY Conference Education Program. The requested instrument will significantly increase the computing capability available at Kean University, providing not only a tenfold increase in power&lt;br/&gt;over Kean's current cluster capabilities, but also with lower latency and greater bandwidth than any resource available on campus?allowing for larger parallel applications with greater communication requirements than possible with current campus resources. This resource will not only allow faculty to perform research, but will also support implementation of training programs for Kean University students and faculty, and for outreach programs throughout New Jersey. As minorities comprise over 52% of the undergraduate student population and 67% are the first in their families to go to college, support of this proposal will serve as a powerful stimulus for the recruitment and&lt;br/&gt;training of underrepresented groups into computational sciences. Additionally, with the creation of the new facilities for the New Jersey Center for Science, Technology, and Mathematics Education, Kean will have the scientific visualization, collaboration, and meeting facilities to further the impact of this project, allowing us to not only meet the research needs of our faculty but to be a local resource in high performance computing and a pathway toward use of new national Petascale facilities for our researchers and for the northern New Jersey area.</AbstractNarration>
