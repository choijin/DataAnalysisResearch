<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit. Prior experimental studies of melt-vapor-brine systems showed conclusively that copper partitions strongly in favor of a brine relative to a vapor. However, many studies of natural fluid inclusions from magmatic-hydrothermal ores and barren systems show the reverse behavior. This fundamental disagreement must be reconciled to arrive at realistic models for (1) formation of magmatic-hydrothermal ores; (2) the mobility of elements in the Earth's upper crust; and (3) exploration for the resources contained in magmatic-hydrothermal deposits. It is proposed to test experimentally the influences of various intensive parameters (including temperature and fugacities of O2, H2S, HCl, CO2 and other components) on Cu partitioning between vapor and coexisting brine. Experiments will be performed using cold-seal hydrothermal techniques, with vapor and brine phases trapped in situ in fractured quartz at run P&amp;T. Cu, Ag, Zn and other cations will be analyzed in vapor and brine inclusions trapped in quartz (as well as coexisting the melt phase where present).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts. Beyond the collection of important data on vapor+brine+/-melt equilibria, and the fundamentals of partitioning and element redistribution in the crust, these data will also serve as a basis for the construction of exploration models for porphyry and related deposits. The project will also support a mix of high school, undergraduate, masters and doctoral students. The graduate students are also involved in undergraduate teaching. Additionally, the PIs and students will highlight this research in campus outreach activities. Furthermore, the PIs actively participate in outreach in a variety of other formats (science lectures in a retirement community and a church group; Partners in Education Program (PEP) sponsored by GSA; training for the Ranger Interpreter Program in Yosemite National Park for the National Park Service; and visits to local Maryland elementary schools as part of the earth science curriculum).&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The well-being of the EarthÆs population is closely determined by the free generation of wealth and by the free exchange of goods and services in the worldÆs markets.  The increase in wealth, that is, in average income, is driven by profit, and is tracked by the increase in world Gross Domestic Product (GDP).  Many tangible goods require metals for their production. Copper, present in wires, pipes and many other components too numerous to name, is critical for our economic well-being.  The world demand for copper increases about 3% per year, with only about one tenth of demand met by recycling. Yet, the average price of copper, in constant dollars, has not risen substantially in a century. Why? The answer is human innovation.  Innovation occurs everywhere along the chain from exploring for ore deposits to the final products of manufacturing.  Our research in the Laboratory for Mineral Deposits Research in the Department of Geology of the University of Maryland, has, as its ultimate aim, the development of a better understanding of how ore deposits form. Specifically, we study how some deposits of copper, as well as of molybdenum, gold, tungsten, silver, and other metals, are formed in the EarthÆs crust.  Understanding the geological mechanisms by which metals are transported from large regions of the EarthÆs crust where they are present in trace concentrations, to much smaller regions of the crust where they are present in such sufficient quantity that they can be mined at a profit, helps to inform explorationists as to how to better find new deposits of ore.  Porphyry copper -gold-molybdenum deposits likely form as part of volcanic belts that are found around the world, known as "volcanic arcs".  The deposits comprise hydrothermal alteration which encloses an interconnected network of fractures/veins filled with quartz and copper-bearing minerals such as bornite and chalcopyrite. Porphyry-ore bodies typically contain about 0.5% copper with smaller amounts of other metals such as molybdenum, silver and gold.  Models for the formation of porphyry ores suggest they form above magma chambers, a few thousand feet beneath volcanoes.  As the magma crystallizes, watery gases &plusmn;salty liquids, are released and bubble up.    The upward-directed buoyancy force applied to the relatively brittle, colder, surrounding rocks causes them to fracture.  The gas  (+/- salty liquid) moves up into small fractures and out of the magma.  According to our studies, the chloride-bearing gases that bubble out of the hot magmatic soup can be copper-rich.  The presence of H2S ("rotten egg gas"), will enhance the concentration of copper in this highly fluid gas phase.  The magmatic brine, if present, is always more enriched in copper than is the gas, according to all of our studies. However, our laboratory experiments, together with our ideas about how we think these magmatic-hot water distillation systems work, suggest that significant quantities of copper are transported away from the magma by phases that are quite gas-like.  Our results suggest that when both chlorides and H2S are present together, as in nature,  they cooperate in transporting copper in chloro-sulfo-Cu complexes that enhance the copper concentration in the gas phase over what would be present with only chloride or sulfur (H2S) alone:  this a surprising result, and shows why experiments of the type we perform are critical! At least for chloride-dominated gases+/- brines, the optimum pressure for copper partitioning into these phases seems to be 100 times atmospheric.  These water-, chloride-, sulfur-, and metal-bearing  gases and brines move, by way of upward branching fractures, into cooler rocks where they  chemically react with rock, cool, and mix with other subterranean waters.  Primary fluid inclusions found in deposits are microscopic bits of liquid and gas trapped within some crystals that are likely samples of the fluids precipitated, or formed, the ore.   In some deposits,...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
