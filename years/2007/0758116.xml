<AbstractNarration>This award supports a variety of theoretical and computational problems involving Einstein's general theory of relativity. Computational techniques will be developed in which black hole interiors are replaced with artificial data to help create more efficient and flexible numerical algorithms. New formulations of the Einstein evolution equations will be studied with the goal of developing more accurate numerical methods. A new class of initial conditions for black hole simulations will be developed, which should eliminate an important source of error in black hole simulations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Theoretical predictions of gravitational waveforms are needed to maximize the scientific output of ground based gravitational wave detectors, such as LIGO, as well as the proposed space based LISA detector. Theoretical and numerical relativity plays a central role in these predictions. This work is part of a worldwide effort to bring gravitational wave detection into the mainstream of astrophysics research. It will open a new window on the Universe. This work will provide students with valuable skills in computational science and mathematics as well as physics.</AbstractNarration>
