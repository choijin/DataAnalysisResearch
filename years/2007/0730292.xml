<AbstractNarration>PROPOSAL NO.: 0730292/0730270&lt;br/&gt;PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Furst, Eric M./Squires, Todd M. &lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION: University of Delaware/University of California-Santa Barbara &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH: ACTIVE AND NONLINEAR MICRORHEOLOGY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The past decade has seen the development of techniques in passive microrheology, where the Brownian motion of colloidal tracer particles is related to the linear viscoelastic properties of the surrounding material. Significantly benefits from microrheological measurements include: requiring mere microliters of sample, providing an extended range of frequencies, and having the ability to probe spatial rheological variation. For this reason, industry has shown significant interest in adapting and adopting microrheological approaches. It has long been appreciated that most industrial flows for processing complex fluids involve significant departures from linear rheology. However, passive microrheology is by nature incapable of measuring nonlinear rheological properties. Here, the goal is to develop the first microrheological techniques to measure nonlinear material properties. The collaborative effort will develop both experimental techniques (the use of laser tweezers and high speed confocal microscopy to measure the force and non-equilibrium structure as a colloidal probe is driven through a material) as well as the theoretical basis to understand and interpret the results. Currently, all theory and experiments have focused exclusively on direct probe-bath interactions, which play no role in macro-rheology and appear as artifacts in passive microrheology. To establish nonlinear microrheology as a general technique for material characterization, these issues must be understood and addressed, and well-founded methods for interpreting the results must be developed and validated. Having established the theoretical and experimental framework for these issues, the Principle Investigators anticipate using more sophisticated techniques (e.g. involving multiple and anisotropic probes) for more faithful measurements of nonlinear bulk rheology as well as normal stress measurements. The intellectual merit is in proposing to develop and refine the first techniques for nonlinear microrheology, thus establishing an entirely new area of rheology. Broader impact is the development of microrheology promises to measure nonlinear properties before scaling up production to industrial scale. Interactions with Procter and Gamble will speed transfer of these methods, both through collaboration and PhD industrial internships. Additionally, the PIs will leverage existing NSF-funded outreach programs to incorporate undergraduates, under-represented minorities and high-school students and teachers into their research efforts, providing educational opportunities in this economically and technically important field.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In recent years, microrheological characterization has encompassed passive techniques, wherein the motion of particles executing purely Brownian motion is measured and used to determine the viscoelastic properties of the surrounding fluid via the Generalized Stokes-Einstein Relationship (GSER). Passive microrheology has since become widely practiced, due in part to the relative simplicity of the experiments and data analysis. A correspondingly wide range of materials have been investigated with passive microrheology, including suspensions, bio-fluids, hydrogels and poly- mer solutions. However, a limitation of passive microrheology is the fact that, by its reliance upon purely thermal motion of the probe particles, the rheological properties measured are constrained to the linear response regime. Because of this limitation, there is significant interest in determining whether microrheology can be extended to measure the non-linear rheology of materials. In order to access this regime, the major research and educational activities of this project focus on microrheology experiments in which the probe particle is actively driven.   Our research advanced the following areas of fundamental and engineering science: (1) the non-linear micrhreology of materials; (2) non-equilibrium depletion interactions; (3) high-throughput screening comining microrheology and microfluidic devices. From this work, we published the following papers in the scientific literature and presented our work at national and international scientific meetings.
