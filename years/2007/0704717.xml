<AbstractNarration>TECHNiCAL: Vapor-deposited metal films and structures generally evolve through the Volmer-Weber (VW) mechanism of crystal island nucleation, growth, and coalescence on substrate surfaces. Films formed via this mechanism do not stably wet their substrate, so film formation is a consequence of kinetic constraints that force the development of metastable or unstable films and particles. Consequently, kinetic processes dictate the course of all levels of structure evolution during film formation, and therefore define the final properties of the as-deposited structures. We plan to study to key aspects of structure evolution during VW growth: 1) pre-coalescence island evolution, and 2) post-coalescence surface structure evolution. In the latter case, we will include studies of evolution of surfaces of homoepitaxial films, to isolate effects of surface processes from effects associated with grain structures. In both regimes we will use in-situ stress measurements to probe both island-scale and atomic scale processes with both the measurement sensitivity and the temporal resolution required to characterize fast atomic-scale kinetic processes that operate during film formation conditions that are typical for engineering applications. We will also use in-situ electron diffraction to probe surface structure evolution, and ex-situ probe-based and electron-based microscopies to characterize morphology and crystallographic characteristics of quenched structures. We plan to investigate the effects of changes in deposition flux and substrate temperature on stress and structure evolution in both regimes. We will investigate effects of growth interruptions as well the temporal variations in the growth conditions (including island size focusing techniques). We also plan to investigate the effects of low-level surfactant coverage and of nano-scale lithographically defined substrate topography on the size, shape, spacing, orientation and ordering of island and surface features, and on the final properties of deposited structures. NON-TECHNICAL: Metallic thin films and nano-structures play critical roles in microelectronic, microelectromechanical, micromagnetic and microphotonic devices and systems, defining their performance and reliability. New envisioned applications also include metallic nano-particle arrays in new computing devices, energy harvesting, and biosensing applications. In all of these applications, stringent engineering control of the structure and properties is required. In all of the planned work, our goal will be to develop fundamental understandings that will have impact on engineering practices leading to improved control of metal films and nano-structures for applications. Two graduate research assistants will be directly supported by the program. In addition, the PI's research group of graduate and undergraduate students is now, and has historically been structured, to directly exploit new insights derived from NSF research in applications, especially in microelectronic and micromechanical devices and systems. Much of this research is directly supported by industry, and reported to industry. The research involves collaborations both inside and outside MIT, and results will be reported, as they have historically been, in both scientific and engineering venues. Research results and summaries are made available via the internet, and are included in MIT courses for undergraduate and graduate students, as well as professional engineers, the latter in the form of short courses at MIT and on-site in companies.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The electrical devices that power our cell phones, computers, video games, and the Internet are created using very thin layers of metals and semiconductors that are formed on flat surfaces of materials like silicon.  Extremely small patterns are then made in these layers to create millions of devices that are connected to make circuits of devices.  Sometimes the devices have parts that physically move as they work.  Layers, or films, of different materials are usually made by essentially spraying atoms onto a flat surface.  Once the atoms arrive on the surface, they move around to form small crystals and these crystals grow until they run into each other to form a continuous film. The way these crystals form and grow can vary tremendously, depending on how the atoms are sprayed and on which atoms are used.  These variations strongly affect the properties of a film, including how easily electrons can move through them or how easily the moving parts can be moved.  This makes it very difficult to make complex integrated circuits of electronic devices and limits what other kinds of devices can be made.  This research program focused on understanding why these variations occur and on how they can be controlled, so that new devices and circuits can be made.   We began by making a very small device that allowed us to measure the motion of a diving-board-like cantilever as atoms were sprayed onto them to form crystals and films. The cantilevers moved because of forces between the film and the cantilever that are related to mechanical stress in the films.  This stress can cause the film to deform or crack when it is used in a device, which causes the device to fail.  We also used very powerful electron microscopes to look at the films and crystals after they were deposited on the cantilevers.  By measuring the stress while the films were formed, and correlating these measurements with microscope pictures of the film and its crystal structure, we learned that the evolution of the stress and the structure is coupled.  That is, it is the details of how the atoms come together to form the film that controls the mechanical stress in the film.  We also learned that the way the atoms come together can be controlled by controlling how many atoms are sprayed in a given time, and by controlling the temperature of the cantilever.  This means that the mechanical stress can be controlled by knowing how the structure changes with these spraying conditions.  The discoveries described above were part of the research that two students did in order to receive a Ph.D. degree from MIT.  A third student is still working on his Ph.D. Both of the students who received their Ph.D.s now work for Intel, where they are applying what they learned to help Intel make more powerful computers and electronic devices that can do more things.  Other students, including other PhD students and undergraduate students, learned about this project through discussions with the NSF-supported students, and the NSF results affected the research of these other students.  The NSF Ph.D. students also gave presentations at technical conferences so that students and professors from other Universities and people from companies.  In addition, the students wrote papers that were published in journals for everyone to read.  Results from their research were also included in courses at MIT and elsewhere, and with engineers and scientists working on related problems in companies.
