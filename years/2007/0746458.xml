<AbstractNarration>0746458&lt;br/&gt;Sullivan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Career award to University of Delaware by the Biomaterials program in the Division of Materials Research is to study a novel, self-activating gene delivery platform by combining self-assembled monolayer-functionalized with nanogold particles with attached biomimetic and nucleus-specific unpackaging peptides.  With this award, Dr. Millicent Sullivan will synthesize and characterize histone-mimetic gold nanoparticles (HMGNs) modified with trimethylated histone tails (H3K4Me3).  Self-assembly of these nanoparticles with plasmid DNA will be the other part of  this project. The ultimate potential goal of this project is to create HMGNs containing combinations of histone tails that optimize nucleus-specific transcriptional activation of HMGN/DNA nanocomplexes.  This project, if successful, could develop an integrated gene therapy scaffold and a generic gene/drug delivery system targeted to the nucleus of the cell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the objectives of this project is to integrate research activities with teaching, training and education of graduate and undergraduate students at University of Delaware.  The outreach component of the project involves the participation of high school students and their teachers.  Local high school teachers will be selected and trained at the researcher?s laboratory as teaching interns in bioengineering course module, and these teachers in turn will provide training and internship to high school students.  In addition, these high school students and teachers will be co-mentored by undergraduate and graduate students.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit:  Gene therapy has enormous therapeutic potential in diverse applications ranging from cancer treatment to regenerative medicine.  A key challenge is the development of gene "packaging" molecules that are able to bind and protect gene-encoding DNA during delivery (e.g. to prevent degradation or immune-based removal of the DNA within the human body), yet unbind/release the DNA within the nuclei of target cells such that the therapeutic activity is realized.  Many delivery approaches employ polycationic lipids, polymers, or tiny particles (nanoparticles) to compact polyanionic DNA into small (~100 nm) assemblies containing multiple polycation and DNA molecules, and this compaction can prevent degradation by nucleases (enzymes that degrade DNA) and shield DNA from recognition by the proteins/cells in the immune system.  The difficulty with these strategies is that the same binding interactions that prevent adverse consequences also inhibit therapeutic utilization ("expression") of the DNA.  Accordingly, the overall objective of this CAREER project was to develop new gene packaging nanomaterials able to "sense" when to bind/protect DNA vs. release/activate DNA by interacting with different components within cells.     To address this challenge, we designed and synthesized peptide-polymer molecules that could bind to DNA and also recognize (bind) and subsequently respond to (react, change shape, etc., as a result of binding) specific proteins within cells.  DNA binding was mediated by the polymer &ndash; a polycationic polymer called polyethylenimine, or PEI &ndash; whereas cellular recognition was mediated by the peptide; peptides are short, synthetic chains of amino acid building blocks whose sequence can define "lock-and-key" interactions with cellular proteins.  The specific peptides we created were designed to mimic the sequence of small portions of native cellular proteins called histones.  Histones are nuclear proteins that can switch between structures that bind/protect chromosomal DNA or alternatively, unbind chromosomal DNA to allow its expression; the change in function is stimulated by interaction with proteins in the cellular nucleus.  Additionally, histone proteins contain "tags" that allow them to be shuttled into the nuclei of cells right after they are synthesized, and also when a cell divides.  These functions are triggered by recognition/binding the cellular components that shuttle tagged proteins into the nucleus.  We sought to determine whether we could use these peptides to stimulate the same activities (binding to DNA; delivery to the nucleus; unbinding of DNA upon reaching the nucleus) using DNA encoding therapeutic genes.    Hence, the main activities of the grant included (i) synthesizing the peptide-polymer molecules and testing their ability to compact DNA into assemblies that prevented the degradation of DNA; (ii) quantifying how much the peptides enhanced delivery to the nucleus and increased therapeutic gene expression; (iii) determining "why" the peptides altered gene expression &ndash; e.g. whether the peptides did, in fact, interact with cellular components that normally interact with histones (histone "effectors").  We found that the peptides significantly increased both delivery and gene expression in the nucleus &ndash; approximately twice as many cells in culture expressed the delivered genes.  Additionally, we found that the increased gene expression was stimulated by the peptides interacting with histone effectors, including proteins located in both the cytoplasm and nucleus.  Finally, we showed, for the first time, that therapeutic DNA can be delivered to the nucleus using highly efficient cellular pathways that are used by viruses and other pathogens.  These findings have important implications for the design of better gene-based medicines that are able to reduce doses and improve therapeutic efficacy.
