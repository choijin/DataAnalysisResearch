<AbstractNarration>Functional Materials Through Bottom-Up Self-Assembly &lt;br/&gt;2007 Chemistry of Supramolecules and Assemblies &lt;br/&gt;(Gordon Research Conference) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This international group travel award provides partial support of the 2007 Chemistry of Supramolecules and Assemblies Gordon Research Conference. Gordon Research Conference organization administers the award. The theme of this conference is Functional Materials Through Bottom-Up Assembly. This conference will be held May 6-10, 2007 at the Il Ciocco site in Barga, Italy. This is the first year in which this series of conferences will be held abroad. It is anticipated to alternate the venue for this biennial series between Europe and the United States with the hope of keeping the content, attendance, and discussions at the frontier of the topics covered in the respective programs. The conference will bring together approximately 135 academic, industrial and government scientists from the United States, the European Union, the former Soviet Union, China, Singapore, Australia and Japan. From this body of scientists, approximately 22 individuals will present 40-45 minute invited lectures on frontier research topics addressing bottom-up self-assembly of supramolecules and assemblies as well as materials and devices created by such assembly processes. These invited lectures will then be followed by a 15-20 minute discussion period. Scientific themes of the conference will include Building Recognition, SupraParticle Architecture, Nanoparticle Compounds, Supramolecular Sensors, Electronic and Storage Properties of Assemblies, Molecular and Polymer Modification for Assembly, Layer-by-Layer Assembly, Photonic Materials, Assembly on Different Length Scales, Particle-based Devices, Biomimetic Crystallization, New States of Matter, and Sticking Things Together. The conference will effect interchange and discussion among the participants about their current research results and new directions for near term research and development. New paradigms for bottom-up assembly will be discussed, and these new approaches will address numerous significant chemical transport and interface phenomena. This project provides funds to supplement conference fees and/or travel costs associated with this meeting. The broader impact of this conference will include providing financial assistance to young scientists, who will be more effective in their forthcoming careers as a result of participating in this conference attended by worldwide leaders in bottom-up self-assembly and in molecular recognition. This conference will provide cutting edge education to a select group of scientists and engineers, well positioned to transform this education into new paradigms, materials, and processes. NSF provides approximately 14% of the total Conference cost.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
