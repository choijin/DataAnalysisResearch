    <AbstractNarration>The Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase I project will enable the further development of a novel nanocomposite based, environmentally safe, anti-corrosive coating system to enhance its erosion, wear and abrasion resistance performance. Standard testing protocols will be used to evaluate the improved functions of the coating formulations. Coating formulations compatible with current coating technology and equipment will be used in the proposed work. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The nanocomposite based corrosion prevention and erosion resistant coatings developed during this research program will have significant commercial application. The total annual estimated direct cost of corrosion in the United States is $276 billion, about 3.1% of the gross domestic product. Thus, deploying methods that can withstand erosive and abrasive environments while preventing or reducing corrosion processes will dramatically increase productivity and efficiency of a system. The coatings in development will be of immediate commercial value. Potential retail commercial markets include transportation (automotive, aircraft, boating, and train), utilities, farming, and paint industries. The identification of erosion resistant, corrosion preventing coatings that do not utilize the current hexavalent chromate based standard, which has been identified as a significant chemical toxin and health hazard, will have a significant societal and environmental impact.</AbstractNarration>
