<AbstractNarration>The  research project is focused on the analytical aspects of the theory&lt;br/&gt;of integrable systems related to the Riemann-Hilbert  and isomonodromy&lt;br/&gt;methods. The problems under consideration include: (a) the investigation&lt;br/&gt;of the  double scaling limits in the  theory of random matrices and&lt;br/&gt;orthogonal polynomials and their applications to the two-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;quantum gravity and enumerative topology; (b) the  asymptotic analysis&lt;br/&gt;of the Toeplitz and Fredholm determinants and the multiple integrals&lt;br/&gt;associated with the correlation functions  of  exactly solvable quantum&lt;br/&gt;field and statistical mechanics models; (c) the related aspects of  the&lt;br/&gt;global asymptotic analysis  of the solutions of integrable differential &lt;br/&gt;equations of the  Painleve' and KdV types. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theory of integrable systems is an expanding area  which plays an&lt;br/&gt;increasingly important role as one of the principal sources of new&lt;br/&gt;analytical and algebraic ideas for many branches of modern mathematics&lt;br/&gt;and theoretical physics. At the same time, it provides an efficient&lt;br/&gt;analytic tool for the study of some of the fundamental  mathematical&lt;br/&gt;models arising in  modern nonlinear science and technology. &lt;br/&gt;Specifically,  the research directions indicated above deal with the&lt;br/&gt;mathematical models which form the  theoretical basis for the following&lt;br/&gt;fields: condensed matter, high energy and plasma physics, nonlinear&lt;br/&gt;hydrodynamics, high-bit rate telecommunication systems, and information&lt;br/&gt;science. A special attention  in the project is given to  the  analysis&lt;br/&gt;of the distributions of random matrix theory which govern  statistical&lt;br/&gt;properties of the  large systems which  do not  obey the usual laws of&lt;br/&gt;classical probability. This kind of systems appear in many different&lt;br/&gt;areas of applied science and technology including heavy nuclei, polymer&lt;br/&gt;growth, high-dimensional data  analysis, and  certain percolation&lt;br/&gt;processes. Simultaneously, the random matrices are playing increasingly&lt;br/&gt;important role, as an extremely powerful analytic apparatus, in several&lt;br/&gt;pure theoretical domains such as the string theory, enumerative topology&lt;br/&gt;and certain fundamental aspects of number theory.</AbstractNarration>
