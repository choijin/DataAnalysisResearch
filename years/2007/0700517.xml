<AbstractNarration>Analysis on Faddeev, Skyrme and some Complex Fluid Models&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract of Proposed Research&lt;br/&gt;Fang-Hua Lin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;         This award will support research on two different projects that are important and interesting both mathematically and scientifically. One project is to study the particle-like solutions in both the static and evolutionary equations of Faddeev and Skyrme models.  We also plan to study the discrete analogs of these problems (or lattice-models) and to explore the connections between the discrete and continuous models. The second project will be a theoretical study of the hydrodynamics of viscoelastic fluids, and micro-macro models, of polymeric fluids. These problems involve multiple scale phenomena and are modeled by nonlinear coupled systems of partial differential equations of both hyperbolic and parabolic types.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;         Skyrme and Faddeev models use continuously extended, topologically characterized, relativistically invariant, locally concentrated, soliton-like fields to model elementary particles. These particle-like solutions display the features of some fundamental phenomena that arise in high energy physics, biological sciences and astronomy. Indeed, it was recently shown that Faddeev models can capture the knotted structures of field configurations; something that has not been yet done for any other classical field models.  A primary object of the proposed research is to conduct a systematic mathematical study of both static and dynamic models. .Another objective is to investigate the analogies between these particle-like solutions in a large scale field with the analysis of other natural phenomena which may contain many scales such as complex fluids and biological fluids. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The theory of partial differential equations is central to the developments of various subjects of mathemtics, and it is also a principle mode for appling mathematics to other fields of science.  One of the main themes of this proposal is to study mathematical models (in particular the so-called Faddeev-Skyrme models) originated in the nuclear and high energy physics using  mathematical tools including in particular the partial differential equations. We have been focused specially on particle-like solutions to the problems. Those are solutions which reveal the characteristics of nature phenomena that models would describe. Being highly concentrated in both space and time, it is not only chalenging to analyze their static and dynamic behevior but also to effectively and accurately cauculate them. The another part of this proposal is to study a large class of partial differential equations which describe problems of multiple scales in both time (hence they possess the so-called hyperbolic as well as parabolic nature) and space (hence nonlinear couplings between microscopic and macscopic variables). Of particular importance is that we need to develop  new mathematical methods for understanding the dynamics of complex fluids that arise in material science and biology.         One of the main consequences of our investigation is a first rigorous mathematical proof of existence of stable, knotted soliton like solutions in both Faddeev and Skyrme models. These solutions are building blocks for any stable and spacially concentrated particle-like solutions.  Moreover, we established an universal sublinear energy growth law in terms of topological charges. A surprising consequence of such an energy growth law is,  like the "stability of matter",  that solutions of these physical models can have in principle arbitrary high topological charges without collapsing. Unlike many other models in particle physics or condense matter physics (such as Bose-Eienstein condensates or superconductivity) in which solutions of only certain special topological charges may be stable.        Our studies on several models of complex fluids including the classical Oldroyd B-model, the polymeric fluid models and the incompressible magneto-hydrodynamic equations lead to a general mathematical theory for global existence and stability of solutions near various equillibriums.  We also established a global  existence and unqiueness  of solutions in two dimensions for the classical Ericksen-Leslie systems describing the incompressible flows of nematic liquid crystals.  An interesting fact is that these solutions we obtained may possess singularities (topological defects).         We have supported the training of several postdocs and Ph.D students through these researches.  Almost all results obtained have been disseminated  through publications in journals, various international and national conferences, summer schools for both senior undergraduates and graduate students.  A part of research results  have been used in topics classes for graduate students.       Last Modified: 08/15/2013       Submitted by: Fang-Hua Lin]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
