<AbstractNarration>The simplest yet non-trivial complex dynamical systems are algebraic: iteration of noninvertible polynomials in one complex variable and, more generally, rational self-maps of a complex algebraic variety.  Certain analytic quantities associated to these holomorphic systems have surprising connections to algebraic constructions.  Examples from this project that illustrate the rich algebraic structures in a complex dynamical setting include:  (1) the study of one-dimensional polynomials by their associated trees and the connection with valuations on the field of regular functions on the moduli space; (2) an analysis of regular self-maps on toric varieties, the resultant of such mappings, and connections with pluri-potential theory; (3) the structure of the moduli spaces of regular self-maps (e.g. of projective spaces) and their "dynamical" compactifications (describing how such systems degenerate) as algebraic varieties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the most familiar examples of such a dynamical system is Newton's method, an iterative algorithm for finding roots of polynomials, first introduced in calculus courses.  Even for this famous and seemingly simple example, we have only recently begun to understand its structure, and its failure in general, using modern mathematical techniques.  With Newton's method (its history, its applications, and recent studies) as a guide, I will pursue a collection of educational projects for students:  (1) undergraduate research projects, with an emphasis on computer exploration of examples; (2) the development of an undergraduate course in dynamics, to present both the theory and recent applications; (3) two workshops for graduate students; and (4) regular student seminars.  The research described above is designed to explore the interplay between chaotic dynamical systems (such as Newton's method and its generalizations) and any underlying algebraic structures.  Such structures add an extra element of symmetry or regularity to a system which might otherwise seem intractable.  The experts in these aspects of complex dynamical systems are concentrated in France, England, Japan, and the US (with smaller groups in Chile, Spain, Poland, and Germany, to name a few); with this project, the Principal Investigator will bring together some of these experts to work with students and clarify these connections between algebra and dynamics.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Research Description  The research funded by this grant is primarily about complex dynamical systems; I have investigated certain algebraic structures underlying their dynamical features.  The simplest, yet nontrivial, example is provided by the quadratic polynomial f(z) = z^2 + c, where z is a complex variable and c is a given complex number.  The associated dynamical system is defined by the iteration of f, studying the compositions of f with itself.  Fundamental questions about these dynamical systems include:  What are the dynamical possibilities for such systems?  How can we classify all dynamical features that arise in a given family of polynomials?  How do we understand the stability of such a system (by which I mean, insensitivity to small perturbations)?  Can bifurcations in a family be quantified in a precise sense, in a way that allows us to understand the global structure of the "bifurcation locus"?    The bifurcation locus in a family (and the chaotic set of a single dynamical system) will typically have a complicated fractal structure.  Nevertheless, the systems themselves are ALGEBRAIC (being polynomial in my example).  It is natural to believe, then, that we might exploit this algebraicity to address dynamical questions.  And conversely, because of this connection, there may be a way to exploit dynamical features and facts to prove results about the algebra itself.  This is precisely the theme of the research carried out under this grant.  There is a deep and interesting interplay between the complex analysis and the arithmetic geometry of these dynamical systems and their associated moduli spaces.  My main results can be divided into two general classes:  those addressing the question of classification and those using arithmetic methods to study the geometry of the moduli space.     Educational Projects and Broader Impact  The CAREER program promotes a balance between research and educational projects.  I outline a few of the more important educational projects supported by this grant.  1.  Worskhop and conference organization.  There were two large events supported by this grant.  One was a weeklong workshop in May 2010 called Algebraic and Complex Dynamical Systems.  The first two days were filled with background lectures by junior participants, from around the US, while the final days were lectures by (more senior) experts on the theme of this grant.  The second large event was held in June 2013:  it was in a fact a double event, with combined funding from this grant and the Math Research Community program of the AMS (also funded by the NSF).  It was a two-week program, beginning with a workshop at UIC and followed by the MRC program in Utah.  The first week was theory (Complex Dynamics and Arithmetic Geometry), while the theme of the second week was Experimentation and Discovery, working with computer programs designed specially for this research.  2.  One-on-one supervision of students and postdocs.  I have been actively involved in research projects with undergraduates; such research is not part of a standard curriculum and exposes students to the way of the research mathematician.  Two of my publications in this period resulted from this work with undergraduates.  I supervised four PhD students during this period; three have completed their degrees and obtained top-level postdoctoral research positions.  I supervised the research of two postdoctoral researchers at UIC.  3.  Course development and community involvement.  I designed (or redesigned) a collection of courses in the math department at UIC during the period covered by this grant.  These courses were designed for undergraduates, for graduate students, and also for current and future high school teachers in our Masters in Teaching program.  Further, I have been active in the general mathematical community, delivering a series of public lectures for teachers and undergraduates and high-school-age students around the US.
