<AbstractNarration>Technical Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;In this individual investigator grant we utilize complex impedance measurement techniques to characterize the effect of magnetic fields on electrical transport in thin-film structures. The particular topics under study are: (1) the collapse of itinerant ferromagnetism in the extreme disorder limit as monitored by in situ anomalous Hall measurements,&lt;br/&gt;(2) the sensitivity of the interfacial magnetocapacitance contributions to the surface proximity of ultrathin buried Fe layers in host Pd electrodes,&lt;br/&gt;(3) a heretofore unrecognized 'giant' magnetocapacitance contribution in lightly doped MOS and Schottky barrier structures fabricated using both standard and magnetic semiconductors, and (4) the acquisition and analysis of the frequency response of the complex dielectric constant in anisotropic or layered correlated electron systems where insulating phases compete with metallic phases that are either magnetic (e.g.,&lt;br/&gt;manganites) or superconducting (underdoped high Tc). Results are expected to give considerable insight into understanding magnetic properties at the interfaces of complex materials that show promise for use in magnetoelectronics and nanotechnology. Students working on this project will disseminate their results within the scientific community and learn thin-film growth and characterization skills that are highly marketable in industrial, government or academic environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-Technical Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;This proposed work will focus on understanding the physics of magnetism at planar interfaces using electrical measurement techniques that can simultaneous sense the effect of magnetic field on the mobility of electrons and on the number of electrons present. For our purposes an interface-dominated magnetic system can be an ultrathin magnetic film, a planar interface between two dissimilar materials, a tunnel junction with magnetic electrodes, or a bulk system in which there are coexisting and competing phases, at least one of which is magnetic. Answers to scientific questions addressed in this proposal, such as "How does magnetism survive at interfaces?", "How small can a system be made before ferromagnetic ordering disappears?" and "How efficiently can spin-oriented electrons be transferred across an interface?", are expected to help provide an understanding of the potential of magnetoelectronics in future technology. Students working on this project will disseminate their results within the scientific community and learn thin-film growth and characterization skills that are highly marketable in industrial, government or academic environments.</AbstractNarration>

Summary of results:  Condensed matter physicists have for a long time been intrigued by the manner in which electrons in metals assume a quantum wave-like character as the temperature is lowered. This character trait becomes manifest when electrons remember their travels and interfere with themselves, much like water waves building up in amplitude when suitably channeled. The resulting tendency of the electrons to stay in one place, or equivalently to be "localized", causes an increase in electrical resistance that has a non-classical quantum origin. This signature quantum resistance is easily observed in ordinary metals but is not expected to be present in magnetic metals (i.e., ferromagnets) such as iron, since intrinsic magnetic fields severely compromise the ability of the electrons to self interfere. Contrary to these expectations, our research shows that electrons in ferromagnets can behave much like their brethren in ordinary metals and execute motions in which they revisit their former coordinates and self interfere. In the experiment, atomically thin films of iron are fabricated and then measured at low temperature and high magnetic field without being exposed to harmful air oxidation. Theoretical analysis of the data takes into account electron-electron interactions and explains the observed unexpected localization behavior in thin magnetic films.  In related experiments on thin films of the magnetic element gadolinium, we have found a phase transition in which a metal with finite conductivity at zero temperature suddenly becomes an insulator with zero conductivity for film thicknesses below a critical value. Analysis of the temperature-dependent data using finite temperature scaling theory convincingly reveals asymmetric exponents describing the transition, in contrast to prevailing expectations that all such phase transitions should be symmetric. Metal/semiconductor contacts, which are ubiquitous in semiconductor technology, often form barriers to current flow in one direction but not the other because of the presence of a built-in electric potential (Schottky barrier). We have found a substantial negative magnetocapacitance associated with gold/gallium arsenide interfaces. The result is surprising because neither the gold nor the gallium arsenide is magnetic. The result is understood as due to "magnetic freeze out" of charge carriers, an effect which has been previously observed as magnetoresistance of bulk samples but not as magnetocapacitance associated with an int...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
