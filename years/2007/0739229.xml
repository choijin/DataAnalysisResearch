<AbstractNarration>This funding supports extension of the Broadening Participation in Computing (BPC) alliance between the Computing Research Association?s Committee on the Status of Women (CRA-W) and the Coalition to Diversify Computing (CDC).  The CRA-W/CDC alliance will be expanded to include the Colorado Coalition for Gender and IT and the BPC Commonwealth Alliance for Information Technology Education in an effort to create programs to build a bridge in the information technology pipeline from community college to four-year undergraduate programs. The extension supports continuation of the highly effective Distributed Mentoring Program and Collaborative Research Experiences for Undergraduates Program run jointly by CRA-W and CDC.  Two new variations will be introduced, the Community College Mentoring Program and Multidisciplinary Collaborative Research Experiences for Undergraduates.  Discipline-Specific Workshops and the Distinguished Lecture Series will continue to support events to recruit undergraduates to apply to graduate school and add a version to encourage community college women and minorities to pursue bachelors degrees in computing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project lies in the strong team of computing researchers and leaders who direct the many activities.  These leaders provide expertise, role models, and champion efforts that have been proven to be effective in addressing under-representation in computing. The alliance partners? commitment to extensive and effective evaluation of the overall alliance and the individual program portfolio provides the community with important data about effectiveness and the development of best practices for programs involving interventions that increase participation in computing as a discipline.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the project include attracting and retaining women and under-represented minorities into computer science and engineering. The project has the potential to produce new models for developing a more diverse group of students and faculty members and to advance discovery and understanding while promoting learning in the information technology disciplines.  The project will also provide a better technically educated workforce to meet national security and economic priorities.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Computing Research AssociationÆs Committee on the Status of Women in Computing Research (CRA-W) and the Coalition to Diversify Computing (CDC) joined forces in 2008 to form the CRA-W/CDC Alliance with the goal of implementing and evaluating programs to increase the success and retention of underrepresented minorities and women (URM+W) in computing research.   The CRA-W/CDC Alliance programs have an overarching goal of widening the research pipeline at all career stages and a methodology for evaluating the success of the programs by comparing a nationwide sample of students, researchers, and faculty with program participants.  Undergraduate: The Distributed Research Experience for Undergraduates (DREU) and Collaborative Research Experience for Undergraduates (CREU) programs offer undergraduate students the opportunity to conduct research under the guidance of a faculty mentor at the faculty mentorÆs institution (DREU/Summer), or at the studentÆs home institution (CREU/Academic Year). The Distinguished Lecture Series (DLS) hosts distinguished speakers at undergraduate and graduate student home institutions, who give a technical talk and encourage undergraduates to attend graduate school. Our results show that compared to undergraduates with other research experiences, CREU/DREU students are nearly three times more likely to enroll in a PhD program.  Graduate/Early Career: The Discipline-Specific mentoring Workshops (DSW) program build technical skills and community among underrepresented researchers within a sub-discipline.  Faculty/Mid-Career: The Advanced Career Mentoring Program (CAPP) seeks to increase the percentage of Computer Science and Engineering women faculty members and researchers who reach the top of their respective career tracks: faculty members, by being promoted to full professor, and researchers in industrial or governmental labs, by being promoted to the top of their institution's technical ladder or by entering research management.  We are continuing all these programs and you can participate.
