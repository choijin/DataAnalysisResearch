<AbstractNarration>Proposal #: CNS 07-09296 &lt;br/&gt;PI(s):          Mataric, Maja J.&lt;br/&gt;  Narayanan, Shrikanth S.   &lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Southern California&lt;br/&gt;          Los Angeles, CA 90089-1147           &lt;br/&gt;Title: IAD:Computing Research Infrastructure for Human-Robot Interaction and Socially Assistive Robotics &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project, acquiring infrastructure for socially assistive robotics (SAR), enables interdisciplinary integrative research covering a broad spectrum of human robot interaction (HRI) topics. SAR studies a unique series of problems related to utilizing robot embodiment to provide social assistance to users in a variety of convalescence, rehabilitation, education, and training settings. The infrastructure consists of richly interactive humanoid robot platforms and state-of-the-art data collection equipment. The work enables the growth of SAR, providing grounding for a major area of HRI research by requiring realistic validation with human subjects/users for studies that include embodiment, affect/attitude modeling and recognition, mixed initiative interactions, user modeling, modeling personality and empathy, and engagement and learning through imitation. The facility is expected to produce a large corpus of data that will be made available to the community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:  Socially accepted robotics research aims to improve quality of life. Enabling the acquisition of pilot data necessary for NIH funding, this research brings new expertise through an interdisciplinary team that includes CS, EE, kinesiology, pediatrics, and development of disorder experts. Furthermore, the infrastructure impacts human resource development through educational and K-12 outreach programs that reach hundreds of students.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This infrastructure project supported the development of autonomous socially assistive robots (SAR) that use interaction as a means of providing therapeutic benefits to their human users. Specifically, the grant supported four main areas of SAR research for therapeutic domains: autism intervention for children, exercise companions for adolescent youth, stroke rehabilitation for adults, and anxiety reduction for children undergoing painful medical procedures. The infrastructure consisted of equipment for understanding user activity, for purchasing or developing robots capable of expressive interaction with users, and equipment for collecting data from human subjects user studies of the various developed technologies.  The research into the development of software (models and algorithms) for enabling robots to monitor, coach, encourage, and motivate users in therapeutic settings and user study evaluation in those areas was supported by other NSF grants.  Consequently, this infrastructure project was an enabler for a large body of research into human-robot interaction for socially assistive, therapeutic robotics.  The following is an illustrative review of the research that was made possible by this infrastructure grant.  In the domain of autism spectrum disorders (ASD), the infrastructure enabled for the development of robots capable of encouraging children with ASD to initiate play, vocalize and talk more, use social eye gaze and take turns, and learn arm movements by imitation.  These results form a foundation for ongoing work supported by NSF aimed at addressing the challenge of social training of children with autism, given that ASD now affects one in 68 children and has quadrupled in the last 20 years.  In the domain of stroke rehabilitation, the infrastructure acquired and developed with this project allowed for piloting multiple studies with socially assistive robots and stroke patients, that assessed user engagement with robots and the robotsÆ ability to motivate performance on rehabilitation exercises and to compare the effectiveness of different types of feedback.  With 800,000 new strokes each year in 2015 and the rate expecting to double in the next two decades, and affect ever-younger populations (as it is moving from 60s and over to 40s and over), the results of this work serves to inform the development of methods and technologies to aid in stroke recovery.  In the final years of the grant, two new domains were explored.  The first is adolescent and teenage obesity leading to risk of type 2 Diabetes.  With support from this grant, a socially assistive robot exercise coach was developed and evaluated in the context of encouraging exercise.  The results are instructive and inform future work that is relevant to both NSF and NIH programs.  The second new domain facilitated by this grant was anxiety reduction; the support was used to design and develop robots capable of comforting children receiving intravenous injections.  This project is ongoing, based on the developed infrastructure and will be used toward future research into anxiety reduction.  Overall, the work on this project was made possible through collaborations with key partners, including ChildrenÆs Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA), Rancho Los Amigos National Rehabilitation Center (RLANRC), and the USC Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSI). The work on this project also included the involvement of a very large number of undergraduate students, who were engaged in hardware and software development as a means of STEM training.  All project personnel, including faculty PIs, graduate students, and undergraduate students engaged in annual K-12 STEM outreach activities, that included hosting open houses to showcase the science and research in robotics, assemblies at the local schools, hosting high school students for summer internships, and holding workshops at the regional Botball and international Global Conference on Educational Robotics (GCER).   ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
