<AbstractNarration>How are the vast number of cells within the central nervous system generated during the development of an organism? Experiments described in this proposal focus on special cells within the central nervous system to learn how gene regulation controls the way cells develop and make specific connections. The cells are called midline cells because they are centrally located within the central nervous system and split it in half. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The central nervous system is an extensive communication system consisting of two cell types: neurons and glia. For cells to function within this system, they must express the appropriate battery of genes. Dissecting how genes are regulated within the various cell types provide information on how this complicated communication network is established. This research focuses on the Drosophila nervous system that is an excellent experimental model for the study of nervous system development and function and shares similarities with mammalian systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Regulatory regions are parts of the genome responsible for gene activity in particular cell types. Regulatory regions can be identified and studied by comparing similar genes in related species of flies. Small changes within these regulatory sequences can cause a gene to switch from being active only in midline glia to being active in both glia and neurons. Even smaller changes can abolish gene activity in the central nervous system altogether. By comparing regulatory regions of a number of genes expressed in various cell types, sequence signatures, or tags, are identified that are shared by a particular cell type. These regions can also be used to identify the proteins that regulate gene activity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Much of the research is conducted by graduate and undergraduate students. It provides students scientific training in genetics and molecular, cellular, and developmental biology that enhances their education and prepares them for careers in the life sciences. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
