<AbstractNarration>The recently developed effective field theory approach is known to be highly useful in our attempt to relate the properties of atomic nuclei to the underlying dynamics of the quarks and gluons, quantum chromodynamics.  We aim here to make further developments of nuclear effective theory and its applications.  Our investigations not only deepen the understanding of nuclear-hadron physics but also have important bearing upon nuclear astrophysics and search for physics beyond the standard model.  Our study has particularly close connections with the on-going and future neutrino experiments that are meant to look for signals for non-standard physics.  The budget allows us to hire a post-doctoral fellow to join our research effort.  A qualified graduate student can be hired in years two and three.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The principal aim of the research is to investigate nuclear-hadronic dynamics with a particular emphasis on its relation to quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the fundamental dynamics of quarks and gluons. Of particular interest is studying the role of chiral symmetry, which is one of the basic symmetries of QCD. The effective field theory, called chiral perturbation theory, offers a systematic and practical framework to translate the symmetries of QCD into those of hadrons, particles that actually constitute nuclei. The research made extensive use of this formalism. In order to describe those phenomena which at present are beyond the applicability of chiral perturbation theory, models were used that approximately reflect the symmetries of QCD and that can be applied to hadrons and complex nuclei.     Specifically, we investigated:(1) Effective field theoretical estimates of radiative corrections for weak processes in one nucleon systems; (2) Systematic improvements of the existing theoretical treatments of the muon capture on deuteron reaction; (3) Neutrino-nucleus reactions at energies beyond the pion-production threshold; (4) Chiral perturbation theory applied to inelastic proton proton collisions involving rather high energy-momentum transfers; and (5) The protonÆs spin, which we show is more than just the sum of the quarksÆ spins.       The intellectual merit of these studies is that they not only deepen our understanding of nuclear-hadronic systems but also have important ramifications for astrophysics and for our search for physics beyond the Standard Model. In particular, the studies have strong bearing upon the experiments at the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory, the Super-Kamiokande and next-generation ultra-high-intensity neutron-beam facilities.                               The research activities are connected to the Principal Investigators' long-term commitment to science education at various levels. To generate enthusiasm for science and to inform on front-lines research activities, they have been for years in close contact with local high school science teachers. Whenever requested, they visit a local high school to give support and advice, teach physics master classes, and offer lectures on "hot" physics research topics.
