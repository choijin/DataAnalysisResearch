    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a novel hydroxyl ion-conducting polymer membrane for use in anion exchange alkaline fuel cells through a parallel approach based on two novel polymer approaches each combined with nano particle functionality. A key issue with traditional alkaline fuel cells (AFC) is electrolyte and electrode degradation caused by the forming of carbonates and bicarbonates in a liquid electrolyte. The degradation is caused by the forming of precipitants of solid metal carbonate crystals which fill the pores and channels, and mechanically disrupt the active sites. In order to address this key issue the project will develop an alternative to the liquid electrolyte; therefore a solid polymer membrane will be investigated. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential from the technology will be a solid polymer-based AFC membrane with high temperature capability with the potential to move this fuel cell technology variant into previously unattainable applications such as automotive power and stationary power generation. Thin solution cast solid polymer membranes would allow for more compact spacing within the fuel cell stack assembly allowing this fuel cell technology variant to be potentially used in "micro" applications such as consumer electronics and military on-soldier power packs.</AbstractNarration>
