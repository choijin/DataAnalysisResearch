<AbstractNarration>AST 0709500&lt;br/&gt;Tholen&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Tholen will use this award to address three tasks related to near-Earth objects (NEOs). The first task is a continuation of efforts to find new NEOs at solar elongations of less than 90 deg, where objects in certain types of orbits can spend the majority, if not the entirety, of their time. The second&lt;br/&gt;task is for follow-up astrometry of NEOs, concentrating on objects in the 20 to 24 apparent magnitude range, where little follow-up capability currently exists. The third task involves the acquisition of calibrated photometry of NEOs in the 17 to 19 absolute magnitude range to do a&lt;br/&gt;better job of determining the true number of objects brighter than absolute magnitude 18. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The Earth orbits the Sun in a swarm of asteroidal debris ranging in size from roughly 10 km down to tiny dust particles. The size-frequency distribution of this debris is such that only a few objects exist at the large end of the distribution, while billions of dust particles pervade the inner Solar System. The rate of collision between these objects and the Earth is proportional to their number. While collisions with dust particles are essentially continuous, the visible manifestation being known as meteors, collisions with larger objects are correspondingly rarer. A 50 m object hits the Earth every few hundred years, the most recent example being the Tunguska event of 1908. The effects of even larger objects colliding with the Earth are potentially devastating, the demise of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago being attributed to the impact of a 10 km object. To inventory potentially hazardous asteroids, several groups are surveying the Solar System beyond the orbit of the Earth, but little attention has been given to the region of the Solar System interior to the Earth's orbit. Previous survey work at small solar elongations has resulted in perhaps the most significant NEO discovery to date, that of (99942) Apophis, a 300 m object that will pass within 6 Earth radii on 2029 April 13. During a 20-year span centered on the date of discovery, this object spends 95 percent of its time at solar elongations of less than 90 deg. How many other similar objects are there? This program is designed to answer that important question.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Astrometric follow-up of the brighter NEOs found by the professional surveys is an activity that involves hundreds of amateur astronomers throughout the world, with no gender, ethnic, or geographic boundaries. This survey will be no different in this regard. The project will directly involve a postdoctoral fellow and/or a graduate student, thus providing both education and training in the subjects of astrometry, photometry, and celestial mechanics. Because of the apparent connection between asteroid impacts and the extinction of the dinosaurs, the subject of near-Earth asteroids has become nearly as popular with younger students as has the subject of dinosaurs. It provides the opportunity to educate the public about the structure of the Solar System beyond the eight major planets traditionally memorized in grade school. And although the probability of finding an object of significant size on a collision course with Earth in the near future is quite small, the broader impact of such a discovery would be enormous, including the topics of disaster preparation, impact prediction, and threat mitigation. So popular has the subject become in recent years that it has spawned two major theatrical motion pictures, a television mini-series, and numerous documentaries.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
