<AbstractNarration>The focus of this proposal is one of the central problems in number&lt;br/&gt;theory: relate special values of L-functions to the orders of associated algebraic quantities, especially Selmer groups. This is a problem whose origins lie in the celebrated class number formula from algebraic number theory and which includes the conjecture of Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer about the L-function of an elliptic curve. The research described in this proposal aims to prove such relations for various L-functions arising from automorphic forms. The theory of automorphic forms provides a rich source of L-functions (conjecturally all) and - through its connections with algebraic varieties attached to quotients of symmetric spaces - it is also closely connected to the objects of interest to algebraic number theorists (esp. Galois representations).  The investigator aims to further develop and exploit the p-adic properties of these connections to relate L-values and Selmer groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research described in this proposal aims to establish relations between certain analytic and algebraic objects. The analytic objects are L-functions- a special class of analytic functions built from number-theoretic data (this class includes the celebrated Riemann zeta function which is built from the prime numbers). For at least a century and a half L-functions have been central to efforts to tackle the most central problems in number theory (e.g., understanding the distribution of prime numbers). An important feature of L-functions is that their values at certain special points - these values are often called `special values' - are expected to be the orders of algebraic quantities associated to the data defining the L-function. The investigator aims to prove the existence of such relations for various classes of L-functions, drawing especially on the theory of automorphic forms. Automorphic forms are closely connected to both analysis (they are a rich source of L-functions, conjecturally all) and algebra. The investigator aims to prove such relations by systematically understanding the divisibility properties of the objects of interest (special values, automorphic forms, and Selmer groups) by powers of primes numbers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    One of the motivating goals of arithmetic geometry is a proof of the Birch--Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture for elliptic curves (one of the seven `Millenium Problems' in mathematics).  This project developed new methods and techniques for studying elliptic curves through improved understanding of various related objects and conjectures, with the ultimate goal of making progress towards the Birch--Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture itself and its generalizations.  Through improved understanding of the arithmetic of automorphic forms, this project made progress on understanding the connections between special values of (p-adic) L-functions (analytic data associated with elliptic curves), p-adic Selmer groups (algebra data associated with elliptic curves), and even the groups of rational points on elliptic curves. Many of the results are most clearly expressed in the technical framework of Iwasawa theory, but the applications to the Birch--Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture include:  (a) A converse to the celebrated theorem(s) of Gross--Zagier and Kolyvagin: This project discovered a p-adic proof that an elliptic curve with algebraic rank one and finite Tate-Shafarevich group also has an L-function with analytic rank one.  (b) The first proof (jointly with Manjul Bhargava) that a positive proportion of elliptic curves over the rational numbers, when counted naturally, have both algebraic and analytic rank one. This proof built on the results from (a); it was cited in the laudation for Bhargava's 2014 Fields Medal.  (c) A proof that the powers of a prime p dividing both sides of the formula conjectured by Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer holds in some new cases.   (d) A proof (jointly with Manjul Bhargava and Wei Zhang) that a majority of elliptic curves over the rationals (even &gt; 60%), counted naturally, satisfy the Birch--Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture.     This project also provided support and training for a new generation of researchers in arithmetic geometry, including five PhD students supervised by the principal investigator (PI) and others closely advised by the PI.  The project also supported the PI's efforts to disseminate the new results through invited lectures at conferences and workshops around the US and internationally.  The PI also spent time at various programs for high school students in the US and abroad, interacting with and encouraging talented students with an interest in mathematics, sometimes exploiting the accessibility of questions about elliptic curves to foster mathematical interest and imagination.
