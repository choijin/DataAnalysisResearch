<AbstractNarration>PROPOSAL NUMBER: 0725332&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: Designing Scientific Software One Workflow at a Time&lt;br/&gt;PI: Ewa Deelman and Yolanda Gil&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Much of science today relies on software to make new discoveries.  This software embodies scientific analyses that are frequently composed of several application components and created collaboratively by different researchers. Computational workflows have recently emerged as a paradigm to manage these large-scale and large-scope scientific analyses.  Workflows represent computations that are often executed in geographically distributed settings, their interdependencies, their requirements and their data products. The design of these workflows is at the core of today?s scientific discovery processes and must be treated as scientific products in their own right.  The focus of this research is to develop the foundations for a science of design of scientific processes embodied in the new artifact that is the computational workflow.  The work will integrate best practices and lessons learned in existing workflow applications, and extend them in order to define and formalize design principles of computational workflows. This work will result in a fundamentally new approach to designing workflows that will greatly improve the scientific software design methodology by defining and formalizing design principles, and by familiarizing the scientific community with these effective workflow design processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Computational workflows have recently emerged as an effective paradigm to manage large-scope terascale scientific analyses and are a crucial technology to scale up to petascale levels.  Workflows were used for decades to manage business processes in complex organizations by providing a formalism to specify tasks, their dependencies, their requirements, and products, and to track task execution over time. Similarly, computational workflows represent computations that are often executed in geographically distributed settings, their interdependencies, their requirements, and their data products.  In the last few years, research focused on the creation and execution of computational workflows has resulted in great gains in productivity, feasibility, and scalability of quite complex scientific analyses.   The work performed as part of this NSF grant included a number of research avenues, among them:  Gathering scientific workflow examples and characterization of their structure and performance Investigating the role of semantics in workflow discovery, construction, and validation Evaluating the feasibility and performance of the execution of scientific workflows on the cloud.    The findings from this work include:  A workflow gallery, which contains information about the workflow structure and performance for workflows from a number of scientific domains (astronomy, bioinformatics, physics, etc) New semantic models and algorithms for workflow discovery, design, and validation Performance data on the behavior of selected scientific workflows on commercial clouds such as Amazon EC2.   The work also resulted in a number of journal and conference publications:  Journal papers:  Yolanda Gil, "From Data to Knowledge to Discoveries: Artificial Intelligence and Scientific Workflows", Scientific Programming, (2008).
