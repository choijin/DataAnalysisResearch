<AbstractNarration>Quantitative and mathematical approaches to biology are becoming more prevalent in both industrial and academic research.  However, there remain significant barriers between the mathematical and life sciences, reinforced by the reality that college students in these programs are not typically exposed to the other discipline beyond the freshman year.  This project will establish a program to train undergraduates at the interface of mathematics and biology, through a combination of course work and research experience.  The program has a focus on team-based learning, with biology and math majors working together on projects jointly led by faculty from the departments of Applied Mathematics &amp; Statistics and various Life Sciences departments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each year, a cohort of undergraduate students will be recruited to the program, half drawn from majors in the mathematical sciences, and half from majors in the life sciences.  These students will be grouped into research teams (including both math and biology majors) that will engage in a summer of full-time research; the research projects will continue through the following year, with the students receiving academic credit.  The research projects will all involve components both of mathematics and of experimental biology, and will be jointly supervised by faculty from both disciplines.  As an introduction to mathematical approaches in biology, a pair of new courses will be offered: one with a focus on the analysis of experimental data, and the other with a focus on the simulation of biological systems.  These courses will provide a foundation in both the theory and application of mathematical biology, with an emphasis on how mathematical models can be integrated with experimental techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This combination of team-based learning, multidisciplinary research and mentoring, and novel course work, will provide a solid foundation for students to apply mathematical approaches to biological questions.  This initiative will broadly impact undergraduate education at this university, serve as a model for change at other colleges and universities, and influence the broader scientific community by graduating students with a multi-disciplinary background who will take this perspective with them in their future careers.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Stony Brook University program for Research Training in Mathematical Biology was intended to achieve a number of overlapping aims: to provide research opportunities at the interface of mathematics and biology to a number of undergraduate students drawn from both life science (biology, biochemistry, etc) and mathematical science (both pure and applied) majors; to promote the development (and sustained offering) of undergraduate coursework in mathematical, quantitative and computational biology; and to use undergraduate research and coursework in this area to increase cooperative interactions between both faculty and graduate students from the mathematical and life sciences.  These goals were chosen both the their intellectual merit (in terms of the educational goal of increased interdisciplinary training as the scientific aims of individual research projects) and for their potential broader impact (most particularly the establishment of lasting training programs that would have continue to benefit students beyond the funded period of the grant).  In terms of direct impact on studentsÆ exposure to research, over twenty undergraduates participated in summer research experiences over the period of the program.   Moreover, nearly half of the participants (ten in total) were reach participants for at least two years.  Not only did these students gain the experience of working on real-world research projects at the interface of mathematics and biology, they had the opportunity to present their work to their peers in the program, to the broader campus community, and in a number of cases to attendees of regional or national scientific conferences.  In terms of fostering broad participation by faculty across campus, a dozen faculty (with primary appointments spanning nine departments) played a role in mentored research projects.  On top of this, four graduate students gained direct experience in teaching at the interface of biology and math (as a teaching assistant or instructor) while at least a dozen more were involved in mentoring of research project.  While these results certainly represent a success of the program, with the most exceptional result being the potential for a truly long term impact on our undergraduate programs.  When the program was first initiated, a single undergraduate course in Bioinformatics and basic methods in Computational Biology was offered at Stony Brook; lacking both an engaged student body and lead guiding faculty member, the course was seeing dwindling enrollments.  Our UBM proposal sought to revitalize this course as well as to develop a new course that would focus more on mathematical analysis and simulation of biological systems.  Both initiatives were a tremendous success: BIO 312 (the bioinformatics course) has evolved into a popular laboratory course (particularly for Life Science students) on the fundamental methods in bioinformatics, with students learning both computational tools and experimental techniques; AMS 333 (Mathematical Biology) has grown to achieving stable annual enrollments of above 50 students, with perhaps 50% of these from pure and/or applied mathematics and the remainder dominated by life science and biomedical engineering majors.  Most significantly, however, the planned developments have only been a portion of the net impact of this program on campus.  During the Spring and Summer semesters of 2012, a new undergraduate specialization in Quantitative Biology and Bioinformatics was developed, spearheaded by faculty tightly involved in the UBM program;  this specialization was approved in Fall 2012.  As part of this initiative, a third course in mathematical and quantitative approaches to biology has been developed; entitled "Computational Modeling of Physiological Systems," this (in conjuction with the two courses discussed earlier) provide a three course sequence that forms the core of the new specialization.  While these courses could have been developed without the aid ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
