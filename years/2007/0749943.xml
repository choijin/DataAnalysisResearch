<AbstractNarration>This project comprises a series of interdisciplinary studies of the functional evolution of hearing in cichlid fishes. Cichlids are freshwater fishes that often serve as model organisms for evolutionary and behavioral studies.  Although it is not widely known, the Malagasy and South Asian (but not the African or Neotropical) cichlids exhibit modifications of the ear, skull and gas bladder, which create a direct mechanical linkage between the gas bladder and inner ear. Similar structures in other fishes are known to bestow enhanced hearing ability. A high degree of variability of these structures in cichlids suggests that hearing abilities have evolved and diversified within this group of fishes, and provides us a uniquely powerful model system to explore the origin of a new sensory ability and the subsequent evolutionary diversification of a new sense.  This collaborative project combines comparative morphological studies of accessory hearing structures with experimental studies of hearing ability using neurophysiological techniques. Field and laboratory studies will document the diversity of hearing ability and correlate differences in perceptual ability with anatomical and ecological features. Malagasy-South Asian cichlids present an ideal case to test the hypothesis that new sensory systems evolve in low-noise habitats to exploit new sensory opportunities, rather than evolving in high-noise habitats to conserve function in the face of increased noise.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project was to better understand how enhanced hearing evolves in a group of fishes that exhibit considerable anatomical variation in hearing-related structures. We hypothesized that the variation we observed in cichlids, specifically in the anterior region of the gas bladder and posterior portion of the skull, would correlate with variation in hearing ability, such that species with a direct mechanical linkage between the gas bladder and the inner ear would exhibit more sensitive hearing.  To address this hypothesis, we conducted a series of interdisciplinary studies to relate physiological measures of hearing function with three-dimensional reconstructions of gas bladder and inner ear morphology.  Unlike their African and Neotropical counterparts, Malagasy-South Asian cichlids exhibit numerous modifications of the anterior gas bladder and the posterior portion of the skull, which in Paretroplus and Etroplus, comprising the subfamily Etroplinae, includes an intracranial bulla directly apposed to the inner ear. We hypothesized that specialized hearing had evolved within this group of cichlids, and that the observed anatomical variation would provide for a wide range of enhanced hearing abilities for species in which the anterior gas bladder has evolved paired extensions, or diverticula, that are in close proximity with the inner ear.
