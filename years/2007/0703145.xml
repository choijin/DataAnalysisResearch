<AbstractNarration>This project is to continue working on some asymptotic problems  in Fluid Mechanics, Gas Dynamics and Plasma physics, as well as to study some well-posedness questions arising in free boundary problems and  non-Newtonian fluids.  These asymptotic problems arise when a dimensionless parameter (such as the Reynolds number or the ratio between the electron thermal speed and the speed of light) goes to zero or to infinity.  In studying these problems, many mathematical difficulties arise.  These difficulties are mainly   due to the change of the type of the equations, the presence of many temporal and spatial scales, the presence of resonances, the presence of boundary layers, ... .  Many tools have been developed to circumvent these difficulties such as the introduction of different types of measures to describe the defect of strong convergence, the use of compensated compactness type arguments, the use of averaging lemma, the use of energy methods and relative entropy methods, ... .  New tools will be developed in this work. Hopefully, they can be applied to other areas of mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study of these problems is very important to get a better understanding about the behavior of complicated systems in different limiting cases. This also allows an improved understanding of the real physical phenomena taking place.  It also gives a better knowledge about the domain of validity of each simplifying model. This is very important for engineers and physicists who are looking for the simplest model that captures the phenomena to implement numerically or to apply in real life.  One of these problems is the hydrodynamic limit of the Boltzmann equation when the Knudsen number goes to 0 especially in bounded domains.  Formally, the limit equation (Euler system, Navier-Stokes, ...) depends on additional  parameters such as the Mach number, the Reynolds number and the  time scaling.  In particular, one of the goals of the project is to understand fluid boundary conditions from kinetic ones. This is a step towards understanding the coupling at the boundary between fluid equations and kinetic equations.  Of course this is a very important question for numerical simulations when we have to go from a domain where a kinetic model is being used to a domain where a fluid model is being used.  Besides, another goal of this project is the study of some non-Newtonian fluids and especially polymeric liquids (egg white, blood or dough for example).  These systems require a coupling between fluids and polymers and are of great interest in many branches of applied physics, chemistry and biology.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Many fundamental problems in  Fluid Mechanics and Plasma Physics were solved.  With  Levermore,  we gave a full justification of the derivation  of fluid equations (such as the  Navier-Stokes system)      from  kinetic equations  (Boltzmann equation). This is a  fundamental questions that was formulated by Hilbert in his sixth problem in 1900.  A fundamental step was done by   L. Saint-Raymond and F. Golse.   With a  former student Arsenio,  we develop   new regularity estimates for  renormalized solutions of the  Boltzmann equation with long-range interactions which are used by  Arsenio in his thesis   to prove the hydrodynamic limit for  potential without cut-off.       With Ambrose, we gave an existence result for  3D vortex sheets with surface tension. We use  a special coordinate system, namely conformal coordinates  to parametrize the surface.  Our parametrization has the  advantage   of being   suitable for numeric simulations since we reduce  a 3D  problem to a simple  problem on a surface.    With Nakanishi, we study the  convergence in the energy space  of solutions  to the  Klein-Gordon-Zakharov system    towards a  solution of   coupled  nonlinear Schrodinger equations  when  two dimensionless parameters  $c$ and $\alpha$  go to  infinity. These two parameters  are    related to the plasma frequency  and the plasma sound speed.     With  Wong, we construct  solutions in Sobolev spaces   to the hydrostatic Euler equations and to the Prandtly system  under some monotonicity assumption.  These two models are  very important models to understand the inviscid limit  (when the viscosity tends to zero).  Also, with Rousset  we prove the convergence of solutions to  the   Navier-Stokes system  with Navier boundary condition  towards a solution  to the Euler system when the viscosity goes to zero. The novelty of this work  is that we are able to prove uniform  bounds       in  conormal Sobolev spaces without constructing a boundary layer.    With Juhi Jang, we prove   well-posedness for  the free-boundary   compressible Euler equations with physical vacuum in one dimension.   We also extended  this to the 3D case using Lagrangian coordinates and  studying a degenerate acoustic system.  Similar results where  obtained by Coutand and Schkoller.     Also,  we gave   a rigorous derivation of the anelastic approximation  starting from  the compressible Navier-Stokes system with gravitational potential  when  the Mach number and the Froude number go to zero with the same speed.      All these results have important applications  from physical point of view             Last Modified: 06/03/2013       Submitted by: Nader Masmoudi]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
