<AbstractNarration>Dazhong Zhao &lt;br/&gt;Proposal No.: IOS-0721192&lt;br/&gt;Title: The EMS1 Receptor Kinase and Anther Cell Differentiation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cell fate determination is a critical process in development of all multicellular organisms. A fundamental feature of sexual reproduction in both plants and animals is the specification of distinct types of cells that give rise to eggs and sperm. So far, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying cell fate determination during sexual reproduction in plants. In flowering plants, male reproduction occurs in anthers, which contain highly specialized somatic and reproductive cells. Recently the anther has emerged as a prime model system for the study of cell fate determination and receptor-linked signaling, in addition to its central importance to plant breeding and reproduction. Signal transduction mediated by the EMS1 leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase (LRR-RLK) plays a critical role in regulating anther cell differentiation. This project will use molecular genetic, cell biological and biochemical techniques to further analyze the biological functions of EMS1. The expected results would include the identification of an EMS1 ligand and other novel signaling components in the EMS1 signal transduction pathway. The proposed project will shed light on the molecular mechanisms of cell fate determination during sexual reproduction in plants and other organisms. The results may lead to potential agricultural and industrial applications. The proposed research programs will provide excellent opportunities to integrate research into education through training a postdoctoral scientist, underrepresented undergraduate and graduate students, as well as K-12 students.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

Plant sexual reproduction is not only crucial for producing offspring, but also essential for crop quality and yield. The long-term goal of this project is to elucidate how plant sexual reproduction is controlled at the molecular level. In flowering plants, pollen grains (male gametophytes) are produced in anthers. Within each of four lobes (microsporangia) in a mature anther, reproductive cells (microsporocytes/pollen mother cells) are surrounded by four concentrically organized somatic cell layers (epidermis, endothecium, middle layer, and tapetum). After meiosis microsporocytes develop into pollen, while somatic cells, particularly the tapetum, are critical for normal development and release of pollen. So far, little is known about the molecular mechanisms of cell fate determination during anther development. In the <em>excess </em><em>microsporocytes1</em> (<em>ems1</em>) mutant in <em>Arabidopsis</em>, the reference species for plant biology, anthers produce excess microsporocytes, but do not form their surrounding tapetal cells. The fact that the <em>EMS1</em> gene encodes a leucine-rich repeat receptor-like protein kinase (LRR-RLK) indicates that EMS1 mediates signals to control anther cell fate determination.

The TPD1 signaling requires a functional EMS1. Furthermore, TPD1 induces EMS1 phosphorylation. Moreover, the secretion of TPD1 is required for the normal function of TPD1-EMS1 signal transduction. Second, genetic and biochemical (yeast two-hybrid) screenings were conducted for identifying novel players in the TPD1-EMS1 signal transduction pathway. More than 4,500 lines have been screened, yielding 10 promising enhancers and repressors. Additionally, three promising candidates were obtained from the yeast two-hybrid screening.
