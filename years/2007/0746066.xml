<AbstractNarration>Myxococcus xanthus is a novel model for system-level study of control mechanisms for emergent behavior, and thus the selective advantages of cooperation and of concomitant loss of cellular autonomy. A swarm of M. xanthus is a population of millions of individual autonomous cells that function together as a single machine, coordinating movement through signals and creating dynamic patterns in response to environmental cues, a process called self-organization (SO). One such response, called development, is controlled through a cascade of transcriptional regulators (TRs), which are proteins that activate or deactivate other genes. All SO in M. xanthus could be under this type of control. Two distinct SO behaviors have already been quantified: development, a starvation response in which cells coordinate to form fruiting bodies, and tracking, directed movement of a swarm toward a nutrient source. Mutant strains were created for each of 310 TRs, and those specific for development or tracking were selected, using microarrays to identify the genes likely to be affected by each TR. Candidate genes were then disrupted to confirm the predicted functional associations. The goal of this project is to understand the role of TRs in controlling bacterial SO, using an approach that integrates genomics, computer analysis, automated microscopy, and experimental genetics to identify and characterize genetic control of two distinct emergent behaviors in M. xanthus. This project offers undergraduates, graduates and post-doctoral researchers unique opportunities to deepen their theoretical understanding of biology while gaining critical computer skills. This work is the foundation for Dr. Welch's career research goal to identify and articulate the genetic networks that control multicellular behavior, ultimately yielding critical insights into the origins of multicellularity and genetic control of formation of 3-dimensional structures.</AbstractNarration>

Populations of M. xanthus form cooperative swarms, which act much like a single, simple multi-celled creature. M. xanthus is an excellent model organism to study multicellular behavior. It has large but simple bacterial genome in which controlled mutations can be made, and these genetic changes impact not just individual cells but the observable behavior, or phenotype, of the population as a whole. Under laboratory conditions, on the surface of agar in a petri dish, when an M. xanthus swarm is deprived of nutrients, the millions of cells will synchronously organize into hundreds of dome shaped structures called fruiting bodies. These fruiting bodies are rudimentary multi-celled structures. Each fruiting body contains thousands of cells, some of which transform into dormant spores that can survive for long periods. These spore-containting fruiting bodies ensure the bacterium's survival by enabling it to establish a new swarm when food again becomes available.  The process of fruiting body formation in a starving M. xanthus swarm is an example of emergence: the cells, with no "master plan," self-organize to form coherent structures. Understanding the underlying mechanisms that control emergence is a fundamental question in biology. Three-dimensional structures in nature arise as a result of emergence. We do not currently understand how genes, a one-dimensional instruction set, can code for three-dimensional structures. Better understanding how M. xanthus forms fruiting bodies will increase our understanding of how genes dictate form.  Activating and de-activating genes impacts cell behavior; proteins called transcriptional activators are one important way to do this. M. xanthus has hundreds of transcriptional activators among the estimated 7,500 genes within its genome.  The purpose of this project was to perform a comparative study of entire families of transcriptional activators in M. xanthus. The underlying assumption guiding this project was that, if fruiting body formation represented a stepwise process with a finite number of checkpoints, then disrupting that process through mutation should have a limited number of outcomes. By disrupting the process at each of the checkpoints in a systematic way and carefully examining the outcome, we hypothesized that we could recapitulate the steps. We believed that the transcriptional activators serve as these checkpoints.  We created mutant M. xanthus strains with disruptions in each of the transcriptional activators covering several families, and characterized and quantified their phenotypes. We also examined their transcriptional profiles, to see if the connection between the genotype of a mutant strain and its phenotype could be observed in the genes that were activated and de-activated.  During this project we were able to draw several conclusions about the connection between changes in the M. xanthus genome and corresponding changes in its phenotype:  1. Timelapse microcinematography can be used to characterize mutant strains of M. xanthus that show no unusual phenotype by standard growth and development assays. After observing the starvation-induced development of hundreds of mutant strains using these methods, we empirically determined that they clustered into ten distinct groups. Quantitative methods produce similar groups.  2. Self-organization during development occurs at different scales. Specifically, the placement of fruiting bodies within a swarm is ordered and under genetic control. This nonrandom arrangement occurs along a strict timeline during development, which is not reproduced in any of the currently available mathematical models of M. xanthus development.  3. Phenotypes too subtle to be observed in individual mutant strains can be identified when large numbers of similar mutant strains are analyzed as a group and patterns emerge. Phen...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
