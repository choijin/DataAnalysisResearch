<AbstractNarration>With over 9 million species estimated to exist on Earth, understanding the factors, both ecological and genetic, that contribute to species formation is a central problem in the biological sciences.  While a half-century of research on the genetic basis of speciation has revealed some general insights, only a handful of genes contributing to speciation have been identified; thus, many questions remain.  For example, what kinds of genes are involved in speciation?  Are there few genes of major effect or many genes of small effect?  These questions will be addressed by studying gene flow across a larger number of molecular markers in naturally occurring hybrid populations of two genetically well characterized house mouse species, Mus musculus and Mus domesticus, and through functional analyses of laboratory crosses between them.  The goals of the research are to identify the number and characterize the biological function of genes contributing to speciation in house mice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will involve the participation of postdoctoral researchers, graduate and undergraduate students and scientists in both the Czech Republic and Japan.  House mice are important biomedical models and many of the speciation genes identified in this project are likely to shed light on genes important in reproduction and survival in humans. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project entitled "Collaborative research on the genetic basis of reproductive isolation in a house mouse hybrid zone" was a multi-year international collaboration involving the participation of research institutions in the US and the Czech Republic.  From 2008 to 2013 several investigators and their students conducted a genotyping study of hybridizing subspecies of house mice in order to pinpoint regions of the genome contributing to reproductive isolation.  We sampled 1301 mice from naturally occurring populations in regions of Germany and the Czech Republic, genotyping them at 1403 genetic markers from both the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes.  The project was motivated by a key problem in evolutionary biology, understanding the genetic basis of speciation.  Analyses of the data revealed that hybrid mice were the result of many generations of hybridization.  Analyses of gene flow between subspecies revealed that specific regions of the genome are not freely exchanged suggesting they play a role in reproductive isolation.  These regions include a large portion of the X chromosome and approximately 5% of the autosomal genome.  These regions contain genes with varied functions and many of them are rapidly evolving in mammals. The simultaneous analysis of multiple genetic markers allowed us to also use the genetic data to assess whether the hybrid populations have relocated over time.  We found some instances where this appears to be the case.   Undergraduate and graduate students from the University of Michigan along with graduate students from the Czech Republic, a postdoctoral researcher and a visiting professor all contributed to this project.
