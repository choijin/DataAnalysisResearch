<AbstractNarration>The primary objectives of the project are to recruit talented biology and mathematics students and equip them to pursue cross disciplinary studies and careers that meld biology and mathematics, and to interest and encourage all biology and mathematics students by conveying the excitement of bio-math research. Annually, six highly motivated and qualified mathematics and biology majors (3 per department) are being mentored by five faculty (2 mathematics; 3 biology) in interdisciplinary research in their junior and senior years. Research areas involve Molecular Biology, Cell and Developmental Biology, and Population Ecology. Particular consideration is given to students from underrepresented groups. Outcome assessment measures used to evaluate the program include coursework, seminars, research accomplishments, and student success in entry to graduate school or the work place. An important assessment component is evaluation by an external committee composed of experts in biotechnology and biomathematics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Participants are being trained through both classroom and inquiry-based research. Three new courses are being developed: Primer for BioMath, Math Methods for Biology and Ecology, and Biostochastics. In these courses students learn the different languages of mathematics and biology to facilitate cross disciplinary communication. These courses also provide students the appropriate biological background and teach them problem solving and modeling skills that ensure successful completion of cutting-edge interdisciplinary research. Experiential learning involves hands-on laboratory research, in which three teams of students, mentored by mathematics and biology faculty, work on unsolved, original research problems. Biweekly informal seminars provide a workshop type environment where the status of the research projects is discussed. Students are being taught to think, design, plan, execute, and then communicate their research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: This program provides the venue that reveals the relevance of mathematics to biology, and vice versa. The program strengthens both the educational and research infrastructure at the institution. It develops connections for undergraduates between departments, an activity that is challenging but essential in a small university. In addition, the quality of individual research programs and the overall research foundation of the institution are being enhanced through the integration of rigorous mathematical analyses into ongoing basic biological research programs. The program strengthens mathematical training for all biology students and interdisciplinary training for all mathematics students and better prepares students from both departments for the work place and enhances their career opportunities. The institution is strongly committed to interdisciplinary undergraduate research and believes that the student participants are enriched by scientifically and personally rewarding long-term research experiences.</AbstractNarration>
