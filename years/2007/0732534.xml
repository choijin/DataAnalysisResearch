<AbstractNarration>Funds are provided to model the physics and ecosystem structure of the Bering Sea.  Change in climate forcing will be determined from coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation model (GCM) simulations made for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report (AR4).  The twentieth century hindcasts from these models differ in terms of their ability to replicate past observed conditions; a subset of the better models will be used to project the trends, variability and uncertainty of the climate of the Bering Sea through the first half of the 21st century.  This ensemble of GCM model results will be used primarily for dynamical downscaling, i.e., as initial and boundary conditions for high-resolution ocean model experiments with the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS).  The ROMS simulations are designed to properly handle physical processes known to be important on the Bering Sea shelf, such as sea ice, tides, and cross-shelf exchange; these results will form the direct input for embedded spatially-explicit nutrient-phytoplankton-zooplankton (NPZ) and food web model experiments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is part of a larger program designed to develop understanding of the integrated ecosystem of the eastern Bering Sea shelf, a highly productive region of US coastal waters.  This ecosystem is home to a major portion of the commercial fisheries of the US and also provides significant resources to subsistence hunters and fisherman of Alaska.  The model will help to synthesize our current and developing understanding of how this system functions.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ It is clear that the global climate is changing, but it is not at all obvious how these changes are liable to impact the marine ecosystem of the Bering Sea. This project was one element of an interdisciplinary, multi-institutional program that was organized to investigate the Bering Sea ecosystemÃ†s response to climate change. Our research has focused on the development and application of tools and methods to determine the linkages between the climate and the base of the food web. The insights gained in conducting this work has both informed the overall Bering Sea project of which it has been a part, and provides guidance for similar investigations of other regional marine ecosystems.  Our research has included three specific elements: (1) analysis of simulations from global climate models for use in Bering Sea applications, (2) adaptation of a high-resolution version of numerical ocean model (ROMS) using output from these global climate models as forcing, and (3) development of a ROMS module to simulate nutrient, phytoplankton and zooplankton distributions in the Bering Sea.  The various elements of the latter module are shown in Figure 1.  The spatial and temporal patterns in the large copepods and euphausiids (crustacean zooplankton) are particularly important to higher-trophic levels (fish, seabirds, marine mammals).  Our simulations reveal that the increases in ocean temperature indicated in the global climate models (Fig.2), along with the negative relationship found between temperature and large zooplankton concentrations (Fig. 3), indicate that this key component of the base of the food web is liable to exhibit an overall trend downward, with plenty of variability, over the first half of the 21st century.  Our work has resulted in improved understanding of the mechanisms relating the biology to the physical environment, and information on the probable future state(s) of the physical environment. In addition, our results represent direct information on the trends and future variability in the climate of the Bering Sea and western Alaska, which should be valuable to local stakeholders (especially indigenous and resource dependent communities) in the planning of cultural and economic activities.
