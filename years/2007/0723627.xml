<AbstractNarration>The Mathematics Department of Wayne State University is co-organizing an "International conference in harmonic analysis and partial differential equations with applications" from June 24 to June 30, 2007, together with Beijing Normal University in China, Beijing Institute of Applied Physics and Computational Mathematics in China and University of Bologna in Italy. The scheduled conference topics cover a wide range of subjects in harmonic analysis and partial differential equations with applications, but with a focus of harmonic analysis techniques. This five-day-long conference is intended to stimulate further interest in these important mathematical research areas. The aim of this conference is to highlight the new methods, directions and most recent developments in harmonic analysis and PDEs.  The format of the conference will be intensive lectures by the invited speakers along with semi-structured discussion sessions following the invited talks. Invited speakers are from Italy, US and China.  Anticipated participants shall include not only well established researchers, but also graduate students, postdoctoral and young researchers. In particular, the conference will encourage the participation of women, persons with disabilities and people from underrepresented groups. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference is expeced to strengthen the US-China and US-Italy research collaborations. Students, post-doctors and other participants and researchers from US will have the opportunity to learn new research developments from speakers from Italy and China.  International collaboration is an important component of mathematical research nowadays. This conference will provide a unique opportunity to initiate, build up and strengthen such collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
