<AbstractNarration>Our understanding of the hydrologic cycle has been enhanced substantially by the application of isotope ratio measurements of hydrogen and oxygen in water. Further progress in understanding the hydrologic cycle is limited, however, by the constraints imposed by conventional isotopic measurement techniques, which involve sporadic sample collection intervals and relatively long holding and analysis times. The availability of instrumentation for real-time isotope monitoring, having the accuracy and precision of conventional laboratory-based measurements, could lead to significant fundamental advances in understanding the hydrologic cycle as well as practical applications such as real-time monitoring of water quality; leakage of levees, dams, landfills, wells, or pipes; volcanic hazards; and other phenomena with impact on human health.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Leakage from improperly sealed oil wells has the potential to contaminate ground waters used for public supply. One such well is located near Greybull, Wyoming, and water leaking past well plugs may be flowing to a ranch, known as the Davis Ranch. It is proposed that a Los Gatos Research Liquid-Water Isotope Analyzer be leased and used to measure the isotopic composition of springs and surface waters providing water to the Davis Ranch. A side benefit of this investigation will be to determine if the Los Gatos Research Liquid-Water Isotope Analyzer is satisfactory for real-time environmental water studies. This instrument is of great interest to the geosciences community because its cost is about one-fifth that of current instrumentation used conventionally to accomplish the same measurements, and because it potentially might be located on site, which would substantially exceed the capabilities of existing isotopic measurement equipment.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The intellectual merit of this research lies in its exploration of a novel approach to the application of isotope ratio measurements in hydrology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: This project will perform exploratory research that could have significant impact in terms of validating the application of a new type of instrumentation for real-time isotopic measurements of liquid water. The new instrumental approach could potentially transform the way in which isotopic measurements are used in hydrologic investigations. In addition, if the instrumentation is demonstrated to be successful for such applications, then it will make isotopic capabilities much more widely available because of its reduced cost and simpler operation, as well as its capability for field deployment.</AbstractNarration>
