<AbstractNarration>This award to the Mississippi e-Center at Jackson State University provides support for a CEOSE mini-symposium focused on serving persons with disabilities and will be held at the NSF's Headquarters, Arlington, VA on October 15, 2007. The meeting will serve as a forum to assist CEOSE in the exploration of mechanisms that broaden participation of persons with disabilities in STEM, a population sorely under-represented at all levels of scientific and engineering enterprise.  Invited participants will include representatives from the disabled community, including STEM students, and those individuals who have worked with and created programs inclusive and supportive of disabled students and faculty within the STEM disciplines. The symposium will enable CEOSE to identify recommendations for NSF consideration and action. This well-timed conference promises to provide a venue where participants will discuss institutional policies and strategies that are and have been successful at increasing the number of persons with disabilities in STEM.</AbstractNarration>
