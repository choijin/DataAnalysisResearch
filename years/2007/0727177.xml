<AbstractNarration>This program is focused on three critical areas: (1) the recruitment of academically-talented students in Chemistry, Computer Science, Geology, Earth Science, Engineering Technology, Math and Physics using the existing science contests and the ACE (Advanced College Experience) program, (2) the retention of majors through the critical first year of study at Bloomsburg University using the STLLC (Science &amp; Technology Living Learning Community) and (3) continuation of support for S-STEM scholars as they progress in their major through graduation. The project is funding about 13 students who are the target of this program with $10,000 each year for four years. These S-STEM Scholars are guaranteed scholarship support at the level granted for the freshman year provided they maintain program eligibility and financial need. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project is its focus on the recruitment and retention of eligible students into the STEM disciplines. The target audience for recruitment includes the normal pool of student applicants plus students in nineteen Pennsylvania Upward Bound programs and twelve Math and Science Upward Bound programs in Pennsylvania and surrounding states (several thousand students). The retention efforts are built on well established principles including (1) social activities centered on academic programs, (2) peer mentoring, (3) time management instruction, and (4) emergency intervention services. Retention activities also include a host of placement testing, tutoring, and academic services designed to help students get past hurdles such as Calculus I or the transition from high school to college. Off-hours tutoring and living/learning communities are strategies that have helped the scholars make good progress in their degree programs. The broader impact of this project is to increase the overall number of students both entering the STEM disciplines and graduating in these disciplines due to the intensive retention and student support efforts.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Improving the Recruitment, Retention and Continuation of Students in Mathematics and the Physical Sciences was awarded to Bloomsburg University from 2007-2013.  During that time, nearly 20 students were awarded scholarships in the majors of mathematics, computer science, computer forensics, physics, chemistry and geosciences.  These students were chosen because of their interest in a STEM discipline and their financial need.  15 of those students were retained in their respective majors through graduation.  These students received specialized master tutoring which focused upon their mastery of mathematics not only in mathematics classes but also in other science classes with a strong mathematical component.  In addition, students were required to attend STEM colloquia and other lectures whose purpose was to demonstrate the larger rewards of a career in a STEM subject.  As the students matriculated through Bloomsburg University, they themselves became resources to other students.  Many of these students became tutors in Bloomsburg University's tutoring center.  These students were elected to several of the STEM honor societies on campus, as well as other more general honor societies.  At graduation, several of these students were top not only in their subject area, but in the entire College of Science and Technology.  The students have all gotten jobs either in industry or in the teaching profession.       Last Modified: 09/17/2013       Submitted by: Elizabeth Mauch]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
