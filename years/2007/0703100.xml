    <AbstractNarration>This project supports planning for an ATE Regional Center for nanotechnology workforce education. The project team includes K-12 school systems, two-year and four-year colleges, and business leaders of the Tennessee Innovation Valley Nano Alliance. In order to support the growth of Tennessee's Innovation Valley, educational institutions and local industries are developing high-quality programs to educate skilled, versatile nanotechnology technicians.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: The project team is using a collaborative planning process that is influencing science, math, and technology education at the secondary and postsecondary levels. The planning process includes: identifiying appropriate fields of nanotechnology education that can have the greatest positive impact on the regional economy; identifying industry and academic skill standards; identifying best practices in curriculum and instructional delivery in the region; strengthening partnerships among the various organizations; identifying professional development needs; identifying needs and barriers to recruitment of students and developing strategies to address them; and developing an operational structure for implementation of regional center activities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: This project is increasing collaboration among regional educational institutions, business and industry, and scientific research organizations, and supporting students from middle school through college programs and into the workplace. The project is also developing strategies for extending access and broadening participation of underrepresented and underserved groups. There is strong support from the state of Tennessee that helps ensure wide impact within the state.</AbstractNarration>
