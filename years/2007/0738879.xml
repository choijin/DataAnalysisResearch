<AbstractNarration>The rise of the Tibetan plateau has profoundly changed the Earth's atmospheric&lt;br/&gt;circulation and climate. For this reason, it has been the prime site to understand the link&lt;br/&gt;between tectonics and climate change as well as the processes of continental collision.&lt;br/&gt;There are several competing hypotheses for the rise of the Tibetan plateau: a rapid and&lt;br/&gt;broad increase in the elevation of the plateau, an expansion of the plateau by&lt;br/&gt;continuous viscous flow of lower crust, or an expansion of the plateau by sequential and&lt;br/&gt;localized shear between coherent crust and mantle blocks. At the center of the&lt;br/&gt;competing scenarios is the question whether the plateau has grown upward en masse&lt;br/&gt;or outward over time. The best place to address this question is the northeast Tibetan&lt;br/&gt;plateau, where the plateau is at a nascent stage with features and dynamic processes&lt;br/&gt;in the crust and shallow mantle that are keys to the understanding of the mechanisms&lt;br/&gt;that may have operated for the entire Tibetan plateau.&lt;br/&gt;This collaborative project between U.S. and Chinese institutions acquires seismic data&lt;br/&gt;from the northeast Tibetan plateau. The research includes detailed studies to image the&lt;br/&gt;crust and mantle structures in the region, to test the current hypotheses against seismic&lt;br/&gt;observations, and to develop new models that integrate seismic observations and other&lt;br/&gt;geological constraints. The research also includes focused studies to analyze regional&lt;br/&gt;earthquake activity, which helps to mitigate earthquake hazards in one of the&lt;br/&gt;seismically most active areas in the interior of a continental plate.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

One type of data allows us to map the fabric in the lithosphere (the outmost strong shell of the earth) and the flow in the asthenosphere (the hot and viscous layer under the lithosphere).  We found that the fabric close to major faults in the lithosphere is strongly affected by the faults while the results away from the faults indicate more effects from  asthenosphere flow. This study helps to understand how the lithosphere and asthenosphere respond to the continent-continent collision between India and Asia.     We used data for the largest ground motions to determine seismic wave velocity model in NE Tibet.  Our model show the lithosphere in this area is thin and slow relative to the global model,  indicating it is mechanically weak and probably easy to deform.  This observation helps to understand why the Qilian-Qinling mountains and the Tibetan plateau are still actively developing here.  We also imaged a local slow anomaly right beneath the bend of the Kunlun fault. The slow anomaly could be caused by hot temperature from the upwelling of the hot asthenosphere after the removal of a thick lithosphere root.
