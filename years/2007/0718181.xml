    <AbstractNarration>A workshop will be conducted to evaluate the responses by the research community submitted in response to a request for information associated with the National Ecological Observatory Network Program. To evaluate these responses requires technology, technical expertise, and spatial data resources that are only available at the USGS EROS Data Center in Sioux Falls, SD. We are requesting transfer of funds to the USGS to conduct this evaluation for the BIO NEON Program and oversee a workshop of scientific and technical experts. Because of the scientific and technical scope of NEON, the evaluation requires scientific and technical expertise from the larger reserach community in addition to the technical expertise provided by the USGS. The workshop will be held at the EROS Data Center, therefore, providing funds to the USGS to handle the logistics, participant support, and travel will be the most cost effective means to accomplish the workshop and technical evaluation.</AbstractNarration>
