<AbstractNarration>This award provides continued funding for COSEE California (COSEE CA) which has demonstrated its ability to develop successful, catalytic activities that spark and nurture collaborations among scientists and educators to advance ocean literacy. COSEE CA combines the resources and expertise of original partners, Scripps Institution of Oceanography and Lawrence Hall of Science, University of California, Berkeley, with two new partners, San Diego Unified School District and The College of Exploration. With the goal of increasing public awareness and understanding of the ocean, COSEE CA will embark on three major initiatives: 1) Supporting the Ocean Literacy campaign (developing and validating an ocean sciences learning progression to accompany the Ocean Literacy scope &amp; sequence, and disseminating the Ocean Literacy framework); 2) Strategic national dissemination of Communicating Ocean Sciences to Formal and Informal Audiences by streamlining the implementation process to reach large numbers of new institutions; and 3) supporting sustained partnerships among teachers, facilitators and researchers to develop cutting-edge educational tools that promote inquiry through the use of technology-mediated visualizations, simulations and investigations. Together, these three initiatives comprise a coherent strategy for building the nations capacity for putting into practice the Essential Principles of Ocean Literacy at all levels of formal education. &lt;br/&gt;COSEE CA is focused on the following objectives: 1) bring the content knowledge and technology tools of ocean scientists into the world of K-12 and postsecondary education; 2) build Network-wide collaborations that provide COSEE with national standing and a collective voice; 3) develop and disseminate model programs that increase the publics understanding of the ocean; and 4) conduct educational research to bring ocean sciences into mainstream science education curriculum and standards. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ COSEE CA has contributed to a significant change in the research culture at Scripps Institution of Oceanography, U.C. San Diego (Scripps) and beyond, engaging an ever increasing number of investigators and graduate students in education and outreach, while simultaneously contributing lessons learned to the national effort to do the same.  COSEE CA has long been a leader in supporting scientists in developing, proposing and implementing broader impact components for their NSF research proposals.  Over the history of COSEE CA, the process by which researchers are helped with their BI components has evolved into an efficient, highly streamlined process that capitalizes on long term experience working with researchers, educators, contracts and grants officers, and business offices to ensure that BI components contribute to effective ongoing education and outreach programs, are budgeted appropriately, and can move through the university proposal system without encountering frustrating hurdles.  Moreover, the intent of providing this service has been to establish partnerships that can serve the Broader Impact needs for researchers for the long term, without the need for additional use of the service, and many such partnerships now exist.     COSEE CA was a pioneer in creating communications courses (Lawrence Hall of Science) that provide researchers at every level with training and practical experience in communicating their science to a wide variety of audiences.  At Scripps, we built on that legacy and through the years have taught these courses in various forms (courses, workshops, summer institutes) for undergraduates, graduate students, and researchers at Scripps.  Communicating Ocean Sciences to Informal Audiences is now a well-established graduate/undergraduate level course, with conversations ongoing with Scripps leadership about expanding the scope and number of training courses offered as part of enhanced graduate education at Scripps.     Through COSEE CA, and subsequent Scripps investment in supporting programs and activities established by COSEE CA, students, teachers and the public will continue to receive the benefit of researcher involvement in education and outreach.  Programs established through COSEE CA funding are helping to build a cadre of teaching professionals who are well versed in the practices of science and have a deeper connection to the ocean sciences research enterprise, thus making them ideal teacher leaders in promoting the implementation of the Next Generation Science Standards.  Pre-college students are afforded opportunities to interact with and learn from young scientists (e.g. graduate students).  Graduate students who have participated in COSEE CA courses and programs are emerging from graduate school with a broader set of teaching and communication skills than they would have otherwise and will bring what they have learned into their professional careers as scientists.
