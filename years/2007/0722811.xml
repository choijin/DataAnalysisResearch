<AbstractNarration>The MRI project supports the acquisition of a high-resolution time of flight aerosol mass spectrometer (HR-ToF-AMS). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Background: Particles, especially nanoparticles, are involved in many practical applications such as drug delivery, medical therapy, material synthesis, catalysis, gas sensing, coatings, ultrafast-response electronic components, high-energy tunable laser diodes, and so on. Particles are also released into the environment from emission sources such as municipal waste incinerators, hazardous waste incinerators, welding systems, automobiles, diesel engine and aircraft exhausts, smelters, and utility boilers. There is also concern that nano-sized particles may be more harmful to human health than those in larger size ranges. Both the characterization and mitigation of particles is, therefore, a very topical area of environmental research. Research:  Because of the importance in both understanding the adverse effects of particles and exploiting their features for beneficial purposes, aerosol research has been selected as one of four focal research areas (i.e., aerosol science and engineering; engineered aquatic processes; multi-scale modeling and molecular transformation engineering; and metabolic engineering and system biology) in the newly organized department of Energy, Environmental and Chemical Engineering (EECE), Washington University in St. Louis. Four core faculty members (i.e., PI and Co-PIs of this proposal) in EECE are heavily involved in particle-related research. To advance the knowledge and to develop the technology related to particles it is essential to characterize the size and composition distributions of particles. While there is extensive aerosol sampling and characterization instrumentation on campus, there is a glaring gap in the ability to simultaneously measure particle size and composition distributions in real time. The PIs, therefore, proposed the acquisition of high-resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer (HR-ToF-AMS) from Aerodyne Research Inc. The objectives of this proposed instrumentation acquisition project are: (1) to develop the capacity for real-time, simultaneous measurement of particle size and composition distributions; (2) to further advance particle related research activities at Washington University in St. Louis and research institutes in the surrounding area; and (3) to support the student training and education on the particle characterization at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact The acquisition of HR-ToF-AMS will have significant impact on particle related research and education at Washington University by improving chemical analysis capabilities in the growth areas of aerosol science, environmental engineering and materials science. Acquisition of the instrument will advance the infrastructure for multidisciplinary research &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;activities by strengthening the facilities of the EECE and Center for Materials Innovation. The instrument will be used by faculty to advance scientific understanding in their respective disciplines of aerosol science and technology, environmental engineering, and materials science. The results of research using the instrument will have many societal benefits. The knowledge gained from environmental science and engineering research can provide a scientific basis for improved environmental protection. Improved understanding of nano-structured materials will benefit society when these novel materials are deployed in environmental, biomedical, and information technology applications. Meanwhile, the proposed instrument will be integrated into the curriculum of Aerosol Science and Technology for the senior undergraduate and graduate education. It will also strengthen the core courses for undergraduate Nanotechnology minor via hands-on or demonstration experiments. The inclusion of HR-ToF-AMS will enhance the teaching quality of the courses offered by these educational programs, and produce competent and creative workforce students for the societies. The PIs will actively present the research and education opportunity to underrepresented groups by approaching related student associations, and will recruit those interested to advance their careers in particle technology. Undergraduate students from other universities will have opportunities to experience this state-of-art instrument through the NSF-funded REU programs.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
