<AbstractNarration>Exploration of THz CMOS for Imaging Applications&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ali M. Niknejad&lt;br/&gt;University of California, Berkeley&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to demonstrate functional THz sources and detectors utilizing deeply scaled complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology for imaging applications.  The approach is to exploit the strength and low cost of CMOS to realize arrays of sources and detectors to improve the sensitivity of the imaging system.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: As CMOS technology has scaled to the nanometer regime, operation at higher sub-mm-wave/THz frequencies is becoming possible.  This research will demonstrate key building blocks to enable a low-cost CMOS-based imaging system.  Using a sharp pulse-based imaging system, a broad range of frequencies from microwave to THz can be captured using matched filter detection algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The THz spectrum has a host of science, engineering, and medical applications.  The chemical signature of many organic molecules also occurs in the THz band, which allows one to use THz spectroscopy, with applications in research and security.  Given security threats at airports and densely populated urban centers, it's vital to exploit THz technology.  THz imaging allows one to see through objects, and thus probe inside tissue.  While THz detection has been used in medical imaging and cancer detection, today's systems are expensive, costing from hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars.  THz electronics research requires a multidisciplinary background in device physics, circuit design and modeling, and optics.  Thus graduate and undergraduate students will be acquiring a diverse and multi-disciplinary education.  Undergraduate students, especially women and underrepresented minorities, will be actively recruited into the research and education components of this project.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
