<AbstractNarration>Dissertation Research: Systematics of Prunus subgenus Amygdalus L. (ROSACEAE)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Almonds (Prunus dulcis) and peaches (Prunus persica), two economically important fruit crops, are members of Prunus subgenus Amygdalus L., in the Rose family (Rosaceae). Controversy over the classification of Amygdalus L., a group of about 33 species, still exists and an updated systematic treatment is necessary to resolve these controversies. The objectives of this project are to 1) elucidate evolutionary relationships within Prunus subgenus Amygdalus, 2) produce taxonomic treatment of this group, including species circumscriptions, identification keys, distribution maps, illustrations and ecological notes and 3) Identify closest wild relatives of almond landraces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will have numerous positive impacts. Plant breeders can use the results as a framework to resolve puzzling questions of domestication and the origin of cultivated almonds and to better understand the extremely limited gene pool that is available for future breeding programs of both almonds and peaches. Conservation biologists can use the taxonomic treatment to make informed decisions about what species to conserve and where. The treatment will provide ecologists and conservationists with a practical guide to identify species by providing them with keys and checklists based on features that can be recognized in the field, and with geographical and ecological information, which would contribute to the overall documentation of world agro-biodiversity.  Because of the economic importance of both almonds and peaches throughout the world, the general public will also be interested in the results of this work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
