<AbstractNarration>Abstract &lt;br/&gt;SES-0753623 &lt;br/&gt;Gail Smith &lt;br/&gt;CUNY &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SES-0753656 &lt;br/&gt;Janet Weiss &lt;br/&gt;University of Michigan Ann Arbor &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SES-0753628 &lt;br/&gt;Steven Salley &lt;br/&gt;Wayne State University &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SES-0753641 &lt;br/&gt;Karen Klomparens &lt;br/&gt;Michigan State University &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The City University of New York (CUNY), the University of Michigan (U-M), Michigan State University (MSU), and Wayne State University (WSU) are among the Top 25 Institutions awarding baccalaureate and doctoral degrees in the social, behavioral and economic (SBE) sciences to underrepresented minorities. In addition, these institutions have documented success in meeting AGEP goals in the STEM (science, technology engineering and mathematics) fields. CUNY is currently part of a MAGNET/STEM AGEP alliance partnered with the New Jersey Institute of Technology, Polytechnic University and Stevens Institute of Technology. U-M, MSU and WSU partner with Western Michigan University to form the Michigan AGEP Alliance (MAA). CUNY and the Michigan AGEP Alliance (MAA), consisting of the University of Michigan, Michigan State University and Wayne State University combined efforts and formed a new regional alliance to advance the production of underrepresented minorities (i.e., African American, Hispanics, American Indians, Asian/Pacific Islanders) in the social, behavioral and economic sciences (SBE) at the B.S. through Ph.D. and early career levels. Alliance institutions are both sharing resources and best practices across the alliance and including SBE fields in existing AGEP programs. The CUNY/MAA Alliance for the SBE sciences has increased participation in summer research programs, expanded recruitment and research opportunities for social sciences students, further developed targeted relationships with minority-serving institutions, provided across the alliance student mentoring and mentoring training for faculty, coordinated skill building workshops to help ensure graduate study success and enhanced fellowship support. It has also expanded student support groups, teaching opportunities, teacher training workshops, students' attendance at professional workshops, and postdoctoral and early career education. This grant funds a continuation of these efforts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project broader impacts will be through the institutionalization of a larger pool of individuals studying and conducting research in the SEE disciplines through the utilization of effective strategies that will attract, motivate, and train domestic talent, especially among underrepresented minorities, women and persons with disabilities. The result of these activities will be to advance understanding of the role of the social and behavioral sciences in the nation, as well as to strengthen the national workforce. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The funding provided by the NSF through the Alliance for Graduate Education and the Professoriate for the Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences (AGEP-SBES) supported activities and programs to recruit underrepresented minority students to enroll in graduate degree programs, and to facilitate their successful completion of doctoral degrees.  The Alliance consisted of the University of Michigan, Wayne State University, Michigan State University, and the City University of New York.  Together as well as on their own campuses these universities leveraged resources to promote the success of outstanding underrepresented minority students in doctoral study in Anthropology, Economics, Political Science, Psychology, Sociology, and Urban and Regional Planning.  The ultimate goal is to increase the number of faculty from underrepresented minorities in these academic fields.                 We designed and delivered programs to attract undergraduate students from underrepresented minorities to pursue a Ph.D. in these six disciplines.  These efforts included a range of strategies.  We reached out through recruiting events at colleges and conferences across the nation, funding the participation of faculty, students and staff.  Another key strategy was helping to organize and fund student-led efforts, to forge partnerships between student organizations and maximize time and resources devoted to recruiting the targeted groups.  We also worked with Graduate School staff to fund and host campus visits by students in federally funded programs that recognize achievements of underrepresented college students, and provided workshops on how to prepare for graduate school.  We sponsored the participation of underrepresented students in these six disciplines in a residential summer research program on our campus for college juniors and seniors.  This enables highly competitive students to work with faculty on graduate level research and the program serves as pipeline to admission to the related graduate degree program.                 The Alliance members developed activities to support these underrepresented PhD students in their efforts to complete their research and dissertations in a timely way.  We created and provided programs that enriched the studentsÆ degree work and made certain they had access to the resources required for research and production of the dissertation.  We sponsored the participation of underrepresented minorities in these six fields who had received Rackham Merit Fellowships in the Summer Institute, a rigorous and accelerated introduction to graduate school at the University of Michigan.  Similarly, we sponsored their participation in nationally renowned Summer Program in Quantitative Methods of Social Research, provided by the Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research at the University of Michigan. We designed and administered the Michigan AGEP Student Seminars; their regular meetings provide doctoral students the opportunity to informally present their research to their peers for productive critiques.  Funds from AGEP-SBES were used for a mini-grant program that provided modest support to these doctoral students for necessary activity such as conference travel, transcription services, travel for interviews, participant incentives, and data storage.  Mentoring is a critical success factor for all graduate students and perhaps especially for underrepresented minority doctoral students. We developed and hosted a one-day workshop to enhance mentoring relationships between 18 faculty advisors and their prot&eacute;g&eacute;s. Mentors and their prot&eacute;g&eacute;s created a plan to implement mentoring strategies for continued use in the future.                 Our strategies to help these students to prepare themselves for an academic career, and to be superbly qualified to compete for positions as professors, focused on their professional development.  We ensured that our students routinely were infor...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
