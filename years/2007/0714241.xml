<AbstractNarration>The Space Science Institute is establishing a museum educator/theater network of eight museums around the country, pairing larger with smaller institutions.  The Association of Science-Technology Centers and the Astronomical Society of the Pacific also are collaborators.  The primary audience is informal science education museum educators; secondary audiences are museum visitors experiencing the to-be-developed programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Science Theater Education Programming System (STEPS) is a technology that has been developed by the PI and others.  The team will be continuing to expand the capability of the system for this project, and the partnering museums are collaboratively creating an initial set of theater programs on astrobiology, along with a suite of training programs and communication formats for educators.  The STEPS technology allows these programs to be delivered both on site and via outreach, depending on the goals of each organization.  The intent is to form the core of a community of practice that would enhance the professional capacity and identities of informal educators.  The theater program format is positioned as a flexible, low-cost alternative to traveling exhibits, particularly for the smaller institutions.  Deliverables include: the establishment of the network, the STEPS system and programs, professional development tutorials and workshops, evaluation of the programs, and a research project and report examining the network as a community of practice and vehicle for strengthening the professional identities of museum educators.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
