<AbstractNarration>This award will permit Illinois Wesleyan University (IWU) to acquire a 64 Channel electroencephalographic (EEG) recording system to examine correlates between brain activity and cognitive factors such as memory performance, language acquisition, social rejection and the potential benefits of exercise on long-term brain functioning. With the capability of recording from only three brain regions simultaneously, the current EEG acquisition system at IWU is not sufficient to address complex issues in the field of behavioral neuroscience. A literature review of published studies utilizing EEG technology reveals that a majority of research laboratories utilize a 64 channel EEG acquisition system. Thus, the proposed acquisition will represent an important step forward in the quality of undergraduate research at IWU.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two current ongoing studies at IWU illustrate the rich intellectual potential of EEG technology. In the first study, preliminary results indicate a strong correlation between EEG changes and correct/incorrect working memory performance. Given the memory decline associated with aging and other brain injuries, understanding the mechanisms by which the brain processes stimuli is essential. In the second study, preliminary results suggest a strong correlation between EEG activity and social rejection in a chat room conversation. Early results suggest that social rejection leads to changes in brain activity that can be detected using EEG technology and that personality differences (e.g. introversion vs. extroversion) might affect how the brain reacts to this social rejection. Though these preliminary results are exciting, the limitations of the current EEG acquisition system does not permit a deeper exploration of several critical variables, such as how multiple brain regions work together to process information. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will also significantly impact the broader IWU community. For instance, the proposed EEG system will strengthen emerging programs, such as a recently approved Cognitive Science Minor (an interdisciplinary program involving the Psychology, Mathematics, Computer Science and Philosophy departments). IWU has shown a strong commitment to interdisciplinary programs, providing internal research funding for collaborations between the Psychology Department and Computer Science and the Psychology Department and Nursing. The proposed EEG acquisition system will represent an important step towards strengthening interdisciplinary collaborations at IWU. In addition, this award will also assist IWU's overall commitment to diversity, a key component of the university's recently-approved strategic plan. Of the 17 students participating in EEG collection this year, 15 students (88%) were female and 4 were minority students (24%). Given the traditional disparities in gender and minority participation in neuroscience relative to other fields of psychology, these numbers show the broad appeal of EEG data collection with underrepresented populations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overall, this award will represent a significant step forward on both an intellectual level by allowing more complex research issues to be examined and on a broader level by allowing IWU to strengthen several key initiatives, such as developing interdisciplinary programs and improving campus diversity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
