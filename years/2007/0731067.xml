<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;Williams, Eric, PI&lt;br/&gt;Arizona State University&lt;br/&gt;CBET-0731067&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Assessing and Managing the Sustainability of Global Reverse Supply Chains: The Case of Personal Computers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cindy M. Lee, Program Director, (703) 292-5356&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The main goal for this work is to develop the intellectual framework necessary for engineering and managing an international reverse supply chain from a sustainability perspective.  The PIs take a case study approach using the reverse supply chain for personal computers in the U.S. The research consists of three components. The first component consists of a material flows analysis to understand the global reach of the end-of-life computers from the U.S. The analysis will stimulate methodological development due to the lack of supporting data infrastructures addressing used goods and materials for recycling. The second component consists of understanding the environment and development aspects of different paths for this reverse supply chain. A new method/perspective termed Global Paths Analysis will be developed, which traces and assesses environmental, economic, and social characteristics of flows of end-of-life processes through different nations. The third component explores the earth systems engineering of technology systems incorporating both engineering and social/policy contexts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Recycling of electronics receives a great deal of attention from policy-makers and the public, although the mass share of material flows of both toxic and benign substances is small.  Despite the focus of attention from governments, non-governmental organizations, and the media, relatively little research has been conducted to inform the broader implications and management strategies of international product/material reverse flows.  This project can make a key contribution to the policy and public discourse.  The case study of personal computers will also be appealing for educational activities for middle school students as well as undergraduate and graduate students. The educational modules and research results will be disseminated through the Center for Sustainable Engineering.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project studies the environmental, economic and social implications of reuse and recycling of computers. The motivation to undertake the work lies in the need to manage the increasing volume of electronics manufactured, used and entering waste streams.  There are new challenges for electronics, such as informal recycling in the developing world and complexity of products with short lifespans. Methods used include life cycle assessment, materials flow analysis and technology diffusion models.  Key findings are:  The developing world will generate more obsolete computers than the developed by 2016-2018. This finding comes from a global material flows analysis which forecasts future computer adoption based on a logistic model. This result sets a new context for policy discussions on international management of electronics waste, which has focused on addressing exports from developed to developing countries. The energy used to manufacture a laptop computer is around 70% of the total consumed for manufacturing and operation. This finding results from a life cycle assessment based on a hybrid method that combines process and economic input-output techniques. New uncertainty analysis techniques are developed through the analysis. The high share of manufacturing suggests that energy management of computers and presumably, other electronics, needs to go beyond improving operational efficiency.  At least 87 percent of end-of-life computers imported to Peru were reused, as opposed to being recycled for materials. The finding comes out of a material flows analyses that analyses imports to Peru shipment by shipment. Trade is end-of-life electronics is often portrayed as waste dumping, this results indicates that there is a positive refurbishment side as well.  Over the period 1985-2000, computer lifespan (purchase to "disposal") at Arizona State University decreased steadily from a mean of 10.7 years in 1985 to 5.5 years in 2000. The distribution of lifespan also evolved, becoming narrower over time.  This result suggests that lifespans are dynamic and that efforts to manage end-of-life electronics should address this dynamism.    Recommendations:  Efforts to manage the environmental impacts of electronics are dominated by a few heuristic principles. Three common goals are increasing recycling, reducing operational energy use and banning trade in electronics scrap. The results of the project suggest a need to reconsider these as driving heuristics.  Given social and environmental benefits of reuse, more consideration should be given to increasing electronics reuse, rather than focusing purely on materials recycling.  Managing the energy use of electronics should also consider how to reduce manufacturing energy use, e.g. through lifespan extension  Rather than focus on banning trade in scrap electronics, policy should address directly how to mitigate the environmental impacts of informal recycling in the developing world.
