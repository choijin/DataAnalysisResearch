<AbstractNarration>0745563&lt;br/&gt;Murphy&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Development and regeneration processes in nature often rely on protein concentration gradients that influence cell activity. The spatial distribution of these proteins, often termed ?morphogens?, influence the phenotype of stem cells as they form new tissues and tissue interfaces. In natural systems, localized protein secretion and subsequent transport through the extracellular matrix&lt;br/&gt;(ECM) often dictate the properties of the resulting concentration gradient and, in turn, the biological effect. The approach of this project will be to mimic this natural mechanism in a controlled manner in synthetic materials in order to deliver controlled soluble morphogen gradients to cells. This project is designed to: 1) determine the parameters that control soluble protein gradients in synthetic hydrogels; and 2) use hydrogel matrices to study the influence of morphogen gradients on adult stem cell phenotype, with the ultimate goal of using these systems to engineer tissue interfaces. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The interdisciplinary approach of this project will be intertwined with educational activities that integrate biology, bioengineering, and science policy in graduate student training, undergraduate education, and community outreach. The education plan will develop and assess: 1) an interdisciplinary graduate internship program that exposes students to the interface between biology, bioengineering, and public policy; 2) a program that supports collaboration between interdisciplinary graduate researchers and undergraduates from underrepresented minority groups in the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines; and 3) interdisciplinary education and outreach experiences that catalyze interactions between biological, physical, and social sciences.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
