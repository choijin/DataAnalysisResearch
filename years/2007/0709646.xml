<AbstractNarration>Urbanization is a leading cause of species endangerment in the US.  Some species, however, thrive in urban habitats.  Understanding what factors in the urban environment allow these urban winners to be successful is critical in understanding effects of urbanization on wildlife. The proposed research will address factors allowing one such species, the Northern Mockingbird, to reach high abundance in urban areas relative to non-urban areas.  Nest predation rates of mockingbirds from 2005-2006 demonstrate reduced nest predation in urban areas, despite higher abundance of avian nest predators (crows, blackbirds, jays) and at least some mammals (cats, raccoons).  This research will address this 'predator paradox' by quantifying predation rates from different groups of predators in urban and non-urban habitats using surveillance cameras on nests.  Knowing how predator communities change in urban areas will allow researchers to make predictions about how other species will respond to urbanization. &lt;br/&gt;To study mockingbirds in neighborhoods and parking lots, the permission of many property owners is obtained by going door-to-door.  Interactions with citizens raise their awareness of wildlife and foster a connection with nature.  This connection is necessary to succeed in conserving biodiversity in both urban areas and far-away pristine habitats.  The PI's will also develop lesson plans with undergraduate education majors that expose middle school students to science and wildlife.  Raising awareness of citizens about the nature that surrounds them in parking lots and backyards is a first step in bringing science and an appreciation for nature to everyone.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
