<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Digital Age has brought about unprecedented growth in the amount&lt;br/&gt;of data being generated, the number of data consumers, and the&lt;br/&gt;diversity of their interests and locations.  Traditionally, users poll&lt;br/&gt;sources for information, but for many applications, polling is hardly&lt;br/&gt;scalable and may miss important events.  The alternative offered by&lt;br/&gt;publish/subscribe systems is to push notifications to users with&lt;br/&gt;matching interests.  This approach suits many applications, ranging&lt;br/&gt;from personal, commercial, medical, to environmental, military, and&lt;br/&gt;security.  However, traditional publish/subscribe systems are becoming&lt;br/&gt;inadequate for advanced applications, where users want to receive&lt;br/&gt;information that has been filtered, joined, and summarized, and only&lt;br/&gt;when certain conditions are met.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims at building a next-generation publish/subscribe&lt;br/&gt;system to face the new challenges.  The PIs propose an end-to-end&lt;br/&gt;solution consisting of techniques from subscription processing and&lt;br/&gt;indexing to dissemination network design, which work together to&lt;br/&gt;support efficient and powerful subscription functionalities, allowing&lt;br/&gt;users to control precisely what they want and when they want it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One main feature distinguishing the proposed approach from previous&lt;br/&gt;work is joint consideration of subscription processing and&lt;br/&gt;notification dissemination.  Traditionally, these problems are&lt;br/&gt;considered separately by database and networking communities.&lt;br/&gt;However, there exists a wide spectrum of interesting alternatives for&lt;br/&gt;interfacing processing with dissemination.  The PIs propose a&lt;br/&gt;promising approach that allows complex, stateful subscriptions to be&lt;br/&gt;handled by simple, stateless dissemination mechanisms, with a clean&lt;br/&gt;system design that is easy to implement and scale.  A cost-based&lt;br/&gt;optimizer, inspired by database query optimization, chooses the best&lt;br/&gt;processing and dissemination strategies jointly and dynamically.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besides system building, this project tackles many new algorithmic&lt;br/&gt;challenges, including, e.g., scalably processing a large number of&lt;br/&gt;complex subscriptions; exploiting event and subscription&lt;br/&gt;characteristics to combat worst-case complexity; balancing semantic&lt;br/&gt;similarity and network proximity in dissemination network design; and&lt;br/&gt;efficiently maintaining statistics for high-dimensional events and&lt;br/&gt;subscriptions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bringing together their expertise in databases and algorithms, the PIs&lt;br/&gt;have a track record of collaborating with each other and with&lt;br/&gt;researchers outside computer science.  A planned application of the&lt;br/&gt;system is to help ecologists with environmental monitoring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs are committed to integrating research and education, and in&lt;br/&gt;particular undergraduate research, by following their tradition of&lt;br/&gt;involving undergraduates through REU and department fellowships.  The&lt;br/&gt;PIs are collaborating on an effort supported by the Department of&lt;br/&gt;Education, to increase workforce diversity for women, minorities, and&lt;br/&gt;persons with disabilities.  They also participate in an internship&lt;br/&gt;program for underrepresented groups, which provides minority students&lt;br/&gt;opportunities to perform paid summer research with Duke faculty&lt;br/&gt;members.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project URL: http://www.cs.duke.edu/dbgroup/prosem/&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
