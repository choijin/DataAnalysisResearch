<AbstractNarration>Rosales&lt;br/&gt;0703937&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Aggregation, the coalescence of monomers into large,&lt;br/&gt;structured clusters, is found at the heart of many phenomena in&lt;br/&gt;science and industry.  In a simplified model, cluster growth is a&lt;br/&gt;discrete stochastic process of adding or shedding monomers, one&lt;br/&gt;at a time.  The Becker-Doring (BD) ordinary differential&lt;br/&gt;equations govern the growth of small clusters by surface&lt;br/&gt;reactions.  Large clusters, growing by the diffusion of the&lt;br/&gt;surrounding monomers, are described by the Lifshitz-Slyozov&lt;br/&gt;equations.  Small clusters nucleate and form large ones by a slow&lt;br/&gt;process caused by fluctuations over a free-energy barrier.  The&lt;br/&gt;investigator, Joseph Farjoun, studies the following aspects of&lt;br/&gt;nucleation:&lt;br/&gt; (a) The Zeldovich nucleation formula disagrees with the&lt;br/&gt;experimental results.  It is highly sensitive to the&lt;br/&gt;super-saturation's value, and hence on the distribution of&lt;br/&gt;cluster-sizes.  The investigator seeks a more accurate formula by&lt;br/&gt;resolving the super-saturation to higher order.  In addition, a&lt;br/&gt;simulation based on renormalized Monte-Carlo methods is providing&lt;br/&gt;more data on the nucleation rate. &lt;br/&gt; (b) The long-term distribution of clusters sizes, as determined&lt;br/&gt;by the Zeldovich nucleation rate and LS growth rate, is a&lt;br/&gt;classical problem.  The investigator studies a connection to the&lt;br/&gt;smooth similarity-solution: A deeper analysis of the partial&lt;br/&gt;answer in his PhD thesis. &lt;br/&gt; (c) The analysis of 2-dimensional nucleation is a natural&lt;br/&gt;extension of the work in the investigator's PhD thesis.  The&lt;br/&gt;logarithmic behavior of monomer concentration about nuclei in&lt;br/&gt;2-dimensions forces the nucleation process to be spatially&lt;br/&gt;non-homogeneous.  The investigator studies this by connecting to&lt;br/&gt;previous work on 2-dimensional diffusion. &lt;br/&gt; (d) The investigator studies the dynamic dependency of the&lt;br/&gt;aggregation process on other physical parameters.  Specifically,&lt;br/&gt;he analyzes aggregation in a system with a varying temperature. &lt;br/&gt;The nucleation rate and the total amount of clusters formed are&lt;br/&gt;determined by a balance between the decreasing temperature and&lt;br/&gt;the depletion of monomers, which have competing effects on the&lt;br/&gt;super-saturation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Phenomena that are modeled by aggregation -- solidification,&lt;br/&gt;precipitation, and the condensation of vapor into droplets --&lt;br/&gt;appear in many biophysical and industrial contexts:&lt;br/&gt;Glass-to-crystal transformations, crystal nucleation in&lt;br/&gt;under-cooled liquids, and in polymers, colloidal crystallization,&lt;br/&gt;growth of spherical aggregates beyond the critical micelle&lt;br/&gt;concentration (CMC), and the segregation by coarsening of binary&lt;br/&gt;alloys quenched into the miscibility gap, to name but a few&lt;br/&gt;specific examples.  The field of micro-chip fabrication stands to&lt;br/&gt;benefit greatly from a theory capable of predicting the short-&lt;br/&gt;and long-term behavior of 2-dimensional clusters.  Resolving the&lt;br/&gt;long-standing disagreement between the Zeldovich formula (which&lt;br/&gt;predicts the rate at which clusters are created) and the&lt;br/&gt;experiments, finding the time-scales of the various phases of the&lt;br/&gt;aggregation process, and a theory for 2-dimensional aggregation&lt;br/&gt;(all of which are topics of research in this project) allows for&lt;br/&gt;more accurate predictions and better design.  A more realistic&lt;br/&gt;model, which accounts for the varying temperature, can be used in&lt;br/&gt;the design of vapor-forming industries (e.g. power plants), and&lt;br/&gt;in weather prediction.  The current state of the art in&lt;br/&gt;aggregation is that of extremes: the behavior at very short and&lt;br/&gt;very long times, the behavior of very small or very large&lt;br/&gt;clusters have been studied extensively.  In this project, the&lt;br/&gt;work of the investigator, Joseph Farjoun, bridges these gaps. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
