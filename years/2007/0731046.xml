<AbstractNarration>COSEE-NOW proposes to use information generated by ocean observing systems (OOS) as a powerful platform to enhance public literacy about the ocean and stimulate public support for ocean research. The mission of COSEE-NOW is to enable use of transformative ocean research and effective education practices to inspire students and the general public in ocean exploration, discovery, and stewardship. COSEE-NOW has identified three key areas of investment that combine the resources and experiences of the project PIs to promote high-quality OOS education and public outreach (EPO) and contribute to the COSEE network. The goals include: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; 1) Assess the knowledge and needs of target OOS audiences: The PIs propose to survey target audiences including the K-16 students/teachers, policy/decision makers, and the science literate public to understand their awareness, knowledge, and attitudes related to OOS. The results of these needs assessments will enable COSEE-NOW and OOS EPO providers to develop useful products while increasing awareness of OOS and its relevance to these audiences. &lt;br/&gt; 2) Improve collaboration and coordination among scientists and educators in the OOS community. This proposed effort will support EPO programs within existing OOS networks while helping to develop planned OOS initiatives. Our work will increase the effective translation and dissemination of scientific data and knowledge to broader audiences and improve use of effective education practices among scientists in the OOS community. &lt;br/&gt; 3) Increase public awareness of Ocean Observing Systems. COSEE-NOW is externally focused on building public awareness of OOS through innovative media products, K-12 classroom applications, and free-choice learning environments. Through this goal, we expect to increase awareness of OOS and ocean literacy concepts among a variety of target audiences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;COSEE-NOW is composed of an accomplished team uniquely qualified to conduct the proposed tasks. COSEE-NOW includes core partners in formal education (Rutgers University), informal education (Liberty Science Center), and research (Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution). Project partners including Virginia Institute of Marine Science (VIMS), Stevens Institute of Technology- Center for Innovation in Engineering &amp; Science Education (CIESE), Monterey Peninsula College ? Marine Advanced Technology Center (MATE), and Word Craft also contribute to the COSEE-NOW team. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) participated in the COSEE NOW project led by a team at Rutgers University.   The goals of the project were:  1) develop a sophisticated web site to encourage collaborations within the ocean science community and between ocean scientists and informal/formal educators, particularly those who were interested in using different approaches to make routine observations of ocean conditions (ocean observing systems), including the health of ocean ecosystems;  2)  increase the use of data collected by ocean observing systems to support  formal and informal learners ; and 3) support scientists to meet the requirements of their NSF grants to communicate their results to broader audiences (beyond their peers).   WHOI investigators participated in many, but not all, of the activities of the COSEE NOW team.  The activities in which WHOI participated are described below.   WHOI co-investigator Dr. Ari Daniel Shapiro led several activities to develop unique approaches to help ocean scientists deliver science messages.   Dr. Shapiro produced a series of podcasts  entitled Ocean Gazing each telling a story about a particular scientist or team of scientists who were involved in Federal government initiatives to establish ocean observing systems.  Podcasts are short audio stories, each one running 9 to 10 minutes, that includes interviews, ambient sounds, archival audio, and music.  The idea is to bring the listener onsite with the scientist and the science, and to make the content accessible and enjoyable.   The intellectual merits of this project were the multiple science messages communicated in the podcasts.  Dr. Shapiro produced 52 episodes that explained how scientists and the public use real-time data gathered from ocean observing systems in their professional and personal lives.  Such uses include the prediction of harmful algal blooms and other pollution events, and the coupling of ocean and weather data to navigate the seas safely.  In addition, the episodes often described the education and outreach aspects of a scientistÆs work.   Each episode was posted at www.oceangazing.org, and the site also offers photographs, extra audio or video clips, and a means of contacting the featured researcher.  The broader impacts of this project are related to the way the podcasts were used in the K-12 environment.  Dr. Shapiro and others involved in COSEE NOW produced an Ocean Gazing multimedia DVD that also included lessons based on the podcasts for middle and high school classes mapped to the National Science Education Standards.   Thus, Ocean Gazing podcasts can and were used in the classroom as an introduction to scientists and their science.  A total of 2,000 copies of "Volume 2" of the Ocean Gazing CD were produced in February 2012.  835 copies were distributed at national ocean science and ocean educator meetings in 2012, and the rest were distributed in the following years at various venues and to individual teachers.  Scientists are increasingly being asked to become more involved in communicating the "broader impacts" of their work.  COSEE NOW led a collaboration with other COSEE Centers to develop a comprehensive professional development program for young scientists:  "GEARS Professional Development Program for Early Career Scientists".   The intellectual merit of the 3 GEARS 1-day workshops in which WHOI participated (Ocean Sciences meeting in 2012, at WHOI in 2012 and at Howard University in 2013) was the training provided to early career scientists to help them communicate their science messages to colleagues and to improve their teaching.  The broader impact of the project was the training that was provided to early career scientists to help them better communicate scientific messages to public audiences.  The workshop featured demonstrations and skills, which were organized into four, interconnected gears or areas.
