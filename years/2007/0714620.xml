    <AbstractNarration>In July 2007, the nineteenth international conference entitled Formal&lt;br/&gt;Power Series and Algebraic Combinatorics (FPSAC) will be held at&lt;br/&gt;the Center for Combinatorics at Nankai University in Tianjin, China.&lt;br/&gt;In June 2008, the twentieth FPSAC international conference &lt;br/&gt;will be held in Valparaiso, Chile. The funding from this grant will be &lt;br/&gt;used to exclusively support the attendance, at each of these 2 conferences, of &lt;br/&gt;45 graduate students, post-doctoral students, early career researchers, and &lt;br/&gt;researchers from underrepresented groups, who are studying or working at &lt;br/&gt;American Universities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Traditionally, the FPSAC conferences feature 9 plenary speakers, approximately&lt;br/&gt;30 contributed talks, and 2 poster sessions. The number of participants varies &lt;br/&gt;between 120 to 200 from all around the world, of whom between 70 to 120 are &lt;br/&gt;graduate students and early career researchers. The continuing success of &lt;br/&gt;the annual FPSAC conferences stems in part from their considerable&lt;br/&gt;interdisciplinary breadth---linking leading researchers in combinatorial &lt;br/&gt;mathematics with strong researchers in allied fields drawn from pure and &lt;br/&gt;applied mathematics, theoretical computer science, physics, and biology. The &lt;br/&gt;considerable span of this conference series is unique among international &lt;br/&gt;conferences with an emphasis on combinatorial mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal topics featured during the next two FPSAC conferences will be: &lt;br/&gt;algebraic and enumerative combinatorics and their applications and &lt;br/&gt;relations to other areas of mathematics, physics, biology, and computer &lt;br/&gt;science. The interdisciplinary span is evidenced by the choice of &lt;br/&gt;plenary speakers. All the plenary speakers for China have confirmed their &lt;br/&gt;participation. Those are: Bruce C. Berndt (U. of Illinois, USA), Philippe Biane &lt;br/&gt;(Ecole Normale Superieure, France), Anders Buch (Rutgers U., USA), Maxime &lt;br/&gt;Crochemore (U. of Marne-la-Vallee, France), Eva-Maria Feichtner (U. of Stuttgart,&lt;br/&gt;Germany), Sergey Fomin (U. of Michigan, USA), Ezra Miller (U. of Minnesota, USA),&lt;br/&gt;Soichi Okada (Nagoya U. Japan), and Peter Paule (U. of Linz, Austria).&lt;br/&gt;As for the FPSAC'08 in Chile, the following speakers have confirmed their &lt;br/&gt;participation: Marcelo Aguiar (Texas AM), Micheal Albert (U. of Otago, &lt;br/&gt;New Zealand), Jonathan Brundan (U. of Oregon, USA), Ian Grojnowski (U. of &lt;br/&gt;Cambridge, UK), Maria Ronco (U. de Valparaiso, Chile). The Chair and co-Chair &lt;br/&gt;for the Scientific program of the FPSAC'07 conference are: Bill Chen of Nankai &lt;br/&gt;University, China and Jean-Yves Thibon of the University of Marne-La-Vall\'ee, &lt;br/&gt;France. For the FPSAC'08 conference the chair and co-chair are: Luc Lapointe &lt;br/&gt;of the Universidad de Talca, and Bruce Sagan of Michigan State University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A distinguishing characteristic of FPSAC conferences is the concerted &lt;br/&gt;effort to recognize and encourage outstanding young scientists. This &lt;br/&gt;is accomplished in part by choosing at least one plenary speaker to &lt;br/&gt;be an ``emerging'' star (Eva-Maria Feichtner, Marcelo Aguiar and Jonathan &lt;br/&gt;Brundan) and by ensuring that talented young researchers are well represented &lt;br/&gt;among the speakers selected for contributed talks. Another special feature of &lt;br/&gt;the FPSAC conferences is a continuing effort to emphasize inclusiveness among &lt;br/&gt;participants. The conference seeks to draw substantial participation from &lt;br/&gt;groups which have been traditionally under-represented in the mathematical &lt;br/&gt;sciences. Attendance at these two conferences will be exceptionally valuable &lt;br/&gt;for graduate students and junior researchers. China has a vibrant community &lt;br/&gt;of researchers in combinatorics, and in recent years they have sought to &lt;br/&gt;significantly increase their international research collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;This will be a unique opportunity for graduate students and&lt;br/&gt;early career resarchers to develop ties with Chinese researchers.&lt;br/&gt;FPSAC 2007 marks the first time this conference series will&lt;br/&gt;take place in Asia. FPSAC 2008 also marks the first time this conference &lt;br/&gt;will be held in South America. In contrast to other countries in the region &lt;br/&gt;such as Argentina and Brazil, Chile still has a relatively small mathematical &lt;br/&gt;community. However, it has been fast growing in recent years. We are hopeful &lt;br/&gt;that FPSAC will bolster the efforts for the developement of mathematics in Chile,&lt;br/&gt;at the very least in the field of Discrete Math. There will be conference &lt;br/&gt;Proceedings for each of these two conferences.</AbstractNarration>
