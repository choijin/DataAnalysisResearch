<AbstractNarration>Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ability to characterize and manipulate surfaces down to the nanoscale is crucial for many scientific disciplines. The development of novel thin-film superconducting devices, the synthesis of various nanomaterials, the study of new precursor molecules for chemical vapor deposition of perovskite materials, and the investigation of molecule formation on simulated interstellar dust grains are only a few of the active areas of research at Syracuse University that would benefit from such capabilities.  We plan to build a user facility for analyzing surfaces with multiple techniques over a wide range of length scales.  A scanning electron microscope (SEM), recently acquired by the Physics Department, will form the starting point for this facility.  We will complement this SEM with an atomic force microscope, capable of multiple imaging modes in several different environments, a surface profilometer with three-dimensional scanning capabilities, and a general-purpose optical microscope.&lt;br/&gt;The construction of such a facility will provide a crucial resource for many research groups that are very active in the study of surfaces and will facilitate synergistic collaborations among groups from multiple departments at Syracuse University and nearby institutions.  We plan to utilize the new instruments in our undergraduate lab courses in physics and chemistry.  In addition, undergraduate students from around the country who participate in the summer REU program run by the Chemistry Department will be encouraged to pursue research projects that make use of the new facility. Thus, the surface analysis facility will provide a variety of opportunities for attracting new students in physics, chemistry, biochemistry, and biology with the prospect of exciting research and educational experiences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ability to characterize the nature of surfaces down to length scales 100,000 times smaller than the width of a human hair is crucial for many scientific disciplines and requires specialized equipment.  The development of novel electronic devices made from superconductors, the synthesis of various nanomaterials, the study of new molecules for depositing films of certain technologically- important materials, and the investigation of molecule formation on simulated interstellar dust grains are only a few of the active areas of research at Syracuse University that would benefit from such capabilities. We plan to build a user facility for analyzing surfaces with multiple techniques over a wide range of length scales.  The Physics Department recently acquired a scanning electron microscope, useful for imaging surfaces with a beam of electrons, that will form the starting point for this facility.  We will complement this instrument with an atomic force microscope, capable of imaging the topography of a wide variety of surfaces at the atomic scale, a surface profilometer for imaging surfaces with substantial height variations over areas up to several centimeters on a side, and a general-purpose optical microscope for acquiring detailed surface images using light.  The construction of such a facility will provide a crucial resource for many research groups that are very active in the study of surfaces and will facilitate synergistic collaborations among groups from multiple departments at Syracuse University and nearby institutions.  We plan to utilize the new instruments in our undergraduate lab courses in physics and chemistry. In addition, undergraduate students from around the country who participate in the summer REU program run by the Chemistry Department will be encouraged to pursue research projects that make use of the new facility.
