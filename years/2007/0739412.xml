<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Geller&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EMSW21 MCTP: Transition Points for High School and Undergraduate Mathematics Students &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project for the MCTP program supports summer programs in 2008-2012 targeting the following four transition points which have been impediments for students as they progress through their studies in the mathematical sciences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I. The transition point at which high school students decide on a major in college. &lt;br/&gt;II. The transition point from basic freshman and sophomore courses to upper-level undergraduate theoretical and applied mathematics courses as well as REU-style seminars &lt;br/&gt;III. The transition point after the junior year of deciding to go to graduate school in mathematics &lt;br/&gt;IV. The transition point of entering graduate students from smaller colleges and universities with mostly undergraduate focus to graduate school in mathematics. &lt;br/&gt;To address these transition points, Texas A&amp;M will act as the host institution for the following summer camps, bridge programs, and mentoring activities: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A. A talent search during the academic year and a two week high school summer camp involving 20 participants designed to entice high schoolers to consider mathematics as a major. &lt;br/&gt;B. A five week summer pre-REU program for 20 freshman and sophomores. Participants will be exposed to enrichment topics in mathematics and work on projects under the guidance of faculty and graduate students mentors. &lt;br/&gt;C. A five week summer bridge program for 15 juniors and 15 entering graduate students in mathematics to address weaknesses in algebra and real analysis. The program will be run at two different levels so as to fill holes in each student's background. This program will encourage the juniors to continue on to graduate school in mathematics as well as increase the likelihood of success in first year graduate classes at whatever graduate school the beginning graduate students enroll in. The two programs will be run together so that advanced juniors may participate in the more advanced courses and less prepared beginning graduate students may fill in their holes in the beginning material. Although participants will be recruited from all over the country, priority will be given to participants from the following schools who have agreed to partner in this effort: the University of the District of Columbia, Fayetteville State University, N. Carolina State A&amp;T, Texas A&amp;M Corpus Christi, and San Jacinto Junior College, institutions which enroll a high percentage of under-represented groups. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit:  There were four summer programs supported by the grant: a two week high school summer camp (SMaRT Camp), a five week PRE-Research Experience for Undergraduates (PRE-REU), and two five week bridge programs, one for rising seniors and one for entering graduate students.  The purpose of SMaRT Camp was to encourage good mathematics students to major in mathematics. The purpose of the PRE-REU was to engage students early in how to do research in hopes that they would do an REU the next year.  The purpose of the two bridge programs was to fill in holes in the students' backgrounds as they were from small schools with fewer offerings than major universities.  The intellectual merit outcomes were:  Almost all of the PRE-REU students did an REU the next summer.  All  but three of the Junior Bridge Students went to graduate school in  mathematics; one went to graduate school in engineering, and the other two took time off from school. One went back to graduate school in math; the other's progress is unknown.  All of the graduate bridge program students were  successful in their first year of graduate school.  Those who were in  the early years of the grant earned at least a masters, a few a Ph.D., and the  rest are still working  on their Ph.D.   Broader Impacts:  The main proposed  broader impacts were to involve minorities and women in greater proportion than are usually found in mathematics and, for the three five week programs, to involve students from small colleges or universities so that they would be comfortable at a major university graduate school.  The broader impacts outcomes were:  Small School:  Of the 249 participants in the five week programs, 200 (80%) were from small colleges or universities.  Diversity:   The major finding was that having a critical mass of each minority  in the combined five week programs  was enough to have the students   feel included and comfortable.  Of the 382 participants the number (percentage) of each category is as follows:  African American 29 1/2 (8%), Hispanic 27 1/2 (7%), Native American 4 (2%),  Asian/Pacific Islander 45 (12%), Caucasian 244(63%), Other 32 (8%); Female 188 (49%), Male  194 (51%).  Since the usual percentage of African Americans and Hispanics is 1% each, and Native Americans  rarely major in mathematics, even though the percentages are low, our percentages are much higher than usual.
