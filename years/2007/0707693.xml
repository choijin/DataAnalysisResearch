<AbstractNarration>Dr. Daniel Homan of the Denison University will undertake research involving high-resolution polarization measurements using the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA).   He will examine and model (1) the distribution of circular and linear polarization from a complete, flux-limited sample of active galactic nuclei (AGN) jets, (2) the spectrum of circular polarization, linear polarization, and Faraday rotation from a smaller number of jets, and (3) the variability of the polarized emission and the connection with the outburst/ejection cycle of AGN jets. A new technique will be used to study the distribution of Doppler factors, Lorentz factors, and intrinsic luminosities of AGN jets.   In another related project, a decade long kinematical data set will be analyzed for direct evidence of acceleration and collimation of jets on parsec-scales.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Undergraduate students will be involved in most aspects of this Research at Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) program, and the students will have the opportunity to present their work at regional and national meetings.  Dr. Homan will draw upon the research for introductory and advanced science courses and for planetarium and observatory outreach to community and school groups. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
