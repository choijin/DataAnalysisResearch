    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I research project explores novel wireless antenna technologies based on one or two dimensional metamaterial structures. The basic approach is to compress, twist, and fragment (CTF) metal strips or discs in a multi-layer structure to form self-tuned, bandwidth optimized, and miniaturized antennas. A concept of dispersion band engineering is introduced in this project to facilitate the antenna design. By tailoring the transmission band characteristics through the use of three-dimensional (3D) substrate metallization, it is possible to reduce guide-wavelength dramatically while maintaining low dispersion. The metallized materials comprise possibly high-density localized vias and metal films within multiple dielectric layers in printed circuit structures. This project investigates new integrated antennas evolved from such structures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wireless communications continue to demand compact power efficient multi-standard and multi-functional systems where the antenna has been a salient component and the bottleneck for miniaturization and broadband applications. The proposed concept of 3D volume integrated circuits to replace conventional planar integrated circuits will have broader impact on RF communication systems. The proposed low-cost single-band antenna solution could have direct impact on dimension reduction of GSM mobile phones. The new idea of one antenna for all should have an immediate market demand on WLAN enhanced GSM phones. The product could expand into other wireless networks, such as global satellite navigation, radio-frequency identification (RFID), and paging systems.</AbstractNarration>
