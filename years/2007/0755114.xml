<AbstractNarration>CBET-0755114&lt;br/&gt;Swinney &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Internal gravity waves are ubiquitous in lakes, oceans and the atmosphere, due to the density stratification present in these environmental fluid bodies. Internal gravity waves affect acoustic transmission, sediment transport and off-shore platforms. These waves are also a major driving mechanism for the general circulation of the ocean. The goal of this research is to use laboratory experiments and numerical simulations is to better understand the fundamental fluid dynamics underlying the generation, interaction and breaking of internal gravity waves. The experiments will be conducted in a stratified and rotating fluid using Particle Image Velocimetry, a conductivity probe, and fluorescent dye visualization. Pseudo-spectral numerical experiments will complement the laboratory experiments. Specifically, the PIs will study harmonic wave generation by internal gravity wave-wave interactions, internal wave generation and mixing over a sloping boundary, and latitudinal dependence of the parametric subharmonic instability. Detailed spatiotemporal data will be obtained in regimes where appropriate theoretical models do not exist and field observations provide sparse data. Systematic variation of parameters in the experiments and simulations will help reveal the underlying physics. Experiments on nonresonant wave-wave interactions will improve the current picture of energy exchange between waves. Experiments on internal wave generation will quantify a new mechanism that can produce strong boundary flow and turbulent mixing in lakes and continental margins. Experiments on the parametric subharmonic instability will help to understand the global internal gravity wave dissipation in oceans. Understanding of the fundamental physics revealed by this research will enhance the ability to quantify the role of internal gravity waves in lake, oceanic and atmospheric dynamics. Besides the environmental applications, experiments on nonresonant wave-wave interactions may also have impact on the understanding of waves in strongly magnetized plasmas, where there exist waves (e.g., in tokamaks) with the same dispersion relation as internal gravity waves. Further, this type of wave plays an important role in the dynamics of White Dwarfs and Neutron Stars.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Laboratory experiments and computer simulations were conducted to improve the understanding of the basic physics of the generation and motion of waves that travel in the interior of the ocean.  Such "internal gravity waves" are responsible for about half of the energy transfer in the oceans. These waves also affect sound transmission, sediment transport, offshore oil platforms, and, most importantly, the general circulation of the ocean, which plays a critical role in climate.   Internal waves have properties similar to the waves on the surface of the ocean, but internal waves, as their name implies, occur only in the interior rather than the surface of the ocean. Internal waves can occur only in fluids whose density varies with depth. The ocean density increases with depth because the seawater becomes both saltier and colder.  Waves internal to the ocean are produced largely by the flow of tides along the bottom topography of the ocean; like the tides on a beach, tidal flow over topography on the bottom of the ocean oscillates in time with a period of about twelve hours.    One part of the present study examined the reflection of internal waves from a sloping mountain surface, for mountains with different steepness. Systematic laboratory experiments were done in a tank (like an aquarium), about 3 feet long, 2 feet wide, and 1.5 feet high. The measurements examined particularly the reflected wave beams that have twice the frequency of the incident wave beams, that is, in the ocean the period of oscillation would be about six hours instead of twelve hours.  This doubling of the frequency occurs through a complicated and poorly understood process in which the incident and reflected waves interact.  The laboratory measurements of the intensity of the frequency-doubled internal waves produced in reflection of incident waves from a mountainside were compared to two theoretical predictions. Contrary to our expectations, the observations were found to differ markedly from predictions of both theories that were being tested.  Then computer calculations were done for NewtonÆs laws applied to the situation in the experiments. The results of the computer simulations were found to be in agreed well with the laboratory observations.  Further, a simple hand-waving argument (not mathematically rigorous) provided a prediction in accord with the observations.  It is still not understood why the results obtained in the present laboratory observations and computer calculations differed so much from the predictions of theory.  More research is needed to address this problem.    Another part of this research project examined tidal flow over a laboratory model of a mountain peak: a mountain that had the same smooth bell ("Gaussian") shape in any direction when viewed from the mountaintop.  Both laboratory experiments and computer calculations for NewtonÆs laws applied to a fluid yielded internal ocean waves that were produced by the tidal flow. As expected, the internal waves at the frequency of the tides were in the same general direction as the tidal flow. However, it was discovered that rather intense internal waves were produced at twice the tidal frequency; surprisingly, these waves traveled not in the direction of tidal flow but in a direction perpendicular to a vertical plane passing through the center of the mountain in the direction of the tide.    The third part of this project examined internal waves traveling in the very deep oceans, especially where the depth exceeds 4 km, which is the case for 52% of the worldÆs oceans. Ocean data obtained in the World Ocean Circulation Experiment, conducted for a decade (1990s) by thirty nations, were analyzed to determine how rapidly the density changes with depth at more than 18000 locations in the deep oceans.  It was discovered that at many locations in the deep oceans the variation of the density of the ocean water on depth becomes so weak that the internal type waves cannot travel, they just ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
