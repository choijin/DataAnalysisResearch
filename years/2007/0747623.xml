<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: ECCS-0747623&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title: CAREER: Advances in Metamaterial Structures and Devices&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI Name: Grbic, Anthony&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI Institution: University of Michigan Ann Arbor   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to address critical needs in the emerging field of electromagnetic metamaterials and to explore entirely new methods of manipulating electromagnetic waves.  New approaches to designing volumetric metamaterials with increased bandwidth and reduced losses will be pursued and an entirely new class of metamaterial surfaces will be developed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The proposed volumetric metamaterials rely on traveling-wave structures to achieve their low-loss and large bandwidth performance. This is in contrast to more conventional metamaterial designs that rely on weakly coupled resonators. Using this new approach, negative refractive index lenses capable of super-resolution and novel microwave devices will be devised. In addition, finely patterned metamaterial surfaces that can focus electromagnetic energy to extreme subwavelength resolutions will be explored. These surfaces present an entirely new perspective on electromagnetic field manipulation and control.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broad Impacts: Broadband and low loss volumetric metamaterials will find application in areas ranging from medical imaging to wireless communications. Furthermore, the proposed metamaterial surfaces hold promise for lithography, non-contact sensing, antenna design and wireless power transfer applications.  Specifically, these surfaces may enable near-field microscopy at previously unprecedented levels of detail, and improve the efficiency and range of wireless power transfer. An educational program in metamaterials will also be established.   Metamaterial concepts will be introduced into engineering design at both undergraduate and graduate levels. Outreach efforts will include the development of a web-based learning resource to promote and establish metamaterial courses, the mentoring of undergraduates through internships, and publishing of educational articles in refereed journals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
