<AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase II research project proposes to develop and commercialize advanced high- resolution ceramic microchannel plates (s-MCPs) for applications in low- and night vision devices, scientific detectors and biomedical imaging. Conventional glass-fiber MCP technology has reached its fundamental limits in spatial and temporal resolution, fixed pattern noise, high count rate capabilities, thermal performance, yield and reproducibility, stability and lifetime. This is a unique approach based on nanoporous ceramics, which allows reaching ultra-high sub-micron resolution. Due their ceramic nature, the proposed s-MCPs are capable of processing temperatures up to 1000 degrees celsius, enabling direct integration of advanced photocathodes for expanded spectral range and sensitivity, and are also expected to have greater lifetime than those produced with existing methods. In addition ceramic s-MCPs can be produced at a much lower cost than glass MCPs. A robust ceramic structure with the required dimensions and resistance has been developed. The remaimimg challenge is to fabricate functional s-MCP prototypes from this structural material, along with validation of s-MCP performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The expected result of the proposed work is a manufacturing technology for production of commercially viable sub-microchannel plate intensifiers with better performance, longer lifetime and lower cost. This could open up new opportunities in the development of the next generation particle and photon detection systems for the infrared, UV, x-ray and gamma ray astrophysics applications. Spin-off applications for ceramic MCPs include "lobster eye" optics for x-ray detectors as well as gas avalanche detectors. Commercial applications include detectors for high-energy physics, scientific instrumentation, biomedical imaging, commercial satellite mapping, vision augmentation, as well as consumer night vision products. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This report summarizes the work performed under NSF SBIR Phase II award #IIP-0724478 during the performance period from September 1, 2007 through June 30, 2011 (including extension view Phase IIB amendment to the grant award).  Major activities and accomplishments include:  Jointly with our academic partner at UC Berkeley, an in-house MCP testing station was completed and validated using stadnard commercial glass MCPs.  This facility is now actively used to provide feedback on ceramic s-MCP development. Development of ceramic s-MCP substrates with channels in the targeted range of 0.5-0.8 &micro;m was accomplished via anodization of aluminum at high voltages, generate prototypes of standard (circular, 25 mm) MCP format.   Using s-MCP resistance model and experimental measurements, several coatings (mixed ZnO-Al2O3 by Atomic Layer Deposition) with varied resistance were identified and validated for achieving required (20-500 MOhm) resistance in 25 mm s-MCP prototypes.  Several batches of 25 mm s-MCP prototypes were produced and evaluated using in-house testing setup.   Prototypes were also sent to UC Berkeley. For the first time, ceramic s-MCP (based on AAO) prototypes demonstrated the onset of electron amplification, with excellent dielectric breakdown and stable resistance. Synkera presented the s-MCP concept at the DOE workshop on large area low-cost detectors for high energy physics held at the Argonne National Laboratory on Feb. 25-26, 2009, which hosted representatives of the leading academic, government and industrial groups in the area of MCP detectors [[i]].  As a result, AAO-based s-MCPs were selected as a primary platform for such detectors in a project being proposed to DOE.  Synkera was invited to join the project team, which also includes Argonne National Lab, Fermi Lab at the University of Chicago, Space Science Lab at UC Berkeley, Arradiance Inc., and several other academic and industrial partners.  This secondary effort expanded the scope of the Phase II project:     Demonstration of AAO structure with channel diameter &ge;0.5 &mu;m and funnel-shaped opening, open-area-ratio &ge;60%, and length to diameter ratio of 50-100.  Delivery of 15 large s-MCP prototypes (32.8 mm) to the Argonne-based project team targeting the above specifications.  Cost projections were made for scaling the AAO-based ceramic s-MCP fabrication process. Micromachined AAO was implemented as an alternative strategy when certain challenges were encountered when trying to utilize the native nanochannel architecture of AAO to produce s-MCP.  The feasibility of generating the appropriate micromachined structures via AAO (i.e. channels of 6-10 micron diameter) was demonstrated.          [i].    DOE Workshop "The Development of Large-Area Psec Photo-Devices", February 26-27, 2009: Argonne National Lab, Chicago, IL.  Workshop included the leading experts in MCP-based detectors and was held to outline the proposal for DOE on the development of large-area, fast, low-cost photon detectors for new high energy physics experiments.
