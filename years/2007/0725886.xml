<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to characterize the distribution of multi-stage combinatorial directed nanovectors in tissues and living cells for tumor characterization and destruction. The approach is to develop a novel near-field scanning probe with sub-diffraction-limit resolution by directly fabricating nanometer sized light source on patterned silicon probe tip, and to use the probe to identify the molecular signatures of breast tumors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The key technology involves using patterned SOI wafer to create a nanoscale light source on the tip of a MEMS fabricated probe. The light source will be made between a pair of silicon electrodes located on the tip, through electrostatically trapping semiconductor nanoparticles (CdSe/ZnS). The expected optical aperture size is ~10 nm, an order of magnitude reduction from that of an advanced NSOM, which enables high resolution imaging of multimolecular complexes on living cells. The self-illuminating scanning probe can be batch fabricated in an array format, with the potential for electronics integration. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The proposed architecture will be extendable to imaging the development mechanics of other sub-cellular structures. Understanding development at cellular level is essential for understanding of human diseases caused by defects and errors in development and differentiation pathways. A Texas-wide interdisciplinary collaboration in biomedical engineering research and education has recently been initiated. This proposal reflects the inter-institutional goal to conduct cutting-edge research to advance the field of micro-nano scale photonics and MEMS for novel biomedical imaging, to provide outstanding teaching for students, and to attract minority especially Hispanic students into engineering professions.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

Multicolor QD-LEDs created on silicon open up the possibilities for future highly integrated mass-producible, robust, smart devices based on optical control. Detailed research description (1) We demonstrated the nanopatterning of multicolored inorganic quantum dot light emitting diodes (QDLED) for compact bio fluorescence imaging. These inorganic quantum-based nano-patterned light emitting devices (QD-LEDs) were created on silicon substrate, through microscale stamping of monolayers of CdSe:ZnS core shell colloidal QDs.

Lithographic patterning technique enables site-controlled patterning and controlled feature size of the electrode with greater accuracy. The feature size of 5 &mu;m was achieved using UV photolithography and reactive ion etching. The ease of fabrication and processing a long life, multicolor QD-LED open up the possibilities for creating robust, compact nanophotonic microsystems for tunable imaging and sensing applications. With well-correlated electroluminescence and photoluminescence spectra, the QDLEDs works as near-field excitation sources to illuminate fluorescently labeled cancer cells. Key parameters such as the nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratio of selected cancer cell lines were measured to benchmark cancer progression.

Our stamping technique allows us to create localized QD-based light sources on arbitrary three dimensional structures. In combination with the silicon micromachining technology, direct deposition of localized light sources will lead to a new generation of highly integrated nano-scale fluorescent optical microscopy. We have demonstrated creation of a QD-LED at the tip of a micromachined silicon scanning probe.
