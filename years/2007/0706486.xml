<AbstractNarration>The central notion of this project is the Haagerup property which, in recent years,&lt;br/&gt;has found applications ranging from K-theory of C*-algebras, to rigidity theory,&lt;br/&gt;to geometric group theory. A group is said to have the Haagerup property if it&lt;br/&gt;admits a proper affine action on a Hilbert space, and a deep result of Higson and&lt;br/&gt;Kasparov asserts that a Haagerup group satisfies the Baum Connes conjecture.&lt;br/&gt;In this project, Lp generalizations of this concept will be studied quantitatively,&lt;br/&gt;together with cohomological aspects of the theory. It is for instance planned to&lt;br/&gt;attack a Gromov conjecture about the vanishing of reduced Lp-cohomology on&lt;br/&gt;amenable groups. More generally, it is proposed to determine for which amenable groups the first reduced cohomology with values in mixing (resp. weakly mixing) Lp-representation vanishes. In particular, this will produce new geometric invariants for a large class of groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Looking for quantities that remain invariant under certain transformations&lt;br/&gt;is one the main objectives in mathematics as in many scientific fields like for&lt;br/&gt;example, physics, information theory or finance. The principle behind geometric&lt;br/&gt;group theory is that many properties of a space, such as its topology or its&lt;br/&gt;geometry, can be revealed by studying its set of symmetries. This set has a&lt;br/&gt;mathematical structure called a group structure. The wealth of this approach&lt;br/&gt;results from the interactions between the algebraic properties of this structure&lt;br/&gt;and its geometric properties. In this project, it is proposed to study new geometric&lt;br/&gt;invariants of groups, and to relate them with their algebraic structure. Groups&lt;br/&gt;of matrices, that appear as fundamental objects in physics, will have a central&lt;br/&gt;position in this study.</AbstractNarration>
