<AbstractNarration>Astronomy (11) The project is developing, implementing, and disseminating introductory-level, inquiry-based astronomy laboratory exercises and lecture materials that highlight and utilize images and data taken with a robotic telescope. The Northwest Indiana Robotic (NIRo) Telescope provides the tool around which the introductory astronomy curriculum at Purdue University Calumet (PUC) is based. It also provides a platform for high-quality undergraduate research, a robust primary education component, and numerous community outreach opportunities in cooperation with the Lake County Parks and Recreation Department (LCPRD) and the Calumet Astronomical Society (CAS). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The NIRo Telescope is improving the astronomy and physics curricula at PUC and will add to the body of current astronomical knowledge through high-quality research. NIRo enables a complete revision of the introductory astronomy courses at PUC, integrating inquiry-based learning and more closely linking the lecture and laboratory components. Introductory-level undergraduates gain direct access to state-of-the-art equipment and astronomical data, new laboratory experiments including observation sessions, and on-site visits. In addition, there is a new, upper-level course in modern observational techniques and several additions to the advanced laboratory course for physics majors.   The observatory supports ongoing student observing campaigns to monitor the variability of quasars, of blue stragglers in open clusters, and of exoplanet transit events. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The observatory has a broader impact on astronomy educational objectives at PUC and through community outreach. A portion of the time and manpower for the NIRo project goes towards the development of a primary education program in conjunction with PUC School of Education professors. The data products of the observational campaigns are being developed into curricula and learning materials in line with the Indiana Earth and Space Science curricula for grades 6-8.  This is the first project to specifically target primary science education through the use of a research-grade, automated telescope.  The data, images, and research results are maintained on a dedicated website, allowing for a much larger audience to take advantage of this opportunity.</AbstractNarration>
