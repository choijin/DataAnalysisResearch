<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;Biological Sciences (61)&lt;br/&gt;The overarching goal of this project is to introduce genomics at all levels of the undergraduate experience. This effort includes two coordinated activities 1) creation of an upper division capstone course, "Bacterial Genome Sequencing and Analysis" at the University of Florida (UF) and, in collaboration with faculty at Seminole Community College (SCC), 2) creation of an introductory level course in genomics offered at both institutions. Professional academic educators at UF are conducting a comprehensive project assessment to provide formative and summative feedback.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students in the capstone course collaboratively sequence and analyze the genome of a previously unpublished bacterial organism and, to gain experience in scientific communication, write up their research for publication in a  journal.  Creation of the introductory course involves a multi-step process: a) development of SCC faculty expertise in genomics through a continuing education course offered by faculty from UF; b) involvement of a team consisting of UF and SCC collaborators in design of the course and c) piloting the course at both institutions simultaneously. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the project lies in its introduction of a rapidly developing field in biology to a broad base of undergraduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the project include its dissemination, through an online course manual posted and freely distributed on the web, of the capstone experience as an approach to genomics education.  In addition, the continuing education course in genomics offered to SCC faculty and instructors from other community colleges as well as middle and high school biology teachers serves as a model of how to broadly introduce genomics approaches at institutions lacking personnel with a strong background in this newly developing field.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
