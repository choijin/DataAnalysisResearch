<AbstractNarration>Computation and Collaboration in the Era of the Internet&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The field of Cryptography has evolved far beyond its traditional goal of securing message transmission. Through the notion of a secure computation, a set of mutually distrustful agents can collaborate to accomplish a common goal while preserving each agent's privacy---examples include anonymous electronic elections, privacy-preserving electronic auctions or contract biddings, privacy-preserving datamining, fault-tolerant distributed computations and more. Protocols for secure computation have been extensively studied since the 80's, but key obstacles remain unresolved. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In particular, the design of cryptographic protocols must prevent rogue interactions between executions of multiple protocols. Cryptographic protocols that are secure when executed in isolation, can be completely insecure when multiple (even two) such instances are executed concurrently, as is unavoidable on the Internet. New ideas and techniques recently developed (some by this PI) suggest that the intellectual tools are at hand for overcoming this problem. One of the principal goals of the PI?s research is to develop secure computation protocols that remain secure under concurrent executions---without assuming any trusted set-up assumptions. Another goal is to develop new techniques for both preventing and analyzing rogue interactions between protocols.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Significance: This research is expected to develop ideas and techniques which hold the potential to fundamentally change the way we collaborate towards common goals, and in particular to enable the development of protocols for securely collaborating on the Internet. In a connected world, rogue interactions between processes is a central problem; if successful this research will provide new tools and techniques for tackling this problem&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

In these years, new and exciting primitives---such as *secure computations*---have emerged which introduce novel means of communication and collaboration previously not imaginable.  But these notions were developed in the context of single isolated interactions, and as shown by Dolev, Dwork and Naor, cryptographic protocols developed for isolated interactions may be completely broken under concurrent interactions. The concurrency allows a coordinated attack in which an adversary controls many parties, interleaving the executions of the various protocol instances. For instance, a man-in-the-middle attacker participating in two simultaneous executions of a cryptographic protocol might use messages from one of the executions in order to violate the security of the second.  In work supported by this award, we have made progress on, and resolved, several fundamental open problems in the area of concurrent security. In particular:  * Non-malleability concerns execution of two-party protocols in the presence of a man-in-the-middle adversary that has full control over the communication channel linking the two parties. The design and analysis of non-malleable protocols (i.e., protocols that withstand man-in-the-middle attacks) is a notoriously difficult task. In a sequence of results, we developed novel methods for constructing non-malleable protocols (thus preventing against man-in-the-middle attacks) which rely on the minimal cryptographic hardness assumption (of one-way functions) and only requires a constant number of communication rounds. (Achieving this had been open since the original work of Dolev, Dwork and Naor in 1991.)  * In a different sequence of works, we demonstrate the importance of non-malleable protocols in the construction of secure computations protocols that remain secure in a fully concurrent setting, leading to the first secure computation protocols that are provably secure under concurrent executions, without relying on any trusted-set up and based on standard (and minimal) hardness assumptions.
