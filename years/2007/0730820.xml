<AbstractNarration>PROPOSAL NUMBER: 0730820&lt;br/&gt;PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Benjamin Wilhite &lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION: University of Connecticut&lt;br/&gt;PROPOSAL TITLE:  Hydrogen from Ethanol via Integrated Ceramic Microchannel Membrane Networks&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this project is to investigate coupling catalytic ethanol steam reforming membranes and catalytic water-gas-shift membranes, within an integrated network of ceramic microchannels, each employing composite palladium-catalyst membranes. Use of micron-scale hydraulic diameters greatly enhances membrane surface areas while simultaneously removing intra-fluid mass transport limitations. Integration of multiple separate membrane processes within a single unit allows further improvements in process intensification, portability, scalability and energy density. The resulting membrane device will be capable of processing ethanol-water mixtures and delivering only pure hydrogen. The proposed research provides fundamental understanding of interactions between multiple integrated separations processes.  Gas purification studies will be performed for multiple low- and high-temperature materials.  Coupling of catalytic reforming of ethanol to hydrogen with hydrogen purification enables investigation of the interplay between reaction and purification and corresponding surface and transport mechanisms for high-purity hydrogen generation. &lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the proposed research is the introduction of a new class of integrated ceramic membrane microchannel networks, capable of allowing multiple separate membrane processes to interact and enhance each other within a single structure. These membrane microchannel networks combine advantages of micromachining and ceramics extrusion while removing respective barriers to purification and coupled generation with purification, system complexity and cost. By applying the experimental system to hydrogen extraction for fuel-cell systems, the research aims to contribute to the development of alternative energy technologies and hydrogen energy infrastucture. This project focuses on efforts to improve utilization of both microtechnology and ceramics processing in meeting future energy needs to improve reactor efficiency, portability and marketability. A modified version of the described experimental system will be employed for development of classroom and laboratory-based learning modules for teaching students about separations principles and fundamentals.  This effort lays the groundwork for future development of membranes integrating desulfurization with steam reforming and water-gas-shift. Thus, the proposed research will contribute not only to scientific understanding of transport issues in integrated membrane systems, but also to the continued development of a clean, emission-free, renewable energy future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
