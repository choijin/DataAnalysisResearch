<AbstractNarration>The goal in this proposal is to develop the mathematical foundations and&lt;br/&gt;associated computational methods for the study of convex sets in real&lt;br/&gt;algebraic geometry. This work requires a combination of ideas and&lt;br/&gt;mathematical tools from optimization, analysis, algebra and combinatorics.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed program will lead not only to theoretical insights, but also to&lt;br/&gt;new algorithms and software that will enable novel applications in&lt;br/&gt;mathematics, engineering, and beyond. The work is organized in five main&lt;br/&gt;thrusts: semidefinite programming and sums of squares, convex semi-algebraic&lt;br/&gt;sets, sparsity and graphical structure, numerical polynomial optimization&lt;br/&gt;and applications, and deformations and variation of parameters. The PIs will&lt;br/&gt;focus on the development of a comprehensive theory and practical new&lt;br/&gt;algorithms for convex sets defined by polynomial inequalities. Specific&lt;br/&gt;problems and techniques include the formulation of semidefinite descriptions&lt;br/&gt;of convex hulls of real algebraic varieties, determinantal representations&lt;br/&gt;of hyperbolic polynomials, sparse polynomials and their symmetries, tropical&lt;br/&gt;geometry and homotopy techniques, and geometric programming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many areas in mathematics, as well as applications in engineering, finance&lt;br/&gt;and the sciences, require a thorough understanding of convex sets. This is a&lt;br/&gt;class of geometric shapes, with several different but complementary&lt;br/&gt;interpretations. The goal in this project is to achieve a better&lt;br/&gt;understanding of how these geometric properties emerge from their algebraic&lt;br/&gt;descriptions in terms of polynomial equations, and the corresponding&lt;br/&gt;computational implications. One of the main motivations is the possibility&lt;br/&gt;of applying these results in the context of optimization. The proposed&lt;br/&gt;research will contribute to existing knowledge, both in algebraic-geometric&lt;br/&gt;techniques as well as in mathematical optimization. It will create synergies&lt;br/&gt;between different branches of applied mathematics, and their engineering and&lt;br/&gt;scientific applications (e.g., in computational biology and statistical&lt;br/&gt;modeling). Successful completion of this project should contribute to the&lt;br/&gt;availability of efficient and reliable computational tools for solving&lt;br/&gt;polynomial systems, which have clear technological and economic interest.&lt;br/&gt;Other key features of this proposal include its integration with curriculum&lt;br/&gt;development, undergraduate research projects, training of graduate students&lt;br/&gt;and postdocs, and the development of new software tools for computational&lt;br/&gt;optimization.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
