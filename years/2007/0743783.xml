<AbstractNarration>The University of Nebraska is awarded a grant to develop the Semantic Cyberinfrastructure for Investigation and Discovery (SCID), a general-purpose Web-based ontological software infrastructure that (1) unites numerous biological research interests by enabling seamless federation of heterogeneous databases from each area; (2) supports scientists in the efficient and effective use of ontologies to enhance investigation and&lt;br/&gt;discovery; and (3) streamlines the use of bioinformatics tools via common user interfaces for querying data, enhanced data analyses, and interpretation of scientific results, thus enabling discovery by those who enter or cross over into new research fields.  Leveraging its long-standing collaboration between faculty from genomics, museum science, and computer science, the SCID team will enhance its existing prototype by (1) developing a "seed" ontology that unites multiple selected databases in biodiversity and genomics, (2) providing an application programming interface (API) to allow new and existing bioinformatics tools to easily "plug in" to our system, (3) developing tools to facilitate the process of reaching scientific consensus in open forums through collaborative editing technologies, and (4) developing tools to support ontological development, federation of disparate data stores, and decision making during investigation and discovery activities.  This project will advance genomics and biodiversity research by federating and unifying data sources in biodiversity and genomics, unlocking heterogeneous, largescale databases, and empowering investigation and discovery. It will also advance the computational areas of machine learning, multiagent systems, and semantic technologies for extracting information from large data repositories, supporting users in making investigations and discoveries, and facilitating community-based knowledge engineering.&lt;br/&gt;New computational models that are developed as part of SCID will facilitate the building of ontologies that tie together disparate databases, support automatic inferences and deductions, allow for data consistency checks, and allow posing of sophisticated queries, &lt;br/&gt;thus creating an innovative, dynamic scientific structure.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Outcomes  This project created Biofinity (biofinity.unl.edu), a prototype infrastructure with genomics and biodiversity data, and an applicationprogrammer interface (API) to directly interface bioinformatic sapplications to the data.  The prototype currently includes a mapping tool, the sequence alignment tool BLAST, and a mobile phone application for browsing and uploading data.  The intent of this system is to support collaboration, biological data storage and analysis. We also integrated Biofinity with major biodiversity initiatives (e.g., Encyclopedia of Life and Planetary Biodiversity Inventory for Dung Beetles).  Biofinity's novel "My Labs" feature allows Biofinity users to keep their data secure, while also facilitating analysis and sharing of that data.  Biofinity supported research in biodiversity and genomics.  Biofinity and its innovative "My Labs" feature was used in biodiversity research to map and visualize the distribution of populations and other properties of various species, including scarab beetles, rhinceros beetles, dung beetles, turf grass scarab beetles, and ornamental pest species in Argentina, Hawaii, and Australia. These efforts have applications to invasive species monitoring, threatened species monitoring, plant pollination, agricultural implications, and land management.  This project also produced a large Fungal Genome Collection database, covering 84 fungal genomes from 48 genera across all five major fungal phyla. The total number of protein sequences included is 862,724.  It can be found at http://bioinfolab.unl.edu/emlab/FGC/  Biofinity was also used in supporting education efforts.  Biofinity and the Biofinity Intelligent Wiki (BIW) have been used to support science education efforts, ranging from (1) a partnership withOmaha's Henry Doorly Zoo to support middle and high school citizen science projects studying amphibians and butterflies; (2) a collaboration with UNL's School of Biological Sciences to aid students in creating and sharing group reports detailing lab experiments, creating an effective student-run journal archiving past reports; (3) support for students to participate in creative thinking exercises and to interact with other students; and (4) a collaboration with UNL's Public Policy Center to support collaborative writing by students.  Intellectual Merit  The intellectual merit of the outcomes described above is obvious. Biofinity represents a significant advance in bioinformatics technology, and there were considerable research results in both biodiversity and genomics studies.  Broader Impacts  There are several existing broader impacts of our work.  In addition to Biofinity's support of ongoing biodiversity and genomics research, it also has ongoing support of educational and citizen science efforts from middle and high school through undergraduate and graduate education.  These educational efforts were not part of the original proposed work, but instead evolved independently.  Further, new research and educational projects are currently being started.
