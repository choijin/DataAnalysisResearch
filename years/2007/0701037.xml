<AbstractNarration>Regularity of Solutions to Nonlinear Elliptic PDEs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract of Proposed Research&lt;br/&gt; Ovidiu Savin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of this project will be on proving properties of certain solutions of nonlinear elliptic partial differential equations. The equations include various semi-linear and fully nonlinear equations; especially variants of the Monge-Ampere equation and the infinity Laplacian. Many of the problems have a variational description. The solutions may be entire functions, solutions of obstacle problems or free boundary problems. The issues include questions about the regularity and symmetries of solutions, their level sets and possible singularities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The problems to be studied in this project arise from simple models of concrete phenomena in elasticity, geometry and statistical mechanics and related areas. The motivation for one of the problems comes from the theory of optimal transportation. Another problem involves the regularity of free boundaries originating as limits of certain random surfaces and arises in statistical mechanics. For all of these problems there are many open mathematical questions that will be investigated. Particular concentration will be put on developing regularity theories for the solutions of these problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    PDEs are used to describe a large variety of physical phenomena. At the same time they contribute to the development of different branches of mathematics such as differential geometry, topology, probability, algebraic geometry. Thus investigation in this area offers opportunities for collaborations among mathematicians, physicists, engineers and other researchers. We participated to several conferences, meetings and workshops in many different places to spread the knowledge acquired through this project among this wide scientific community. We also co-organized lectures and seminars in our department at Columbia University. For example, among others we spoke at the International Conference on Geometric Analysis and Nonlinear PDEs in Hangzhou China in May 2011 and the Current Developments in Mathematics at Harvard University in November 2009.   Also, we used heuristics from this research in order to broaden the mathematical interests of our undergraduate students, involving them in research activities through independent studies. Finally, we incorporated the results of this project into several graduate courses on PDEs which we taught at Columbia University.      A large portion of this project was devoted to Monge-Ampere type equations. The Monge- Ampere equation occurs naturally in the mathematical formulation of optimal transportation problems, many of them within the realm of our daily lives: traffic network planning in cities, internet traffic optimization, blood vessel branching in the human venous system, meteorological fluid dynamics. Moreover Monge-Ampere equations frequently arise in other areas of mathematics, like Riemannian or conformal geometry.   In a series of papers, we developed a boundary regularity for the Monge-Ampere equation. We thus extended the celebrated results of L. Caffarelli on interior regularity.  Several other aspects of this equation have been investigated: parabolic problems, degenerate equations and the linearized Monge-Ampere equation. Some motivation came from problems on geometric flows involving the Gauss curvature and the embedding of manifolds in R^3.   Another major accomplishment of this project was the introduction of nonlocal minimal surfaces. We investigated the geometric properties, existence, regularity and related issues for a family of surfaces S (boundaries of sets) that minimize an integral norm, and which strongly   resemble minimal surfaces. In fact minimal surfaces can be thought as an   infinitesimal version of these non-local surfaces we consider. This   work is motivated by the structure of interphases that arise in   classical phase field models when very long space correlations are   present. The main results obtained are in parallel with the classical   minimal surface theory: smoothness except on a set of Hausdorff   dimension n-2 , existence of tangent cones, monotonicity formula, flatness implies regularity.   Many other problems have been addressed: symmetry of elliptic PDEs and De Giorgi type conjectures, regularity of minimizers of non-smooth convex functions, point singularities of infinity harmonic functions.    This project established significant progress in the regularity theory of a variety of problems. New ideas and methodologies have been introduced which will be useful in future applications.                   Last Modified: 09/18/2013       Submitted by: Ovidiu Savin]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
