<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program project is to enable the implementation of self-powered sensing systems based on ionomeric materials. Creation of a hydrokinetic renewable energy device based on ionic polymer energy harvesting is proposed as a means to catalyze meaningful societal and educational shifts in the area of sustainability.   While ionic polymer sensors demonstrate superior performance, there are currently no engineering models that capture the physics of selective ionic conduction in sensing. Among the consequences of this intellectual gap is a perceived trade off between sensitivity and mechanical integrity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project research offers a dual-physics hypothesis for the observed sensing response; validation of the hypothesis will enable a synthesis feedback loop resulting in mechanically robust ionic polymer sensors.  The educational program addresses the need for sustainability education and technology development. Ionic polymer electromechanical sensing and harvesting will be used to create a novel hydrokinetic energy harvest device. This concept will be used to inspire curiosity and learning in both university and public sustainability education programs. The university component includes creation of a new certificate program; the public education component includes collaboration with leaders and citizens of Vandergrift, Pennsylvania in that town's transformation into an eco-municipality.</AbstractNarration>
