<AbstractNarration>This project will support research on probability problems that arise from a wide variety of fields. Topics from genetics include regulatory sequence evolution, gene duplication, and the analysis of data generated by cancer genome projects. In finance, understanding bubbles in markets, swing options, and credit risk associated with subprime mortgages require sophisticated mathematical ideas from control theory, backward stochastic differential equations, and enlargement of filtration. The study of financial markets, insurance risk, and communication and computer networks lead to stochastic models that exhibit long range dependence and heavy tails. The analysis of these processes and the new phenomena they present, involves techniques much different from the classical theory of independent random variables, making use of ideas from a wide variety of sources including ergodic theory. In addition, there is a fertile interaction between probability and a variety of topics that arise from algebra, geometry, and analysis, including the use of analytic techniques to study convergence rates of Markov chains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Probability theory, born in the analysis of gambling games, now plays an important role in biology, physics, economics, finance, insurance, communication networks, and in many topics within mathematics. The main aim of this proposal is to train more researchers in probability to tackle the many important problems that arise from its applications. Cornell is an ideal place for these activities because of the strong traditions of research in probability and interdisciplinary work in applied mathematics. Support for summer research projects will show undergraduates that probability is an interesting research area with many important applications. At the graduate level, increased fellowship support will enhance the training of our Ph.D. students. Postdoctoral positions will help new graduates expand their horizons, while hot topics conferences and annual summer schools will be a national resource for broadening the education of researchers (young and old). In all of these activities, the focus will be on developing theory to treat problems that arise from applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The aim of this project is the professional training of eligible (US citizens and permanent residents) students (undergraduate and graduate) and postdoctoral associates in Probability Theory and its Applications. This includes developing the research  abilities of the trainees as well as their abilities to communicate with other researchers and the public and to teach at a variety of different levels.    Probability theory plays a key role in modern science and provides models for many essential phenomena from physics and biology to social sciences and cybersecurity.   Supported activities include two main components:  (1) Activities which provide a rich research environment for graduate students and postdoctoral associates in probability theory at Cornell University and  (2)  Attractive research training summer programs for nationwide participants.    Over the period of the award, fifteen eligible graduate students received (partial) support from the grant to pursue their study and research work. Nine have graduated and taken position in academia or the industry. The others are still pursuing their PhD at Cornell. Six of the fifteen graduate students are women.  Seven eligible postdoctoral associates spent 2 or 3 years each in the program and are pursuing careers in academia. Three of the seven are women.    Several eligible Cornell undergraduate students received support to pursue research with a faculty during the summer or to participate to one of the  "Research Experience for Undergraduate" program organized annually by the Cornell mathematics department.  Graduate students and postdoctoral associates published research papers in probability theory, attended international conferences and summer schools around the world, and presented their work at conferences and workshops with the support of the grant.  At Cornell, graduate students and postdoctoral associate attended courses and seminars, and participated to activities such as the training of undergraduate students for the International Modeling Contest and outreach at the local High School and for K-12 students and teachers. In all these activities, they were mentored by the team of faculty associated with the project.     Six editions of the Cornell Probability Summer School were held under this award. Each of these two week programs attracted about 80 participants with many participating more than once. Each summer school featured three main lecturers and several additional speakers who presented cutting edge research material in Probability Theory and its Applications. Successful efforts were made to insure that the lectures were at a level that was accessible to the audience and additional tutorial sessions were organized when necessary.     Eleven additional two-day research workshops on subjects of current interest in the field of probability theory were organized including two editions of a workshop titled: "Women in Probability". Eligible participants received support from the grant.   Overall, thanks to the success of the Cornell Probability Summer Schools and workshops, over 300 eligible participants received cutting edge research training in Probability Theory and Its Applications under this project.
