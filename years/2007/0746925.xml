<AbstractNarration>Proposal #: 0746925&lt;br/&gt;Title: CAREER: Non-Conventional Solutions for Ensuring Security in Cognitive Radio Networks&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PHY and MAC layers of cognitive radio networks are very different from those of conventional wireless networks.  The distinguishing attributes of cognitive radio networks such as cooperative spectrum sensing, on-demand spectrum contention, incumbent- and self-coexistence mechanisms, and spectrum etiquette mechanisms raise new security implications that have not been studied previously.  The overarching goal of this research is to contribute to the ongoing research and standardization efforts of cognitive radio technology by investigating crucial security issues that hold the key to the success and wide deployment of cognitive radio networks.  We are currently focusing on problems that cannot be addressed using conventional security solutions.  To solve these challenging problems, research is needed in areas that are considered "non-conventional" within the context of network security. These areas include RF signal identification, data smoothing, cyclic spectrum analysis, distributed detection and data fusion, etc. This research involves conducting high risk and high impact research in the aforementioned areas.  We are investigating several security issues unique to cognitive radio networks, including incumbent node emulation and security vulnerabilities in network self-coexistence.  The research findings from this research will serve a critical need in the cognitive radio research community by addressing security issues that have not been studied previously. We expect that our research findings will also benefit regulators and manufacturers involved in cognitive radio standardization and development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The role of spectrum as an important economic growth engine was brought forth in the National Broadband Plan (NBP) and in the PresidentÃ†s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) report entitled "Realizing the Full Potential of Government-Held Spectrum to Spur Economic Growth". Recommendations in the PCAST report include realizing the ambitious goal of sharing underutilized Federal spectrum and identifying 1,000 MHz of Federal spectrum as part of an effort to create "the first shared-use spectrum superhighways". Some form of shared dynamic spectrum access in some parts of the spectrum will be necessary to achieve the visions of the NBP and PCAST report. One of the critical challenges that need to be addressed to realize spectrum sharing is addressing the problems of spectrum security, privacy and enforcement. The primary concern is the interference experienced by primary users due to rogue transmissions by malicious secondary users when the two groups operate in the same band. The primary users are the license holders or incumbents of a given spectrum band (such as Federal government users), and the secondary users are opportunistic users of fallow spectrum with secondary access priority. This threat is a serious concern for mainly two reasons: (1) Interference caused by rogue transmitters will undermine the advantages of spectrum sharing and seriously hinder its wide-spread adoption; and (2) cognitive radios (CRs) and other spectrum sharing technologies&mdash;which make spectrum sharing possible&mdash;are far more capable than today's legacy wireless devices, and they can be used to launch very destructive jamming attacks. This project studied a number of key problems critical to the security and privacy of CR and other spectrum sharing technologies.  The project findings were disseminated through presentations, panel discussions, and journal/conference publications.  The investigators expect that the findings will have a significant impact on the ongoing research on shared spectrum access technologies, especially on the technologies being developed to ensure the security and privacy of the spectrum sharing paradigm.  The findings are also expected to make an impact on the related regulatory policies that are currently being discussed or planned.
