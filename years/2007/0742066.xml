<AbstractNarration>This award renews funding of the Bacillus Genetic Stock Center (BGSC) at the Ohio State University. The BGSC acquires, maintains and distributes pure cultures of several species of Bacillus, including both mutant and wildtype strains. The majority of the 1971 strains in the center's collection consist of variants or mutants Bacillus subtilis, a species that has served as important model system in basic research for many years, and whose genome was recently sequenced.  Other species and strains in the collection are useful in a variety of basic and applied research areas. In addition to its role in research, the collection promotes science education through distribution of low-cost materials for secondary school and undergraduate laboratories. Both online and printed catalogues describing the content of the collection are available at the Center's web site (http://www.bgsc.org/). Over the past five years, it has distributed over 11,000 strains in response to 2800 individual orders originating from nearly 2000 users in academia, government, and industry. Strain distributions have increased 67% over the previous five-year period. Those requesting cultures are charged a small fee intended to cover a portion of the cost of operation. During the period funded by this award, online information on the contents of the collection and methods for use of the collected organisms will be improved, and additional strains will be added to the collection.</AbstractNarration>
