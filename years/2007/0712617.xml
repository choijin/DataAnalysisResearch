    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will solve the problems of high cost and large size associated with current generation fiber laser platforms, by developing compact, efficient wavelength conversion light sources based on the innovative principle of fiber optic multi-resonators (OMRs). This represents a breakthrough in performance for optical fiber lasers, enabling them as effective light sources at wavelengths previously only available at great expense. The objective of this research is to solve the problem of incorporating multiple fiber embedded mirrors suited to the requirements of this device as a means of wavelength specification. Advanced holographic methods with unique optical fiber compatibility and scalability to manufacturing will be evaluated, and feasibility of these techniques will be established as compatible with the OMR platform. It is anticipated that this program will result in the realization of compact, wavelength specific, OMR lasers, and a set of design principles and process parameters governing their fabrication. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The subject light sources of this work have been conceived primarily as an enabler in the large commercial markets for non invasive biospectroscopy of species such as alcohol, lactate and glucose. The resulting systems will have a major impact in areas ranging from more effective means for reducing the incidence of drunken driving to early detection and thereby avoidance of the onset of diabetic shock in Type I diabetes patients. One substantial customer for these devices would be the current manufacturers of such spectroscopy equipment who rely on less effective light sources such as Halogen Lamps or Light Emitting Diodes. Further, the potential for compact, lower cost light sources at unique wavelengths can begin to address spectroscopy for the monitoring of greenhouse gasses. The potential improvement to the viability and quality of people's lives in either one these two areas results in high commercial value of these enabling light sources. It is also found that the optimization of the interaction between the multiple optical resonators of this platform demands significant advance in several areas of the physics of both optical fiber lasers and semiconductor lasers.</AbstractNarration>
