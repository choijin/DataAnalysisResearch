<AbstractNarration>The Department of Computer Science at the University of Massachusetts Amherst &lt;br/&gt;is hosting a Summer Information Technology Research Experience for Undergraduates &lt;br/&gt;(SITe-REU) under the direction of Professor W. Richards (Rick) Adrion. We are &lt;br/&gt;recruiting students in community college pathways, i.e., students planning to &lt;br/&gt;transfer or who have transferred to 4-year programs. Minorities and women are &lt;br/&gt;proportionally better represented in IT associates degree programs than they &lt;br/&gt;are in bachelors programs. These students often are the first in their families &lt;br/&gt;to attend college, may lack family and community mentoring and role models, &lt;br/&gt;frequently are focused on job opportunities, and seldom think about graduate &lt;br/&gt;programs or research careers. Reaching out to this diverse student population &lt;br/&gt;to attract, retain and nurture them in upper division and graduate programs is &lt;br/&gt;the primary goal of our REU Site. We are partnering with three NSF BPC, two &lt;br/&gt;LSAMP, and one EGEP alliances and others to cast a wide net and bring a diverse &lt;br/&gt;set of students into positive research experiences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each spring we will select 10 rising juniors or seniors to participate in a &lt;br/&gt;10-week summer research experience. We identified research projects for the &lt;br/&gt;students that emphasize fundamental computer science that is core to addressing &lt;br/&gt;a broad set of IT challenges. Projects include: Robotics (sensor fusion for &lt;br/&gt;manipulation, emergency detection of immanent collision); Bioinformatics and &lt;br/&gt;Biocomputing (memory, circadian, or tumor modeling, protein folding, gene &lt;br/&gt;regulation); Wireless Networks (the DieselNET location system, database, and &lt;br/&gt;diagnostics, the TurtleNET wildlife tracking net); Learning Systems (pedagogical &lt;br/&gt;agents for intelligent tutors, jMANIC, Ubiquitous/Auto Presenter); Software &lt;br/&gt;engineering (medical error modeling, dispute resolution systems); Security/Privacy &lt;br/&gt;(medical Devices, RFIDs); and Data Mining (models for social nets).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
