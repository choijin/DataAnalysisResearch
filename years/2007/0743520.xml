    <AbstractNarration>The purpose of this workshop is to assess current and future synchrotron radiation (SR) needs of the molecular environmental sciences (MES) and geochemistry communities. Given the status of ongoing projects and the timetable of planned construction/upgrades, it is expected that a priority will be given to evaluating future needs and opportunities that could take advantage of unique characteristics that will be made available at NSLS II and as a result of the upgrade at the APS. However, identification of other needs, including those relating to other SR facilities, will also be addressed. A final product of the workshop will be a written report for publication that would document needs in the context of existing SR facilities throughout the US. It is expected that this report would provide sound guidance for proposed MES and geochemistry priorities at NSLS II, the APS, and elsewhere. The workshop is also expected to catalyze exchanges of ideas that could lead to partnerships to secure funding for development of new end stations. It will also serve to inform directors of SR facilities of user needs. The findings will further provide program managers of funding agencies with a current evaluation of future research directions in MES and geochemistry.</AbstractNarration>
