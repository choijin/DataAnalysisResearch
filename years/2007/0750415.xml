<AbstractNarration>This research project, directed by Professor Igor Rubtsov and supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, is aimed at developing a novel relaxation-assisted two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy method (RA 2DIR) relevant to chemistry and biochemistry that will be useful for structural measurements for various organic and inorganic molecular systems.  The method permits measuring long-range bond connectivity patterns in complex molecules. The project will aim at understanding the transport of vibrational energy in molecules on angstrom scales in various structural motifs, which is essential for practical use and further development of the RA 2DIR method.  The correlations of the observables of RA 2DIR, such as energy arrival times, with the distances between the vibrational modes will be targeted.  It is the Rubtsov team's goal to develop RA 2DIR into a routine analytical technique for the structural characterization of molecules.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several undergraduate and five graduate students will be trained in this research program and benefit from this interdisciplinary project.  The PI will implement the new discoveries resulting from this project in the course on Molecular Spectroscopy and will design an experiment on 2DIR spectroscopy which will be a part of the course on Instrumental Analysis taught annually for undergraduate students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[       A three-dimensional structure of a molecule determines the molecular properties and its chemical reactivity.  Development of new spectroscopic methods of deciphering molecular structures in solution at physiological temperatures is an important challenge of physical chemistry. The main goal of this project was to propel a novel structural method of two-dimensional infrared (2DIR) spectroscopy, the relaxation-assisted 2DIR (RA 2DIR) method proposed in the PIÃ†s laboratory, towards an nalytical technique.  The RA 2DIR method relies on the transport of vibrational energy in the molecule under investigation originated from excitation of one vibrational mode and observing another vibrational mode (reporter) frequency as a function of the delay time passed after excitation of the first mode (waiting time), Fig. 1A. The energy transported to the reporter causes its frequency shift, which is manifested as a cross-peak enhancement. The cross-peak enhancement of 27-fold was experimentally observed stressing the power of the RA 2DIR method (Fig. 2) and making accessible long-range structural constraints.  We discovered that for sufficiently large molecules the energy transport time correlates with the distance between the modes involved.  Thus the energy transport time can be used as additional structural constraint reporting on the intermode distance for very distant groups (&gt;30A) in the molecule and well as reporting on the bond connectivity pattern.         Understanding of the energy transport on a molecular scale is essential for using the RA 2DIR method; we have investigated energy transport in a variety of molecular systems including medium sized organic compounds, peptides, transition-metal complexes, and polymers. The through-bond energy transport in molecules is found to be very efficient.  Even the energy transport in transition metal complexes is found to be very fast requiring ~3 picoseconds for energy to pass via two coordination bonds (Fig. 1). A novel theoretical model of energy transport in molecules is developed in collaboration with Prof. Burin at Tulane.  The model computes the energy transfer rates of anharmonic transitions using generalized Marcus theory. We found that using solely third-order relaxation pathways, where energy of a mode is broken into two other modes, the modeling reproduces well most of the characteristic features of the experiment, including the lifetimes of the excited modes, energy transport times, and the overall cooling time.        The RA 2DIR method has been applied to several molecular systems.  A new labeling strategy was proposed for structural measurements in peptides and proteins. The C-D stretching modes of perdeuterated side chains of amino acids can serve as such reporters (Fig. 1B).  The energy transport was found to be strongly affected by molecular structure as investigated in tree isomers of acetylbenzonitil.  The experiments with sugar anomers demonstrated the capability of 2DIR and RA 2DIR spectroscopies in to provide unique spectroscopic data specific to sugar anomers that vary at a single stereochemical center. These methods identify unique coupling networks within individual sugar stereochemical units and demonstrate the potential to identify a number of stereochemical differences among them.        The energy transport investigation in polymeric (PEG) systems resulted in an unexpected discovery: the energy transport time in the PEG oligomers is found to be linearly proportional to the transport distance, reporting on the constant speed transport. Such regime of energy transport is known as ballistic. In isolated molecules it has been previously observed only to short distances of ca. 10A initiated by about an order of magnitude larger excitation energy.  We found that ballistic energy transport occurs in PEG oligomers to distances of 60A, which is the first example of ballistic energy transport in molecules in solution to such large distances.
