<AbstractNarration>This award supports the renewal of a successful Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at the University of Oregon Eugene for the summers of 2008-2010.  This site is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU Program in the Division of Chemistry (CHE).  The program will be directed by Geraldine Richmond, a faculty member in the Department of Chemistry, and run through the University of Oregon's Materials Science Institute.  This REU site will bring ten students to campus for a ten-week period each summer to conduct cutting edge research in chemistry and physics.  Students will be recruited from predominately undergraduate institutions around the country and local community colleges and are expected to have completed coursework in chemistry or physics at the undergraduate junior or advanced sophomore level.  REU participants will be able to choose their research projects among the laboratories of 17 faculty members in chemistry and physics. To further enrich the students' experience, activities outside of the laboratory have been planned throughout the ten-week period including mentoring and training in professional development and career decision-making.  At the end of the program, each student will provide a presentation on the results of their project and submit a written report that summarizes their research activities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Interdisciplinary Research Experience for Undergraduates in Chemistry and Physics at the University of Oregon gave students an opportunity to work with state-of-the art instrumentation through a broad spectrum of research projects in areas such as environmental materials and processes, nanotechnology, spectroscopy and characterization of thin films and nanostructures.  All had the common theme of relying heavily on the combination of chemistry, physics and materials science to understand scientific problems of current national need and interest. The overlap of these disciplines contributed to discussions in weekly seminars and other research related activities.     One of the unique aspects of this REU program is that all of the students have been recruited from outside of the University of Oregon, and most of these students have been selected from undergraduate institutions that have little or no opportunity for conducting undergraduate research.  This gives those students an opportunity for research and the experience of working with graduate students in the research laboratory that they could not get at their home institution.  A second unique aspect of the program is the mixing of projects, students and faculty across the disciplines of chemistry, materials science and physics.   Students leave with a much richer appreciation for the importance of working and thinking across scientific disciplines.       The 30 students that participated in the program could choose from an average of 18 different projects each summer conducted in the laboratory of 14 faculty members in Chemistry and Physics. We worked particularly hard to recruit underrepresented groups and minorities. As a result, we increased both the numbers of students entering graduate school in this interdisciplinary area and the diversity of the students selecting this field for future study and careers.  At the end of the summer students gave presentations on their work and provided a written summary.  The presentations were video recorded so that students could get a sense of their ability to communicate their science.  Each year several students were selected to present their work at National meetings.        Last Modified: 06/05/2012       Submitted by: Geraldine L Richmond]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
