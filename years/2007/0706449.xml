<AbstractNarration>INTELLECTUAL MERIT:  Hydroxyapatite (HA) is a calcium phosphate mineral resembling the natural mineral apatite phase of bone and widely used to fabricate scaffolds to support bone cell growth in implanted bone grafts.  This proposal explores the hypothesis that smaller grain sizes and microcracking caused by thermal expansion anisotropy (TEA) in HA materials designed for use as bone grafts (1) increase the number and maturation of osteoblast (bone forming) cells adhering to the graft, (2) foster deposition of mineralized tissue and microcrack healing, and (3) promote improved mechanical strength and performance of the graft.  These hypotheses are consistent with published and preliminary laboratory findings that definitively identified microcracking in HA, postulated microcracking as a toughening mechanism for brittle ceramics such as HA, demonstrated that HA enhances osteoblast function, and showed increased osteoblast proliferation on nanograined HA.  The project has three objectives: (1) To determine the extent of microcrack damage in HA and correlate the microcracking with osteoblast attachment and maturation.  (2) To determine the localized occurrence of microcrack healing by osteoblasts on HA and correlate such healing with measurable changes in global and local material properties such as the elastic modulus. (3) To determine the role of grain boundaries on osteoblast attachment and maturation and correlate osteoblast activity with grain size.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACTS:   Approximately 500,000 bone grafts are performed in the United States annually.  Common sources for bone graft material, both autografts and allografts, are highly limited by availability, quantity, poor mechanical properties, risk of disease transmission, and cost.  There is an urgent need for a biocompatible synthetic engineered bone graft material with adequate mechanical integrity and enhanced healing/bone integration properties.  The expectation is that the neobone bioceramic constructs developed in this project, because of their improved morphology and cellular activity, will be a viable synthetic alternative to all currently available graft materials for repair of damaged bone tissue.  The project will support two graduate students throughout their doctoral training.  The PIs have routinely supported undergraduate research workers on their projects, many of whom have been coauthors on journal articles and conference presentations.  Members of the research team will participate each summer in the MSU Summer High School Engineering Institute for Detroit-area students, who include many women and minority participants.</AbstractNarration>
