<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for a 3 year standard award to support a Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) in Engineering Site program at Northeastern University entitled, "RET-PLUS (Partners Linking Urban Schools," under the direction of Dr. Michael Silevitch and Ms. Claire Duggan. This is a renewal of a previously supported three year RET Site. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Northeastern University's Center for STEM Education in collaboration with the Bernard M. Gordon Center for Subsurface Sensing and Imaging Systems (Gordon-CenSSIS) an NSF Engineering Research Center (ERC), and the College of Engineering, will continue its current RET program to build and support STEM change agents throughout partner schools.  Ten participants per year for three years from local K-12 school districts and community colleges will participate in a six week comprehensive program during the summer. Participants and mentor faculty will engage in collaborative inquiry through shared research experiences.  This will strengthen the content knowledge of teachers, build understanding and professional respect, and provide opportunities for leadership and professional development for all members of the RET team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funding for this award is being provided by the Engineering Research Centers (ERC) Program in the Division of Engineering Education and Centers (EEC).</AbstractNarration>

During the research experience, teachers engaged in a variety of activities, both at the basic level appropriate to individuals just entering a research situation and at higher levels that would be expected of those more deeply invested in the lab.  The experience provided an opportunity for teachers to reconnect with what it was like to be a learner, and to meaningfully address curriculum and pedagogy.

Teachers participating in the program brought their summer research experiences back into the classroom to extend the reach of the program. This was done most notably through lesson plans developed as part of the summer experience, however numerous other aspects of the experience also impacted the way the teachers taught. These resulted in the development and implementation of new, research-informed curricula upon their return to the classroom. Teachers commented that the program allowed t...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
