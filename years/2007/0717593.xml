    <AbstractNarration>The project is directed towards realizing the potential of s-block organometallic complexes as reagents in organic synthesis. The goal of the project is to exploit the utility of these metals in the efficient preparation of organic molecules that are of practical value to synthetic chemists. Three specific areas of study will be focused upon: (i) developing alkaline earth metal reagents to mediate enantioselective deprotonation reactions, (ii) exploring the synthesis and synthetic utility of alkaline earth chargeseparated complexes, and (iii) examining the preparation and functionality of geminal diorganometallic complexes. The strategies adopted will uncover fundamental aspects concerning the synthesis, structures, reactivities, selectivities and mechanisms of action of the reagents developed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this renewal award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Professor Kenneth W. Henderson, of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of Notre Dame. The main goal of the project is to develop new methods and reagents for synthetic organic chemistry, exploiting the unusual reactivity of the heavier congeners (e.g., calcium) of the more commonly encountered lithium- and magnesium-containing reagents. In turn, the developed methods may be applied to the synthesis of biologically active compounds for use in areas of central importance to the US economy such as the agrochemical and pharmaceutical industries. In addition, the metals of interest are generally inexpensive, nontoxic and environmentally benign, which makes their use attractive in industrial settings.</AbstractNarration>
