    <AbstractNarration>Proposal 0714277&lt;br/&gt;CT-ISG: PacketSpread; Practical Network Capabilities&lt;br/&gt;Angelos Keromytis&lt;br/&gt;Columbia University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Network denial of service attacks occur with increasing frequency and&lt;br/&gt;devastating economic and psychological effects for the targeted sites&lt;br/&gt;and their users. Addressing the problem has proven difficult, primarily&lt;br/&gt;due to deployment and complexity concerns about previously proposed&lt;br/&gt;mechanisms. In particular, receiver-controlled capabilities are an&lt;br/&gt;elegant way for preventing communication interference, but are&lt;br/&gt;difficult to deploy in practice and are susceptible to control-channel&lt;br/&gt;attacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is investigating a new communication paradigm, named&lt;br/&gt;PacketSpread, which makes feasible the use of capability-like mechanisms&lt;br/&gt;on the current Internet, without requiring architectural modifications&lt;br/&gt;to networks or hosts. The high-level hypothesis of the research is that&lt;br/&gt;practical network capability schemes can be constructed through the&lt;br/&gt;use of end-point traffic-redirection mechanisms that use a&lt;br/&gt;spread-spectrum-like communication paradigm enabled by an overlay&lt;br/&gt;network. To test this hypothesis, the project is prototyping and&lt;br/&gt;experimentally validating the resistance of such a scheme against&lt;br/&gt;attacks launched by realistic adversaries, while minimizing the&lt;br/&gt;impact of the approach to end-to-end communication latency and&lt;br/&gt;throughput.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this research will enable a better understanding how&lt;br/&gt;network-capability schemes can be deployed and used to provide robust&lt;br/&gt;and secure communications under both normal operation and in times of&lt;br/&gt;crisis. Improvements in the security and reliability of large-scale&lt;br/&gt;systems on which society, business, government, and individuals depend&lt;br/&gt;on will have a positive impact on society.</AbstractNarration>
