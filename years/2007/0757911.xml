<AbstractNarration>The PI proposes to explore how one might detect dark matter through its faint luminous manifestations using various astronomical tools. When dark matter particles pair-annihilate, or if they decay, photons and other radiating particles are produced and can be detected with gamma-ray, X-ray, optical and radio telescopes. The PI will also study how the microscopic particle features of dark matter effect the evolution of structure in the Universe,. and show how this might solve some open questions in cosmology and astrophysics. The issue of the generation of baryonic matter (baryogenesis) will be analyzed in its relationship with particle physics setups beyond the Standard Model, such as Supersymmetry. Imprints of the baryogenesis mechanism can emerge in a wide variety of fields that will be explored in the proposed research, such as searches for new particles with colliders, gravitational waves from the Early Universe and exotic properties of elementary particles. The PI will participate in SCIPP and UCSC Physics outreach programs at UCSC which concentrates on pre-college students and their teachers which includes a large component of under-represented groups from the southern and inland parts of Santa Cruz County. This latter activity is partially supported by QuarkNet, GLAST and EPO.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This NSF grant funded research at the intersection of the "quantum" and the "cosmos", addressing two fundamental questions:  (1) What is the dark matter, which constitutes 80% of the matter in the universe, made of? how can we probe its fundamental nature?  (2) Why is there more matter than antimatter in the universe? How can we test the mechanism that produced this asymmetry?  The PI and NSF-funded graduate students made significant progress in the two questions above. We tested the possibility that dark matter manifested itself producing gamma rays or cosmic rays in the Galaxy or in outer galaxies; we explored many theories that contain dark matter candidates; we outlined strategies to probe models that would explain the matter-antimatter asymmetry with a variety of different experiments.  NSF funding allowed the PI to disseminate the key findings of his research program both to the community of scientists working on these topics, and to the general public. For example, NSF funding allowed to produce a code that was used by the Fermi gamma-ray space telescope Collaboraiton to search for dark matter in gamma rays. The PI also gave numerous talks to the general public (e.g. within the Quarknet program) and reached out to high-school students through the "Adopt a Physicist" Program.
