<AbstractNarration>In this CAREER proposal the PI proposes to study the mechanisms of DnaB replication using single molecule manipulation measurements of the DNA activity. The specific  scientific  aims  of  the  proposal  are: 1.  Determine  the mechanism  of  DnaB translocation. 2. Determine the  mechanism  of  dsDNA unwinding. (The PI will  study  this question by  altering  the  fraying equilibrium  of dsDNA  through  application  of  a  destabilizing  mechanical  force,  and measuring  the resulting  unwinding  velocity.)  3. Develop  a  novel  single-molecule technique  that will  allow  multiple  single-molecule  measurements  to  be  performed in parallel. The results of the proposed research will lay the  groundwork  for  future  studies  of  the  mechanistic  behavior  of the  entire replication  complex and will  be  relevant  for  understanding  replication dynamics  in higher  organisms. The educational  aim  of  the  proposal  is  to  train  the  next  generation  of interdisciplinary, life science  oriented  researchers  by  introducing  undergraduate  and graduate students  from  the  physical  sciences  to  biological  probes.  This  will  be accomplished through  both  laboratory  internships  integrated  with  the  research  aims of  this proposal,  and  through  classroom  teaching.  The  PI will  train  both  graduate  and  undergraduate students,  who will  learn  techniques  from  biology,  biochemistry  and  physics  in order to  carry  out the  experiments.  Participating  undergraduate  students  will  be  recruited from  several backgrounds,  including  those  that  are  underrepresented  in  the  sciences.</AbstractNarration>
