<AbstractNarration>Proposal Number: CBET-0743034&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:   Bergman, Theodore L.&lt;br/&gt;Affiliation:   University of Connecticut&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title:  SGER: Engineered Microclimates for Enhanced Biomass Production&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the research is to develop an understanding of how biomass responds growthwise and thermally to moderately-elevated local levels of CO2, and how the biomass response in turn affects local CO2 levels through a very complex solid-gas coupling. Ultimately, this knowledge might be used in a scheme to (i) enhance production of biomass for biofuels within roadway microclimates induced by vehicle exhaust and (ii) simultaneously reduce average atmospheric CO2 levels. Detailed information regarding the growth and thermal response of C3 and C4 photosynthesis plants to controlled microclimates containing CO2 spatial distributions in the range of 350 to about 1000 ppm will be generated using a novel experimental facility to be built with SGER funding. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the proposal is to lay groundwork for possible deployment of an elegant engineering approach to meet the challenge of increasing biomass production for biofuels while simultaneously reducing average CO2 content of the atmosphere. Novel experimentation is proposed that will shed light on the response of C4 and C3 photosynthesis biota to elevated local CO2 levels that exist today alongside major roadways in the U.S.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts include: (i) possible benefits to society in terms of enhanced biofuel production and reduced average atmospheric CO2 levels, (ii) development of an experimental facility that will be useful to researchers at the evolving intersection of plant science and engineering, (iii) dissemination of results through traditional (journal article and conference paper) and non-traditional (workshop and textbook) means, and (iv) stimulation of follow-on projects that will ultimately expose students to international research collaboration for the development of a diverse, globally-engaged community of scholars. The facility will be used in the future for outreach to K-12 students in various University of Connecticut outreach programs.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
