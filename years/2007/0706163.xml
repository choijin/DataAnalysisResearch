<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL: Phase equilibria and phase transformations will be studied in stainless steels carburized at low temperatures (725-750K) under paraequilibrium conditions.  Prior experience with austenitic stainless steels has shown that "colossal" concentrations of interstitial carbon can be achieved using paraequilibrium carburization and lead to very much improved properties, including "superhardness" and enhanced wear, fatigue, and corrosion resistance.  Under a NSF SGER program, PI have demonstrated that low temperature paraequilibrium carburization is also possible for at least some ferritic and martensitic stainless steels and that a carburization-induced ferrite-to-austenite phase transformation can occur in some alloys. PIs have put forth a combined computational/experimental program to study low temperature paraequilibrium carburization of this class of stainless steels. The computational work will employ the CALPHAD formalism and explore the composition space where ferritic alloys should develop a colossal interstitial carbon supersaturation and remain ferritic through the entire process.  A second group of ferritic alloys will transform to austenite during carburization, and the composition space where this is possible will likewise be explored computationally.  A suite of ferritic alloys predicted to display both types of behavior will then be melted, rolled into sheet form, carburized, and characterized. A further important aspect of the prior work on austenitic steels is the strong compositional dependence of carbon diffusivity at the low temperatures and large carbon concentrations inherent in paraequilibrium carburization.  This will be explored in detail.  PI would be able to explore the concentration dependence of carbon diffusivity in ferritic alloys, again at the low temperatures and large carbon concentrations afforded by paraequilibrium carburization.  Such studies of carbon diffusion would not be possible absent the greatly enhanced solubility of carbon in ferritic alloys that can be achieved by low temperature carburization. Stainless steels carburized under paraequilibrium conditions have the promise to greatly extend the application arena where these materials can be used.  As mentioned already, the process is inexpensive, and uses conventional carburization gases at 1 atm pressure in a low temperature furnace.  It is fully conformal and entails no dimensional changes or loss of component ductility.  Hence, finished components can be carburized as a final step in their manufacture. NON-TECHNICAL: This transformative research will provide the scientific underpinning for an exciting disruptive technology. The use of carburized stainless steels with their improved properties will allow substitution of these materials for more expensive materials in many structural applications.  The work on ferritic and martensitic stainless steels is quite novel, and reveals that an understanding of a materials system, particularly under conditions far from true thermodynamic equilibrium, can lead to exciting breakthroughs even for so-called "mature" materials and industries. The research suggested here will also have very positive impact on the graduate materials science and engineering program at Case Western Reserve University, particularly for the two graduate students who will be supported. The students' research will entail their acquiring skills in a host of mainstream materials science techniques, including modeling and microstructural characterization, and thermodynamic and kinetic analyses.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[           Non-magnetic , austenitic stainless steels containing  a significant nickel content have a broad range of commercial uses due to their excellent resistance to corrosion.  These stainless steels possess high levels of toughness, but only modest hardness in comparison to steels routinely used for demanding structural applications.  High temperature carburization is a process commonly employed to achieve very high hardness levels in the surface layers of steel.  However, high temperature carburization of stainless steels invariably destroys their corrosion resistance.             On the other hand, low temperature carburization of non-magnetic, austenitic stainless steels is now employed on an industrial scale and, contrary to the high temperature process, dramatically improves their corrosion resistance. In addition, such low temperature carburization significantly improves their surface hardness, wear resistance, and fatigue resistance.              We have now developed, under NSF support, a similar low temperature carburization technology for the other major family of stainless steel, the low nickel content, magnetic, ferritic, or martensitic stainless steels.  This new technology has been shown to improve the properties of several commercial stainless steels of this type, which moreover are less costly than the non-magnetic, austenitic stainless steels due to their lower content of the strategic element nickel.  This technology should enable new applications and new markets for this important class of stainless steels in advanced engineering designs that demand a combination of exceptional material properties.
