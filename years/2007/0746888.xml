<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;CAREER: Protecting Privacy in Untrusted Environments&lt;br/&gt;----------------------------------------------------&lt;br/&gt;PI: Vitaly Shmatikov (The University of Texas at Austin)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Information about individuals and organizations is increasingly collected&lt;br/&gt;in massive databases, sent over public networks and shared across&lt;br/&gt;organizational boundaries.  This presents serious threats to privacy:&lt;br/&gt;even if individual pieces of data are cryptographically protected,&lt;br/&gt;sensitive information may still leak out due to mismatches between&lt;br/&gt;privacy policies of different components.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to develop tools and techniques for protecting privacy&lt;br/&gt;of sensitive data, focusing on three main research thrusts.  The first&lt;br/&gt;thrust is protection of public databases containing individual information&lt;br/&gt;such as medical records, transactions, and preferences.  This includes&lt;br/&gt;design of provably secure methods for enforcing access policies directly&lt;br/&gt;in published data, development of analysis tools for finding privacy&lt;br/&gt;vulnerabilities, and evaluation on real-world data.  The second thrust&lt;br/&gt;is design and implementation of formal methods for checking privacy&lt;br/&gt;policy compliance in order to ensure that data processing applications&lt;br/&gt;do not violate the stated privacy policies of the enteprise.  The third&lt;br/&gt;thrust is development of new methods for analyzing privacy-preserving&lt;br/&gt;communication networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Protecting data privacy is important not only for individuals, but&lt;br/&gt;also for businesses and organizations that deal with individual data.&lt;br/&gt;New technologies developed as part of this project will help detect&lt;br/&gt;potential privacy violations and enforce privacy policies.  They will&lt;br/&gt;enable applications dealing with sensitive personal and organizational&lt;br/&gt;data to be executed in open computing environments and support many&lt;br/&gt;socially important tasks such as multi-institution medical trials that&lt;br/&gt;do not violate patients' privacy and collaborative analysis of Internet&lt;br/&gt;security threats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[This project focused on some of the most challenging problems faced by today's society: how to use people's sensitive personal data to enable myriad online and offline services that cannot function without it, yet do this without violating individuals' privacy; how to build computing systems that operate on sensitive data, yet do not leak it or use it improperly; how to use sensitive data in science and research, yet ensure that no harm can come to the individuals from whom the data was collected. The first research goal pursued by this project was to understand privacy risks to sensitive individual data, such as social relationships, transactions, preferences, online and offline behavior, even biomedical and genetic records.  We demonstrated that many existing methods for "de-anonymizing" the data do not provide robust protection and can be defeated given the abundance of information about individuals in today's society.  This research influenced not only how data protection technologies are engineered today, but also laws, policies, and best practices world-wide.  The second goal was to design, implement, and evaluate privacy-preserving computing systems that provide strong data privacy guarantees.  In the course of this project, we developed many software prototypes for a wide variety of scenarios: large-scale data analysis, mobile and Web apps, machine learning, and censorship-resistant communications. Several of our prototypes have been released as open source and adopted by the community.  In particular, our techniques for protecting the users of mobile devices from malicious advertising have been deployed on millions of Android devices.
