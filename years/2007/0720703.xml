<AbstractNarration>Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are those computer-based systems that have an intimate coupling with the physical world, which range from the nano-world to systems of systems.  Envisioned CPS are complex systems that are composed of hardware components and software components and that must interact with a dynamically changing environment.  Many CPS applications are safety critical and thus it is important to ensure they work safely and reliably.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Component-based engineering has been widely accepted as an approach to facilitate the design of complex systems.  It is based on the premise that a complex system can be designed by decomposing it into simpler components and then by composing the components using interfaces that abstract component complexities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the proposed work is to develop a compositional framework of components that serve as building blocks of CPS.  The approach is to define the notion of a component that includes physical components (sensors and actuators) and computation tasks mapped to hardware platforms.  The component is abstracted by a resource interface.  Based on this notion, the project aims at the development of compositional analysis techniques for CPS based on compositional analysis of concurrent systems and hierarchical real-time scheduling&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
