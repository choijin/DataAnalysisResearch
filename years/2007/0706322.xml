<AbstractNarration>Technical:&lt;br/&gt;This NSF-GOALI project brings together  researchers in nanomagnetism from NYU and IBM with the aim of furthering the understanding of the physics of spin-transfer and applications of spin-transfer to high performance devices, such as magnetic random access memory (MRAM). Spin-transfer is a mechanism by which a spin-polarized current can alter the magnetic orientation of a nanomagnet and induce magnetic excitations such as spin-waves. This is an exciting development that will very likely enable dramatic improvements in magnetic information processing and storage. This is because spin-transfer offers a mechanism for rapidly reversing the magnetization of nanomagnets with large magnetic anisotropy that would otherwise require huge local magnetic fields an achievement critical to increasing magnetic information storage density. Further advancement of this field requires a quantitative understanding of spin-transfer induced dynamics and its dependence on materials properties. This knowledge will guide technological developments that will enable a reduced switching current and increased switching speed of spin-transfer MRAM. The present project will take significant steps in this direction through the investigation of new device structures and materials, using unique broad-band high-frequency measurement techniques at NYU as a tool both for the characterization of materials parameters and for assessing device performance.  Graduate and undergraduate students involved in this collaboration will gain by interactions between academia and industry and through the many planned student exchanges between NYU and IBM. High school students (with interests in Intel Science Research) will also participate in this research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-Technical:&lt;br/&gt;This project brings together researchers from NYU and IBM with the aim of furthering the understanding and application of nanometer scale magnetic devices and materials. Magnetic nanostructures are widely used in technology with the most advanced applications found in information processing. This is a huge industry in the United States that is growing rapidly, with the ever-increasing worldwide demands for data processing and storage. It has recently been discovered that in miniature magnetic devices a direct electrical current can switch the direction of magnetization by a mechanism known as spin-transfer. This is an exciting development that may enable dramatic improvements in magnetic information processing and storage. There are many important and fundamental questions about the nature of the interaction between the current and magnetization that this project will address through the investigation of new device structures, materials and unique high frequency measurement techniques available at NYU. This research will be integrated with the training of young scientists in this forefront area of magnetism research. Graduate and undergraduate students involved in this collaboration will gain by interactions between academia and industry and through the many planned exchanges between NYU and IBM. Their education will be enriched through exposure to a variety of perspectives, expertise and techniques present in an industrial setting. High school students (with interests in Intel Science Research) will also participate in this research.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
