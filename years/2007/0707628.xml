<AbstractNarration>There has been growing evidence for the existence of neutron stars with super-strong magnetic fields (10 to 1,000 trillion Gauss), including radio pulsars, magnetars and other radio-quiet neutron stars.  Recent observations have revealed a number of puzzles and raised important questions that require theoretical understanding and modeling. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, the physics and astrophysics related to the surfaces, atmospheres, and magnetospheres of highly magnetized neutron stars will be studied.  The work is essentially organized into two parts. First, quantitative calculations of the cohesive properties of condensed matter in strong magnetic fields will be performed.  These are fundamental quantities characterizing magnetized neutron star surfaces.  The possible observational consequences of strong surface cohesion of neutron stars with strong magnetic fields will also be explored, including surface condensation and the development of polar gap accelerators (relevant to radio emission) in the magnetospheres of pulsars and magnetars.  Second, the basic physics of proton/ion cyclotron line transfer in a variety of environments will be studied, and applied the physics to neutron star atmospheres and radiation bubbles in magnetar outbursts.  Dr. Lai's ongoing program of numerical modeling of partially ionized neutron star atmospheres of heavy elements will also be continued.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some of the research results (e.g. the cohesive property of condensed matter at different field strengths) will have lasting value to the astrophysics/physics community, going beyond explaining particular observations.  A graduate student will be supported here and trained in scientific computing and multidisciplinary subjects required for this work, and an international collaboration will also be fostered.  The results will be published in refereed journals and presented in appropriate scientific meetings.  A web interface where researchers can easily access these results will be created.  In addition, Dr. Lai will integrate the results of this research into his general education lectures at Cornell.</AbstractNarration>
