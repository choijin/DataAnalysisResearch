<AbstractNarration>The PIs will design algorithms, communication protocols, and pluggable interfaces to allow decision makers to verify the validity of discrete-event simulation models of construction operations. With this IT in place, it will be possible for an individual to 1) interact with the concurrent 3D animation of a construction operation being simulated, 2) to affect the operation being simulated by virtue of the interaction, and 3) to immediately see the consequences of the interaction. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Appropriate response of the model to challenges has convinced the domain experts and decision makers that the model is correct, and is essential for reliance on the models results to make better decisions. Models built using this IT will resemble 3D video games where players can learn about the operation represented by the model simply by playing. These games will be used to teach design of construction operations to graduate students. They will also be used in activities of The Center for the Enhancement of Diversity in Engineering at Virginia Tech.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
