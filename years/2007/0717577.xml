<AbstractNarration>PROJECT SUMMARY &lt;br/&gt;Biological Sciences (61)  This project fosters the development of computer simulations of laboratory procedures commonly employed by research scientists (e.g. DNA microarray, real-time PCR, pulsed field gel electrophoresis), along with a series of cases for investigative, problem-based learning involving bioinformatics. Existing resources provide access to a variety of bioinformatics tools and online databases, but do not provide a context for analysis by engaging students in open-ended simulations of the laboratory procedures that produce the data. The additional simulations being provided by this project provide this context, while at the same time complementing other educational resources in this area. Team members include faculty from six universities with expertise in software development, bioinformatics, biomedical research, and assessment. An established framework for this proposal is already in place via the Case It project, an NSF-supported effort to make molecular biology simulations and associated cases freely available to biology educators worldwide (http://caseit.uwrf.edu). Educators report that over 2500 students at 41 institutions used Case It software released this past year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: This proposal is a logical extension of previous successful effort to use role-playing and simulations to enhance student interest in science, through cases emphasizing diagnosis and ethical issues surrounding health counseling. The current innovation uses this effective case-based pedagogy to place students in virtual research settings, fostering their ability to solve problems confronted by research scientists. The simulations being developed work directly with databases of DNA sequences at government repositories such as the NCBI website, making it easier for students to learn bioinformatics methodology and associated laboratory techniques. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: After formal assessment at culturally diverse institutions in the U.S. and Puerto Rico, the proposed cases and simulations will be freely distributed to educators worldwide via the Case It web site. Statements of support by educators and documented use of current Case It software are strong evidence that the project will have a broad impact on biology education at universities, community colleges, and high schools including AP and International Baccalaureate programs. All project materials is being translated into Spanish to make the project more accessible to Hispanic / Latino students. The existing Case It web editor / conferencing system will enable students to discuss their findings with peers at other schools via Internet "poster sessions". The BioQUEST Curriculum Consortium, longtime publishers of Case It software, strongly supports this proposal and is working with the project to disseminate project materials via workshops at educational conferences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
