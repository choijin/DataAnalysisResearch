<AbstractNarration>The Division of Chemistry supports Shannon Watt of the University of Michigan (UM) as a Discovery Corps Postdoctoral Fellow for the 2007-2008 and 2008-2009 academic years. This project will integrate her interests and experience in materials chemistry, student mentoring, and fostering diversity in STEM education.  Watt's research centers on the solid-state characterization of substituted conjugated polymers with unusual properties.  Watt will use a variety of spectroscopic and microscopic techniques to investigate the effects of substrate modification and processing conditions on the self-assembly, orientation, and properties of these polymers on surfaces. These studies, which bridge the gap between the fields of polymer synthesis and physical characterization, promise to provide insights into the interfacial molecular interactions governing the potential use of these conducting polymers in microelectronic devices.  The service component of this Discovery Corps project focuses on collaborations with members of the UM Department of Chemistry and the UM ADVANCE program to create a long-term, sustainable diversity initiative at the graduate level. Projects will be designed to engage and inspire larger numbers of female and minority UM graduate students to pursue careers in STEM fields. Dissemination of the results of these efforts will help to diversify and strengthen the nation's scientific workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Discovery Corps Fellowship Program seeks new postdoctoral and professional development models that combine research expertise with professional service. Discovery Corps Fellows leverage their research expertise through projects that address areas of national need. Their projects enhance research capacity and infrastructure and contribute to workforce development and job creation. The Discovery Corps Program supports both Postdoctoral Fellows and Senior Fellows.</AbstractNarration>
