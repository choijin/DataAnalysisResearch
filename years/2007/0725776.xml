<AbstractNarration>ECCS -0725776&lt;br/&gt;Stephen Chou&lt;br/&gt;Princeton University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Nanophotonic structures working at ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths and their implementation to lasers and photodetectors are having enormous impact to the understanding of fundamental science, engineering of new photonic devices, miniaturization and integration of optical devices onto a chip, and innovative applications in communications, biodetection, and many other areas. Most previous studies of nanophotonic structures have been in the infrared or longer wavelength range, with some in the visible range, but very few studies exist for the UV and shorter wavelengths.  The proposed research will explore (design and fabricate) (a) two novel and important nanophotonic structures in the UV and deep UV (250-400 nm): a tunable UV nanophotonic dielectric filter (mirror) and a tunable UV metallic (plasmonic) nanomesh high pass filter, and (b) new types of UV lasers and photodetectors based on these novel filters: tunable UV semiconductor lasers and solar-blind UV photodetectors.  The fabrication of these devices will use a broad range of advanced nanotechnology, including nanoimprint lithography, interference lithography, electron beam lithography, self-repair of defects, and nanoscale etching and deposition. The proposed research is based on the Principal Investigator's pervious extensive research in nanophotonic structures, lasers, detectors, and nanofabrication.  In addition to the impacts mentioned above, the proposed research also will lay the knowledge and technology foundation for future UV nanophotonic structures and devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The research will generate new cutting-edge knowledge in the design and physical understanding of nanophotonic structures, tunable lasers and photodetectors, and nanofabrication technology, and will have broad applications in communications, biodetection, and many other areas. Thus, the success of the proposed research will benefit U.S.'s competitiveness in nanotechnology, aid U.S industry, and will potentially have significant economic impact. The research will train graduate and undergraduate students in the new technology area of nanophotonics and nanofabrication.  Moreover, the proposed research will provide undergraduate research opportunity, and will participate school-wide outreach education program.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
