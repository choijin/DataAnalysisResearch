<AbstractNarration>This planning visit grant supports travel to Brazil by Drs. M. Madden , T. Jordan, and  Dr. D. Fragaszy as well as two graduate students, all from the university of Georgia, to visit colleagues Dr. Rocha, and colleagues at the University of São Paulo, and Dr. D. F. Mendes at the University of Goiás. The purpose of the trip is to plan a collaboration combining geospatial techniques and biological studies of wild capuchin monkeys.  The trip will include discussions with collaborators in São Paulo and visits to two or more sites in Goiás and Piauí where the proposed collaborative work would take place to establish the suitability of proposed mapping, habitat sampling and behavioral research techniques.  The US and Brazilian collaborators will discuss the details and feasibility of studying variation in the distribution of stone tool use among wild capuchin monkeys in relation to habitat and geographic features.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
