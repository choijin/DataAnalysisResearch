    <AbstractNarration>This award supports a Planning Visit to Abuja, Nigeria that will enable a team of four U.S. researchers and a graduate student to develop stronger collaborations in mathematics and computer science. The areas of planned collaboration include Security Issues in Data Mining (led by PI Arun Sood, George Mason University and A. Osofian, University of Ibadan), Nonlinear Optimization Problems (lead by Roman Polyak, George Mason University and Chukwuma Nwozo, University of Ibadan), Dynamical Systems and Applications (led by Barbara Keyfitz, University of Houston and G.O.S. Ekhaguere, University of Ibadan), and Bifurcation Theory and Singularity Theory (led by Martin Golubitsky, University of Houston and V. F. Payne, University of Ibadan). The U.S. personnel will also meet with representative of the Nigerian government and representatives of relevant Nigerian professional societies to discuss ways to strengthen U.S.-Nigerian collaborations. The timing of the visit will also allow the U.S. personnel to attend several sessions of the Annual Meeting of the International Centre for Mathematical and Computer Sciences (ICMCS) in Abuja, where they will have the opportunity to meet with more researchers from many Nigerian universities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The planning visit will strengthen relationships between U.S. and African mathematicians and computer scientists and identify opportunities and mechanisms for enhancing research and education collaborations of mutual interest.</AbstractNarration>
