<AbstractNarration>0744556&lt;br/&gt;Rao&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project is the development of an integrated ex vivo system for propagation of chromosomally stable human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), and for relating gene transcription to specific microenvironmental conditions. The ex vivo propagation system developed as part of this project will meet specific expectations that aim to (i) be efficient, producing high densities and quantities of pluripotent cells; (ii) maintain stem cells? genotypic and phenotypic integrity over several generations; and finally, (iii) use only defined, animal-product free culture components. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The techniques, tools and mindset required to accomplish this research program require an overlap of interdisciplinary engineering, molecular genetics and cellular biology skills. The Principal Investigator (PI) plans to increase the awareness of the power of these interdisciplinary skills by developing educational modules for students at a variety of educational levels. By working with high school teachers, public educators at museums, and faculty at primarily undergraduate universities, the PI will develop presentation and laboratory modules that will benefit high school students, undergraduate students and the general public. The broader impacts of this project are the enormous potential for communicating research findings to a wider audience and for students and the general public to get excited about the latest advances in stem cell research.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
