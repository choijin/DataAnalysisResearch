<AbstractNarration>The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes to develop and commercialize advanced nanochannel array reactors for efficient and cost-effective fuel reforming for fuel cells and other applications.  Conventional reformers have significant performance, size, reliability and cost issues that prevent broad-scale introduction of polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cell systems, especially in the portable power market segment.  To overcome these limitations, a highly innovative approach based on the nanoporous ceramics is being pursued to create ultra-light and ultra-compact reactors.  That approach was successfully validated during Phase I.  The results unequivocally demonstrated the feasibility of methanol reforming and confirmed the strong competitive advantages of the proposed architecture over conventional reactors.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Phase II aims to develop application-specific reactor prototypes and to initiate their integration into PEM fuel cell systems. The expected outcome will be a manufacturing technology for low-cost and compact yet highly efficient and reliable reactors for point-of-use hydrogen generation.  This technology has a potential to facilitate the development of more affordable fuel cell power system for broader government, commercial and consumer applications, especially in the portable power (0.1-1kW) market segments, and will benefit our society by contributing to energy security and availability of environmentally friendly energy solutions.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Through this SBIR work, Synkera Technologies Inc. focused on the development and commercialization of compact, efficient, and cost-effective nanochannel reactors for hydrogen generation in PEM fuel cell systems and other applications.  This approached is based on using a novel nanochannel catalytic support, anodic aluminum oxide (AAO).  The methanol reforming catalyst is then uniformly deposited into the nanochannels of the support.  This approach provides improvements over pack bed reactors, such as high conversions at high space velocities, uniform temperature distribution, compact form for use in small systems, and low cost.  Major activities and accomplishments of the work includes:  Uniform deposition of reforming catalyst into the nanochannel pores of the anodic alumina support, and optimization of the support for use in methanol reforming. Exceptionally high hydrogen yields (as high as 50-60 cm/min at 250-275&deg;C) were achieved with Gen-1 nanochannel catalyst.  Residence times as low as 1 to 10 ms were observed for mid-range conversion efficiencies (40-60%). During the Phase IIA, Synkera worked with the CREST Nanotechnology Center for Biomedical and Energy-Driven Systems and Applications (NCBEBSA) at the University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez (UPRM).  UPRM characterized the AAO support to determine the annealing temperature for optimal surface area. Synkera worked with partners in the fuel cell industry on the application of this technology in integrated reformers (involving Synkera membranes and catalysts), targeting fuel processors for PEMFC power system.    Synkera is in the process of forming a spin-off to develop and manufacture advanced, small and mid-scale hydrogen generation and separation components and systems for the fuel cell and clean energy industries, as well as for other on-demand and distributed applications.
