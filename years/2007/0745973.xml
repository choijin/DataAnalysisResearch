<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;Moro is a Kordofanian language spoken in the Nuba Mountains of South Kordofan in Sudan. Kordofanian languages have received little attention in the linguistics literature and constitute one of the most poorly described and threatened language families in Africa. The current project aims to fill this void by producing a descriptive grammar, analytical papers, and a dictionary focusing on Thetogovela, a previously undescribed dialect of Moro. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research to date reveals that many phenomena in Moro present intriguing challenges for linguistic analysis, and provide new data for grammatical typology and relationships between Kordofanian and other Niger-Congo languages. Several especially noteworthy phenomena are: (1) the status of tone in Moro, a previously disputed aspect of the language, which is shown to interact with word formation and sentence structure, (2) a complex verb system that displays several distinctive methods of marking grammatical subjects and objects, and (3) a striking set of properties connecting relative clauses and questions. The project involves close collaboration between speakers of the Moro community, the principal investigators and graduate students, and will make a lasting contribution to African linguistics.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Moro Language Project  Linguistic research aims to discover the properties of human language &ndash; how the grammars of natural languages are structured, how language is acquired and processed, and how it varies and changes. An important component of this research is the documentation and description of the many thousands of languages of the world. Such research is vital to establish an accurate portrayal of human language before many endangered languages disappear.

The major goal of the Moro Language Project is to describe the grammatical structure of the Moro language, spoken in the Nuba Mountains of the Republic of Sudan.
