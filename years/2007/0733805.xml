<AbstractNarration>The NYU Noyce Scholarship Program is preparing 26 new science and math teachers to teach in high-needs secondary schools. The Noyce Scholars are recruited from among 900 declared STEM majors who study each year in the New York University (NYU) College of Arts and Science. They are recruited into teaching through participation in a special Teaching and Learning Residency program, which places undergraduate science and math majors in exemplary New York City (NYC) math and science classrooms in high-needs schools.  Students also attend weekly seminars designed to introduce prospective teachers to the content and pedagogy involved in teaching mathematics and science. Successful completion of the residency, including recommendations from the NYC teacher and NYU teacher educator who mentored the student in the residency, and from an NYU STEM faculty member who agrees to provide continuing content mentoring to the student, plus declaration of an education minor, make STEM majors eligible for a $10,000 undergraduate scholarship, plus a $15,000 scholarship for a 5th year program leading to certification as a math or science teacher and an MA in Science or Math Education.  The key to recruiting these additional prospective teachers is the capacity of the project to help them gain early familiarity with creative and effective math and science teaching in high-needs schools; to foster a sense of secondary school teaching as a good career path for serious mathematicians and scientists; to provide the opportunity to accelerate their preparation for certification as secondary math and science teachers without diminishing the required coursework or field experience; and to provide follow-up support for early career teachers.</AbstractNarration>
