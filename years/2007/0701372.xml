<AbstractNarration>The present proposal focuses on the study and control of strong field processes via the&lt;br/&gt;application of attosecond pulses in combination with a variety of other intense, ultrafast&lt;br/&gt;sources. The short duration of the pulses and the strength of the applied fields mean&lt;br/&gt;that accurate calculations require a nonperturbative solution of the laser-matter&lt;br/&gt;interaction, which is achieved by direct integration of the time-dependent Schroedinger&lt;br/&gt;equation.&lt;br/&gt;All of the calculations envisioned are directly relevant to ongoing collaborations between&lt;br/&gt;the principle investigator and experimental groups at the forefront of strong field physics&lt;br/&gt;and attosecond science. Investigations to control strong field processes by quantum&lt;br/&gt;path selection using attosecond pulse trains synchronized to strong infrared fields, as&lt;br/&gt;well as a novel attosecond electron wave packet interferometer which uses the same&lt;br/&gt;configuration, are undertaken. In addition studies of the interaction of atoms with&lt;br/&gt;attosecond pulse trains having just one pulse per infraredcycle, an arrangement that&lt;br/&gt;can be used to freeze the motion of electrons periodically released into an infrared field,&lt;br/&gt;will be examined.&lt;br/&gt;Explorations of multiphoton physics in a new regime, the deep tunneling limit, reached&lt;br/&gt;when a high intensity, few cycle mid-infrared laser is used to ionize rare gas atoms, is&lt;br/&gt;also on the agenda. Of special interest is the possibility that these pulses can be used&lt;br/&gt;to generate attosecond pulses with a low average frequency, which would make them&lt;br/&gt;very useful for controlling ionization processes in atoms and molecules.</AbstractNarration>
