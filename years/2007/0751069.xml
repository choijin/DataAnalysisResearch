<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 0751069&lt;br/&gt;PI:  Bulent Yener      &lt;br/&gt;Institution:   Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 0751095&lt;br/&gt;PI:  Aggelos Kiayias     &lt;br/&gt;Institution:   University of Connecticut&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title:        SGER: Collaborative Research: Secure and Auditable Privacy Contracts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the major challenges imposed by the pervasiveness of&lt;br/&gt;cyberspace is to ensure ``trust'' and design trustworthy systems to&lt;br/&gt;support the critical infrastructure for official, commercial, and&lt;br/&gt;personal business.  Millions of everyday users pass their personnel&lt;br/&gt;information over the Internet to their health-care providers, to&lt;br/&gt;their banks, to insurance companies and other service providers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once such personnel information is transferred, in many cases, it is&lt;br/&gt;outsourced to other parties (some of which may even reside in&lt;br/&gt;foreign countries) for storage and processing. It may be sold or&lt;br/&gt;resold  for data mining.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The collection, processing and resale of private data is a&lt;br/&gt;multi-million dollar industry that has serious security and privacy&lt;br/&gt;breaches including inadvertently revealing  or loosing   the&lt;br/&gt;personal information of thousands or millions of people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While there is a clear need for knowledge discovery for commercial&lt;br/&gt;(e.g., marketing, insurance design), scientific and even security&lt;br/&gt;reasons (e.g., identifying public health problem outbreaks such as&lt;br/&gt;epidemics, biological warfare instances), at present, ``data&lt;br/&gt;producers'' (i.e., users like all of us) have no control of who,&lt;br/&gt;how, and what exactly is done with such private and sensitive data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal considers the above fundamental problem by introducing&lt;br/&gt;a novel mechanism called secure and auditable privacy&lt;br/&gt;contracting (SAP-Contracting). An SAP-Contract can be used to&lt;br/&gt;define a tradeoff between level of privacy and amount of data&lt;br/&gt;mining. Such a tradeoff can be negotiated and customized between&lt;br/&gt;data sources and data miners. An SAP-Contract defines precisely the&lt;br/&gt;functions and permitions that can be performed in personnel records.&lt;br/&gt;It aims to bridge the need for privacy with the need for data&lt;br/&gt;collection, transfer, marketing and processing; thus, enable&lt;br/&gt;sensitive private data to be treated as a commodity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SAP-Contracting is different from the current state of art such as&lt;br/&gt;privacy preserving data mining approaches since it does not rely on&lt;br/&gt;server based data hiding. It complements and benefits from the&lt;br/&gt;research on cryptographic databases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs propose to design, implement and test a prototype of this&lt;br/&gt;paradigm to establish a proof of a concept and  show provable&lt;br/&gt;security properties of SAP-Contracts, including&lt;br/&gt;confidentiality, integrity, and auditability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful this project will provide provable and auditable&lt;br/&gt;privacy. It will  marry  privacy and data mining research with&lt;br/&gt;different economical models and venture into new research areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
