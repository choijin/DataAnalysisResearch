<AbstractNarration>Rhythmic behaviors, such as walking, chewing, and breathing, are essential and pervasive throughout the animal kingdom. While it is known that such behaviors are controlled by networks of neurons called central pattern generators, little is known about the genetic basis of natural variation in rhythmic behaviors. This study will examine variation in stridulation rate among populations and species of the Hawaiian crickets Laupala cerasina and Laupala eukolea. Stridulation is a rhythmic movement of the wings which male crickets use to produce songs during courtship or aggression. The high degree of divergence in stridulation rate among these species makes this an ideal system for understanding rhythmic behavioral variation. The investigators will employ a comparative approach to identify genes involved in regulating stridulation, and to uncover mechanisms by which these genes affect stridulation rate variation. Through this work the authors will develop genetic resources in a model rhythmic behavior system that has been studied extensively from a neurobiological perspective. The results of this work will provide insight into the regulation of rhythmic movement patterns and central pattern generators, as well as the molecular basis of variation in an important evolutionary model system. Additionally, the investigators will employ undergraduate assistants to help with several aspects of this work providing an opportunity for those undergraduates to gain valuable knowledge and experience. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
