<AbstractNarration>Theoretical analysis combined with computer simulation is proposed for continued investigation of the properties of strongly coupled complex (dusty) plasmas.  Complex (dusty) plasmas consist of mesoscopic grains immersed in the background of gaseous plasma of electrons, ions and neutral atoms.  Such systems occur in a variety of situations.  The Proposal addresses problems associated with collective behavior in such systems: i.e. phenomena resulting from the cooperative participation of many particles.  Such a collective behavior is the hallmark of strongly coupled systems.  Six major areas are proposed for study: (i) magnetic interaction between grains carrying a magnetic dipole moment; (ii) propagation of waves in complex plasmas in two dimensional and three-dimensional configurations; (iii) micro-instabilities generated by beams of ions or grains penetrating into the complex plasma; (iv) stochastic and disordered behavior in complex plasmas; (v) phase transitions in complex plasmas; (vi) feasibility study for the cryogenic generation of complex plasmas on the surface of liquid helium.  One of the principal approaches to be used in the proposed investigations relies on an analytic method referred to as the Quasi Localized Charge Approximation that has been successfully used previously.  Collaboration with a research group at the Research Institute for Solid State Physics and Optics of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences in Budapest, Hungary on computer simulation will enhance the research program.&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the research will contribute to improved understanding of problems of fundamental importance in plasma and condensed matter physics.  Establishing techniques suitable for the manipulation of mesoscopic structures will also have impact on engineering applications. Scientific exchanges with several major theoretical and experimental research groups both in the U. S. and overseas will be facilitated.  These principles and techniques of strongly coupled plasma physics will be part of a graduate program in the physical and engineering sciences.</AbstractNarration>

These plasmas are systems containing small (micron to submicron) sized dust grains that become electrically charged in the plasma owing to various processes including the collection of plasma electrons and ions. In low-temperature laboratory or microgravity experiments the dust is negatively  charged because of the higher mobility of the electrons. In these environments the ensemble of grains can often be strongly coupled, to the extent that the plasma is either in a liquid phase or crystallizes into a floating lattice structure.  It is  by this behavior that the dusty plasma becomes a model for condensed matter processes, where, however, the constituent particles are microscopic electrons and ions. Because the particles constituting the dusty plasma are of mesoscopic size, their individual behavior can be made visible by laser light scattering and thus can provide an "enlarged" picture of fundamental condensed matter processes.

Our current research efforts have focused on problems in areas where fundamental physical problems can be addressed by future experimental efforts.  (i)      In order to study the magnetic interaction between particles carrying, in addition to charges, a magnetic dipole moment as well, we have developed a general theory for wave propagation in the presence of an external magnetic field in a dusty plasma consisting of such particles.  (ii)    It is well known that in "normal", i. e. weakly coupled gaseous plasmas the interaction of an injected beam of particles can interact with the plasma waves and generate an exponentially growing instability. We have shown that the strong coupling importantly modifies this process.   (iii)   In most condensed matter systems different kinds of particles (electrons and ions, e. g.) coexist, To model such systems, we have developed the theory for waves in two-component (two differently charged and of different masses) Yukawa pl...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
