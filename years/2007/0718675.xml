<AbstractNarration>The long-term goal of the Hanna-Rose lab is to understand how internal organs develop in a coordinated fashion to allow a fully formed organism to function.  As a model for coordinated organ development, they examine formation of the vulva and the uterus in the organism C. elegans, a microscopic worm.  A mutant called cog-3 (connection of gonad defective) is at the center of their proposed work.  In cog-3 mutant worms, the vulva and the uterus do not connect to one another, resulting in a physical blockage in the pathway to and from the uterus, analogous to a birth defect.  cog-3 plays a surprising role in promoting this functional connection.  It promotes temporal synchronization of the development of the uterine and vulval tissues so that a connection can form between the two organs at the appropriate time.  In the cog-3 mutants the uterus develops later than the vulva, while they would be expected to develop simultaneously.  The Hanna-Rose lab proposes to discover the molecular identity of cog-3 and then probe how cog-3 controls temporal development.  Dr. Hanna-Rose will involve undergraduate and graduate students in this research to provide hands-on research experience that teaches these future scientists how to use the scientific method to approach any biological problem of interest.  By accomplishing these aims, these researchers will shed light on how formation of a functional connection between lumens of two tubular organs in C. elegans is established.  The principles they decipher will have wide reaching significance in understanding organ formation.  Ultimately, the lab aims to apply knowledge of how organogenesis of the vulval-uterine connection in C. elegans is executed to understanding how defects in organogenesis during mammalian development can result in physical birth defects.</AbstractNarration>

As a model for coordinated organ development, they examine formation of the egg-laying apparatus in a microscopic soil-dwelling worm called C. elegans. A mutant strain called cog-3 is at the center of the completed work.     Major Findings:  We determined the molecular identity of the cog-3 gene and studied its function in multiple organ systems.  We found that the gene encodes a nicotinamidase enzyme that interconverts two forms of vitamin B3, niacin and niacinamide. This enzyme is called PNC in other systems.  Thus, the gene was renamed pnc-1.  PNC-1 catalyzes the first step in a pathway to synthesize a vital energy carrier called NAD+ that is required to produce the ATP, which is the cellÃ†s primary source of energy. Lack of PNC-1 activity would be expected to result in a buildup of niacinamide, a decrease in niacin concentrations and a concomitant lack of production of NAD+.  Identification of the gene product in combination with phenotypic analysis of the mutant has revealed for the first time an effect of vitamin B3 metabolism on development of an organism.   We showed that niacinamide accumulation and lack of efficient NAD+ biosynthesis have independent biological consequences. Excess niacinamide results in cell death of some neuroendocrine cells and lack of NAD+ causes a delay in reproductive development.  The pnc-1 mutants were also discovered to have impaired muscular activity.  While this defect was hypothesized to be due to the acute effects of inefficient energy production, we surprisingly discovered that the muscles have impaired activity as adults because of an aberrant developmental process.  We also uncovered an isoform of the PNC-1 enzyme that is secreted from the cell.  This finding helped to support a proposed function for a similar enzyme in humans and has led to development of new hypotheses about how metabolism in different organs throughout an organism may be coordinated and coordinately regulated.  Both graduate and undergraduate students were involved in this research.  Thus, another significant outcome of the work is valuable training of the next generation of scientists. We trained 2 female graduate students and 7 undergraduates, including 3 women and 1 minority student.        Last Modified: 08/08/2011       Submitted by: Wendy Hanna-Rose]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
