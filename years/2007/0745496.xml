<AbstractNarration>An award has been made to the University of California at Riverside under the direction of Dr. Serguei V. Triaptsyn for the improvement of a collection of parasitoid insects known as Aphelinidae, which are important infective agents of plant pests such as aphids and mealybugs.  The collection consists of some 25,000 microscope slides with a larger number of specimens of parasitoids that are dry-mounted for microscopic observation.  Many of the slides are deteriorating, putting the specimens at risk for damage that would decrease their value.  The project will re-mount the specimens on new microscope slides in an archival mounting medium that will preserve them for the long term.  A technician and several undergraduate students will perform the work, as well as enter data on the project and the specimen collection in a database that will be made available to researchers and biological control specialists worldwide.</AbstractNarration>

Many of the species used in biological control programs around the world, including type and important voucher material, are represented in collections of the University of California, Riverside, Entomology Research Museum (UCR ERM).

The majority of specimens were reared from known hosts and are irreplaceable vouchers of the past biological control projects conducted at UCR and elsewhere.

More than 50% of these (3,874 slides) were in various stages of decay, with the majority being completely or partially dry. Many specimens, including some type material, were already damaged.

The project is now complete; it has been very successful and significantly ahead of schedule in terms of the number of specimens remounted. As planned, all the Encyrtidae and Aphelinidae (other than the genus Aphytis which was dealt with in the course of the previous NSF project) that required remounting from Hoyer's into Canada balsam have been remounted. Altogether, project personnel have remounted, labeled, and databased14,040 specimens of Encyrtidae and Aphelinidae from numerous original slides, which is significantly more than planned (in the proposal for this project, we planned to remount, label, and database approximately 11,622 specimens during the entire length of the project). We were able to remount, label, and database more than 2,400 additional specimens mainly because of the effectiveness and experience of the personnel who were working for almost the entire duration of the project. The other significant factor was the fact that many of the original slides contained multiple (sometimes more than 20) specimens on the same slide under one (usually) or sometimes several coverslips. The PI has already incorporated all but 1,740 of the remounted specimens back into...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
