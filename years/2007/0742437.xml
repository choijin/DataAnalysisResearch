<AbstractNarration>Despite historical references to the contrary, recent study of Panamanian seaweed diversity has revealed a marine flora rich in species, including species new to science and species that may represent sources of important natural compounds. This project will elucidate patterns of seaweed diversity through intensive SCUBA-based field surveys in the Caribbean Sea and eastern tropical Pacific, live culture of field-collected specimens, and comparisons of seaweed DNA. The work will result in the establishment of a baseline of seaweed diversity upon which environmental change can be assessed, and upon which evolutionary hypotheses can be tested. Specifically, a strategy is outlined to explain why algal species composition on Caribbean and Pacific coasts of Central America is so similar, in comparison to the general pattern of zoological diversity in which distinct (though closely related) species inhabit opposite coasts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A major initiative of this project is to establish a collaborative of seaweed scientists in southern Central America that will promote long-term study of seaweed evolution and biogeography. Over 40 students and scientists (from universities in Panama, Costa Rica, El Salvador, and Colombia, the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, and collaborating American Institutions) will receive training in seaweed identification, molecular systematics and seaweed culturing as part of this research, or through taxonomic workshops. The research will advance an understanding of the distribution and diversity of tropical seaweeds, as well as the biotic history of the Central American Isthmus, and culminate in a series of bi-lingual identification guides to the marine flora of Panama. The Office of International Science and Engineering is co-funding this award to help support US student participation in this international research activity. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
