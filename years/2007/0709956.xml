<AbstractNarration>Evolution of cleptoparasitism in apid bees (Hymenoptera: Apidae)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of the ~5654 described species of apid bees, approximately 30% are thought to be cleptoparasitic.  Cleptoparasitic bees do not build their own nests or forage for their offspring.  Instead, they enter the nest of a host bee, lay an egg in a cell, and then usually leave.  In this project, investigators will conduct a phylogenetic study of the family Apidae based on both morphology and molecular (DNA sequence) data.  Efforts will be focused at the tribal and generic levels of the family with an emphasis on the cleptoparasitic lineages.  The phylogeny will then be used to investigate origins of cleptoparasitism and patterns of host parasite relationships.  In addition, an interactive identification key to the genera of Apidae will be built.  This key will be made available on the internet.  The biology of cleptoparasitic bees and their hosts will also be studied using modified circle tube experiments and field observations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the key pollinators of most flowering plants, bees are essential for maintaining healthy ecosystems and many of our agricultural crops.  Considering the economic and ecological importance of members of this family, it is pressing that the evolutionary history of these bees be more fully understood.    &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
