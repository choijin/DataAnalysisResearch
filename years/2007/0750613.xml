<AbstractNarration>Research on university patenting has focused primarily on aggregate analyses of temporal changes in quantity and quality of university patents, their impact and utilization, and their distribution by class.

The three decision stages are: 1) project selection related to patented invention; 2) invention disclosure; and 3) the post-disclosure involvement of inventors with the development of their inventions. Data for the study are generated through a national online survey to a random sample of university scientists who are listed as inventors of patents assigned to US universities between 2000 and 2006 and to a random sample of co-authors of inventors who have not patented an invention. The survey electronically embeds patent data as a means of stimulating patent-specific responses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of the project improve knowledge about the complex patent decision context that exists in universities and identify specific contextual elements that encourage or constrain patenting activity. The characterization of the university patents in terms of common patterns of behaviors and activities contributes to future policy debates about whether and how to encourage patenting activities on university campuses.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Abstract  Research on university patenting has focused primarily on aggregate analyses of temporal changes in quantity and quality of university patents, their impact and utilization, and their distribution by class. Minimal systematic research has been conducted at the micro-level to investigate how individual researcher, organizational, and institutional factors explain patenting behavior of academic scientists. This study funded by the Science and Society Program develops a theoretical model of the emergence of a university patent consisting of multiple decision stages, mediated by individual, disciplinary, and organizational constraints and the resulting motivation to undertake commercially relevant research leading to patents. Data for the study were generated through a national online survey to a random sample of university scientists who are listed as inventors of patents assigned to US universities in 2006 and to a random sample of departmental colleagues of inventors who have never patented an invention. The survey electronically embedded patent data as a means of receiving patent-specific responses. The results of the project improve knowledge about the complex patent decision context that exists in universities and identify specific contextual elements that encourage or constrain patenting activity. The characterization of the university patents in terms of common patterns of behaviors and activities contributes to future policy debates about whether and how to encourage patenting activities on university campuses.  Findings to Date  Patenting decisions of academic scientists tend to be determined by the following factors:    Individual factors:  Scientists who perceive higher returns (monetary and non-monetary) from patenting are more likely to engage in patenting activities. Scientists with stronger open science attitudes are less likely to involve in patenting activities. Senior faculty who achieve a certain level of stability in their career trajectory are more likely to engage in patenting activities than junior faculty.  Scientists who demonstrate increased publishing activity will be more likely to patent.  Scientists who have patenting experience are more likely to patent. Male scientists are more likely to engage in patenting activities than female scientists.    Field of science  In general, engineers are more likely to engage in patenting activities than scientists in other fields. Scientists who conduct medical research are more likely to be involved in patenting activities.      Organizational factors  Scientists with knowledge of the university royalty distribution policy are more likely to engage in patenting activities. Scientists who work in departments in which promotion systems value patenting are more likely to patent. Scientists who work in an departmental environment where patenting norms are widely accepted are more likely to involve in patenting activities.   High perceived organizational barriers from university Technology Transfer Organizations (TTO) are associated with lower likelihood that scientists produce a first patent. Scientists who work with TTOs that frequently visit their departments and communicate with them are more likely to engage in patenting activities.   Resource factors  As the proportion of industry support of a scientistÆs research funding increases, he or she is more likely to be involved in patenting activities.  Scientists having strong personal connection with industry are more likely to engage in patenting activities.     There are three main decision points identified in this research: selection of research projects, disclosure of inventions to the university as they occur, and involvement in post-invention activities to bring the invention closer to commercialization.  Determinants of the patenting decisions of academic scientists tend to vary across decision points. Individual factors - scientistsÆ perceptions and attitudes towards patenting - have grea...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
