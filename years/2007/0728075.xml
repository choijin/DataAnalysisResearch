    <AbstractNarration>Because of the difficulty of conducting field campaigns in rugged terrain, the lack of logistical support, and political and cultural conflicts, there is a paucity of field-based glacier measurements in the high Himalayas. This limits basic understanding of the temporal and spatial patterns of glacier dynamics and the sensitivity of glaciers to climate variability across the Himalayas. This doctoral dissertation research project will combine data from the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) sensor with GIS and field techniques to derive mass-balance measurements and glacial mapping over large areas of the Himalayas using a multi-scale approach. The doctoral candidate's specific objectives are (1) to develop and field validate remote sensing methods for estimating glacier parameters (area, length, mass balance, and equilibrium-line altitude) at the basin scale; (2) to construct a geospatial glacier inventory for analysis of glacier changes at the regional scale; and (3) to understand spatial patterns of glacier fluctuations in relation to climatic variability at the mountain-range scale. Field measurements conducted at the same time with the image acquisition will be the focus of this study. Specific tasks to be accomplished in the field are (1) obtaining ground control points (GCPs) needed for orthorectification of ASTER scenes for the entire Himalaya; (2) validating algorithms for mapping of debris-covered glaciers; and (3) validating remote sensing mass-balance estimates with field measurements at various sites. Field verification will be conducted at Chhota Shigri glacier in the Lahaul-Spiti region of western India, and Glacier AX010 in Solu-Khumbu, Nepal. These activities should enable the student to develop methods that will be applied to unsurveyed sites throughout the Himalayas, with an emphasis on Sikkim.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will result in a systematic, comprehensive assessment of glacier parameters across the Himalayas, which will serve to provide a more complete picture of the current state of glaciers worldwide. The results of this study will provide regional and local planners with valuable information to develop strategies for water management, planning of hydroelectric stations, and detection and management of glacier-related hazards like glacial-lake outburst floods, ice avalanches, and debris flows. The Himalayan glacier datasets will be made available to the broader scientific community in a timely manner by means of the GLIMS Glacier Database, which is stored at the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder. This project will facilitate interactions with remote sensing laboratories and universities in India and Nepal. It will provide graduate students from Kathmandu University with training and assistance in GIS and remote sensing methods as well as with first-hand field experience. As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career. This award is jointly funded by NSF's Office of International Science and Engineering.</AbstractNarration>
