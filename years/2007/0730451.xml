<AbstractNarration>This project will provide five years of support so that the United States can participate in the International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU) program of the Scientific Committee on Solar-Terrestrial Physics (SCOSTEP).   SCOSTEP's main goals are to facilitate collaboration across nations and discipline areas in order to advance understanding of the Sun-Earth system, which includes space weather and climate.  SCOSTEP was formed as a Scientific Committee under the International Council of Scientific Unions in 1978 and is charged with the long-term responsibility to promote international interdisciplinary programs in solar-terrestrial physics.  SCOSTEP facilitates cross-project cooperation, cross-disciplinary conferences, and multi-national research collaboration with the scientific goal of advancing quantitative understanding of coupling mechanisms responsible for the transfer of mass and energy throughout the solar-terrestrial system.  The practical goal is to improve predictability of the effects of the variable components of solar energy and disturbance on the terrestrial environment.  These disturbances range from interference with satellite and aircraft communications systems, to blackouts of electric power grids.   The project will allow SCOSTEP to continue to play an important role in advancing discovery in the field of solar-terrestrial physics, especially regarding international collaboration, as well as its efforts to integrate research and education in the field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Board on Atmospheric Sciences and Climate serves to facilitate U.S. input to SCOSTEP as needed and is the conduit for payment of required annual dues.  SCOSTEP dues are critical to support the full range of SCOSTEP activities in promoting and coordinating international programs in the field of solar-terrestrial physics. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

One of SCOSTEPÆs most visible and important education and public outreach activities is its successful comic book series. Nine comic books have been created, including five within the last five years.  The series now includes:  -           What are the Polar Regions?!  -           What are Cosmic Rays?!  -           What is Global Warming?!  -           What is the Ozone Hole?!  -           What is the Solar Wind?!  -           What is the Aurora?!  -           What is the Geomagnetic Field?!  -           What is the Sun-Climate Relationship?!  -           What is the Upper Atmosphere?!  These subjects are representative of the SCOSTEP scientific topics, and the books are designed specifically for K-12 education. The comic books are available in hard copy or by download from the SCOSTEP website (http://www.yorku.ca/scostep/?page_id=366).  They are available in 23.   SCOSTEP continues to serve the international community by planning and organizing international programs in the solar-terrestrial physics, requiring a great deal of coordination. Within SCOSTEPÆs CAWSES-II program, this is the responsibility of the so-called task groups that each cover a specific subset of science questions within the overarching CAWSES theme. As an example, TG4 of CAWSES organizes targeted observational campaigns, supported by focused modeling activities. In recent years, TG4 carried out six 2-month long campaigns aimed at tides and in 2010 a low-latitude campaign of coordinated ground-based observations to study the relationship between atmospheric waves and ionospheric instabilities.
