<AbstractNarration>This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program supports work by Professor Suzanne Blum at the University of California, Irvine, to  apply single-molecule fluorescence microscopy in the study of mechanisms of reactions which are of broad interest to the chemical community.    Currently available techniques that study the properties of molecules en masse, e.g. ensemble spectroscopy, suffer from two major drawbacks:  (1)  instrument dynamic range that leads to an inability to detect minor (under ~1%) components in mixtures; and (2) lack of information on which components are responsible for reactivity and catalysis.  The difficulty in observing catalytic intermediates is summarized by Halpern's Rule: "If you can observe or isolate an intermediate, it is unlikely to be catalytically relevant."  Single-molecule approaches circumvent Halpern's Rule, because trace quantities of material can be probed spectroscopically, regardless of whether these intermediates accumulate to a level necessary for ensemble spectroscopy.  Similarly, single molecule techniques permit direct observation of intermediates regardless of their position on the reaction coordinate (e.g., after the rate-determining step) and in part-per-billion quantities. Although a special issue of Science recently recognized the emerging power of single-molecule microscopy to answer biochemical questions, the potential of these techniques to answer chemical questions remains virtually untapped.  The proposed research provides a general method to study a range of reactions, by attaching fluorescent tags to reagents and using total internal reflectance (TIRF) microscopy to monitor individual covalent bond forming events.  Several different representative types of synthetically important organometallic reactions will be examined, including olefin polymerization and arene amination.  Additionally, because TIRF is used, these single-molecule experiments will enhance our understanding of surface chemistry, and catalysis at the surface/solution barrier. Through a professional development program, graduate student teaching assistants work with the PI to participate in curriculum and lecture design at the highest levels.  Discussion of pedagogy and assessment of impact play key roles.  In the long term, the program improves the skills of community college, university, and K-12 teachers.Through a professional development program, graduate student teaching assistants work with the PI to participate in curriculum and lecture design at the highest levels.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The development of transition-metal catalyzed reactions, with their selective chemical transformations, has revolutionized the way that materials are generated and pharmaceutical compounds generated.  In these studies, our research group established the fundamental chemistry of two catalysts that cooperate together, gold and pallidum.  The studies established that the cooperativity of these catalysts produces chemical transformations that are not available to either catalyst acting alone.   Major findings include the development of methods to selectively manipulate relatively simple raw materials in order to produce value-added products.  The scientific discoveries achieved during this program speed the construction of chemical compounds and aid in the design efficient chemical processes.   Six Ph.D. graduate students and two undergraduate students received laboratory and advanced scientific training through our research program.  An additional seven graduate students in the Chemistry Department at UC-Irvine (UCI) from multiple research groups received teacher training as part of this grantÃ†s broader impacts teacher training program, Get FIT! (Faculty in Training); three of these trained teachers have since initiated careers as chemistry professors and/or lecturers at primarily undergraduate institutions.  The quality of undergraduate training at UCI was improved for over 800 undergraduate students enrolled in the chemistry classes of the graduated students who received teacher training.  Together these research and teaching programs train the next generation of scientists and college science teachers and extend beyond our laboratory.
