<AbstractNarration>This award supports meetings and other activities of the National Academy of Science's Board on Physics and Astronomy (BPA).  The Board on Physics and Astronomy (BPA) serves as the focal point in the National Research Council (NRC) for activities related to physics and astronomy and their interactions with engineering, medicine, chemistry, biology, and other sciences.  The BPA's principal objectives are to maintain an awareness of the status of research in physics and astronomy, to identify emerging needs, and to initiate studies that address these problems and that foster continued progress.  The BPA fulfills these objectives by working closely with the physics and astronomy communities in academia, federal agencies and their advisory committees, government laboratories, industry, relevant scientific and technical societies, and other boards and committees of the NRC.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ ??This grant provided partial support for the National Research CouncilÆs (NRC) Board on Physics and Astronomy (BPA).  The BPAÆs overall objectives are to identify important new developments at the scientific forefronts, foster interactions with other fields, strengthen connections to technology, and facilitate effective service to the nation by the scientific community.  The membership of the BPA is drawn from universities, industry, and national laboratories.  The BPA meets twice a year and those meetings are devoted to reviewing activities being carried out under its auspices, discussing critical issues, and developing new initiatives.  In general, studies that are initiated by the BPA focus on particular areas of physics or astronomy and are carried out by ad hoc groups of experts in those areas.     Over the three years covered by this grant, the BPA has overseen the production of a number of reports including the decadal study for astronomy and astrophysics, a study on the impact on scientific communities of selling the nationÆs helium reserve, a survey of the scientific uses of the radio spectrum, an assessment of the status and outlook for the nationÆs capabilities to discover and produce crystalline matter, and an evaluation of research at the intersection of the physical and life sciences.  All publications are available in printed form and are also accessible for free, in pdf format, at http://national-academies.org/bpa/.  The website also provides information on all of the BPAÆs activities.          Last Modified: 11/10/2011       Submitted by: Donald C Shapero]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
