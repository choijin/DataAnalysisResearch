    <AbstractNarration>The investigator and his colleagues use spectral methods to&lt;br/&gt;investigate a challenging problem in unsupervised learning and&lt;br/&gt;data visualization: given a set of unorganized data points&lt;br/&gt;sampled possibly with noise from an underlying manifold, compute&lt;br/&gt;a set of global coordinates of the data points with respect to&lt;br/&gt;the underlying manifold. The approach is guided by the general&lt;br/&gt;principle that global structures can emerge from careful analysis&lt;br/&gt;of local interactions. The central idea is the exploration of&lt;br/&gt;tangent spaces as representations of local geometry on a&lt;br/&gt;nonlinear manifold using weighted PCA, and the global alignment&lt;br/&gt;of those local tangent spaces to obtain the global structure of&lt;br/&gt;the manifold by way of computing a partial eigendecomposition of&lt;br/&gt;the neighborhood connection matrix. The study focuses on the&lt;br/&gt;following areas: 1) effective local geometric and topological&lt;br/&gt;structures for manifold learning; 2) the interaction of the local&lt;br/&gt;sampling density, noise level, the regularity of the manifold and&lt;br/&gt;the local curvature structure, and their effects on the accuracy&lt;br/&gt;of manifold learning; 3) local smoothing methods to make manifold&lt;br/&gt;learning more robust to noise and outliers; 4) connections with&lt;br/&gt;infinite mixture models, one-class support vector machines and&lt;br/&gt;level set methods; 5) efficient and scalable algorithms for&lt;br/&gt;large-scale manifold learning problems.&lt;br/&gt; With the advancement in modern computing technology, we are&lt;br/&gt;faced with the challenging problems of extracting useful&lt;br/&gt;information from vast amounts of data. The data generated in a&lt;br/&gt;variety of applications tend to have tens of thousands of&lt;br/&gt;attributes, leading to the problem characterized by "curse of&lt;br/&gt;dimensionality." In many applications, however, high-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;data points are governed by a few intrinsic degrees of freedom.&lt;br/&gt;Think of the set of images depicting a horizontally rotating&lt;br/&gt;face: the images are high-dimensional but the intrinsic degree of&lt;br/&gt;freedom of the image set is simply one, representing the rotation&lt;br/&gt;angle of the face. The focus of this proposal is the development&lt;br/&gt;of geometric, statistical, and computational methods for&lt;br/&gt;extracting those latent intrinsic degrees of freedom by modeling&lt;br/&gt;the set of data points as samples from nonlinear manifolds, and&lt;br/&gt;the discovery of the global structure of the manifolds from&lt;br/&gt;careful analysis of local interactions. The results, algorithms,&lt;br/&gt;and techniques developed have immediate applications in&lt;br/&gt;bioinformatics, especially for gene expression analysis for&lt;br/&gt;detecting and distinguishing diseases and disease types; in&lt;br/&gt;appearance-based modeling for people detection using video&lt;br/&gt;sequences generated from surveillance cameras; in helping&lt;br/&gt;intelligence analysts to sift through large amount of textual&lt;br/&gt;information by more efficient modeling of text document&lt;br/&gt;collections; and in enhancing computer-supported collaborative&lt;br/&gt;learning and performance measurement in second language learning.</AbstractNarration>
