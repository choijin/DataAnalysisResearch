<AbstractNarration>GRADUATE TEACHING FELLOWS IN K-12 EDUCATION&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PROPOSAL #: 0742462&lt;br/&gt;PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Constantin Chassapis &lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION: Stevens Institute of Technology&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: NJ Alliance for Engineering Education&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the New Jersey Alliance for Engineering Education (NJAEE) is to create a partnership that promotes the integration of problem-solving, innovation and inventiveness within mainstream high school STEM curricula, while fostering the cross-fertilization of innovative teaching methods across K-12 and university level education. The intellectual merit of the effort is the implementation and assessment of a model that combines traditional science and mathematics teaching with engineering and technology education, thus effecting wide-reaching transformative changes in the traditional pedagogical paradigm. A cohort of graduate engineering students (Fellows) will collaborate with engineering professors, education professionals, and high school STEM teachers to design, develop, and implement innovative and motivating educational modules based on the Fellows' research areas. The modules will be aligned with the NJ science curriculum requirements and will incorporate themes of engineering design, innovation and inventiveness within the STEM curriculum. Stevens Institute of Technology (SIT) faculty, education professionals and Lawrence Hall of Science staff will collaborate in the creation of a new course "Communicating Engineering", which all Fellows will experience. While completing their engineering studies, Fellows will also complete a 9 credit graduate certificate in education from SIT. NJAEE will enhance STEM learning for approximately 11,700 high school students, will provide considerable professional development opportunities to 130 participating K-12 teachers, and will immerse the next generation of engineering professors in innovative teaching methodologies. Through the project, a sustainable model for a graduate education certificate program "Teaching and Learning in STEM Disciplines" as a supplement to traditional doctoral student technical training in engineering will be developed, assessed, and disseminated nationwide.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Changes at the university level in attitudes or practices  Directly linked to the process of developing the GK12 initial proposal, and through constant reviews of the programÆs annual results, the faculty at Stevens quickly recognized the need to expand the existing engineering education to formally include skills that were far more common in non-STEM majors; in particular subjects related to communications (verbal and writing), presentations (to enhance the ability to describe research and engineering progress and findings), leadership, and entrepreneurial understanding. All of these skills were core to the GK12 program and formalized through workshops, classroom opportunities and on-going evaluation, as well as one on one discussion with the GK12 faculty team.  Stevens offers and has recently expanded its "Graduate Enrichment Program". Much of the content has been developed as a direct result of an increasing number of faculty members becoming aware of the need for additional "soft" skills. The support and success of this program is clearly a result of a self-sustaining change by the school administration with regard to what is important to be a successful engineer or scientist in todayÆs competitive world.  The skills of enhanced communications (of all types) and leadership have also been recognized as a necessary foundation of TA training. Many of the attributes are the same ones that made for a successful fellow in a high school classroom. The lessons learned from GK12 were linked to the needs for a successful TA and turned into a Stevens Teaching Assistant workshop series.   Practices in the schools that began with the Fellows and are continuing beyond the life of the project  The fellows initiated the practice of students reviewing current media in the search for recent engineering and/or scientific discoveries and events. These subjects then became a basis for discussions as to how that which is learned in the classroom is linked to the information under discussion. The fellows attempted to develop demonstrations of analytical or scientific concepts, such as 3D printing. Where the equipment is now available in the classroom, it is expected that these demonstrations will continue. The fellows served as support for various schoolsÆ science day and as judges for STEM contests. Stevens is committed to continue to serve in this role. The fellows initiated entrepreneurial programs in several of the high schools. The teachers found the exercises to be of value to the students and would like to continue with the program. The presentations entitled "What is an engineer/What is a Scientist"  were met with enthusiasm, and the presentations have been left with the  teachers in the hope that they will continue to be used. However,  Stevens will make every effort to provide a student to support "Career  Day" with these presentations if requested by the high school.   Use of materials produced  Over the life of the program, the GK12 fellows produced over 200 Power Point Presentations and Lesson Plans. The majority of these are available for future teacher use.  Changes in K-12 student and teacher achievement, STEM knowledge, or attitudes toward STEM, scientists, engineers, etc.  A comment that was universal from the Fellows assigned to the lower-achieving high schools was "The biggest problem faced was that students were completely unaware of future jobs. The only jobs they knew existed were those within their immediate circle: firefighter, policeman, teacher, etc." For these students, the impact upon their future career choices may have had the greatest impact. The Fellows were able to bring to the students a level of technological awareness that did not previously exist. Through building the link between the materials required to be taught and its application in every day use we are hopeful that some students may take an career path not previously considered.  Changes made in the teacher's approach to STEM  Primarily, the changes ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
