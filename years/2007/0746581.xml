<AbstractNarration>Historically, metabolic systems have served as fertile breeding grounds for many important concepts of molecular biology, including the mechanisms of gene regulation and strategies of homeostasis. At the dawn of the era of systems biology, metabolic systems can play an especially important role towards establishing how system level properties may be quantitatively studied, since many of the components are already known and quantitatively characterized. In this research, a combined experimental and theoretical approach will be used to study the control of nitrogen assimilation and its coordination with carbon/energy metabolism in E. coli. Nitrogen assimilation is carried out by a very compact system consisted of just 3 key enzymes and 3 metabolites, but controlled by a network of regulatory proteins. The goal of this research is to link the biochemistry and molecular biology of the components to growth physiology. This will be accomplished by studying nitrogen flux under media with a spectrum of nitrogen and carbon availability; flux patterns obtained will then be related to the known biochemistry and molecular biology of the regulatory apparatus on the one hand, and to growth physiology on the other hand. The results are expected to produce a quantitative framework connecting the molecular control of nitrogen assimilation to growth physiology, thereby establishing a practical roadmap for extending this approach to other sectors of the metabolic network. Students involved in this project will be exposed to a tightly integrated interdisciplinary education and research experience involving biochemistry, molecular biology, computation, and microbial physiology.</AbstractNarration>

This research uses the bacterium E. coli as the model organism to investigate how cells control nitrogen assimilation under various physiological conditions. Of interests are both the strategies of nitrogen assimilation and the molecular mechanisms by which the strategies are implemented.  In order to carry out these studies, we developed a number of methods (i) to measure accurately the intracellular level of alpha-ketogluturate, a key metabolite and signaling molecule for nitrogen metabolism, (ii) ti enables quantitative studies of bacterial behavior at fixed, low levels of ammonium using a microfluidic device, (iii) model metabolism and gene expression for bacterial cells growing exponentially under different nutrient conditions.

Some of the results derived from this research have been published already in prestigious journals such as Science, Cell, and Proceedings of the National Academy of Science. A number of more recent results are in various stages of preparation and submission. The major findings of this research are summarized as follows:  1. The cell's propensity to assimilate nitrogen is strongly dependent on the availability of carbon and other necessary nutrients. If cell growth is limited by the other nutrients, then the cell reduces its nitrogen uptake. On the other hand, if nitrogen itself is the growth bottleneck, then the cell increases resources devoted to nitrogen uptake.  2. The tight coordination between carbon and nitrogen metabolism described above is coordinated by alpha ketoglutarate and other chemically similar compounds through an integral feedback control mechanism.  3. Despite a complex web of molecular interactions, the expression of key metabolic genes exhibit simple linear correlations with the proliferation rate of the cell, reflecting the underlying architecture of cellular resource allocation.  The findings of this research suggest a fruitful new direction to study metabolism and gene expression, a top-down approach which rests on the physiology of growing cells. This approach is expected to be useful to metabolic engineers in optimizing metabolic pathways of engineered microbes to produce useful compounds, in addition to providing a more quantitative, basic understanding of bacterial growth strategies.
