    <AbstractNarration>Proposal Number: 0719000&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title: Doctoral Dissertation Research: Rogue Agents? Judicial Decision Making at the Federal Courts of Appeals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Jeffrey Segal&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Co-PI: Maxwell Mak&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Performing Organization: SUNY Stony Brook&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This dissertation tests for whether and to what degree the Supreme Court, through its preferences and decisions, can influence the choices lower-court judges make. Truly meaningful influence requires congruence in the eventual case outcome, responsiveness to the principal's preferences, and evincing such behavior in spite of divergent preferences. If judges do indeed behave in a manner inconsistent with their own preferences, only then can the Supreme Court be seen as an adequate and effective principal of the judicial hierarchy. Examining free speech and abortion cases decided at the U.S. Courts of Appeals, I will examine how Court of Appeals decisions change as Supreme Court decisions and preferences change. The data, collected from searches on Lexis/Nexis, will be two of the more comprehensive collections of cases at the Federal Courts of Appeals in these issue areas, opening the door for research in many aspects of judicial politics. Also, the general framework is applicable to the separation of powers literature examining the dynamics of the coordinate branches of government as well as principal-agent models of bureaucracies and legislative committees. Finally, this research also has educational implications. The analytical framework of this dissertation can be used in the education and training of undergraduate and graduate students with interests in judicial politics or advanced methodology.</AbstractNarration>
