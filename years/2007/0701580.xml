<AbstractNarration>David Eisenbud will perform research on a number of&lt;br/&gt;areas in which algebraic geometry mixes with homological commutative&lt;br/&gt;algebra. One of these is the study of the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity&lt;br/&gt;of high powers of ideals. For an ideal in the homogeneous coordinate ring&lt;br/&gt;of a projective variety that is of finite colength and is generated by forms&lt;br/&gt;of a single degree, this "assymptotic regularity" is connected with the&lt;br/&gt;properties of fibers of the corresponding map of varieties, and Eisenbud&lt;br/&gt;will use this connection to investigate generic projections. A second&lt;br/&gt;area is the study of schemes that are 2-regular. This work builds on the classification&lt;br/&gt;for reduced schemes that was recently completed by Eisenbud, Green, Hulek and&lt;br/&gt;Popescu. A third area has to do with the computation of higher direct images using&lt;br/&gt;exterior algebra methods. Eisenbud will study certain varieties that appear naturally&lt;br/&gt;in the deformation spaces of bundles in this way. All these areas are supported&lt;br/&gt;by computations based on Groebner basis methods. Eisenbud will collaborate&lt;br/&gt;with Stillman and Grayson in the development of the Macaulay2 program, which&lt;br/&gt;is currently the best tool for computations in projective geometry. Finally, Eisenbud&lt;br/&gt;will collaborate on a project with Diaconis, Holmes, and their students involving the&lt;br/&gt;application of techniques in algebraic geometry to statistics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An algebraic variety in complex n-space is a set defined by&lt;br/&gt;the simultaneous vanishing of a collection of polynomial functions&lt;br/&gt;of n variables. Many of the important geometric objects that appear&lt;br/&gt;in mathematics can be defined this way. One way to study an algebraic&lt;br/&gt;variety is to ask for the dimension of the vector space of polynomials&lt;br/&gt;of degree at most d that vanish on the variety, as a function of d. This&lt;br/&gt;is called the Hilbert function of the variety. David Hilbert showed how to&lt;br/&gt;compute this function, and refine it, by computing something called a&lt;br/&gt;free resolution of the variety. My work uses such free resolutions to study&lt;br/&gt;varieties in many contexts. For example, if a variety of dimension n is embedded in&lt;br/&gt;a vector space of dimension n+1,&lt;br/&gt;then the variety is defined by just one equation, a relatively simple case.&lt;br/&gt;Most varieties of dimension n can not be embedded in this way, but any&lt;br/&gt;variety of dimension n can be mapped linearly onto a variety of the&lt;br/&gt;same dimension in an n+1 dimensional space. One of the questions I will&lt;br/&gt;study is the difference between the original variety and its image, for the&lt;br/&gt;best possible embeddings.</AbstractNarration>
