<AbstractNarration>This project will develop an 8th grade assessment for proportional reasoning from a cognitive diagnosis model (CDM) framework. CDMs are psychometric models developed specifically for diagnosing the presence or absence of fine-grained skills or processes required in solving problems on a test. Assessments based on CDMs can provide information deemed more diagnostic and descriptive, therefore, more relevant in applied instructional settings. This project will also introduce a comprehensive framework that will make the construction, administration and analysis of such assessments more practicable. New models, methodologies, and a computer program will be developed in this project to facilitate wider applications of CDMs.</AbstractNarration>
