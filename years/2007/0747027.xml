<AbstractNarration>Securing Active Information&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When multiple parties attempt to collaborate, they often end up having to&lt;br/&gt;compromise the confidentiality of their private information.  Cryptographic&lt;br/&gt;primitives like secure multiparty computation and obfuscation are aimed at&lt;br/&gt;mitigating this situation. We view many such problems as part of a unifying&lt;br/&gt;paradigm that we call Active Information: various parties in a system can have&lt;br/&gt;access to prescribed actions of the information in the system, but nothing&lt;br/&gt;more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first focus area of the project is secure multiparty computation, which&lt;br/&gt;lets mutually distrusting parties emulate a commonly trusted party, by means&lt;br/&gt;of a protocol. We identify and investigate crucial properties required for&lt;br/&gt;this to be useful in practice: "network-awareness" addresses issues that arise&lt;br/&gt;in a realistically complex environment, and a new class of "context-awareness"&lt;br/&gt;features are vital in integrating secure multiparty computation into a larger&lt;br/&gt;application.  We also derive insight into the fundamental nature of various&lt;br/&gt;multiparty computation tasks by classifying them into complexity classes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another focus of this project is on "secure active objects" that offer far&lt;br/&gt;more flexibility in their use, compared to protocols. We study well-known (but&lt;br/&gt;little understood) concepts like obfuscation, as well as new tools we develop&lt;br/&gt;like "remotely primed obfuscations," and "active encryptions," and also&lt;br/&gt;features like anonymity and unlinkability that are important for applications.&lt;br/&gt;Secure active objects also serve as a platform to integrate the study of&lt;br/&gt;hardware-based security solutions into the theory of cryptography.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tools developed span a wide spectrum, ranging from low-level algebraic&lt;br/&gt;techniques used in constructions, to high-level frameworks for conceptualizing&lt;br/&gt;security definitions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Towards bringing the subtle concepts from theoretical cryptography to a&lt;br/&gt;broader audience of current and future practitioners, two online resources are&lt;br/&gt;being developed: (1) a wiki-based tutorial/reference website, and (2) a blog&lt;br/&gt;aimed at students and a non-specialist audience.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In today's information age, there is a constant tension between the demands of privacy and the compelling promise of functionality and convenience obtained by sharing our information with various service providers.  In response, modern cryptography has been developing tools that promise to strike a seemingly impossible balance. These tools - protocols and codes - encode information in a way that allows computations to be performed on it, leading to enhanced functionality, while preventing access to any further information than is explicitly specified by the functionality.  The project "Securing Active Information" focused on the foundations of the science behind such tools, resulting in around 40 research papers, over a span of six years. The research included:  Developing mathematically rigorous definitions of what it means to be secure, while allowing greater functionality. Classifying the various types of functionality in terms of how complex they are to achieve, when security guarantees are required.   Several new cryptographic protocols and constructions, and a new protocol design paradigm, for achieving significantly improved efficiency and functionality, without sacrificing security.     The results from this project have led to several new connections with areas like information theory and computational complexity theory, and has opened up several important directions of research.  The project involved several graduate and undergraduate student researchers, as well as the PI and other collaborators. The PI developed advanced course material on cryptography and computational complexity theory. Also, as part of the project, PI has co-edited a book on the topic of  "secure multi-party computation," a core research topic in the project. Research results and ideas were disseminated to the research community and students through a number of talks, visits to other researchers, papers posted online and initially, through an instructional wiki and a blog.
