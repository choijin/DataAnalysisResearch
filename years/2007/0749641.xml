<AbstractNarration>This award provides support for a second summit and follow-up activities between American and Chinese researchers from leading universities in both countries. The first summit was held in China in 2006. This second meeting is being arranged as a result of a recommendation from the American delegation from the initial meeting of the delegations.  The summit is to take place in the summer of 2008 and to be organized by a joint U. S./China Steering Committee.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project lies in the opportunities it provides American researchers to develop new methods for improving education and research at their own institutions and in the nation.  During the meeting and subsequent smaller meetings across the United States, researchers from both countries plan to identify research and education projects of common interest for further collaboration. American participants should gain further insights into the educational structures and research programs in China and thus develop research and education practices needed for today?s global economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this project involve the potential for American students and faculty to adapt an increasingly global higher education and economy and to open up lines of communication that may enable new international collaborations at all levels of the education and scientific research enterprises.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
