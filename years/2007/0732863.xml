<AbstractNarration>In this project, a team of investigators will develop new algorithms and software to simultaneously align DNA sequences and reconstruct phylogenetic trees. This methods and theory-oriented project addresses an important problem in phylogenetic reconstruction: relatively poor performance of existing tools in the face of insertions, deletions, and duplications in large datasets. This project will develop a simultaneous approach to DNA sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis that will allow researchers to overcome these problems. Specific goals for the project will be to develop a portal and open-source software for simultaneous alignment and phylogenetic analysis, develop new simulators to model DNA sequence evolution, establish a working group on alignment methods with the Assembling the Tree of Life (AToL) community, and develop training programs in alignment and phylogeny estimation with outreach activities to minority institutions. The project includes many members of the Cyberinfrastructure for Phylogenetic Research (CIPRES) project and will provide significant new analytic capabilities for that data resource. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By making simultaneous alignment and phylogenetic analysis feasible for very large datasets, this project will provide software tools that will serve a broad community of researchers conducting phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequence data. These tools will enable consideration of DNA regions for phylogenetic analysis that cannot be aligned using existing tools. An open-source, portal interface will open multiple sequence alignment and tree-building to a broader range of users and engagement of existing AToL users will provide input and evaluation early in the software development process.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

Specifically, we developed a sequence simulation program (indel-Seq-Gen or iSG), large-scale benchmark datasets of simulated protein and DNA sequences, and SuiteMSA, visual tools for multiple sequence alignment (MSA) comparison. iSG is capable of simulating biologically realistic sequence evolution at both DNA (coding and non-coding) and protein levels. It allows to simulate highly divergent evolution incorporating insertion/deletion events, discrete evolutionary steps, lineage-specific as well as site-specific parameterizations, motif conservation, subsequence length constrains, and event tracking. iSG is freely available from: http://bioinfolab.unl.edu/~cstrope/iSG/</p> <p>Using iSGv2.1, large-scale benchmark alignment datasets have been produced for both DNA and protein sequences.

For each model, 5000 and 10000 taxa of sequences were generated. Based on the true alignments and true phylogenies, useful statistics (e.g., alignment properties, error rates) wee also collected.
