<AbstractNarration>Under the supervision of Dr. David L. Browman and Dr. Fiona Marshall, , Mr. Jose M. Capriles-Flores will analyze the evidence for the origins of camelid (llama and alpaca) pastoralism in South America.   Among the salient issues will be the examination of the generalized management strategies employed to extract animal products and animal energy sources to enhance the local prehistoric economy.  Evidence from pristine samples recovered from two sites in the Iroco area near Oruro, Bolivia, will be utilized to test two theoretical models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Iroco locality was selected as a research focus because it is in an area of presumed origin of primary dependence upon camelid pastoralism.  But the location was chosen also because it is far outside of the main prehistoric and historic trade routes near Lake Titicaca.  Earlier studies in these areas have been confounded by the extensive introgression and hybridization of the animals since the Spanish Conquest.  Iroco should provide a clean sample of early camelid pastoralism.  Preliminary aDNA (ancient DNA) pilot analyses provide support for the selection of this site. Detailed zooarchaeological analyses coupled with spatial contextual information will be employed to determine the nature of camelid consumption, and camelid resource extraction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beyond the research questions of particularly interest to natural and social scientists, this project will provide potential data to address broader public issues such as the adjustments that may be necessary owing to global warming.  One of the projected consequences of the current environmental situation facing the world is increased aridity in many locales, where there will still be sufficient moisture to support stock raising and other pastoral strategies, but where plant agriculture will be drastically reduced or eliminated.   Evaluation of the strategies developed and employed by prehistoric camelid pastoralists here should provide experts with additional models and strategies to consider in addressing the apparently impending environmental relocation facing the globe.  Llama and alpaca herds are increasingly common in the western U.S. grasslands, and this research should provide new information for fine-tuning expansion of the American industry.  For the host country, Bolivia, the fieldwork will provide information on the cultural and historical heritage of the Oruro region.  And, as well, by carrying out the analysis phase in coordination with the Bolivian Colecci√≥n de Fauna research component of the Universidad Mayor de San Andres in La Paz, Bolivia, the project will provide currently unavailable opportunities for training students in analytical methods and techniques.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
