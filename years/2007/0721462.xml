<AbstractNarration>Steroids exert dramatic, highly reproducible effects on behavior in every species studied to date from insects to man. Behavioral changes are strongly  correlated  with structural and functional changes in the connections among the cells in the brain, or synapses in the adult brain.  Gonadal steroids such as testosterone have been shown to accelerate and induce changes in the strength and number of synapses in areas responsible for learning and memory.  The goal of this project is to determine if the presence or absence of testosterone changes synaptic strength  among nerve cells in a neural network responsible for social and reproductive behaviors in adults.  Synapses will be identified with the latest technology and examined under low and high power microscopes to identify significant changes in the number, function, and source of synapses in the preoptic area, an important integrating structure in this network.  Results from these studies will enhance our understanding of the role of gonadal steroids in the regulation of neural function in the adult brain, thus setting the stage for future studies of growth enhancing chemicals and substrates involved in sexual differentiation, aging and injury.  This project will offer unique training opportunites in neuroanatomy and will include undergraduates and graduates in the collection, analysis and processing of the results.</AbstractNarration>
