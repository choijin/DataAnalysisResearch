<AbstractNarration>The origins of space and time are one of the enduring mysteries of nature. Did space and time emerge in some kind of Big Bang? Will the universe end in a Big Crunch? Can we sensibly describe these singular highly quantum states of nature? In order to answer such basic questions about the nature of space and time, we need a quantum theory of gravity. String theory remains the best candidate for such a theory. The first aim of this project is to explore the nature of time in string theory through the study of both singular and non-singular time-dependent backgrounds. The second aim is to further explore the physics of flux compactifications with a focus on the heterotic string and the relation between moduli stabilization, the emergence of the Standard Model of Particle Physics and cosmology. The broader impact of this project centers on improved interdisciplinary ties with both cosmologists and mathematicians through lectures at schools and workshops, and through direct collaboration. A second aspect of the broader impact is via the PI continuing his participation in the Space Explorers innercity K-12 enrichment program.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Does time have a beginning or an end? How do we describe the physics of the Big Bang? These questions are central to any understanding of the origin of our universe. Near a cosmological singularity like the Big Bang, gravity becomes strongly interacting and our conventional notions of space-time break down. To describe the physics of such singularities, we require a quantum theory of gravity. Our best candidate for such a theory of quantum gravity is string theory.  In combining quantum mechanics and gravity, string theory leads a rich and surprising picture of the microscopic universe in which there are eleven rather than four space-time dimensions. Our current paradigm for how the observed four-dimensional universe emerges from string theory involves  a landscape of metastable solutions with sufficient complexity to admit our universe. Each point in the landscape is characterized by the shape and size of the compactified dimensions, along with a choice of fluxes threading those dimensions.    It has been clear for many years that generic string geometries are going to look quite different from the geometries that have been the main focus of study over past years. Most of the effort in understanding string compactifications has centered on Calabi-Yau spaces, or closely related variants. This is for good reason: Calabi-Yau spaces solve the space-time Einstein equations, which govern large volume string compactifications. These spaces form a natural set of compactifications of the type II string, which enjoy extended space-time supersymmetry.     However, Calabi-Yau vacua are rather special because they do not involve any flux degrees of freedom. We expect most compactifications to involve fluxes which, in the heterotic string, require non-Kahler geometries, typically with string scale features. Among models with minimal space-time supersymmetry, Calabi-Yau spaces should look quite distinguished.    A natural place to find generic string geometries is in the physics of two-dimensional chiral gauge theory. Among the outcomes of this project is the realization that chiral gauge theory has a much richer vacuum structure than has been seen in non-chiral theories.  There are new branches, which typically involve integrating out gauge anomalous heavy multiplets. The low-energy structure is very different from what is seen in conventional models, and the resulting geometries are non-Kahler spaces with boundaries, fluxes and branes.    This kind of linear framework has been desired for many years as a way to understand generic string vacua. This is a rather exciting situation where the physical theory is well-defined, providing a definition of new target spaces and geometries, but the associated mathematics is mysterious. Indeed, gauge theory should teach us the correct mathematical framework for describing generic string geometry.   Another outcome of this project is a new stringy mechanism for evading a classic no-go theorem that forbids flux compactifications of M-theory and the type IIA string. The mechanism involves new sources of brane charge in string theory and M-theory, which are generated by combinations of curvature and flux.     The broader impact of this project centered on improved interdisciplinary ties with both cosmologists and mathematicians through lectures at schools and workshops, and through direct collaboration. A second aspect of the broader impact was continued participation in the Space Explorers inner- city K-12 enrichment program, and the Chicago Physics REU Program for Women &amp; Minorities.
