<AbstractNarration>The project focuses on the development of new methods and new strategies for the facile construction of complex molecules in the laboratory.  The research is by design of practical nature, thus, it is conceivable that innovations from the work might find industrial applications, such as in fine-chemical or pharmaceutical product synthesis.  A number of new transformations that form carbon-carbon, carbon-oxygen, and carbon-nitrogen bonds with absolute stereo-chemical control will be investigated.  Molecular complexity will be developed rapidly and in ways that are subject to prediction.  The complex products of the transformations hold great promise to function as useful new building blocks in chemical synthesis, with potential applications in many different areas of scientific and commercial enterprise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. Andrew G. Myers in the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology at Harvard University.  Dr. Myers will focus his work on developing synthetic methodology that can be applied to complex synthetic problems.  The broader impact of the work is in the areas of pharmaceutical, agricultural and materials chemistry.  Further, the project presents an excellent setting for the training of graduate students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our laboratory has conducted research on the discovery, development, and application of new reaction methodology in synthetic organic chemistry.  These new methods provide chemists with new tools with which to construct complex molecular structures for applications in drug discovery, development of new catalysts, and for the discovery of new materials.  We have conducted fundamental research exploring new processes to form carbon-carbon, carbon-oxygen, and carbon-palladium bonds.  In one component of our research we have sought to develop new ways to label biomolecules, such as proteins and nucleic acids, in water.  Students involved in these research activities gain depth of experience in problem solving related to the construction of complex molecules, which is essential in many industries focused on the development of pharmaceuticals, agricultural products, and materials.     We have successfully developed new methods that allow chemists to form carbon-carbon bonds with control of stereochemistry, which is essential in many practical applications, such as those involving drug discovery, where typically only one of two mirror-image forms is biologically active.  As part of this work we have found chemistry that allows chemists to construct "quaternary carbon centers," which are highly congested carbon atoms bearing four non-hydrogen substituents.  Many complex bioactive natural products contain quaternary carbon centers.  In other research, we developed a method to construct adjacent carbon centers with hydroxyl groups (1,2-diols), built in such a way that the adjacent centers are differentiated, which is to say that subsequent chemistry can be conducted selectively.  Adjacent 1,2-diols are widespread among biologically active compounds, including many antibiotics, carbohydrates, and numerous other compound classes. We have also developed a method that allows for the rapid construction of isoquinolines, a class of molecules that includes antiproliferative (anticancer) agents, and an extraordinary diversity of alkaloids.  Recently, isoquinoline-containing molecules have been developed to treat hepatitis C and cardiovascular diseases, among others.  Lastly, we have continued to develop and explore fundamental new chemistry that enables the preparation of discrete organopalladium intermediates.  We've shown that these intermediates can be used to form carbon-carbon bonds in water and have taken preliminary steps to label biomolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids with dyes and other molecular markers.  These reagents for bimolecular labeling may have a number of practical applications, including as tools for the identification of molecular targets of drugs.
