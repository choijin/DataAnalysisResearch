<AbstractNarration>CBET-0732231 Akay    This project proposes to support the International Summer School on Biocomplexity from System to Gene in July 2007 at Bogazici University, Istanbul, Turkey. The main objective of this summer school is to expose undergraduate and graduate biological science and bioengineering students to the relatively new approaches of the mathematical and computational challenges in Systems Biology and the new directions in computational biology, bioinformatics and molecular engineering research and to facilitate rapid diffusion of these mathematical and computational tools in the biological sciences. These methods will be helpful, also, to students in computer science and mathematics who are interested in pursuing research in biology, biomolecular engineering and bioengineering, since the summer school provides exceptional insights into the fundamental challenges in biological sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The summer school uses lectures, oriented toward biological science students, by expert faculty and will focus on the biological data mining and knowledge discovery that can be used to understand highly interconnected and complex biological systems. In addition to these lectures, the summer school will include 2 two-hour panel discussion, with active participation of undergraduate and graduate students, focused on future developments in computational biology, bioinformatics and molecular engineering and science. In addition, students will present their research activities in their departments and institutes in a culminating poster session, which will facilitate discussion of both the biology and computational approaches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Biomedical Engineering Program and Office of International Science and Engineering are co-funding this summer school.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
