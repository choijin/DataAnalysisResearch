<AbstractNarration>GRADUATE TEACHING FELLOWS IN K-12 EDUCATION&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PROPOSAL #: 0742402&lt;br/&gt;PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Dominick Casadonte&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION: Texas Tech University&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: Building Bridges: Integrating Mathematics, Science and Engineering Education on the South Plains&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program prepares forty experienced doctoral-level science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) graduate students and forty secondary STEM teachers to work in an interdisciplinary environment by developing novel Mathematics, Engineering, and Science Bridge Quartets (MESBQ), where a GK-12 Science or Engineering Fellow and a GK-12 Mathematics Fellow will partner with corresponding in-service science and mathematics teachers. The cohorts will form during a series of summer institutes, where the research knowledge of the Fellows will be disseminated to the teachers, training in pedagogy and learning theory will occur for the Fellows, and integrated STEM curriculum modules will be developed.  The focus of the MESBQ project is to enrich the education of STEM doctoral students, to develop a novel curricular approach to mathematics and science instruction, to build integrated math/science communities within and between higher education and K-12 institutions, and to enhance the mathematics and science content knowledge of teacher participants. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More broadly, the STEM graduate students will gain an appreciation for the interconnectedness of the STEM disciplines in research. The teachers will develop an enhanced understanding of the relationship of math and science in their teaching. The K-12 students will benefit through the development of new inquiry-based integrated curriculum modules. Fellows from underrepresented groups will be recruited and an emphasis will be placed on working with teachers from schools with underserved populations. Results will be disseminated nationally through a capstone conference and a model developed that can be replicated across the nation.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

The program allowed the STEM Graduate Fellows to provide relevant mathematics of use in high school science and engineering courses and relevant scientific or engineering examples of the use of various math concepts.               The MESB cohorts were initiated each year through a week-long summer institute where the Graduate Fellows and Teacher Fellows began cohort development, began to understand of the relationship of the graduate students in the K-12 classroom, learned advanced teaching and presenting skills, and started the construction of the integrated STEM learning modules.  This process continued throughout each academic year, with week-long modules being deployed in the spring (see attached figures).  The Fellows spent 10 hours per week in class and up to 5 hours per week in preparation (including weekly meetings with the Teachers and monthly meetings with the PI team).  In addition, the Graduate Fellows participated in a STEM seminar each fall that required them to learn how to present the results of their research to a scientifically literate but general audience, in order to improve their communication skills.  In summary, 55 total (41 unique) graduate students were hired in the Texas Tech Building Bridges GK-12 program, of which 38 total (28 unique), representing 69% of the total population, were from under-represented minorities in the STEM disciplines.  Over the five years of the grant (plus one-year grant extension), 64 STEM presentations (18 associated with GK-12 activities) and 37 research articles were published in peer-reviewed journals by the Graduate Fellows...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
