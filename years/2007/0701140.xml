<AbstractNarration>Burns will be continuing his studies of partially hyperbolic dynamical &lt;br/&gt;systems. This area has seen great progress in the last decade after the &lt;br/&gt;breakthrough work of Pugh and Shub, who established ergodicity for volume &lt;br/&gt;preserving perturbations of the time one map of the geodesic flow of a &lt;br/&gt;surface of constant negative curvature. A series of papers, culminating in &lt;br/&gt;recent work of Burns and Wilkinson, has established ergodicity for a very &lt;br/&gt;general class of volume preserving partially hyperbolic systems. This work &lt;br/&gt;appears to have pushed current techniques to their limit, but still falls &lt;br/&gt;short of a complete understanding of when volume preserving partially &lt;br/&gt;hyperbolic systems are ergodic; new ideas are needed. Burns will continue &lt;br/&gt;to study this question as well as various special examples of partially &lt;br/&gt;hyperbolic dynamical systems, in particular compact group extensions of &lt;br/&gt;hyperbolic basic sets. He will also consider geometrical questions about &lt;br/&gt;the geodesic which are closely related to the work on partial &lt;br/&gt;hyperbolicity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Partially hyperbolic dynamical systems are important because they model &lt;br/&gt;phenomena which occur in nature and because, at least in some examples, it &lt;br/&gt;is possible to completely understand the mechanisms which create the &lt;br/&gt;observed phenomena. Partial hyperbolicity is to be expected in systems &lt;br/&gt;which have a fast-slow dynamics in which one aspect of the systems &lt;br/&gt;operates on a short time scale and other aspects operate on a longer time &lt;br/&gt;scale. There is now a good understanding of how partial hyperbolicity &lt;br/&gt;gives rise to highly chaotic behaviour in many situations.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
