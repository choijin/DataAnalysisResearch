<AbstractNarration>Flapping flight provides high maneuverability for indoor environments.&lt;br/&gt;To achieve robust intelligence for tasks such as search and indoor&lt;br/&gt;navigation, the maneuverability of an ornithopter will be combined&lt;br/&gt;with a learning approach which makes minimal assumptions about the&lt;br/&gt;nature of disturbances and obstacles.  We propose to develop&lt;br/&gt;algorithms for ornithopters to cooperate in sensing and navigation in&lt;br/&gt;typical indoor environments without prior maps.  Our research will be&lt;br/&gt;verified with full three dimensional dynamic simulation, a&lt;br/&gt;multi-tethered laboratory test-bed, as well as with actual indoor&lt;br/&gt;flying ornithopters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The key research issues to be addressed in this work are:&lt;br/&gt;1) improved ornithopter mechanics and aerodynamics&lt;br/&gt;2) robust ornithopter flight control strategies&lt;br/&gt;3) learning algorithms for cooperative navigation&lt;br/&gt;of ornithopters using only simple sensor information&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will advance understanding of high maneuverability&lt;br/&gt;flapping wing vehicles for indoor flight.  By combining research from&lt;br/&gt;the levels of mechanics to learned behavior in a real indoor&lt;br/&gt;environment, we will test how performance at each level can be&lt;br/&gt;integrated to achieve robust intelligence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our project will provide interdisciplinary education for students in&lt;br/&gt;achieving robust intelligence through the combination of mechanics,&lt;br/&gt;sensing, control, and learning.  This research can lead to flying&lt;br/&gt;robots which can robustly enter unknown and hazardous indoor&lt;br/&gt;environments, potentially keeping rescue workers out of harms way.</AbstractNarration>
