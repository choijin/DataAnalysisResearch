<AbstractNarration>     In this project, ozone (O3), NOx (NO+NO2), peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN), non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHC), and carbon monoxide (CO) will be measured continuously over two full summers at the Pico mountain observatory in the Azores, in order to study transport events over a range of transport altitudes and pathways.  To identify and attribute pollution transport events, FLEXPART particle dispersion model simulations of the transport of anthropogenic and boreal wildfire emissions to Pico will be conducted, and all events with observed anthropogenic impacts and minimal boreal fire impacts will be analyzed.  Tropospheric O3, CO, and NO2 from the TES, OMI, and SCIAMACHY satellite sensors will be analyzed to assess the importance of the sampled events relative to the total column.  Data will be analyzed in conjunction with GEOS-Chem chemical transport model (CTM) simulations to evaluate the ability of the CTM to simulate observed absolute and relative enhancements in measured species and to probe the consistency between observations and simulated photochemistry and mixing.  New techniques will be used that combine high-resolution FLEXPART simulations with CTM output to obtain a semi-Lagrangian sampling of CTM simulations in pollution transport events.  By analyzing multiple events over two summer seasons, the data will be used to quantify the contribution of such events to large-scale impacts of continental outflow on O3 and O3 precursors.&lt;br/&gt;     This work will lead to reduced uncertainties in estimates of the impacts of anthropogenic and boreal fire emissions on tropospheric O3.  It will provide new information on variability in remote lower free tropospheric O3 and PAN resulting from inter-annual variability in boreal fire activity.  This project will contribute to teaching and training by providing a doctoral research topic for one graduate student as well as an undergraduate research project; through the sharing of research findings with high school teachers in the Azores; and through a web site.  It will enhance research infrastructure by maintaining the Pico station during a period of transition to a permanent Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) station.  A Pico GAW station would be a valuable resource for the atmospheric science community for long-term monitoring of atmospheric composition and trans-Atlantic pollution transport, and as a base for research intensives.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project entailed the operation of atmospheric monitoring instrumentation at the Pico Mountain Observatory on Pico Island, Azores.  Data from these observations were used in research on emission of air pollutants and their transport and chemical processing in the lower atmosphere across the North Atlantic Ocean.   We continued operation of previously installed monitoring equipment for measuring the gases ozone, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, and non-methane hydrocarbons.   New instrumentation that was installed recorded atmospheric radiation, the size of small particles present in the atmosphere and of peroxy acetyl nitrate (PAN), which is an important gas reservoir for the long-range transport of nitrogen oxides.   Data from these measurements were used in conjunction with atmospheric transport models to study the influence of different type of emissions and source regions on the atmospheric pollution seen in the Azores.  This research was done in close collaboration with colleagues from Michigan Technological University and the University of the Azores.  We also worked closely with scientists from Europe and Canada in the context of the BORTAS campaign (Quantifying the impact of BOReal forest fires on Tropospheric oxidants over the Atlantic using Aircraft and Satellites).  The BORTAS experiment entailed two intensive summer campaign in 2010 and 2011.   Measurements from Pico were used to assess the distance, frequency, and pathway of boreal biomass burning plumes across the Atlantic.  The main scientific findings from the past few years of this research are:  -          The Azores are primarily influenced by pollution outflow from North America.  Atmospheric transport from Europe or Africa was only observed in very few occasions.  -          Levels of PAN are relatively low in air sampled at the station, especially during summer.  This shows that air gets transported mostly in the lower troposphere where relatively warm temperatures cause PAN to have a short lifetime.  -          Comparisons of the full 10-year record of Pico data with emission inventories and model simulations indicate a slight decline of ozone and carbon monoxide in air sampled at the station.  These trends are an indication that emission controls in North America exhibit strong influence on trends of these compounds far downwind, and, for the North Atlantic Region, supersede emission increases from Asia.  A new Pico Mountain Webpage was launched for sharing information about this atmospheric research with the public.  It is accessible at http://instaar.colorado.edu/pico/.  This site has received close to 40,000 visits since it was launched two years ago.  We also created a public data archive from which all data from the past 10 years of Pico Mountain observations can be downloaded.  Findings from this research were included in several manuscripts that have been submitted to the special issue for BORTAS in the journal Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics.
