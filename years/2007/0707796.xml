    <AbstractNarration>This project investigates the spectra of elliptic operators that arise in models of thermal insulator coatings. Analytical and numerical research will be carried out in two areas. Work in the first area will use Dirichlet eigenvalues and eigenfunctions to measure the thermal insulation properties of an anisotropic material. The principal and higher Dirichlet eigenvalues will be estimated rigorously and numerically by using only the three rotational invariants of the thermal tensor of the material. These estimates will be used to study the optimal design of nano insulators and to inversely find the invariants of the thermal tensor. The project will also investigate the Robin eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of an isotropic body coated by an anisotropic insulator. Work in the second area will continue development of a theory to estimate the first positive Neumann eigenvalue of the Laplacian and will investigate inverse scattering problems in which a closely related eigenvalue problem arises. Applications include optimal design of periodic structures in diffractive optics technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first part of the project is motivated by significant engineering applications in nano-composite materials science. Efficient thermal insulators can be created by proper designing of nano-composite materials, which, at the macroscale, commonly exhibit anisotropy. For such a material, the principal Dirichlet eigenvalue of the corresponding elliptic operator can be used to measure the thermal insulation effectiveness. The user-friendly estimates developed in this project of Dirichlet eigenvalues will be helpful in designing better nano-composite thermal insulators and in understanding the thermal tensor when its analytic formula is not available. This work extends studies of the practical problem of protecting an isotropic conductor (e.g., a space shuttle) from overheating by an anisotropic coating; an easy-to-use rule for the optimal thickness of the coating required has been obtained. This rule is potentially widely applicable in thermal engineering. The second part of the project addresses measurement of the strength of diffusion in a well-insulated container. The expected applications of this theory include the uniqueness of the inverse problem that arises in the optimal design of periodic structures in diffractive optics technology.</AbstractNarration>
