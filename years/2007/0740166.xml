    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project plans to integrate technologies from two emerging areas - sensor-based prognostics and health management and high-rate/high-volume real-time information management. In mission-critical commercial, military, and government applications, the cost of hardware failure is detrimental. The costs result from three types of scenarios: monetary, time, and productivity loss. The proposed research will develop a four-tier sensor based framework to create an environment wherein 1) catastrophic failures are minimized/avoided, 2) monitoring is simplified and optimized, 3) replacement/service costs are lowered, 4) hardware life is prolonged, and 5) the reuse/recycling is increased. The specific research objectives are: 1) formulate a framework to handle sensor-based real-time data generated in a distributed environment; 2) develop an information system to process incoming sensor data, make diagnostic/prognostic decisions, and pass on decisions to all the users; and 3) develop effective data processing protocols to interface sensors with the information system. The anticipated project deliverables include (1) information system prototype, as applied to computer servers as test-bed (2) protocol to integrated sensors with the information system; (3) a web-based application to manage/analyze data and to generate notification reports.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The reliance on devices to store data, perform critical tasks combined with the need for 24x7x365 availability are the impetus for SARTIS. Preventing breakdowns, data and time loss increases efficiency and security. In commercial systems it is noticed that implementation of monitoring and diagnostics technologies can cut down half of the downtime cost. The project will promote the welfare of society and the environment. Society will have a tool to ensure mission-critical processes operate continually, saving redundancy-related costs. Understanding of effective integration of sensor and information technologies into commercial, government, and military applications.</AbstractNarration>
