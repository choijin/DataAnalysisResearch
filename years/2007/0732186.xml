<AbstractNarration>Teachers' Domain online professional development courses contain multimedia collections of science materials and resources developed by WGBH with support from National Science Foundation (NSF) during the last six years. Using an experimental design, this project will examine the effects of online professional development courses on high school biology teachers' content and pedagogical knowledge, and on their students' knowledge. The impact of using 'rich media' will also be tested. Hierarchal linear modeling techniques will be used to analyze the data.  This project will contribute to the knowledge base of what makes a difference in student achievement by testing the efficacy of online professional development for science teachers.  The issue of science teachers' content and pedagogical knowledge poses particular problems at the middle and high school level, where a large percentage of teachers are teaching outside their area of expertise. This project will contribute substantially by examining both the effect of professional development on high school biology teachers and the connection between professional development and student achievement. In examining the effectiveness of the Teachers' Domain professional development courses and materials on teachers and students for a diverse group of New York State school districts, it will be possible to understand how teachers can go beyond surface familiarity with basic concepts and textbook presentations and increase their pedagogical content knowledge.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Overview  Between 2007 and 2012, researchers at the Education Development Center|Center for Children and Technology (EDC|CCT) conducted a suite of research studies designed to examine the impact of an online professional development course on teachers and their students. The findings from these studies hold implications for the design and dissemination of professional learning opportunities for K&ndash;12 teachers, in particular for science teachers using digital media tools in their instruction.     The online course, Teaching High School Biology, sought to improve teachersÆ content knowledge, their pedagogical knowledge, and their knowledge of how to integrate digital media resources into their teaching. The purpose of this experimental study was to investigate the impact on teachersÆ own knowledge of, and on their studentsÆ understanding of, genetics and evolution, through participation in the course. The course was developed by WGBHÆs TeachersÆ Domain and delivered by PBS TeacherLine.     In addition to the main quantitative study, the project included a qualitative study that investigated teachersÆ instructional practices and a supplemental study with school districts using a blended learning approach in their professional development offerings that provided information about potential models for integrating online learning resources.     The participants in the experimental study were 81 New York state high-school biology teachers and their students (a total of 2,532 9th and 10th graders). The experimental group took the Teaching High School Biology course during the summer of 2008. (The control group took the course at a later date.)     To measure the impact of the course on teachers, we assessed teachersÆ knowledge of genetics and evolution concepts, their understanding of how to teach these topics to high-school students, and their awareness of how to use digital resources in the classroom. Then we examined whether teachers who took the course had a greater impact on studentsÆ knowledge of genetics and evolution than did teachers who did not take the course.     Key Findings  Experimental Study: Teachers who took the course increased their knowledge of  genetics and evolution topics; inquiry-based teaching techniques; and use of digital resources in classroom instruction.      This increased knowledge did not result in larger learning gains for their students, compared to a control group of teachers and their students.     Surveys and Teacher Case Studies: In surveys, teachers reported using more digital resources in their teaching following the course. They used these resources&mdash;videos, animations, simulations&mdash;to illustrate difficult concepts and to engage students. Through classroom observations of eight case study teachers, researchers observed that using inquiry-based instructional strategies was more of a challenge.     Blended Learning Supplemental Study: To explore the variety of ways that schools are using online professional development tools combined with in-person supports, we conducted a supplemental study with five local education agencies who use the National Science Teachers Association (NSTA) Learning Center resources. Key informants at study sites viewed online learning at the NSTA Learning Center as an important component of their professional development activities for teachers of science. Its primary function was to enhance teachersÆ knowledge about science content and how to teach critical concepts. The online and face-to-face professional learning activities were relatively distinct.     Implications   The main experimental study demonstrated that Teaching High School Biology, the PBS TeacherLine course that was the focus of this study, had a significant impact on teachersÆ own knowledge, but did not demonstrate that this additional knowledge translated into improved student outcomes.     This online professional development course did not take a "blended" approach to implementation....]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
