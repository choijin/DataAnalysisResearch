<AbstractNarration>University of Arizona: Richard Jorgensen (PI), Gregory Andrews, Kobus Barnard, Susan Brown, Vicki Chandler, Nirav Merchant, Carolyn Napoli, Sudha Ram, Steven Rounsley&lt;br/&gt;Arizona State University: Daniel Stanzione&lt;br/&gt;Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory: Lincoln Stein, Doreen Ware&lt;br/&gt;Purdue University: Rebecca Doerge, &lt;br/&gt;University of North Carolina at Wilmington: Ann Stapleton&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The iPlant Collaborative (iPC) is a new type of organization ? a cyberinfrastructure collaborative for the plant sciences - that enables new conceptual advances through integrative, computational thinking (i.e. thinking at multiple levels of abstraction using a systems-level approach to problem-solving). The iPC is fluid and dynamic, utilizing new computer, computational science and cyberinfrastructure solutions to address an evolving array of grand challenges in the plant sciences.  It is community-driven, involving plant biologists, computer and information scientists and engineers, as well as experts from other disciplines, all working in integrated teams. The iPC brings together strengths in plant biology, bioinformatics, statistics, computer science and high throughput computing, as well as innovative approaches to education, outreach, and the study of social networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several key principles guided the development of the iPC.  Specifically, the iPC:&lt;br/&gt;? is a cyberinfrastructure collaborative rather than purely a cyberinfrastructure,&lt;br/&gt;? will enable multi-disciplinary teams to address grand challenges in plant science,&lt;br/&gt;? will be an entity that is by, for and of the community,&lt;br/&gt;? will train the next generation in computational thinking, and&lt;br/&gt;? is designed to be able to reinvent itself as needs and technologies change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The driving force behind the iPC is the nature of the grand challenge questions in plant sciences, and all facets of the collaborative are organized around those selected questions.  The act of selecting these questions will be community-driven, and to facilitate that, the Collaborative will host a series of workshops, each focused on a specific area of plant biology, but with participants cutting across the spectrum of the computational and biological sciences.  The goal of each workshop will be to identify the grand challenge questions in that field, as well as the necessary strategies and approaches that will be needed to solve the question(s). Self-forming Grand Challenge Teams from the community will then work with iPC personnel to develop a ?Discovery Environment? (DE), which will be a cyberinfrastructure for open-access research and education focused on a grand challenge question.  Over time, the DEs designed for different grand challenges will overlap and coalesce into a comprehensive cyberinfrastructure for discovery and learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cyberinfrastructure created by the iPC will provide the community with two main capabilities: it will provide access to world-class physical infrastructure ? for example persistent storage, and compute power via local and national resources, and it will provide services that promote interactions, communications and collaborations and that advance the understanding and use of computational thinking in plant biology. Through these capabilities, the iPC will catalyze progress in targeted areas of plant biology, and more broadly advance the whole of plant science through new, creative, synthesis activities, and training the next generation of scientists in computational (and collaborative) thinking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the iPC project will not be limited merely to creating the tools for solution of currently intractable grand challenge questions, because at its core the iPC is actually a community building and educational enterprise designed to facilitate education and outreach. Grand Challenge teams and iPC staff will work together to educate students (K-12, undergraduate, and graduate, including members of underrepresented groups) through the use and development of Discovery Environments. Thus, education and outreach efforts will permeate the iPlant Collaborative.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The iPlant Collaborative: A Cyberinfrastructure-Centered Community for a New Plant Biology  In 2008, the National Science Foundation created the iPlant Collaborative (iPlant) to facilitate significant advances in the understanding of plant biology by fostering the development of a diverse, multi-disciplinary community of scientists, teachers, and students applying computational thinking and approaches to Grand Challenge problems in plant biology. The original proposal included five deliverables from which three main strategies were developed and revised as the project matured. The three strategies included: 1) create an extensible cyberinfrastructure (CI) platform for plant biologists, 2) establish mechanisms to engage the plant science research community to solve Grand Challenges, and 3) promote computational thinking across the community.  Creating the Cyberinfrastructure  A principal deliverable of iPlant is a community-extensible generic CI platform to support solutions to major problems in plant biology, and ultimately be useful across all of the life sciences. The CI effort can be thought of in two distinct parts. The first is the components of the core CI, identified and implemented through requirements analysis and community feedback. These components continue to evolve, incorporating input from ongoing activities. The second part is composed of specific tools and science capabilities incorporated into the core CI.   The foundational elements of the core CI include the web accessible Discovery Environment, the iPlant Data Store, Application Programming Interfaces, the cloud computing platform Atmosphere, the image analysis platform Bisque, and the application stack that enables access to large-scale computing resources. Underlying these elements is the computational infrastructure (hardware and networking), as well as the organization to efficiently operate and support them. Each of these elements continues to evolve with new resources and technologies, as the base of tools, workflows, and datasets incorporated into the infrastructure grows.  Engaging the Plant Science Research Community  A major strategy of iPlant is to federate cyberinfrastructure development activities with other major cyberinfrastructure projects, and support smaller projects by enabling them with iPlantÆs CI.  For example, the DOE is investing in a similar cyberinfrastructure project to support efforts at national laboratories focused on sustainable biofuel production. iPlantÆs CI leverages early breakthrough technologies developed by other NSF-funded research groups in the fields of computer science, CI, and biological informatics. iPlantÆs efforts unify and extend these technologies under an easy-to-use platform and brings high performance computing (HPC) and big data management to scientists. Previously biologists relied on computationally savvy collaborators to perform their analysis for them, but with iPlant, they are now empowered to execute the analysis independently. This allows researchers to analyze their growing datasets more efficiently, with greater flexibility, and to address questions that were difficult or impossible before. Two important outcomes of the CI development effort include the Powered by iPlant program and Computational Scaling. Powered by iPlant provides computational support for external scientific computing platforms, enabling both academic and industrial groups to scale their resources as demands grow and focus on delivering scientific discoveries rather than maintaining infrastructure. A prime example of such a project is the Comparative Genomics portal, CoGe (www.genomevolution.org/CoGe).  For Computational Scaling, iPlant works with scientists to restructure or rewrite their software algorithms to scale on larger computational systems. In one example, iPlant scaled a problem that previously would have taken centuries to run to complete in just a few hours (see Figure XY for additional metrics).
