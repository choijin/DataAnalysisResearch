<AbstractNarration>GRADUATE TEACHING FELLOWS IN K-12 EDUCATION&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PROPOSAL #: 0742554&lt;br/&gt;PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Karen Viskupic &lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION: Boise State University&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: Utilizing local resources and educational settings to stimulate K-12 learning&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Boise State University?s Graduate GK-12 Fellows will partner with three local learning centers to develop and deliver educational activities in biology and the geosciences. GK-12 project will use local and regional science issues to stimulate learning in the K-12 community.   K-12 classes that visit the learning centers will use some of the developed activities, while other activities will be used in traditional classroom settings through outreach.  The project will help K-12 students to increase their understanding of science topics, and how those topics relate to their lives, through the use of local and regional themes.  Together, the partner learning centers will serve a total of over 40,000 K-12 students each year, and the project has the potential to affect a large percentage of Idaho students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expected outcomes of the project include: 1) Funding many graduate students? educations, which will allow them to pursue diverse research goals in science fields; 2) The infusion of research-based science and its importance into the consciousness of local students; 3) Training several graduate students in communicating science to non-technical audiences; 4) Enhancement of K-12 students? understanding of science concepts, which may lead to increased interest in pursuing careers in these fields; 5)  Development of educational activities that can be used by teachers and classes not directly participating in the project; and 6) Development of a sustainable collaborative partnership between Boise State University and the K-12 community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Boise State UniversityÆs GK-12 project established a successful model for partnering science graduate students with educators at informal learning centers.  This innovative GK-12 model was purposefully developed with the goal of giving graduate students varied and interdisciplinary teaching experiences in order to maximize development of their communication skills and to reach a large number of K-12 students and teachers, and members of the general public.  Between 2008 and 2014, the project supported 37 graduate students from the departments of Geosciences and Biological Sciences as GK-12 Fellows.  Graduate fellows were partnered with educators at the Foothills Learning Center (years 1-6), the Boise WaterShed Environmental Education Center (years 1-6), the Discovery Center of Idaho (years 1-2), and the Morrison-Knudsen Nature Center (years 3-6) in Boise, Idaho.  These learning centers use their unique location with respect to the local geology, biology, and environment to deliver educational programs in science that are relevant to the community, and the education foci at these learning centers overlap with the research interests of faculty and students at Boise State University.  While working with learning centers, GK-12 Fellows were tasked with development of inquiry-based science lessons that incorporated local or regional themes and the FellowsÆ research interests.  Fellows worked with students in grades preK-12, as well as with community organizations such as scouting groups and master naturalist programs, and with the general public.  Fellows delivered lessons to both large and small groups and in diverse settings that included classrooms at the learning centers, outdoor spaces, trails, streams, a wastewater treatment facility, wetlands, and K-12 classrooms during frequent outreach visits.  Over the course of six years of GK-12 funding, Boise State University GK-12 Fellows interacted with more than 60,000 K-12 students (mostly elementary-school aged), 1,000 teachers, and 5,000 community members.  Providing such a large community of people with access to scientific expertise through the GK-12 Fellows is a hallmark of Boise StateÆs GK-12 project, as this aspect differed substantially from many other GK-12 programs where Fellows were primarily partnered with a single classroom teacher.  Evaluation findings show that the project has lasting impacts on the Fellows, the partner learning centers, and on Boise State University.  Fellows exhibit increased confidence when teaching science lessons, improved ability to communicate complex scientific concepts with non-science audiences, greater understanding of the requirements of K-12 teaching, enhanced perception of the social relevance of science, deepened understanding of science concepts outside of their own disciplines, a commitment to continued teaching/outreach as part of their scientific careers, and increased understanding of how their research relates to real world problems and local communities.  In comparison to their graduate student colleagues, GK-12 Fellows are involved to a greater extent in educational outreach activities both during and after their years at Boise State.  The partner learning centers also were beneficiaries of the GK-12 project.  Reported benefits include being able to serve a greater number of schools and students, expansion into previously unreached populations such as high schools, increased diversity of programs through the development of new lessons by the Fellows, improvement of existing programs and lessons through updated science content and classroom equipment, increased scientific knowledge by the learning center staff through interaction with the Fellows, enhanced networking among the partner learning centers, and better connections with Boise State University.  The benefits to Boise State University from the GK-12 project include expansion of interdisciplinary graduate programs and enhanced faculty collaboration, improved training for...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
