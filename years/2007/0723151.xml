<AbstractNarration>This award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program (MRI) provides funds for the acquisition and technical support of a Multi-Collector Thermal Ionization Mass Spectrometer (MC-TIMS) for isotopic research in the Earth and Planetary Sciences Department (EAPS) at Northwestern University (NU). The acquisition of the MC-TIMS coincides with the establishment of a new analytical facility in the EAPS Department that will support functionalities in isotope (radiogenic and stable), aqueous, organic, and sedimentary geochemistry. Within this complex, the MC-TIMS will be the primary research tool in the Radiogenic Isotope Laboratory, which will encompass a clean laboratory for sample preparation and a climate-controlled instrument room. The MC-TIMS will benefit a cross-disciplinary community of faculty and students at NU and other Chicago-area institutions, including the University of Chicago and the University of Illinois-Chicago. A comprehensive management plan will ensure the efficient and cost-effective operation of the instrument by internal and external users. Emphasis will be placed on the measurement of Ca, Nd, Re, Os, Sr, Th, and U isotope abundance variations to support single investigator and collaborative research activities in the areas of aqueous geochemistry, ground and surface water hydrology, chemical oceanography, paleoceanography, geomicrobiology, cosmochemistry, chemostratigraphy, and climate change, both modern and ancient. Graduate and undergraduate students will use the MC-TIMS to accomplish NSF-funded research, and the PI will directly integrate the instrument into courses featuring the theory and practice of radiogenic isotope geochemistry. Research and teaching activities employing the MC-TIMS will also include minority students from Evanston Township High School who are participating in project EXCITE at NU. The goal of EXCITE is to increase the number of underrepresented minorities majoring in science, engineering, mathematics, and technology at the college level. Lastly, the PI plans to create a radiogenic isotope intern program drawing from a consortium of 17 Chicago-area 2- and 4-year colleges whose student body is comprised of traditionally underrepresented groups. Interns will gain hands on experience with the MC-TIMS. Opportunities exist for interns to matriculate into the EAPS graduate program with the aid of special fellowships and scholarships offered by The Graduate School at NU.</AbstractNarration>
