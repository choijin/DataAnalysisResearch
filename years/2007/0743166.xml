<AbstractNarration>Males and females within species often differ dramatically in size and shape, a phenomenon known as sexual dimorphism. This project asks how such dimorphisms can arise despite the substantively identical genomes of males and females. It tests the hypothesis that sexually dimorphic traits are particularly influenced by genes on the sex chromosomes (sex-linked genes), using water striders as a model system. A novel experimental breeding design will enable the investigators to measure the influence of sex-linked genes on a suite of traits ranging from sexually monomorphic, through sexually dimorphic to sex-limited (found only in males). A major advance of this research is quantifying aspects of genetic variance that have been conflated in all previous investigations of sex-linked effects. The results will reveal the genetic mechanisms that allow response to sexually-divergent selection and, more generally, will increase our understanding of the functionality of sex-chromosomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, this research will contribute new statistical algorithms for genetic analyses and these will be incorporated into a software package for dissemination. The project also provides research opportunities for many graduate and undergraduate students, contributes pedagogical materials for outreach and non-specialist courses, and supports a specialized research infrastructure that draws national and international collaborators.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In species with two sexes, the distinct traits of each sex arise from a genome that is largely shared between sexes.  In many species, including humans, the development of distinct sexual morphologies is orchestrated by genes on sex-chromosomes which initiate cascades of sex-specific patterns of gene expression throughout the genome.  While these patterns are readily studied by the techniques of genomics, such studies cannot determine how much of the variance in trait values at the phenotypic level is caused by variation in genes on sex chromosomes (called sex-linked genes).  How important are sex-chromosomes in determining the variation among individuals in primary and secondary sexual traits?  The research supported by this grant addresses this question using the techniques of quantitative genetics.  Principal investigators Daphne Fairbairn and Derek Roff first developed a novel, multi-generational breeding design that enabled them to separate sex-linked effects from other genetic effects.  They then applied this design to an insect species, the water strider Aquarius remigis, in which sexual differences for 16 morphological traits had been well characterized.  As preparation for their analyses, the investigators also developed new statistical techniques for extracting components of genetic variance from various breeding designs and from pedigrees of wild populations.  These methodological advances contribute broadly to the field of evolutionary genetics.  The team also developed new guidelines for determining the repeatability of measurement data that will improve experimental designs across many disciplines.  The breeding experiment produced a final data set consisting of measurements of 15 &ndash; 16 traits in &gt;3000 water striders across three generations.  Analysis of these data is incomplete but preliminary results indicate that sex-linked genes contribute significantly to the phenotypic and genetic variance for 19% of traits in males and 27% of traits in females, and that the pattern and magnitude of sex-linked effects differs greatly both among traits and between sexes.   More refined and novel analyses incorporating dosage compensation and non-additive genetic effects are in progress and will provide an unprecedented evaluation of the impact of sex-linked genes on sex-specific patterns of phenotypic variation.     Major Outcomes:  Development and publication of a novel experimental design to measure sex-linked variance. Development and dissemination of new software to extract sex-linked variance from pedigree data (available in ASReml3). Development of novel theory, methods and software to detect the effects of dosage compensation on the expression of sex-linked genes using pedigree data (paper in preparation).  Development and publication of general guidelines for researchers estimating repeatability, a widely-used statistic for quantifying variation amongst repeated measures. Initiation of collaborations with researchers from the UK and France who are interested in using the methods and software developed for this project. Provision of research training for 6 graduate students.   Provision of research training and mentoring for 21 undergraduate students in the biological sciences, including 12 women, one African American and five Hispanic students. Involvement of graduate students in mentoring undergraduate research students. Provision of equipment and facilities for graduate and undergraduate research projects in addition to the funded research. This includes maintenance of three walk-in environmental chambers, specialized laboratory equipment for rearing and maintaining semi-aquatic insects, and computers and microscopes for taking digital measurements of insect morphological structures.  Presentation of the new methods and research results at national and international scientific conferences by both the principal investigators and graduate students  Creation of novel estimates of the proportion of phenotypic...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
