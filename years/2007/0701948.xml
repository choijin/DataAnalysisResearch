<AbstractNarration>****NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The behavior of systems composed of electrons interacting with other electrons can change dramatically when confined to spatial dimensions less than the familiar three dimensions in which we live.  For example, in a two-dimensional world, placing the interacting electrons in a very strong magnetic field creates unusual matter, which contains new entities with a fraction of the electron charge.  Moreover these new entities, called "quasi-particles," behave neither as particles of light (photons) nor as electrons.  Photons are bosons, and bosons like to aggregate, making it possible to build lasers.  However, electrons like to avoid each other; leading to the known quantum-mechanical behaviors of solids such as conductors, semiconductors, and insulators. The new quasi-particles are neither bosons nor fermions, and obey a new type of quantum statistical behavior called fractional statistics.  Using specially created semiconductor devices this project will probe the electrical conduction properties of these unique systems.  A related topic will be the study of new states of matter with a new type of ordering, very different from familiar ordering such as the alignment of spins, responsible for the magnetism in iron.  Understanding these new behaviors may enable us to design new types of superconductors, and pave the way to more robust quantum computers, which are much less sensitive to environmental interference.  Additionally very narrow one-dimensional superconducting wires will be investigated to ascertain their robustness, providing a better understanding of their potential application as interconnects in ultra dense circuitry.  Graduate and undergraduate students working on these projects will be trained in state-of-the-art semiconductor processing, and on ultra sensitive electrical measurements, to prepare them for careers in academia or industry.  At the same time, the outreach component will introduce K-12 students to important concepts such as charge, current, spins, superconductivity, and statistics of particles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;**** TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program seeks to elucidate unusual properties of correlated electronic systems in reduced dimensions.  Such systems are created in special devices on the cleaved-edge of semiconductor crystals.  The emergence of new properties, such as fractional statistics of fractionally-charged quasi-particles, and unusual underlying quantum orders of correlated states, will be investigated.  In the two-dimensional fractional quantum Hall states, measuring the temporal correlation of the noise in the electrical currents injected into different collectors from a single coherent source is expected to yield evidence indicative of fractional statistics, intermediate between the familiar bosonic and fermionic statistic in three-dimensional systems for photons and electrons, respectively.  Alternatively, studying the magnetic field period of the Aharonov-Bohm quantum interference modulation could reveal unusual topological quantum orders in the wave functions of the Pfaffian fractional quantum Hall states.  Uncovering such properties helps bring a greater understanding of a new type of superconductivity termed "anyon superconductivity," and may enable future realization of topological quantum computation, a scheme largely free from decoherence effects.  Additionally, very narrow one-dimensional superconducting wires will be investigated to probe the existence of new quantum phase transitions.  Investigating the behaviors of ultra narrow superconducting wires will provide a better understanding for their potential application as interconnects in ultra dense circuitry.  Graduate students and undergraduate students will be trained in state-of-the-art semiconductor processing and ultra sensitive electrical measurements.  The training received will prepare them for careers in academia or industry.  At the same time, the outreach component will introduce pre-college students to modern concepts such as quantum mechanics and statistics of particles.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This program focuses on 1-dimensional (1D) systems of electrons.  We live in a 3D world.  A 1D object would have no width or height, and only a length.  Imagine two 1D objects living on a line.  They cannot get past one another, and their movement is very restricted.  Fortunately, for tiny objects like an electron, they live in the quantum-mechanical world.  Here, 1D means something a bit different.  Quantum mechanics tells us that energy levels can become discretized, with finite jumps between successively higher energy levels. Let's imagine one of the directions, say the height is small (low), such as a very low "ceiling."  In this direction, there is a lowest energy level, called the ground state.  Above this ground state, the amount of extra energy to reach the next level is large. As we approach absolute zero in temperature, there isn't enough thermal agitation for an electron to reach the next level.  It is stuck in the ground state, and no longer has any freedom in this height direction.  Thus, the electron now lives in a 2D world with free movement in the width and length directions.  If the width direction is also small, the electron lives in a 1D world.  Quantum mechanics also enable electrons in this 1D world to get past each other, and to influence each other through their Coulomb repulsion, as well as other of means of interaction.  This program explores several aspects of 1D electron physics including: (a) superconductivity, (b) formation of a crystal lattice and its precursors, and (c) exotic particles made from electrons, living in 2D, but carrying fractional units of electron charge.  These fractional charges travel along the 1D edges of the 2D system, and possess unusual properties.  Projects (a) and (c) utilize specialized cleaved-edge crystals.  Elementary particles, such as an electron, or photon (light particle) come in two varieties: Fermions (e.g. electrons), or Bosons (e.g. photons).  Fermions of the same sort obey Pauli exclusion and avoid each other, while Bosons like to come together.  Electrons give us the properties of metals, semiconductors, and insulators, encountered in everyday life.  Bosons, in particular, photons, give as the laser, and also superconductors, when 2 electrons pair up to form a Boson called a Cooper pair.  Superconductors in 1D differ from 3D in that it is much easier to scramble the coherence of the Cooper pairs.  The Cooper pairs must all oscillate together to form the superconducting state.  By studying the ability of very thin 1D aluminum nanowires (22 atoms across and 22 atoms tall), we are looking to find new quantum-mechanical behaviors, such as the tunneling of a large number of coherent Cooper pairs, called macroscopic-quantum-tunneling (http://today.duke.edu/2011/09/alnanowires).  In Fig. 1, we show an electron microscope picture of a typical nanowire approximately 8 nanometers in diameter, and its current carrying properties.  This is 10,000 times smaller than the thickness of a human hair.  Understanding how much current a superconducting nanowire can carry will help us utilize them as interconnections to reduce heating in future large scale computer chips.  Other nanowire applications include qubits for quantum computation.  Separately, we investigate the possibility that electrons in 1D can line up, to form a lattice, a bit like an ice crystal or salt (NaCl) crystal, but in 1D instead of 3D.  A dilute collection of electrons may prefer to form a lattice at low temperatures, because they have like charge and repel each other.  By forming a lattice, they can avoid getting close to each other.  Nevertheless, because electrons are very light, quantum mechanics tells us that they like to move around due to zero-point motion.  This crystal, called a Wigner crystal, is quantum-mechanical in nature, and electrons must overcome the zero-point motion to stay in place.  In Fig. 2 inset, we display an electron microscope picture of a device in a semiconductor material calle...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
