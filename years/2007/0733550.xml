<AbstractNarration>The University of Illinois at Chicago exploratory proposal builds on major accomplishments of the Chicago Math and Science Initiative (CMSI), and on a previously NSF/Educational System Reform-funded project. Its overarching goal is to contribute to the capacity of urban school districts and educational researchers to work collaboratively in the effective planning, implementation, scale-up, adaptation, documentation, and evaluation of systemic reform in mathematics and science education. Specifically, the proposal aims at (1) producing new knowledge that (a) contributes to current understanding of the mechanisms involved in reforming mathematics and science education systematically in the context of a large urban district, (b) elaborates a model for effective communicating and collaboration among key stakeholders, and (c) bridges the practice/research divide in mathematics and science educational reform; (2) sharing and communication findings that have relevance and utility to those engaged with policy and practice, such as educational planners, administrators, educational researchers, and evaluators; and (3) leveraging future collaborations and communication among those engaged in practice, policy, and research on mathematics and science education. In order to accomplish these goals and objectives, the proposal will conduct a multidimensional study that draws on a body of high-quality, quantitative and qualitative longitudinal empirical data documenting systemic reform efforts over five years of the Chicago Public Schools' efforts to reform K-12 STEM education from the stages of design, planning, and initial implementation through scale-up and adaptation (e.g., from district policy level to implementation of curricular materials in classrooms).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research is based on a four-dimensional model of issues critical to STEM systemic reform: (1) levels of reform and systems approach (district, school, teachers, and students), (2) scaling-up (depth, spread, and ownership), (3) maintenance across time (context, flexibility, and sustainability), and (4) cross-cutting issues related to challenges and supports for changing practices (accountability/controls, participation/motivation, learning/sense making, relations/trust, and allocation/equity). Longitudinal data inventories addressing these constructs are: (1) system and district level (staff and instructional leader interviews and focus groups), (2) school level (longitudinal in-depth case studies, studies of curricula implementation, principals' interviews), (3) teacher level (surveys and classroom observations), and (4) student level (classroom observations, logs of instructional practice, and district student achievement records). Data analysis will look at both impact of the reform and processes by which innovations are brought to scale. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
