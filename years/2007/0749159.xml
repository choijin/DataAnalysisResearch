<AbstractNarration>This research focuses on the experiences of members of disadvantaged groups.  It begins with the idea that the reports of experiences with prejudice and discrimination are related to the extent to which individuals identify with their group.   This project examines whether strongly and weakly identified group members experience different amounts of actual prejudice from members of advantaged groups. The first set of studies examines whether White Americans express more prejudice toward strongly identified ethnic and racial minorities than weakly identified minorities.  The second set of studies examines how members of two disadvantaged group (women pursuing doctoral degrees in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math fields and ethnic minorities) behave when they are in high status positions and have the opportunity to help or harm fellow ingroup members.  To this end, an additional aim of this project is to examine the implications of this effect for diversity-related outcomes and to consider how identification may affect group members' behaviors inside and outside of the group.  This research has important theoretical implications for advancing research on group identity and prejudice. This research also has substantial societal implications for understanding prejudice and discrimination and for achieving diversity in domains where women and minorities are underrepresented.</AbstractNarration>
