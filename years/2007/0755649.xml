<AbstractNarration>CBET-0755649&lt;br/&gt;Oscar Ruiz&lt;br/&gt;Inter American University of Puerto Rico San Juan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mercury (Hg) is a very toxic environmental pollutant and there is an urgent need for its cleanup. Current physicochemical methods for Hg remediation are very expensive and ineffective. Although current phytoremediation approaches can remove Hg from the polluted areas, they release elemental-Hg back into the atmosphere where it may be accumulated and converted back into more toxic forms. The proposed approach would be to genetically engineer plants to accumulate Hg inside their tissues in a form that is inert and easy to recover. Such a plant would be harvested from the restored site and the Hg recovered could even be sold back into the market. A phytoremediation system that effectively removes Hg from a contaminated environment and that at the same time assists in supplying the demand of Hg, presents a very attractive and cost-effective bioremediation tool. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Inter American University of Puerto Rico is a private, non-profit, hispanic-serving higher education institution in an EPSCoR jurisdiction, where a large portion of the student body comes from low income families. This research project will provide the opportunity for minority students to experience work in a research environment under direct mentorship. This opportunity will provide the methodological and analytical skills to become successful professionals and scientists helping secure the pipeline of research-trained scientists. Finally, the long term impact is that this phytoremediation system might allow sustainable and cost-effective use of metals and a healthier environment. The use of plants for the remediation of toxic metals is a new field of study that, when combined with cutting-edge genetic engineering technologies and genomics, can produce novel systems for effective restoration of contaminated environments.</AbstractNarration>
