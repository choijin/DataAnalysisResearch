<AbstractNarration>The objective of this GOALI award is to develop the "intelligent" friction stir processes (FSP) and advance the fundamental understanding of the material deformation and alloying in FSP.  Working together with Ford Motor Company, the GOALI collaborator, this research can improve the shape, quality, and strength of the spot friction welding (SFW) joint for light-weight aluminum automotive body structure.  A novel idea to apply the FSP for addition or building of material will also be investigated.  Experimental analysis will enable better understanding of the bulk- and alloy material mixing and flow in the friction stir zone.  The intelligent spindle with temperature and force sensing capability will be adopted in this research.  Using advanced in-process monitoring and control of temperature and force can optimize the SFW process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this research can lead to three additional broad impacts of FSP.  First is the friction stir repair of cracks.  Current friction stir welding leaves a hole of the tool tip shape after retracting from the surface.  Using the material additive process, the hole can be filled and components with cracks can be repaired, possibly on-site.  Second, this process can potentially lead to FSP-based rapid prototyping to build functional part from simple geometry.  Third, small batch of new alloy materials can be generated under the large deformation and high temperature in the friction stir zone.  This research will have close collaboration with the Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University of South Africa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This report summarizes a successful National Science Foundation Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) project in collaboration with the Ford Motor Company on the stir friction welding of light-weight aluminum automotive structure for fuel-efficient vehicle applications.  We have completed the research to enable a strong joint between two aluminum sheet metal parts by adding the metal powder as an additive while using a tool to mechanically stir in a point.  The metal powder is mixed with the aluminum material and creates the reinforcement for the joint. It enhances both the strength and ductility of the spot friction welding (SFW) aluminum joint.  This project also established close collaboration with the Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University at Port Elizabeth, South Africa with faculty and student exchange on research tasks in the real-time sensing of SFW process.  This project has supported three PhD students during their study, including Dr. Scott Miller (currently Assistant Professor at University of Hawaii Manoa), Dr. Senthil Arul (currently with US Department of Navy, Washington, DC), and Dr. Carl McGill and several Master and undergraduate students.  Ford Motor Company has provided the support of SFW machines and materials during the study.  We have demonstrated the technical feasibility for SFW for aluminum light-weight automotive structure in production.  More specifically, this research has five accomplishments.  First, the powder metal matrix composite reinforcement in SFW has been demonstrated.  Second, the temperature in SFW of aluminum has been measured and correlated to the strength of SFW joint.  Third, the influence of process parameters on SFW joint strength is quantified.  Fourth, the effect of specimen geometry on SFW joint strength and failure mode is investigated.  And, finally, the effective of lubricant existing on the aluminum blank on the SFW joint strength is studied and demonstrated the importance of cleaning the aluminum blank before the SFW process in production on joint strength.  In summary, this research successfully demonstrated a simple and novel joining process for the light-weight automotive manufacturing.
