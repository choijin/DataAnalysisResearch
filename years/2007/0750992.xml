<AbstractNarration>One of goals in Cyber-Infrastructure project is for people to have ability&lt;br/&gt;of doing remote data gathering and remote scientific experiments efficiently. This demands high-speed communication networks with mobile connectivity and flexible deployment. The wireless access network on top of the optical core network is an important ideal architecture for such a target. Indeed, the optical network in core provides the efficient high-speed communication with high bandwidth and the wireless network in access provides mobile communication with flexible deployment. The advantage of fiber-optical backbone network&lt;br/&gt;combined with wireless technology has gained more and more interests in the study of the next generation communication networks. One of important issues is the optimal resource management. The increasing need of mission-critical traffic and real-time traffic from businesses and individuals has made the computer communication network grow very rapidly. Today there are a large amount of network resources and also a large amount of traffic. Therefore, efficient utilization of network resources becomes a very important task, which has impact in survivability, energy efficiency, and quality of service (QoS).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We propose an integrated research project that studies various optimization problems on (a) resilience schemes, including protection and restoration &lt;br/&gt;schemes, for optical wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) networks to survive from failures with efficient utilization of network resource and less service disruption, (b) sensors' active/sleep schedules for the wireless sensor networks to achieve longer lifetime or energy efficiency, and (c) tradeoff between two layers to achieve multi-layer optimization.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
