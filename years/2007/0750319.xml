<AbstractNarration>The focus of this project is on the total synthesis of the phomactin family of natural products.   Specifically this involves the synthesis of Phomactins A, B, B1, C, D, E, F, G and H, all platelet activating factor antagonists.  The two key steps in the strategy involve the cyclohexadienone annulation reaction of Fischer carbene complexes with alkynes and the ring closing metathesis reaction with Grubbs carbene complexes.  Since most of the phomactins have not been previously synthesized, the conversion of the key bicyclo[9.3.1]pentadecane to each of the targets will require the exploration of new territory and undoubtedly the development of new chemistry as well as the testing of hypotheses formulated from a consideration of probable biosynthetic pathways.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Professor William D. Wulff in the Department of Chemistry at Michigan State University.  Professor Wulff's research efforts are concentrated on the development of the chemistry of Fischer carbene complexes for the advancement of the field of organic synthesis.  The successful development of the proposed chemistry will contribute to the discovery and production of new products with societal benefits by the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and agrochemical industries.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The most important aspects of the work supported by this grant were the results associated with the synthesis of aziridines.  Aziridines are nitrogen containing compounds that are highly useful in the synthesis of a wide variety of organic compounds.  In particular, we have developed asymmetric methods which deliver single enantiomers of aziridines and the work supported by this grant has shown definitively that our method is the most widely useful of all methods that have been developed in the past.  The structure and nature of the chemical catalyst, or chemzyme (as opposed to a biological enzyme catalyst), has also been determined.  The chemzyme is composed of a very novel boroxinate core that has not appeared in asymmetric chemical catalysts before.  It was also shown in the work supported by this grant that the aziridination reaction could be controlled not only to give individual enantiomers of the aziridines, but also individual diastereomers as well.  A combination of X-ray structural studies and computational analysis of the aziridination reaction has yielded a good deal of information on how this asymmetric aziridination reaction works. The chemzyme was shown to be an anionic species that binds to its substrate by hydrogen bonding.  Aziridines are important compounds for the preparation of alpha-amino acids which occur in a wide variety of food supplements and pharmaceutical agents.  Aziridines can be used to access a number of different types of nitrogen containing compounds other than alpha-amino acids in single enantiomeric forms.  This thus greatly broadens the scope of different pharmaceutical agents that thus become accessible by the aziridination reaction developed by this grant.  The utility was demonstrated in the synthesis of L-methyldopa, an antihypertensive agent used in the treatment of high blood pressure, especially gestational hypertension.   A new finding from the work supported by this grant is that the same chemzyme can be used to prepare homoallyic amines as single enantiomers in a different class of reaction known as an aza-Cope rearrangement.  In this case useful levels of production of only one enantiomer of the product only occurred if the catalyst was modified by the addition of one molecule of benzoic acid.  This class of amines should be useful for the synthesis of a number of different important biologically active molecules and this was demonstrated in the synthesis of coniine, the hemlock alkaloid.
