<AbstractNarration>Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;This project would fund the acquisition of an X-ray diffractometer equipped with imaging to enhance research and training infrastructure at Louisiana Tech University (LaTech), Grambling State University (GSU) (a historically Black university) and the University of Louisiana at Monroe (ULM) as well as other universities in the surrounding area.  Fifteen faculty members from the three institutions are involved in the project as either PI, Co-PI or Other Investigator.  The project will support currently funded NSF projects in the topics of drug delivery and release, lithography of conducting polymers, and hydrogen storage materials.  Also, research projects currently supported by DARPA and the Louisiana State Board of Regents will also take advantage of the acquisition of this instrument.  The instrument will be used for routine phase identification, microdiffraction and will be equipped with a heating stage for carrying out in-situ phase transformation studies.  Diffraction signals may be collected from spatial regions of 10 m up to 100 m.  The heating stage reaches to temperatures of 900oC in air and in controlled atmosphere.  In its early arrival to the Institute for Micromanufacturing (IfM) at Louisiana Tech University, the instrument will be used for several projects in Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Applied Physics (GSU researchers), Electrical Engineering, Pharmacy (ULM researchers), and Chemistry.  Planned use for the instrument includes:  (1) to assess the uniformity of functional groups or nanomaterials coated onto microcantilever sensor arrays for defining selectivity and sensitivity; (2) to characterize halloysite clay films used for drug delivery and release; (3) to understand phase distributions in TiCl3-doped NaAlH4 hydrogen storage systems; (4) to characterize sol-gel synthesized lead zirconate titanate (PZT) for tamper resistant MEMS sensors; (5) to assess amounts of amorphous phase present during the powder processing of chronorelevant drug delivery systems; (6) to understand phase changes during the anneal of FePt nanoparticles for magnetic storage media applications; (7) to understand the crystallinity of various nanowires and nanotubes prepared using the template wetting technique; and (8) to characterize phase distribution in concrete which has been strengthened with nanoparticles using electrokinetic osmosis.  Acquisition of this instrument will have a strong impact on the continuing expansion of micro and nanotechnology oriented research and educational efforts at LaTech, GSU, ULM, and neighboring institutions.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;This project would fund the acquisition of an instrument for studying atom-to-atom distances in solid phase materials.  This state-of-the-art instrument will be equipped with microscopic imaging to elucidate the region of sample from which the measurement is to be collected.  Although the microscopic imaging supplied with this instrument does not permit the direct visualization of atoms and their arrangement, the instrument is equipped with an operating mode, called diffraction, which permits observation of individual atomic arrangements. Overall, the acquisition of this instrument will enhance the research and training infrastructure at Louisiana Tech University (LaTech), Grambling State University (GSU) (a historically Black university) and the University of Louisiana at Monroe (ULM) as well as universities in the surrounding area.  Fifteen faculty members from the three institutions are involved in the project as either PI, Co-PI or Other Investigator.  Researchers will be able to use the X-ray diffractometer for routine materials identification and, in some cases, may use the microscopic imaging option for specifying a 'region-of-interest' (ROI) from which to acquire the atomic arrangement information.  Since the instrument will be equipped with a heating stage, atomic rearrangements occurring at elevated temperatures can be observed in real time.  In its early arrival to the Institute for Micromanufacturing (IfM) at Louisiana Tech University, the instrument will be used for several projects in Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Applied Physics (GSU researchers), Electrical Engineering, Pharmacy (ULM researchers), and Chemistry.  Plans for the instrument includes its use:  (1) for improving selectivity and sensitivity of sensors; (2) for drug delivery and controlled drug release research; (3) to understand hydrogen storage systems to support 'clean' energy alternatives;  (6) for magnetic storage media applications; and (7) for studying a process with strengthens concrete (after its initial use and wear) by inserting very fine particles into its pores and cracks.  Acquisition of this instrument will have a strong impact on the continuing expansion of research and educational efforts at LaTech, GSU, ULM, and neighboring institutions.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
