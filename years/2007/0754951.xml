<AbstractNarration>This award, for a new Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site, &lt;br/&gt;builds a Supercomputing Undergraduate Program in Maine (SuperMe). This &lt;br/&gt;new site provides ten-week summer research experiences at the University &lt;br/&gt;of Maine (UMaine) for ten undergraduates each year for three years. With &lt;br/&gt;integrated expertise of ten faculty researchers from both computer &lt;br/&gt;systems and domain applications, SuperMe allows each undergraduate to &lt;br/&gt;conduct meaningful research, such as developing supercomputing techniques &lt;br/&gt;and tools, and solving cutting-edge research problems through parallel &lt;br/&gt;computing and scientific visualization. Besides being actively involved &lt;br/&gt;in research groups, students attend weekly seminars given by faculty &lt;br/&gt;mentors, formally report and present their research experiences and &lt;br/&gt;results, conduct field trips, and interact with ITEST, RET and GK-12 &lt;br/&gt;participants. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SuperMe provides scientific exploration ranging from engineering to &lt;br/&gt;sciences with a coherent intellectual focus on supercomputing. It &lt;br/&gt;consists of four computer systems projects that aim to improve &lt;br/&gt;techniques in grid computing, parallel I/O data accesses, &lt;br/&gt;high-resolution scientific visualization and information security, &lt;br/&gt;and five computer modeling projects that utilize world-class &lt;br/&gt;supercomputing and visualization facilities housed at UMaine to &lt;br/&gt;perform large, complex simulation experiments and data analysis in &lt;br/&gt;different science domains. SuperMe provides a diversity of cutting-edge &lt;br/&gt;research opportunities to students from under-represented groups or from &lt;br/&gt;universities in rural areas with limited research opportunities. Through &lt;br/&gt;interacting directly with the participant of existing programs at UMaine, &lt;br/&gt;including ITEST, RET and GK-12, REU students disseminates their research &lt;br/&gt;results and experiences to middle and high school students and teachers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership &lt;br/&gt;with the NSF REU Site program.</AbstractNarration>

Our REU program has successfully attracted female applicants, minority students, and applicants from relatively small colleges with limited supercomputing resources.

In the past three years, we have received over 200 applications while we can only accept 30 students (10 each year, including 5 UMaine and 5 non-UMaine).  Our REU participants include eight female students, and six minorities (only one female minority).  Among 15 external participants from outside of UMaine, eight participants were from small colleges that only offer bachelor degrees and two were from colleges whose highest degree offered is master.  As a result, 66% of our external participants were from small colleges with very limited research resources and opportunities.  Our program has made positive changes to students' self-efficacy and attitudes toward scientific based on pre- and post- survey, as shown below.
