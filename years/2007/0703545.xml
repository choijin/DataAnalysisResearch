<AbstractNarration>AST-0507561&lt;br/&gt;James Lombardi&lt;br/&gt;Vassar College&lt;br/&gt;Modeling Stellar Exotica in Dense Star Clusters&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;A collaborative project between Vassar College and Northwestern University will be undertaken&lt;br/&gt;which will explore the effects of magnetic fields during close interactions between stars as are likely&lt;br/&gt;to take place frequently in dense stellar environments (e.g., the cores of globular clusters). Such&lt;br/&gt;interactions not only determine the fate of these clusters but are also believed to be the origin of&lt;br/&gt;exotic objects such as blue stragglers, binary pulsars, and x-ray sources. The investigators and&lt;br/&gt;students at Vassar will use a 3D smoothed particle hydrodynamics code developed under previous&lt;br/&gt;NSF funding and complete its adaptation to include magnetic fields (a 3D smoothed particle&lt;br/&gt;magnetohydrodynamic code). This new tool will then be used to simulate stellar collisions/mergers&lt;br/&gt;among a variety of types of stars (main-sequence, subgiant, red giant, and stellar remnants).&lt;br/&gt;Specific topics that will be addressed include stellar collisions in globular clusters (and the origins&lt;br/&gt;of blue stragglers, i.e., collisions versus mergers), binary mergers, and common envelope evolution.&lt;br/&gt;Included in this project is significant involvement by students with the goal of setting up self -sustaining student research programs (in which new students are trained by seniors). There is also&lt;br/&gt;the opportunity for students at either school to become involved in collaborations with&lt;br/&gt;students/postdoctoral fellows/faculty at the other. Likewise, useful skills in programming,&lt;br/&gt;modeling, hydrodynamics/fluid mechanics, etc., will be developed among the participants.</AbstractNarration>
