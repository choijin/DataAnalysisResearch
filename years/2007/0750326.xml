<AbstractNarration>Srinivasan Iyengar of Indiana University is supported by an award from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program for work to develop a combination quantum wavepacket molecular dynamics technique for the simulation of vibrational events in hydrogen bonded systems. The system Iyengar is developing is known as the quantum wavepacket ab initio molecular dynamics, or QWAIMD, method and is being applied to the study of vibrational properties of hydrogen bonded clusters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the most challenging issues in modern theoretical chemistry is determining the proper way to combine the inherently quantum mechanical description of molecules with the description of a molecule's motion, which involves classical mechanics.  This work is addressing that issue and, if successful, will have a wide impact on the development of proper descriptions of a number of important application topics including tunnelling effects in biological systems and hydrogen transfer in fuel cells.  The work is, thus, expected to have a broader impact on both biology and materials science and through the PI's extensive outreach work to under-represented students at area high schools.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Outcome 1:  Understanding complex molecular vibrations under a range of temperature conditions  Significance: Molecular vibrations provide detailed information about molecular geometries and chemical bond strengts. Together these have been used to understand properties in a large number of systems including those of interest in biological and materials (energy research related) chemistry.  Special experimental techniques are required to gauge these molecular vibrations. This is because molecules vibrate at the rate of a trillion times in one second. As a result, a range of experimental techniques have been developed over the years to probe molecular properties under different conditions. In many cases the results obtained from these experiments can be quite complex. One major focus area in our pertains to developing new computational methods based on quantum mechanics, to understand and predict such properties.  Impact: Through these efforts we have been successful in developing a number of new analysis tools to understand the complex behavior of molecular systems under different temperature conditions.Fig. 1 displays one such set of analysis tools. The systems shown here contain a fundamental interaction, known as the hydrogen bond, that is common in biological and materials chemistry. Detailed understanding of such systems will have a significant impact in impact in biologicalchemistry and materials science. Outcome 2: Electron transport through molecular wire systems  Significance: Electron transport between a donor and an acceptor mediated by a bridgemolecule to facilitate electron transfer, has a fundamental role in a many areas. These include: biological redox reactions where electron transport through an intervening bridge molecule iscentral to photosynthesis, advanced materials where molecular nano-electronics has now come to fore withpotential applications in problems such as sensors, photonics, electro-catalysis and solar photo-conversion,charge transfer systems in DNA and large biomolecules and atmospheric and condensed phase systems wheresolvated electron chemistry plays a critical role. In materials science and chemistry, molecular electronics hasemerged as a thrust area and this is triggered partly by the possibility of the silicon based electronic chip-technology tending to its inherent physical limitations and through novel developments in nano-fabrication methods.  In molecular electronics, the donor-bridge-acceptor electron transfer problem is complicated. Here an external bias converts the molecular wire junction into one where electrons enter and leave the bridge molecule. Hence the identity of the electrons in the molecule do not remain the same. Such a process is called a non-equilibrium, open-system flow process and presents a serious challenge for quantum mechanical theories.  The Iyengar group has developed a new computational method to study such problems. The method iscalled multi-stage ab initio wavepacket dynamics (MSAIWD) and is illustrated in Figs. 2 with an animation at: http://www.indiana.edu/~ssiweb/outbox/MS-AIWD/animations/molelec/narrow-3000K-dens-stages-1fs.mpg.  Impact: Since the approach developed in the Iyengar group rigorously accounts for the open system problemsdiscussed above, this method will in future have impact through its applications to a variety of problems inmolecular electronics, solar energy research and biological systems research. Outcome 3: Modeling complex systems through simultaneous dynamical treatment of electrons and nuclei  Significance: The simultaneous dynamical treatment of electrons and nuclei is one of the major challenges in theoretical chemistry. This problem is complicated by the fact that in several biological and atmospheric reactions, not only electrons, even light nuclei such as hydrogen display quantum behavior. A good example of this problem is seen in the hydrogen transfer dynamics involved in an enzyme called Soybean Lipoxygenase-1, that has been p...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
