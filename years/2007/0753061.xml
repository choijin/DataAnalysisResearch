<AbstractNarration>0716511&lt;br/&gt;Rebecca Wright&lt;br/&gt;Stevens Institute of Technology&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;0716564&lt;br/&gt;Aaron Jaggard&lt;br/&gt;Tulane University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Collaborative Research: CT-ISG: Mitigating Exploits of the Current&lt;br/&gt;Interdomain-Routing Infrastructure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses fundamental flaws in Internet-routing&lt;br/&gt;infrastructure using both theoretical analysis and practical tools.&lt;br/&gt;The results not only improve the security of the current Internet, but&lt;br/&gt;also advance principles of secure routing design useful for&lt;br/&gt;next-generation protocols.  The project advocates a different approach&lt;br/&gt;than previous work in this area by formally defining comprehensive&lt;br/&gt;requirements for protocol security, rather than imposing new&lt;br/&gt;technologies to address one or two specific exploits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) provides best-effort connectivity&lt;br/&gt;between the component networks of the Internet, a task called&lt;br/&gt;interdomain routing.  However, BGP lacks any security mechanism,&lt;br/&gt;allowing accidental router misconfiguration or intentional attacks&lt;br/&gt;that have far-reaching effects on network stability and traffic&lt;br/&gt;flow. Furthermore, simply adding security mechanisms is insufficient&lt;br/&gt;because BGP also lacks the guarantee that specification-compliant&lt;br/&gt;inputs always produce stable routes across the network.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses these shortcomings through research on various&lt;br/&gt;assumptions that guarantee good routing behavior and on methods to&lt;br/&gt;verify or enforce these assumptions to prevent deviation from that&lt;br/&gt;behavior.  We identify and address attacks that have previously been&lt;br/&gt;studied as well as new attacks that have not yet received attention in&lt;br/&gt;the literature.  We target incremental-deployment benefits and&lt;br/&gt;computational efficiency as primary desiderata; thus, our solutions&lt;br/&gt;can offer incentives for immediate adoption without system-wide&lt;br/&gt;changes. Through its educational component, our project introduces&lt;br/&gt;students to cross-disciplinary research. This encourages collaboration&lt;br/&gt;in research projects and allows development of coursework integrating&lt;br/&gt;security, networking, and theory for a timely application domain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
