<AbstractNarration>This project is attracting students to and retaining students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields via involvement with sustainable technologies in two ways. The project includes a summer Precalculus Preparedness Seminar, a summer Energy Laboratory Academy as a preparation for a later internship, placement in undergraduate research and/or industry internships, and counseling, mentoring and tutoring support through an existing Math, Engineering, Science  Achievement  (MESA) center.   A  capstone  activity  of the Energy Laboratory Academy  is  a  community  service  project  involving  photovoltaics.  Other efforts aimed at increasing retention within STEM majors include provision of instruction to strengthen skill  sets  important  in  gateway  courses  in  math  and  laboratory  science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The  project's intellectual  merit stems from the interplay of the many interventions being employed: project based  learning, service  learning, learning  through  teaching, intensive  cohort  experiences, individualized  learning,  and  longitudinal  support  through  established  learning  communities. It  addresses   the  need  for  improved  performance  in  two  gateway  classes: Precalculus, the  course  necessary  for  almost  all  lower division  college  technical  coursework, and  Circuits, a  prerequisite  for  almost  all  upper  division  college  technical  coursework  in  many  engineering  disciplines.  It builds on past successes of the MESA center and a current STEP project (0336644) involving a consortium of MESA Centers at a number of community colleges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project's broader  impacts   are  twofold:  results  from  the  comprehensive  evaluation  of  the  project are being widely disseminated to encourage others to try similar efforts; and  the  students graduating from the project are helping to meet the workforce  needs  in  the  greater  Silicon  Valley  and  Monterey  Bay  area.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Project Outcomes Report Goals    The goal of Science Technology &amp; Energy: Expanding Potential, or STEEP,  were to increase the numbers of STEM transfers and degrees using methods.1) interest students in STEM majors, 2) prepare and support for success in those majors and 3) to retain them and bolster their efforts to transfer and complete four year degrees. This goal was met through the 1) Summer Energy Academy (SEA),  2) Precalculus Readiness and Excellence Program (PREP) and 3) Internships and longitudinal support.  Increasing STEM participation for underrepresented minorities was also a focus. See Charts A &amp; B. Programs  SEA consisted of a month-long learning experience centered on renewable energy culminating in service-learning projects. Each of the five annual Academies included 24 student participants with an interest in renewable energy and sustainability but without significant progress toward STEM degrees.  Each cohort had 8 committed STEM major peer leaders/mentors for the team-based curriculum in which a variety of STEM disciplines were introduced. The emphasis was on hands-on lab activities with time for tinkering and sparking curiosity for science and engineering learning.  Teams completed demonstration projects and presented them in an Energy Fair to educate the public about renewable energy.  The PREP program was for students interested in STEM majors who were at risk of being unsuccessful in precalculus, a gatekeeper course for STEM majors. Student cohorts participated in a two week math intensive then were enrolled in the same precalculus course and had weekly workshops throughout the semester. Participants overcame math anxiety, learned how to study math and were empowered to teach one another with the guidance of peer leaders and faculty. Paid internships were offered for students to extend their learning through special projects.   On-campus Energy Interns worked with the college facilities department performing energy audits with the guidance of consulting professionals collecting data to aid in reducing energy use and increase efficiency.     Energy Bike interns built a bicycle generator which was donated to the local high school for kinesthetic learning demonstrations and inspiring new STEM majors.   Solar interns studied and practiced installation of solar photovoltaic systems which lead to passing the NABCEP solar installer certification exam.   Peer leaders acted as teaching assistants for SEA and PREP.   Teaching  internships in local math and high school classrooms furthered studentsÆ interest in teaching math or science.   Longitudinal support for STEEP students was provided through the campus MESA Study Center where students have access to   Drop-in tutoring in math, physics, chemistry, computer science and biology   A well-equipped study center open 6 days per week   Regular workshops with peer-led team learning for key math and physics courses   Academic, career and personal advising   Transfer assistance   Scholarship, internship and research experience application assistance.   Field trips and science colloquia    Outcomes: Students Overall campus effects include an increased STEM awareness and participation with a more than three-fold increase in the number of underrepresented groups pursuing STEM majors over the six year course of the grant.  Recruiting efforts resulted in over 45% of participants with undeclared majors changing to STEM majors after the interventions. The number of students completing credits towards a transfer STEM degree increased by more than 50%, going from roughly 7% before the grant to 17% after. The proportion of STEM associate degrees earned by underrepresented minority students increased from 11.5% before the grant to 33.9% after. URM STEM majors in the pipeline have increased from 24% to 40% of all STEM majors over the course of the grant. See Charts C &amp; D The success rate for PREP students completing precalculus was 10.8%  higher than the success rate ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
