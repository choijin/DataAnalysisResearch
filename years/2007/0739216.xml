<AbstractNarration>The University of North Carolina, Charlotte proposes to extend the size, scope and impact of the existing BPC STARS Alliance. STARS is a cohesive system of regional partnerships that aims to broaden participation in computing. It collaboratively and systematically implements, disseminates, and institutionalizes effective practices for increasing the number of women, under-represented minorities, and persons with disabilities in the computing disciplines. This proposed Extension focuses on the recruitment, bridging, and retention of under-represented student populations, the advancement of junior faculty, and the sustainability and dissemination of the STARS Southeastern Constellation as a replicable network of regional partnerships, that can be implemented in other geographic regions. It includes new activities aimed at K-6. The Extension will grow the Alliance to include at least 20 academic institutions and 80 regional partners, and it will double student participation in the STARS Student Leadership Corps (SLC), including community colleges, as well as middle and high school students, teachers and guidance counselors. Finally, it will extend the existing program evaluation to explore STARS impact on the computing culture at member institutions.</AbstractNarration>

In addition,  the STARS Alliance has produced 20 journal articles, 54 conference papers, and 18 conference posters disseminating knowledge about our practices.     Individual Impact   The STARS Alliance has demonstrated increases in grade point average, computing professional identity, confidence in computing abilities, belief in the social relevance of computing, and commitment to obtaining a computing degree among Corps students*. The Corps is reaching underreprented populations in computing. Half of the 1,134 Corps students have been female, and nearly half (41%) have been African Americans and 10% Hispanic.   Organizational Capacity Development  25 STARS Alliance institutions have formed mentoring programs and have mentored 517 students. 18 STARS Alliance institutions have established permanent BPC practices through academic credit bearing courses for Corps activities and student clubs.   National Resource for Broadening Participation in Computing  The STARS Alliance has held 7 Celebration conferences providing over 318 training and professional development workshops to students, faculty and community partners. STAR Online connects over 700 students, faculty and community partners via 20 Affinity Groups and 41 school groups who share information, resources and ideas. STARS has supplied 52 resources to the national online portal, the BPC Digital Library.   *Dahlberg, T., Barnes, T., Buch, K. &amp; Rorrer, A. (2011).
