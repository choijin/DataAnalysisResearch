<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests continued support for a major scholarly project well underway. Volume Six of The History of Cartography covers the twentieth century as a million-word, 1,000-illustration, 1,500-page component of a massive, multi-volume scholarly reference work that will be published by the University of Chicago Press. The Press conducted a peer review and approved our design, contents list, and development strategy during Year 2 of the current five-year grant. (Approval by the Press Board was a significant milestone because, in accord with Press policy for huge reference works like Volume Six, peer review occurs at the pre-contract stage, during which the concept and strategy are vetted, rather than after submission of a complete and dauntingly massive manuscript.) Progress to date includes recruiting contributors for 83% of the 520 assignable entries on the list approved by the Press, logging in first drafts for 56% of the entries commissioned, and reviewing and approving 44% of the entries received. This proposal explains why the timetable for the original work plan was unrealistic and presents a workable strategy for completing the research and delivering a publishable manuscript to the Press for timely publication in 2013 or 2014. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Addressing all aspects of cartography during the twentieth century, Volume Six differs from earlier volumes in its inherent focus on electronic technology as well as the rise and fall of mass production; the relative democratization of map use and associated improvements in cartographic literacy; the increased role of government in collecting, mapping, and using scientific data; the heightened concern for data quality; the changing boundaries between cartography and other endeavors; the relationship of cartography to public policy; and increased awareness of ethical considerations in the design and use of maps. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of Volume Six lies in the significance of the twentieth century as a pivotal period in cartographic history; the need of scholars, students, and general users for a comprehensive, well-organized encyclopedia of map history; the logical, systematic process used to develop the list of entry terms and to recruit knowledgeable advisors and contributors in association with the History of Cartography Project; and the proven reference-checking and editorial process developed for earlier volumes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of Volume Six will derive largely from its value as a reference work and research tool for scholars, whose writings will have further impacts on other scholars, journalists, and the general public. It will also encourage many of its numerous contributors (260 recruited to date) to publish expanded essays elsewhere or to undertake book-length studies. In addition to stimulating research on map history, Volume Six will increase awareness of maps and geographic information among historians of geography, of science and technology, and of science and society as well as among general lay users. All of these impacts should be substantially greater than for the other volumes in The History of Cartography series because of cartography's markedly stronger ties during the twentieth century to science and engineering, the substantial and increased involvement of cartographic technology in public administration and warfare, and the wider use of maps by the media and the general public. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
