<AbstractNarration>0708759&lt;br/&gt;Chang-Beom Eom&lt;br/&gt;University of Wisconsin-Madison&lt;br/&gt;Active Nanostructures with Giant Piezo-response&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Major challenges are emerging as electromechanical systems move to the nano-scale (nanoelectromechanical systems, or NEMS), with an integration density that demands faster and larger relative motion range. Our recently developed giant piezoelectric epitaxial thin-films directly on silicon can drastically increase the motion range and speed, with even potentially greater response by using engineered nanoscale strain distributions and domain structures. We will integrate epitaxial thin film heterostructures of giant piezoelectric materials directly on silicon to make hyper-active nano-electromechanical systems. These heterostructures are compatible with silicon nanofabrication processes, can be integrated with silicon-based electronics, and have large enough response to revolutionize active NEMS actuators. This research will develop a fundamental scientific understanding of nanoscale piezoelectric phenomena in active nanoscale electromechanical devices, with applications in high performance signal processing, communications, sensors, and nano-positioning actuators. The relationship between piezo-response and nanoscale strain and domain configurations developed here can be applied to multifunctional materials to develop new NEMS devices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This research will resolve the fundamental issues that control nanoscale performance of piezoelectric materials in NEMS devices. Future generations of NEMS devices enabled by this research are likely to find wide-ranging applications and bring technological advances to many parts of society. Our Education goal is a broad experience for all students. This includes first-year student rotation through research groups, working in international and industrial laboratories, research interactions with individuals of diverse backgrounds, and participating in outreach programs. In Outreach, secondary school science teachers from Mayaguez, Puerto Rico will be brought to UW-Madison each summer for a nanotechnology learning/research experience. They will develop classroom material in both English and Spanish, and put in place programs for implementation secondary schools across the country. Graduate students will be involved as mentors to the teachers. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) are finding broad application as motion and direction sensors in personal electronics, in harvesting energy from ambient vibrations to run low-power electronics, and as mechanical actuators and filters. These micro-machined structures have enabled mechanical motion to be harnessed and controlled at the miniature scale. But major challenges have emerged as these systems move to smaller size and increased integration density, while requiring faster and larger relative motion range. Continued scaling of MEMS to the nanometer regime, (nanoelectromechanical systems, or NEMS), requires revolutionary advances.     This NSF-funded research has made significant advances toward these goals, creating a new structure that incorporates a high-performance piezoelectric thin-film layer that converts electrical energy into mechanical motion in one MEMS structure. Such "active" MEMS have been previously demonstrated, but only with relatively low-response piezoelectric materials. We have perfected the growth of thin-film materials with giant piezoresponse, and incorporated them into operating micromachined structures, moving beyond the active regime to "hyper"-active MEMS.     Images are a completed hyperactive MEMS structure, along with a computer modeled analysis of the structure. Based on silicon technology, this MEMS includes multiple layers, including the giant piezoresponse thin film, metallic contact layers, and insulating barrier layers. Applying low-voltages to the giant piezoelectric thin film material controls the position of the end of the cantilever. Alternatively, displacing the cantilever end generates a voltage signal across the piezoelectric thin film. This allows for both sensing and positioning functions.     This device forms the basis for a new generation of high-response thin-film based MEMS and NEMS that take advantage of giant piezo response materials.

Our Education goal was a broad experience for all students. This includes first-year student rotation through research groups, working in international and industrial laboratories, research interactions with individuals of diverse backgrounds, and participating in outreach programs. In Outreach, secondary school science teachers from Mayag&uuml;ez, Puerto Rico were brought to UW-Madison in summer for a nanotechnology learning/research experience. They developed classroom material in both English and Spanish, and put in place programs for implementation secondary schools across the country. Graduate students were involved as mentors to the teachers. This leads to areas in which they could develop new programs tailored to their own students in the Mayag&uuml;ez area. This approach turned out to be very successful, with the three teachers engaging their entire school in nanotechnology activities on their return to Mayag&uuml;ez.
