<AbstractNarration>Technical: This project addresses fundamental mechanisms that control the electronic structure of organic interfaces and electrical doping, and the extent to which these mechanisms are modified or inhibited by environmental factors. The project emphasizes a comprehensive approach, bringing together electronic structure data and theory, interface chemistry and charge carrier transport data in a self-consistent fashion. N-type electrical doping using low ionization energy molecules as alternatives to fast diffusing alkali metals will be included in the study. Additionally, several classes of molecules, such as cobaltocenes and derivatives, and new delivery methods will be investigated. Doping (both n- and p-type) of crystalline layers will also be investigated at the molecular level via scanning probe techniques. This project involves a multi-technique (ultra-violet and X-ray photoemission spectroscopy, inverse photoemission spectroscopy, scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, current- and capacitance-voltage measurements) approach to fully characterize electronic, chemical and charge transport properties of interfaces. Collaborations with chemists, device physicists and theoreticians are established.  &lt;br/&gt;Non-technical: The project addresses basic research issues in electronics/photonics materials science with high technological relevance, and is expected to provide important opportunities for student training. It will expose graduate and undergraduate students to a range of fundamental interface science problems as well as some practical device issues, to a variety of experimental techniques, and to different research environments through collaborations in chemistry and theory of electronic structure. Through his participation in outreach programs at Princeton University, short courses given to industry, and involvement in scientific societies, the PI will remain active in the teaching and dissemination of knowledge in the field of organic electronics.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
