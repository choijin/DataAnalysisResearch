<AbstractNarration>Sherr 0732301&lt;br/&gt;Oregon State University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funds are provided for an analysis of the impact of changing sea ice conditions on planktonic food web structure, focusing on microzooplankton and mesozooplankton trophic linkages and the fate of phytoplankton blooms in the Bering Sea during spring sea ice conditions. To this end, the principal investigators plan to conduct experiments over a range of ice, ice edge, and open water conditions, and, particularly, will consider the importance of detached ice algae, when present, as a food source for the secondary consumers. As part of this effort, they will determine standing stock biomass, composition, and size structures of phytoplankton, microzooplankton and mesozooplankton assemblages, measure microzooplankton growth and mesozooplankton reproduction rates, and measure grazing rates and prey preferences of heterotrophic protists and dominant species of mesozooplankton. They will also determine the fine scale vertical distribution of plankton, especially of fragile forms such as colonial phytoplankton, to identify thin layers of plankton/ particles in association with hydrographic features. Their collaborative study will explicitly address trophic linkages previously unexplored in this region of the subarctic. They hypothesize that changing ecosystem structure due to global warming, e.g. decrease in seasonal sea ice, will alter these trophic interactions, and thus the ultimate fates of algal production in this region. They plan to participate in each of the three annual cruises proposed for spring sea-ice conditions during the BEST field program. They will carry out a full set of analyses (standing stock determinations and rate measurements) at designated stations along transects within the BEST study area. Abundances and rate measures will be combined to determine relative microzooplankton and mesozooplankton grazing impacts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the direct measurements and observations to be derived from this program will allow the principal investigators to describe the microzooplankton and mesozooplankton of the eastern Bering Sea shelf and their grazing impacts with a detail heretofore unavailable, the numbers they derive will also provide strong constraints on the ecosystem models to be developed as part of BEST.  These models will serve as an important tool during the synthesis of the collective understanding derived by the BEST investigators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ When ocean ecologists say: æall fish is diatomÆ, they mean that the annual blooms of these large, lipid-filled algae support major marine fisheries.  Diatoms, which grow both in sea ice and in the water, are known to form the base of food webs in the Bering Sea.  Yet, exactly how the production of diatoms moves through the food chain to fish, seabirds, seals, and whales is still debated.  The standard concept is that diatoms are eaten by crustacean zooplankton such as copepods and krill, which are then consumed by higher predators.  However, this view of a straight-line food chain is giving way to evidence that much of the diatom production is instead consumed by unicellular predators, protists in the microzooplankton.    The goal of our project was to quantify the amount of algal production consumed by protist predators in the microzooplankton (organisms smaller than 200 microns in size) during spring in the Bering Sea.   During three March-June cruises in the eastern Bering, in conditions of both sea ice and open water, 49 experiments were done in on-deck incubators to measure growth of algae in seawater with and without the presence of microzooplankton predators.  The difference in algal growth between these two treatments, measured by change in amount of chlorophyll during 24-hour incubations, allowed us to determine how much algal production was eaten by the microzooplankton.  Using a microscope, we inspected water samples preserved at sea to determine the biomass and types of predatory protists in the microzooplankton.    The results of the experimental incubations showed that the microzooplankton protists were important consumers of diatoms, the major type of algae in sea ice and in open water during spring.  At some sites, we measured a high amount of protist grazing on intense diatom blooms.  Microzooplankton herbivory averaged about 40&ndash;50% of daily algal production, higher than that previously reported for the Western Arctic Ocean and other polar systems. The most common types of protist predators of diatoms were large sized dinoflagellates.  Many species of marine dinoflagellates are heterotrophic and make their living by feeding on diatoms and other algae, either by engulfing algal prey whole or extruding a blob of protoplasm that attaches to, and digests, algal cells or chains of cells (see figure of images of dinoflagellates feeding on diatoms).  We also observed other type of protists, including ciliates, amoebae, and parasitic flagellates, feeding on diatoms. We found a positive relationship between the biomass of these predatory protists and algal stocks as measured by the concentration of chlorophyll in the water (see figure of log-log relation between microzooplankton biomass and chlorophyll).   Our study convincingly demonstrated that microzooplankton protists are major consumers of diatoms during spring bloom season in the Bering Sea.  This is the first such data set for the Bering Sea at this time of year.  Since protists in the microzooplankton are, in turn, a major food resource for copepods, krill, and fish larvae, protists are of central importance in these sub-arctic food webs.  The results of this project will aid in development of accurate models of food webs in Bering Sea ecosystems.          Last Modified: 09/06/2013       Submitted by: Evelyn B Sherr]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
