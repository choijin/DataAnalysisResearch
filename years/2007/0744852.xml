<AbstractNarration>Lipids in a membrane respond to particular changes in temperature or overall membrane composition by segregating into liquid domains with compositions that are distinct from the surrounding membrane. Furthermore, lipids in one leaflet of a bilayer membrane interact so strongly with lipids in the opposite leaflet that domains are induced from one side of a membrane to the other, even in the absence of membrane proteins. This project will probe the complex functions performed by lipid bilayers, with the eventual goal of shaping our knowledge of the physical behaviors accessible to cell membranes, and guiding biologists in new approaches to understanding complex biological systems. The primary tools of approaching these problems will be fluorescence microscopy and NMR.  To investigate Inter-leaflet interactions and induction of domains across membrane leaflets, mechanisms of induction of liquid domains from one leaflet of a membrane to the other will be tested. To investigate local changes in lipid distributions versus global phase behavior, the effect of crosslinking of membrane components on membrane phase behavior will be evaluated. To study sterol solubility, NMR will be employed. To investigate whether liquid domains form in membranes containing lipids found in the inner leaflet of cell membranes (PE lipids, PS lipids, and PI lipids), vesicles containing those lipids will be produced and analyzed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will directly advise undergraduate and graduate researchers and they will present their research results at national scientific meetings. The majority of graduate students in the Keller laboratory have been women. In the classroom, Dr. Keller will continue to improve the classroom resources she has developed such as a mathematics tutorial, an assignment that introduces students to research seminars and literature searches, and classroom content that emphasizes current research topics. Dr. Keller has recently been recognized for her accomplishments in the classroom with a UW Department of Chemistry Outstanding Teaching Award in 2005, and a University of Washington Distinguished Teaching Award in 2006. In the UW community, Dr. Keller will continue to participate in UW mentoring activities through presentations to the UW Faculty Connections students, the UW Undergraduate Research Society, the UW Chemistry Student Association, the UW Nanotech Student Association, and the UW Postdoctoral Association. In the surrounding community, Dr. Keller will continue to work to implement a centralized, searchable web listing of seminars on campus to enable local industry and community members to learn about relevant scientific research at the University of Washington. Dr. Keller will continue to disseminate materials that she has developed in order to mentor young faculty across the U.S.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This summary describes outcomes of three different research thrusts completed in the Keller Laboratory during the funding period of this NSF award.  The first thrust contains four separate projects that utilize physical tools and concepts to advance knowledge and understanding in the field of membrane biophysics:   1) Lipid membranes incorporate sterols up to a solubility limit.  Above this limit, sterols leave the membrane and assemble in crystals in the aqueous solution, a process with implications for patients with high cholesterol.  This project experimentally determined solubility limits of a variety of biologically-important sterols within lipid membranes, a task that is currently difficult to achieve by theory or by simulation of the system.  2) Lipids within membranes often demix into domains enriched in particular lipid types.  This project measured the growth rate of those domains and found excellent agreement with a simple theory, resolving a quandary that had arisen because previous experiments by other research groups had been unable to incontrovertibly verify the same prediction.   3) A significant fraction of the lipids that reside in cell membranes are charged. It has been argued that repulsion between these charges may preclude domains from forming in those membranes. In this project, the Keller Laboratory discovered the surprising result that high fractions of charged lipids do not significantly affect the temperature at which domains appear in model membranes.   4) The Keller Laboratory provided the first experimental verification of a 2012 prediction that the application of tension to a membrane shifts the temperature at which membrane domains appear.       All of the projects in the first research thrust above use physical methods to answer biologically-inspired questions.  The opposite tactic, of creatively utilizing biological materials to make fundamental discoveries in physics, is rare.  Projects in the second thrust do exactly that, thereby advancing knowledge and understanding across different fields.  Specifically, the Keller Lab found that model lipid membranes behave in a manner consistent with the 2-dimensional Ising Model.  The lab was the first to accomplish the longstanding goal of measuring the correct dynamic critical exponent of a 2-dimensional Ising system with conserved order parameter, in agreement with the predicted value of the exponent. This prediction was only recently refined in theoretical work in 2008-9, making the experimental results timely. These types of measurements are important to the study of biology because membranes derived from intact cell membranes exhibit critical fluctuations.     A third research thrust during the funding period involved developing and testing a new technique to produce nonlinear optical materials. These materials are important to industry for their applications in electronic devices and therefore have the potential broader impact of a benefit to society. The Keller Lab successfully produced multi-layer nonlinear optical materials via deposition of Langmuir monolayers.     Over the entire funding period of the award, projects in the three research thrusts above resulted in publication of nine peer-reviewed scientific journal articles.  Together, those articles have had high impact; they have garnered over 300 citations in other journal articles to date.  Three of those articles were highlighted on journal covers and a fourth was chosen as an open access featured article in the Biophysical Journal.  Research funded by this NSF award was showcased in international press (The EconomistÆs science blog), in national press (slashdot.org, ScienceDaily.com, kurzweilai.net), in local press (UW Today, UW Daily), and by scientific societies (ASBMB Today, Biophysical Society blog).     An important broader impact of the Keller Laboratory is mentoring the next generation of scientists and engineers.  Over the course of this NSF award, three graduate students in...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
