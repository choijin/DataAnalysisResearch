<AbstractNarration>The Principal Investigator (PI) plans to perform Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) modeling of solar wind turbulence on scales of the ion Larmor radius, where a fluid description is less applicable and plasma kinetic effects are important. This modeling is necessary for investigating how energy in turbulent fluctuations is converted into heat. These kinetic simulations of MHD turbulence will provide quantitative predictions of how turbulence induces fluctuations in a variety of heliophysical quantities, including the magnetic field, the electric field, the plasma density, and the particle distribution function. The PI intends to compare his simulation output with in situ measurements in the solar wind. He will also study the heating of solar wind plasma through small-scale fluctuations in an MHD turbulent cascade, and will quantify the extent to which his modeled plasma heating is consistent with observations of the solar wind. This project will significantly advance the understanding of the complex connection between the turbulent fluctuations in the solar wind and the heating and acceleration of solar wind plasma by such turbulence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Graduate student and postdoctoral training will be an important part of this project. The PI will also provide public talks on a regular basis that will incorporate the results of this research and convey the scientific process to a broader audience.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Turbulence involving magnetic fields and gas is a key process encountered in a wide variety of space and astrophysical plasmas.  In the solar corona and solar wind, motions near the surface of the sun are believed to excite a wide variety of waves that can transport energy over significant distances.  Turbulence is one of the most promising mechanisms for converting the energy initially stored in such waves into thermal energy of the plasma, heating and accelerating the solar wind.  Fundamentally, then, this turbulent heating is responsible for producing the solar wind in the first place.  In the course of our work, we developed a detailed understanding of turbulence in magnetized plasmas, focusing on the small scales where the turbulent energy is converted into heat.  We carried out the most comprehensive calculations to date predicting turbulent fluctuations consistent with direct measurements on small scales in the solar wind. The image "Predicted Fluctuations in the Solar Wind" associated with this report shows these predicted electric (green) and magnetic (black, red) turbulent fluctuations.  A long-standing problem in understanding observations of the solar wind and solar corona has been reconciling the properties of the turbulence with the measured temperatures of protons, electrons, and other ions like Oxygen.  The temperature measurements seem to require turbulence with properties very different than that observed. We sharpened this tension using state-of-the-art turbulence calculations and then provided one of the most promising resolutions of this discrepancy by developing new models for how the turbulent energy is converted into heat.  We incorporated these heating models into calculations of the full structure of the solar wind, from the sun to beyond the Earth, that are in good agreement with measurements.  This provides a "first principles" model that directly connects the small-scale physics of heating with the large-scale properties (velocity, density) of the solar wind.  Finally, we studied how additional measurements in the solar wind -- e.g., of the density fluctuations and the handedness of the turbulence -- can be used to constrain the key processes producing the heating and acceleration of the solar wind.  Broader Impact:  In the course of our work, we pioneered the application of techniques developed in the fusion community to the study of solar system and astrophysical plasmas.  The NSF funding was primarily used to support young researchers early in their career.       Last Modified: 05/31/2012       Submitted by: Eliot Quataert]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
