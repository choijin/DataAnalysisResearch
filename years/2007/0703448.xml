<AbstractNarration>Moist tropical forests have huge amounts of carbon in their biomass and soils, and high rates of productivity: tropical forest growth, disturbance, and land use therefore have potentially large impacts on atmospheric CO2 levels. Accurate modeling of carbon uptake and release by forests is essential for global-change analyses, yet we do not even know how much CO2 tropical forests capture or produce. This project will make use of 19-yr-old replicated plantations in lowland Costa Rica to evaluate species-level controls over whole-forest carbon cycling. In comparisons among four species, three key plant traits that influence ecosystem-level carbon balance will be evaluated: 1) carbon use efficiency (CUE); 2) partitioning among plant parts that have differences in CUE (e.g., leaves, wood); and 3) tissue biochemistry, which influences carbon cycling rates. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this project include training and international experience for both undergraduate and graduate students. Further development of the widely used Century model will offer a major advance in the ability to predict the effects of shifts in species composition on ecosystem-level carbon balances. Maintenance of this research site will provide infrastructure for other researchers, and a demonstration of restoration of ecosystem services. Results will be disseminated to the scientific community, and also to NGO's and land-holders in the area. Development of a user-friendly rainforest simulation model will enhance education opportunities for 29,500 K-12 students in the Miami, FL area, though a partnership with the Fairchild Tropical Botanical Garden.</AbstractNarration>
