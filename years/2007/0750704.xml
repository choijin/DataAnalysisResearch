<AbstractNarration>SES-0750704&lt;br/&gt;Jon Gjerde&lt;br/&gt;Gloria Chun&lt;br/&gt;Angela James&lt;br/&gt;Beth Schneider&lt;br/&gt;University of California, Berkeley&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A three-year grant was provided to the UC-DIGSSS Alliance (University of California Diversity Initiative for Graduate Study in the Social Sciences)comprised of the University of California at Berkeley, Los Angeles, Santa Barbara, to complete a pilot program to broaden the participation of underrepresented minority students into the social sciences. The aim of UC-DIGSSS is not only to increase the numbers of underrepresented minority  students, but also to help transform the culture of the academy so that institutional environments are more attractive to underrepresented minorities.  UC-DIGSS has worked closely with divisional deans, department chairs, graduate advisors and faculty to initiate a series of new programs to recruit and retain underrepresented minority students in graduate programs in the social and behavioral sciences.  All three campuses have experienced increased in the number of students matriculated in social science graduate programs since the onset of the grant.  UC-DIGSS plays a role within the broader Alliance for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (AGEP) community.  The incorporation of SBE faculty and students has broadened the disciplinary scope of AGEP community, generating a more informed dialogue about the origins and consequences of inequalities in societies and institutions and enriching the social and educational context of programs.  UC-DIGSSS, will continue to build on initial successes and move forward to: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;. Form partnerships with MSIs (minority-serving institutions) to increase the applicant pool, by developing longitudinal relationships with MSIs across administration, faculty, and staff..&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;. Mentor underrepresented minority students with one-on-one research traineeships with faculty in the early stages (first three years) of the graduate program in order to help build research skills and to create strong bonds with faculty mentors early in their program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;. Improve retention by focusing on community building and creating support for graduate student research, including funding for tutors, writing improvement workshops, professional conference attendance, field research, and master's exam support. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The major broader impact of this program is the creation of synergy to broaden participation of underrepresented students in SBE fields not only within alliance campuses, but across the nation.  This will be done by fostering a more informed dialogue about racialized identities and practices within the academy and forging collaborative efforts to increase the applicant pool and retain a greater number of students matriculating with doctorates in the social sciences.</AbstractNarration>
