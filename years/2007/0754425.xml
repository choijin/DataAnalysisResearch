<AbstractNarration>This award is to support the renewal of the UnIPhy-REU site program at Hampton University.  The award will support the summer research residential program for undergraduate physics and science majors along with its summer research program for teachers - TIRP-RET.  The main focus of the UnIPhy-REU site program is to offer a research experience in the areas of nuclear, particle, optical and medical physics or atmospheric sciences to students from groups normally underrepresented in physics.  Eight students will conduct research in labs on the campus of Hampton University and at the nearby Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility.  Four students will participate in the UnIPhy-REU/MIT Summer Program for Undergraduate Research with an Electron Ion Collider at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  The TIRP-RET program will provide research opportunities in experimental nuclear or particle physics for two high school teachers.  The main focus of the UnIPhy-REU and TIRP-RET programs is to introduce undergraduate students and high school teachers to the process of conducting advanced scientific research, specifically in the field of physics.  Students conduct research under the guidance of a mentor; they are in daily contact with the mentor, researchers, and graduate students.  Additionally, students participate in seminars and social activities.  At the conclusion of the program, students give a thirty-minute oral presentation and submit a written research report.  This award is co-funded by the Division of Physics and by the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities of the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate.</AbstractNarration>

UnIPhy-REU has shown its commitment to serving underrepresented populations since its inception, and African American and female students have comprised 72% and 44%, respectively, of participants since 1997.

The UnIPhy-REU program has been very successful in recruiting students from underrepresented groups in physics, particularly women and African-American students and was listed on the NSF REU web-site as a site for women and minority students.  Participants were selected based solely on their qualifications and desire to participate in a physics research experience.  Hampton University partnered with the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (Jefferson Lab) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Laboratory for Nuclear Science (LNS) in 2007 to create an annual UnIPhy-REU/MIT program with an emphasis on the Electron Ion Collider.  The recent Nuclear Science Advisory Committee Long-Range Plan endorsed an Electron Ion Collider (EIC) as an essential tool in the long-term vision of the field of nuclear physics.

The following summer, the same students were invited to conduct research at MIT for the entire duration of the UnIPhy-REU program.  Ten students participated in research at MIT-LNS through this award.   Over the three-year period of this award, thirty-four UnIPhy-REU participants were selected from more than twenty different institutions, including six Historically Black Colleges, several small colleges (e.g., Grove City College and Bard College at SimonÆs Rock) and majority research institutions (e.g., Carnegie Mellon University and University of Massachusetts).  Participants presented papers at scientific meetings and conferences during and after the summer programs were completed.  One student presented a poster paper at the 51st Annual meeting of the American Physical Society Division of Plasma Physics (Atlanta, GA, 2009) and coauthored a paper published in Radiation Effects and Defects in Solids (2010).
