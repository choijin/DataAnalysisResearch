<AbstractNarration>The Texas A&amp;M University System (TAMUS) LSAMP Phase IV will extend an&lt;br/&gt;alliance of three institutions: 1) Texas A&amp;M University (TAMU), a Tier I research&lt;br/&gt;institution, 2) Prairie View A&amp;M University (PVAMU), a Historically Black College&lt;br/&gt;and University, and 3) Texas A&amp;M University-Corpus Christi (TAMUCC), an&lt;br/&gt;Hispanic Serving Institution. To sustain gains made during Phase I, II, and III of the&lt;br/&gt;TAMUS LSAMP, alliance institutions will develop strong ties with 5 community&lt;br/&gt;colleges, which each have large underrepresented minority (URM) student enrollment.&lt;br/&gt;The community colleges are Palo Alto College (San Antonio); North Harris Montgomery&lt;br/&gt;College, both the North Harris and Cy-Fair campuses; Houston Community College-&lt;br/&gt;Northeast campus; and Del Mar College (Corpus Christi).&lt;br/&gt;INTELLECTUAL MERIT - TAMUS LSAMP IV has a GOAL of broadening the&lt;br/&gt;participation of underrepresented minorities (URM) in science, technology,&lt;br/&gt;engineering or mathematics (STEM) disciplines to the successful completion of a&lt;br/&gt;bachelor's degree and who are well prepared and ready to matriculate into a&lt;br/&gt;doctoral program.&lt;br/&gt;Objectives include:&lt;br/&gt;1. Enhance community college partnerships for recruitment of URM students into&lt;br/&gt;STEM majors through integrated interactions with alliance institutions.&lt;br/&gt;2. Expand retention efforts for STEM URM undergraduates with a focus on firstyear&lt;br/&gt;and transfer URM students at alliance institutions.&lt;br/&gt;3. Promote and encourage URM student pursuit of doctoral degrees and building of&lt;br/&gt;a community of scholars from the undergraduate to graduate school levels and&lt;br/&gt;across alliance institutions.&lt;br/&gt;4. Provide international experience for a select group of TAMUS LSAMP IV&lt;br/&gt;students for increasing and diversifying the pool of globally trained STEM&lt;br/&gt;graduates&lt;br/&gt;PI Dr. Karan Watson, Dean of Faculties and Associate Provost, and Regents&lt;br/&gt;Professor of Electrical Engineering, TAMU, will be joined by co-PIs: Dr. David Prior,&lt;br/&gt;Executive Vice-President and Provost, TAMU; Dr. Karen Butler-Purry, Professor of&lt;br/&gt;Electrical Engineering, TAMU, and current TAMUS LSAMP Phase III Project Director;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Milton Bryant, Dean of Engineering, PVAMU; and Dr. Frank Pezold, Dean of&lt;br/&gt;Science and Technology, TAMUCC. These research faculty will seek to advance&lt;br/&gt;discovery of successful mechanisms to increase URM student retention, graduation and&lt;br/&gt;pursuit of doctoral degrees, and URM student involvement in international study abroad.&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACTS - The involvement of PVAMU, a Historically Black College and&lt;br/&gt;University, and TAMUCC, an Hispanic Serving Institution, will broaden the participation&lt;br/&gt;in STEM of URM groups, as will participation by TAMU, as research intensive&lt;br/&gt;institution, and 5 community college partners since all enroll large numbers of URM&lt;br/&gt;students. LSAMP IV will benefit society by increasing participation of URM groups in&lt;br/&gt;STEM, and by providing opportunities and activities at the undergraduate and graduate&lt;br/&gt;levels that lead to educational and career enhancements of URM students.&lt;br/&gt;LSAMP IV will also enhance the infrastructure of research and education by&lt;br/&gt;advancing undergraduate research and pursuit of graduate and doctoral STEM degrees at&lt;br/&gt;alliance institutions and through the replication and dissemination of successful models&lt;br/&gt;for URM community college transfer students.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Texas A&amp;M University System Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (TAMUS LSAMP) worked under the model of improving Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) underrepresented minority (URM) student retention, the level of URM involvement in STEM academic and professional communities, and the progression of URM students to STEM graduate studies.  TAMUS LSAMP Phase IV provided funding for alliance-wide academic enhancement activities and research opportunities.  The TAMUS LSAMP Undergraduate Research Program was established to promote the academic and professional skills of LSAMP students. The immediate intent was to link undergraduate students with active and supportive faculty-researchers who would mentor the students and provide them with opportunities to engage in research-related activities, as early as possible in the studentsÆ academic careers. The long-term intent was to encourage and prepare students to continue their academic and research careers in STEM graduate programs.  During Phase IV, the three partner institutions of TAMUS LSAMP encouraged and supported undergraduate research (UGR) during the academic year by providing research seminars, summer research, summer study abroad opportunities, and summer international experiences.    Opportunities for participants to attend research conferences of their respective professional organizations provided a platform for presenting their research to their peers and to the organizationsÆ professionals.  The project also held its own annual symposium for students to present their research to their peers across the Alliance, providing the opportunity to increase their skills at presenting as well as to gather feedback on their research and presentation.   Collaborations with other programs and grants on each campus allowed more student exposure to opportunities available through the LSAMP project.  Lessons learned on each of the three Alliance campuses were able to be disseminated through contact with the other programs and grants across each campus and with local community colleges.  Opportunities for recruitment of future LSAMP participants were made when the Alliance connected with a K-12 program that brought in STEM teachers for workshops.   An increase in URM STEM enrollment was indicated by data in all years of Phase IV for the Alliance from the baseline year (Fall 2007) to Year  6 (Fall 2013).  The net Alliance enrollment increase for the six years of Phase IV was 72.2% (3,076 students) over the baseline enrollment (4,261 students) at the end of Phase III.  The Alliance had a minimum yearly enrollment gain (from one year to the next) of 1.7% (which occurred between Years 3 and 4) and a maximum yearly enrollment gain of 20.4% (which occurred between Years 5 and 6).   URM STEM Bachelor Degree data indicated changes in the bachelor degree production of the three TAMUS LSAMP Alliance institutions from the baseline year (2007-2008) to Year 6 (2013-2014).  A total of 4,689 STEM bachelor degrees were awarded to URM students over the six years of Phase IV.  The net degree increase for Year 6 (918 degrees) of Phase IV is 62.5% (353 degrees) over the baseline degree total (565 degrees) at the end of Phase III.  Degree completion rates, regardless of level, have experienced historical cycles.  The number of degrees reported for the last year of Phase IV appears to indicate the degree cycle to be dropping for two of the three institutions.  Year 5 completion rates were at the top of the cycle.  The Alliance had a minimum yearly degree gain (from one year to the next) of 6.5% (which occurred between Years 3 and 4) and a maximum yearly degree gain of 15.0% (which occurred between Years 4 and 5) for Phase IV.  Individual institutional data indicate fluctuations in the number of degrees completed.  These fluctuations may have been attributed to the economy and other factors causing students to have to return to work or to drop out of the degree programs. ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
