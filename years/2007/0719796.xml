<AbstractNarration>Organoarsenic compounds are widespread in nature, occurring in freshwater and marine as well as terrestrial environments.  Organisms, including bacteria, fungi, algae, invertebrates, vertebrates and even humans, can biotransform arsenic (As), converting inorganic to organic As, and in some cases vice-versa, producing a range of structurally simple to complex organoarsenic compounds in the environment.  In addition to natural sources, organoarsenicals have been synthesized for agricultural, medicinal, and military uses.  The use of organoarsenicals in the poultry industry, for example, has increased dramatically as the industry has grown.  Roxarsone (3-nitro 4-hydroxybenzene arsonic acid) is added to poultry feed up to 45.5g per ton for the purpose of improving weight gain, feed efficiency, and pigmentation.  When roxarsone is removed from feed for a 5-d period before slaughter, As concentrations in tissue are below the USFDA limit of 0.5 mg/kg.  The majority (95%) of the As is excreted from the animal, resulting in elevated As (15 to 77 mg/kg) in poultry litter.  Because poultry litter is rich in nutrients, more than 90% of it is land-applied as fertilizer.  The disposal of poultry waste through land application results in release of an estimated 10^6kg of As to the environment.  Recent work has demonstrated that As in poultry litter is highly water soluble and thus potentially mobile.  Biotransformation of roxarsone and other organoarsenicals has been documented in the laboratory, but to date, there is little known about the ultimate fate of roxarsone, and other organoarsenicals, in watersheds.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of our proposed research is to examine the biogeochemical controls on organoarsenic transformation in a watershed within the Delmarva Peninsula, a region of intense poultry production.  Our main hypothesis is that organoarsenic transformation is carried out by diverse microbial populations under a range of biogeochemical conditions.  We will conduct intensive field monitoring of soil, ground, and surface waters before and after litter application to determine the concentration and form of As in each of these water types.  We will use biochemical and molecular techniques to identify and characterize microbial communities in the water samples and to examine the impact of biogeochemical conditions on microbial community structure.  To enhance public understanding of water quality, we will work with students, teacher, and community groups on water quality sampling projects on two river systems, one in a mostly forested and rural area (New River, Southwestern VA) and another impacted by agricultural and industrial land uses in an urban area (Allegheny, Monongahela, and Ohio Rivers, Pittsburgh, PA).</AbstractNarration>

To address our objective, our research team conducted a series field and laboratory experiments, described below, using a field site on the Delmarva Peninsula, a region of intense poultry production.

The Virginia Tech team included an associate professor, one primary graduate student, and four undergraduates, as well an outreach specialist.  Our team collaborated with two professors and a graduate student at Duquesne University, who were focused on biological transformation processes affecting As.  After instrumenting our field site and monitoring background geochemical characteristics of soil water, ground water, and surface water, we conducted a poultry litter application experiment.  After the application, we continued monitoring for a period of six months. Results showed release of low concentrations of trace elements and nutrients from litter into soil water. Little impact was measured on ground or surface water.  Mass balance calculations of trace elements in litter, soil water, and soil suggested that the majority of trace element mass released from litter was retained in the B soil horizon.

Statistically significant differences in trace element concentrations between reference sites (forested regions) and downgradient sites were measured.  Correlation analysis between sediment trace element enrichment values and 2006 land use/land cover (LULC) data did not show any clear statistical significant relationship between agricultural areas and enrichment. However, there was a statistically significant relationship between several of the trace elements and 2006 residential land use, a relationship that was not observed using earlier (1992 or 2001) LULC data sets.  Examination of the LULC datasets revealed that land use in the watershed region has changed significantly over the past 30 years; land area used for agriculture and forest has decreased, concomitant with an increase in land used for residential and commercial purposes.  Thus, the urbanization within the watershed could be one possible reason for the patterns observed.  Overall, our results indicate that trace elements are released from poultry litter into the subsurface, and that the mobility of those elements is controlled by both hydrologic processes (precipitation patterns) and geochemical processes (adsorption and complexation) within the subsurface.  Our Duquesne colleagues used sediment and water samples collected from the field site to examine the influence of microbial processes on the fate of organic As.
