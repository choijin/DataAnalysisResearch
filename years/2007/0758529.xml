<AbstractNarration>The objectives of this project are to organize and support multidisciplinary reconnaissance teams composed of volunteer field researchers to collect perishable data and observations immediately after significant earthquakes throughout the world and disseminate the collected data and lessons learned from field observations to the earthquake engineering community at large. These activities organized by EERI since 1973 have led to increased understanding of earthquake ground motions and their effects on built and natural environment, to fundamental changes in building codes and construction practices, and to improved procedures for response, recovery and preparedness.  These continued activities have provided bases for continuing research in many different disciplines, by providing initial scientific and engineering observations upon which in-depth research projects are based.  Post-earthquake teams provide data, observations and lessons that are used to pose critical research questions that merit further research to prove or disprove scientific hypotheses, and calibrate laboratory-based models of building performance, wave actions, and tectonics, among others. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Field observations-based research has enabled the scientific and engineering communities to develop better tools and techniques to improve design and construction practices for increased life safety.  They have led to improvements in emergency planning and response efforts, resulting in a reduction in earthquake losses and improved recovery. The efforts have also led to enhanced earthquake awareness in general public to enhance post-earthquake societal resilience. While many critical advances have been made, the continuing loss of life, as well as escalating social and economic impacts, underscore the fact that much remains to be learned from post-earthquake damage surveys. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
