<AbstractNarration>Through participation in this Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site at the New York City College of Technology (affiliated with the City University of New York), each year a total of 10 carefully selected students will be paired with established University and government scientists and demonstrably contribute to real-world research projects in the Earth Sciences. This urban campus has a longstanding and close association with NOAA's Cooperative Remote Sensing Science and Technology Center (NOAA-CREST), and is thus particularly well suited to outreach that will encourage and enhance involvement of underrepresented groups in the sciences. Students will be selected and assigned to a specific university faculty member and/or NOAA researcher as their chief mentor. Following an appropriate orientation and with the benefit of occasional workshops focusing on various aspects of the scientific research process, each student will work over a 15-week period on an established mentor-led research project.  Additional guidance from graduate students already working in their chosen sub-disciplines will provide further near peer-level mentorship to encourage the students' scientific growth and success. Through hands-on participation in field data collection activities, scientific conferences and visits to nearby research centers, emphasis will be placed on connecting participating REU students with established scientists, including minority members of the research community, in a variety of settings. Students will formalize their work via both written reports and oral presentations, and select participants will be given the opportunity to share their results at appropriate symposia and conferences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:  Participants will contribute to increased knowledge and understanding in basic science as well as applied research topics. Activities will encompass a variety of sub-disciplines, but will in particular take advantage of collocation with NOAA-CREST to expose students to cutting-edge remote sensing techniques critical to accurate observation and increased understanding of the Earth system. This REU Site will contribute significantly toward NSF's established goal of creating an internationally competitive and appropriately engaged public and, over the long term, enhance the quality of the academic scientific workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  By virtue of entraining and supporting a rich variety of students drawn primarily from the highly diverse demographic of the New York City College of Technology, this program will desirably enhance both near-term educational and long-term career opportunities for members of groups that have historically been underrepresented in the sciences. It will also contribute to the further enrichment of graduate students and future educators, and serve as a model for other programs of this type.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

Therefore, by providing opportunities for STEM research, by improving the academic performance, skills, and attitudes of the students, and by providing significant exposure to STEM, this REU program has contributed in meaningful ways to the diversity of our nationÆs 21st century STEM workforce.  This NSF REU project was steeped in both outreach and dissemination. In a joint effort, this project established a collaborative REU exchange program with the REU program in Nornan, Oklahoma. It has created relationships with Middle Schools and High Schools in the New York metro region, and it has built international research ties with the Dominican Republic. The program has extensive dissemination portols via its main website and via a Book of Papers that highlights the REU students' research.  The intellectual merit of our proposed activities is that we will provide promising college undergraduates the opportunity to work with scientists and engineers and conduct research at one of our nationÆs premier scientific center in the area of Satellite and Ground-Based Remote Sensing. Remote Sensing is a critically important, unique, and young area of science, and it is practically unknown to many if not most of the undergraduates that we serve at CUNY. The proposed activities combine year long (Summer, Winter, Fall, and Spring) research experiences with focused, multidimensional/layered mentoring, and a robust learning community that produce holistic and engaging stimuli for the scientific and academic growth and development of our student participants. The broader impacts of this activity are that the students participating in this program will become the future engineers and scientists of our nation. Even those students who choose other careers will greatly benefit both themselves and our society by having a deeper understanding of the importance of this science. Moreover, the proposed activiti...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
