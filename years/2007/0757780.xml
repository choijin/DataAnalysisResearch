<AbstractNarration>One of the great challenges in neurobiology is to decipher the molecular mechanisms that integrate synaptic plasticity, learning and memory. Dr. Franke's project examines the protein kinase called Akt, which is a key molecule at the interphase between the extracellular environment and intracellular homeostasis. The project seeks to clearly define the role Akt signaling as a new molecular pathway at the center of neuronal cell biology, synaptic plasticity and cognition. By expanding Dr. Franke's previous research on the identification and characterization of Akt, this project will examine novel implications of the Akt kinase in higher brain function using genetically modified mice. The project is based on the hypothesis that the Akt-dependent regulation of specific receptors in the brain is involved in mediating its role in learning and synaptic plasticity. To test this hypothesis, behavioral, electrophysiological, biochemical and cell biological experiments will be performed in an innovative and interdisciplinary project team that combines diverse scientific know-how and technical expertise. Considering the crucial role of Akt in neuronal cell biology, the results of the study will provide significant new insights into the cellular basis for the processing of memories. Thus, the project will reveal important new information about basic mechanisms contributing to higher brain function that have not yet been investigated. &lt;br/&gt;The project includes training opportunities for pre- and post-doctoral students, and involves high school and undergraduate students as active participants in the research. In addition, the investigators will present their research findings at local schools and undergraduate colleges. A special emphasis will be placed on the integration of students from underrepresented population groups by including summer students from minority-based institutions such as Hunter College (City University of New York) and Long Island University (Brooklyn).&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
