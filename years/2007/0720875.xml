<AbstractNarration>Release of chemicals or biological agents in the subsurface often results in plumes migrating in the medium, posing risk to human and ecological environments. Temporal and spatial monitoring of the plume concentrations are needed to assess risk, make decisions and take remedial action. Current underground contaminant plume monitoring technologies are inefficient, expensive and ineffective. Wireless sensor technologies have the potential to dramatically improve this process. &lt;br/&gt;A closed-loop system integrating wireless sensor network based monitoring with numerical models for plume tracking is being developed, in which sensor data continuously calibrates and validates the system identification and prediction models, while the output from these models direct the sensor network operation to optimize constraints such as accuracy and power consumption.  The system is based on a novel virtual sensor network architecture with broader applicability beyond plume tracking. Algorithms and protocols being developed support the formation, usage, adaptation and maintenance of dynamic subsets of collaborating sensors, named Virtual Sensor Networks (VSNs).   VSN protocols for collaboration among groups of sensors will greatly ease the task of deploying sensor networks, especially in environments where multiple geographically overlapping applications are deployed.  A proof-of-concept laboratory test bed that captures the complex subsurface processes is used for integration and evaluation of VSN protocols.  This interdisciplinary project  will significantly advance the state-of-the art in subsurface plume tracking and sensor networking technologies. It will stimulate a unique partnership of electrical engineers,  computer scientists and environmental researchers, and demonstrate closed-loop operation of computer models and sensor networks  to solve complex environmental problems.</AbstractNarration>

A model's predictive performance is dependent on being able to match the model's outputs to the actual observations and is quantified by the objective function which contains the residuals between the data ``received'' from the network and the data computed by the predictive computational model.   REDFLAG has reduced the objective function  by almost three orders of magnitude due to the removal of a large majority of faulty data.   We have addressed the challenges rising from sensor data assimilation. We have focused on the periodic inclusion of concentration data into a computational advection-dispersion transport model.  The data are synthetically generated and a WSN simulator is used to inject authentic anomalies into the data set.

In order to validate the closed-loop system, we have developed a large three dimensional, laboratory-scale synthetic aquifer, designed experiments which create complex plume configurations from an ionic tracer, employed a network of electrical conductivity sensors to track plume movement, and developed a methodology which uses the sensor data to calibrate numerical models designed to simulate plume transport through the synthetic aquifer.
