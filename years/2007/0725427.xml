    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to qualitatively advance our understanding and&lt;br/&gt;development of EXX phenomena where E = extraordinary and XX = electroconductance (EEC) and optoconductance (EOC), etc. The approach is to a) prepare single elements and nanoarrays of EOC and EEC sensors and study their properties, b) optimize the design of these elements and arrays, and c) demonstrate the efficacy of EOC and EEC nanoarrays by producing images of&lt;br/&gt;selected physical entities. We will conduct collateral theoretical investigations of these EXX effects by employing finite element modeling, with the drift diffusion equation and the Boltzmann transport equation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this research is embodied in the scaling of EXX devices to the nano-regime and the elucidation of the mesoscopic physics of EXX sensors and arrays for which mesoscopic proximity effects are particularly significant. We focus here on EOC and EEC arrays because these are the least complex for nanoscale fabrication and, more importantly, because of&lt;br/&gt;their potential application to the imaging, with ultra-high temporal and spatial resolution, of various entities that span a variety of disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We anticipate that the proposed research will have broad beneficial impact on education and technology as a diverse team of researchers develops the proposed nanoarray devices into much less cumbersome and much lower cost research tools for uses such as rapid screening of live cancer cells. Moreover, EOC and EEC sensor nanoarrays could impact a variety of technologies spanning clinical applications to consumer electronics with obvious societal&lt;br/&gt;benefits.</AbstractNarration>
