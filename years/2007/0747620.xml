<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to develop high-sensitive light-weight accelerometers that can be body-worn like a bandage or vest for continuous respiratory sound monitoring.  The approach is based on a novel air-spaced cantilever structure to increase the accelerometer sensitivity by orders of magnitude and a unique intelligent textile technology to make the packaged accelerometer light-weight and wearable.  &lt;br/&gt;The proposed research may lead to a paradigm shift in the monitoring of respiratory sounds and advance the development of various wearable health monitoring sensors.  The novel air-spaced cantilever structures proposed may enable high-performance and low-cost accelerometers that are highly desirable for many industrial, scientific, civilian and military applications. &lt;br/&gt;The successful development of the proposed system will have significant impacts on various clinical and healthcare applications such as anesthesia monitoring in operating rooms, asthma management, non-invasive vital sign monitoring for pilots and other military personnel, patient monitoring in intensive care units, nursing facilities, and emergency medical services, etc.  Significant societal and economic impacts are expected. The exciting new methods and findings associated with the research will be first incorporated into a Micro/Nano Electro Mechanical Systems course the PI is teaching.  Then a new course on wearable physiological sensors will be developed.  Eventually, a unique graduate level education program on wearable health monitoring will be developed.  Both undergraduate and high school students will be involved in the proposed research work.  By taking advantage of the geographic location of Wayne State University, the PI is committed to broaden the participation of underrepresented groups. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
