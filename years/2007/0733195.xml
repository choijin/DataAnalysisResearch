<AbstractNarration>"Teachers Helping Teachers Teach Science Inquiry: The 'Just ASK' Project" develops and evaluates a new generation of adapted science kit (ASK) resources and distance delivery strategies. The goals of the project are to form communities of practice among rural science teachers using web-based resources that allow audio and video connections in real time and to conduct research that examines the impact of these communities of practice on school programs, teaching practices, and student achievement. The project develops and tests teacher adaptations of FOSS, Insights, and STS lessons to make them more appropriate for students in rural schools. The project also develops and tests web-based distance education strategies that enable video, audio, and print interactions among participating teachers and with professional development specialists as well as teacher-to-teacher exchange of lesson plans and other instructional materials over the web. The target audience is elementary teachers, grades K6, in nine rural schools located in Iowa and Missouri. The products of the project will be a vetted set of Adapting Science Kits lessons and accompanying classroom videos specific to FOSS, Insights, and STS kits to be posted on the web and easily accessible by teachers; the formation of a web-based community of practice facilitated by an Elluminate Live portal where ASK activities and classroom videos can be accessed and posted and where teachers can interact with expert ASK teachers and, eventually, with other teachers nation wide; and empirical evidence addressing the impact of ASK communities of practice on school district programs, teachers' classroom practices and student achievement in nine field test school districts.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[A National Network of Teachers Helping Teachers Teach K-6 Inquiry Science The ASK a Teacher Project   The "Teachers Helping Teachers Teach Inquiry Science:  Just ASK" project (NSF Award #0733195) helps elementary school teachers work together to "adapt science for kids." The project was built on 20+ years of four successive multi-year professional development projects starting in 1992. Although different in many respects, each project further developed and researched a strategy to improve K-6 teachersÆ science content knowledge by showing teachers how to adapt science lessons for children so that the science inquiries could also be used to enhance studentsÆ mathematics, reading and writing skills.  The outgrowth of the projects is a website (http://justaskateacher.com) that opened in 2013 and now contains 73 lesson plans with annotated videos of ASK lessons. To be cost efficient and to reach teachers in widely-separated rural and small town schools, the lesson plans and videos were generated exclusively on the Internet using PolyCom view stations. The full lesson videos and the edited lesson vignettes with inserted teacher commentaries were posted to facilitate asynchronous video and audio interactions.  Teachers anywhere in the United States can access the Just ASK resources at any time &ndash; day or night.   In its first 24 months, teachers from 575 schools and teacher educators from 192 colleges visited the website more than 18,000 times to view or download lesson plans and videos. Now more than 1100 educators have free accounts and are utilizing what has been learned so far by project staff and produced by the several thousand teachers.  Just ASK is now seeking funds for an expanded version of the project and its website.  The new project will be known as "A National Network of Teachers Helping Teachers Teach K-6 Inquiry Science: The ASK a Teacher Project."  ASK a Teacher proposes to (1) increase the number of teachers contributing lessons in order to capture a broader range of lessons and to better represent a national perspective, (2) improve the value of the site as a professional development tool by incorporating commentary by science content experts, (3) use its distance strategies and technology to offer all USA teachers one-on-one professional development, and (4) study the impact on the science content knowledge of teachers contributing ASK lessons, on teachers who visit the website, and on students of the teachers who visit the website.  An on-going monthly newsletter to more than 10,000 educators highlights a particular lesson or pair of lessons.  To encourage communication among teachers, we raise questions for discussion relevant to the lesson(s). We also encourage educators to share with others and provide information on how to access the shared resources.  To increase awareness among educators, parents, and other members of the public, we created a special video and participated with 100+ other projects in NSFÆs "2015 Teaching and Learning Video Showcase."  This was an interactive online showcase in which 20,655 unique visitors from 137 countries participated, with almost 2,000 comments posted and 15,436 votes cast by visitors. You can read samples of the public discussion of Just ASK and see our three-minute video at http://resourcecenters2015.videohall.com/posters/535).   The ASK idea appeals to K-6 teachers because it deals with the problem they have in finding time for science in a school day dominated by reading, writing, language arts and mathematics. ASK helps teachers find ways to use science inquiries to teach more than the big ideas of science.  ASK professional development begins primarily with units from NSF funded kits and focuses on adapting the lessons to work with students in a particular situation. These adaptations have proven successful in three important ways: (1) they brought to the professional development program K-6 teachers who had previously been reluctant to teach science or partic...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
