<AbstractNarration>Rutgers University seeks support for a 4-year full-scale project in Bioinformatics. This project addresses two grand challenges-Cutting-edge STEM Content and K-12 Science Assessments. Using DNA Sequencing Analysis Program (DSAP) that will be modified by the proposed project, high school students and teachers will learn molecular biology and modern genetics by working with authentic genomic sequences, and submit their findings for review by scientists. The objective of this project is to develop state-of-the-art web-based tools and resources that will make it possible for high school students to conduct authentic research in bioinformatics. To accomplish this objective the project will employ the following methods: First scientists from Rutgers University Waksman Institute will team with educators from WestEd, a nonprofit research, development and service agency, to produce an online embedded assessment tool that will be used to provide feedback about student understanding of molecular biology, bioinformatics, and related subjects. The project will also take advantage of experienced high school teachers in this regard. Secondly, the DSAP tool (consisting of five  separate yet interrelated components: (1) a student DNA sequence analysis scaffolding program; (2) an administrative program that allows teachers to view student work, students to evaluate peers, and teachers to communicate with their students; (3) a staff administrative program that allows the researchers to observe student and teacher work, and interact with both groups; (4) an embedded assessment tool that will monitor and measure student learning; (5) a series of tutorials and "help modules" that will guide students through their DNA sequence analysis. Thirdly, over a four-year period the DSAP tool will be field-tested, revised, piloted, and disseminated guided by formative assessment, project evaluation, and teacher/student feedback. These programs will be designed to be used in two settings: locally, with teachers and students who attend a summer institute at Rutgers University, and remotely, with teachers and students over the Internet.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Bioinformatics: Learning by Doing is a NSF Discovery Research K-12 full-scale project. Its primary goal was to develop state-of-the-art, web-based tools and resources that support high school students as they conduct authentic research in bioinformatics, the computational analysis of biological data and databases. The bioinformatic analyses of the DNA sequences performed by the students used the same programs and databases used by practicing scientists.

Using DSAP, students are able to analyze novel authentic DNA sequence data and are able to publish their findings on the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) databases that are used by scientists around the world.   DSAP is an online, multifaceted, interactive, learning, and teaching tool that includes embedded assessments, tutorials, videos, and Help Modules (Fig 1).  There are five main components to DSAP:  a scaffolding learning program for students;  an administrative program for monitoring teacher/student interactions;  an administrative program used by staff and teachers for critiquing student work;  an embedded assessment tool;  a series of supporting tutorials, videos, and Help Modules.    Over the duration of the project, more than 5,200 teachers and students used DSAP to analyze DNA sequences and publish their results on the NCBI DNA sequence databases.  In working through DSAP, students developed competencies with information gathering and Information Technology (IT) literacy, as well as critical thinking and problem solving skills. These are 21st Century Skills that will prepare students for the demands of a career in the fields of science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM), and enhance their scientific literacy.    Intellectual merits:  Using DSAP, students became knowledgeable about molecular biology and bioinformatics. Scientists worked with education specialists to develop DSAP and supporting materials.   Broader impacts:  By using DSAP, students participated in an authentic research project. They made meaningful contributions to the scientific community by publishing their work so that researchers worldwide can access and make use of their analyses.  DSAP enabled all students, regardless of socioeconomic background and/or geographic location, to participate in original research and contribute to scientific investigations and interact with practicing scientists using web-based resources developed in this project.
