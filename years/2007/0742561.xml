<AbstractNarration>GRADUATE TEACHING FELLOWS IN K-12 EDUCATION&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PROPOSAL #: 0742561&lt;br/&gt;PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Gretchen Rollwagen-Bollens &lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION: Washington State University&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: Global Change in a Local Context: Partners in Discovery of the Columbia River Watershed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Partners in Discovery GK-12 project brings Washington State University Vancouver (WSUV) science graduate students and faculty together with Clark County, Washington, science teachers in a collaborative partnership. The central theme of this GK-12 project is ?Global Change in a Local Context,? with the Columbia River Watershed as the unifying environmental feature around which students connect science concepts from their classrooms to their own ?backyard.? Clark County is located on the southwest border of Washington State, along a 100-mile stretch of the lower Columbia River. The Columbia River Watershed, extending from the high Cascade glaciers to the estuary and river mouth, encompasses the entire county and is the defining feature of this region ? environmentally, economically and culturally. Clark County, with nearly 400,000 residents, is the fastest-growing county in Washington, and is experiencing dramatic changes in population, housing construction, land use, etc., that are directly impacting the watershed. Thus the watershed and the Global/Local theme provide a compelling and relevant context within which to explore science disciplinary content (Earth, Life and Physical Sciences) through inquiry, and in particular how change in nature is manifested in a local system and how those changes affect students as individuals and communities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Partners in Discovery GK-12 project is structured around year-long one-on-one partnerships between WSUV graduate student Fellows and grades 6th ? 9th   science Teachers in four Clark County school districts. Fellows and Teachers will engage students in authentic scientific inquiry focused on the nature and impacts of change in the Columbia River Watershed. The Fellow-Teacher partnerships will utilize each district?s existing curriculum and revise or augment their science ?kits? by identifying questions and inquiry activities that link instructional modules to state and national science standards, and to the complementary expertise of WSUV research faculty and graduate students working in the Watershed. The program will support 6 to 10 Fellows-teacher partnerships per year for a total of five years. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The "Partners in Discovery of the Columbia River Watershed" GK-12 project brought Washington State University Vancouver (WSUV) environmental science graduate students and faculty together with Clark County, Washington science teachers in a collaborative partnership.  The central theme of this GK-12 project was "Global Change in a Local Context," with the Columbia River Watershed as the unifying environmental and cultural feature around which students connected science concepts from their classrooms to their own "backyard."  The primary focus of our project was the one-on-one partnership between a WSUV environmental science graduate student Fellow and a 6th &ndash; 9th grade science teacher.  In this GK-12 project, we encouraged and provided opportunities for GK-12 Fellows and science teachers to participate in constructive dialogue and collaboration to deeply understand, build upon, and expand existing, science curricula with inquiry-based activities and lessons specifically related to the Columbia River Watershed and aligned with both Washington state and national science standards.  This collaboration between the Fellow and teacher primarily occurred in the teacherÆs classroom as the partners jointly developed and led these activities, and worked together to engage students in the teacherÆs curriculum.  The Partners in Discovery project also provided participants with meaningful and relevant professional development led by WSUV science and education faculty, through a bi-weekly pedagogy seminar series for Fellows, two full-day and four late afternoon professional development workshops for all participants during the academic year.  Our overall project goals were to:  Improve graduate student FellowsÆ abilities to teach science through inquiry, to use and apply research in the classroom, and to communicate science to non-scientists; also to improve FellowsÆ appreciation for and commitment to K-12 outreach. Improve TeachersÆ abilities to teach science through inquiry and to use and apply research in the classroom; also to improve TeachersÆ science content knowledge. Enrich Clark County 6th &ndash; 9th grade studentsÆ science education and build their enthusiasm for science. Strengthen scientist-teacher partnerships between WSUV and Clark County schools. Integrate the GK-12 partnership model into all WSUV Science graduate programs.   At the end of our 5-year GK-12 project, our teacher participants reported that the FellowsÆ ability to teach to middle school students improved and that the Fellows had a better understanding of how middle school students learn. Most teachers reported that the fellows improved their communication skills and improved their ability to engage the class by using hands-on activities or visuals.  Moreover, all teachers and Fellows reported that the Fellows gained an appreciation for the challenges teachers face, and better understood the constraints teachers work within when using a particular curriculum and trying to adapt their teaching to meet changing standards.  Most importantly, all of the Fellows interviewed were eager to collaborate with K&ndash;12 educators in some future capacity.  In addition to the projectÆs impacts on graduate student Fellows, all of the teacher participants interviewed reported increased science content knowledge in specific areas of expertise held by their partnering Fellows. Over the course of the project, this included engineering, marine biology, how plants interact with the environment at the chemical level, physics and physical science, biology, and chemistry.  The teachers also reported increased use of student-centered teaching approaches and interactive strategies when teaching science.  The Partners in Discovery GK-12 project also actively engaged &gt;3,000 6th-9th grade students over the project period from 2008-2014.  In surveys of students taken at the beginning and end of each academic year, they demonstrated an increase between the presurvey and postsurvey f...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
