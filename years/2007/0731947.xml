<AbstractNarration>Deep-sea hydrothermal fluids circulate through vast portions of the earth?s crust. Volcanically derived gases and products from water-rock reactions support chemolithoautotrophic microbial communities that might be pervasive within the subseafloor and contribute significantly to deep-ocean and subseafloor biomass production. Microorganisms in low-temperature terrestrial environments are commonly segregated by metabolism along chemical gradients. However, demonstration of a similar distribution pattern of organisms along geochemical gradients in deep-sea geothermal environments to date has been rare. The use of hyperthermophiles for such a study is ideal since these organisms are generally not found in contaminating background seawater and since their metabolisms likely reflect the chemistry and temperature of their environment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding the distribution of different types of chemolithoautotrophic hyperthermophiles in sulfide deposits and diffuse hydrothermal fluids will provide insight into the distribution of much larger populations of autotrophic organisms that may be living in the deep subsurface biosphere. This study will take an important step towards quantitative modeling of microbes in surface and subsurface vent environments by combining metabolic rates from laboratory culture studies with detailed field measurements of fluid chemistry constraints on metabolic reactions. The data will be critical to advancing whole-system models of hydrothermal systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will address 3 of the 7 fundamental goals in the RIDGE 2000 Science Plan: 1) determining how biological activity affects vent chemistry, 2) characterizing the forces and linkages that determine the structure and extent of the hydrothermal biosphere, and 3) examination of the nature and space/time extent of the deep subseafloor biosphere. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will include educational benefits in five areas: 1) graduate student training, 2) undergraduate student training, 3) scientific involvement of underrepresented groups, 4) application of information in courses taught by the investigators, and 5) public education outreach.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Although hidden from view, volcanoes in the deep ocean provide a huge, global-scale habitat for microbes that live off the chemical energy produced by the interaction of seawater with hot rock and magmatic gases. Chemo-synthetic microbes form the base of a food chain that produces oases of unique hydrothermal life. There is an extremely high diversity of microbial life capable of deriving energy from hundreds of chemical reactions that occur when volcanic hot spring fluids mix with cold ambient seawater.  There are many big questions related to this sub-seafloor biosphere:   How much living organic material (biomass) is there? How fast do microbes produce biomass?  How much of the total available energy is captured by microbes and converted to biomass?  What are the effects on the overlying ocean?    To answer these questions, we need to construct models of energy flow and biological productivity in hydrothermal systems.  Our research for this project is designed to produce the essential building blocks for such models.
