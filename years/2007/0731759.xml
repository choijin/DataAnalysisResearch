    <AbstractNarration>This proposal has two main scientific components. The first part is a&lt;br/&gt;project to understand relatively hyperbolic groups and CAT(0) spaces&lt;br/&gt;with isolated flats, two topics that are tightly connected by previous&lt;br/&gt;work of the PI with Bruce Kleiner. The PI plans to continue a joint&lt;br/&gt;project with Kim Ruane to study the topology of the boundary of a&lt;br/&gt;space with isolated flats and its relation to group splittings. The&lt;br/&gt;PI also plans to continue work in progress with Daniel Wise on&lt;br/&gt;a-T-menability and its relation to CAT(0) cubical complexes. In&lt;br/&gt;particular, they plan to cubulate many classes of hyperbolic and&lt;br/&gt;relatively hyperbolic groups.&lt;br/&gt;In second main component, the PI plans to continue a program to study&lt;br/&gt;the lattice theory of the automorphism group of a simplicial complex,&lt;br/&gt;in a joint project&lt;br/&gt;with Benson Farb. This program is at the frontier between geometric&lt;br/&gt;group theory and the theory of discrete subgroups of Lie groups and&lt;br/&gt;linear algebraic groups, and generalizes recent work of Bass--Lubotzky&lt;br/&gt;on tree lattices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI is interested in the large scale geometry of spaces with&lt;br/&gt;nonpositive curvature. That is, they have a nontrivial mixture of&lt;br/&gt;negative curvature (like a saddle) and zero curvature (flat like a&lt;br/&gt;piece of paper), but no positive curvature (like the surface of a&lt;br/&gt;ball). More specifically, his research has focused on nonpositively&lt;br/&gt;curved spaces with isolated flats. These spaces are almost negatively&lt;br/&gt;curved in the sense that the flat, zero curvature, parts do not&lt;br/&gt;interact with each other. Thus techniques from the elegant theory of&lt;br/&gt;negatively curved spaces can sometimes be adapted to hold for spaces&lt;br/&gt;with isolated flats. In a separate project (joint with Benson Farb),&lt;br/&gt;the PI is studying the symmetries admitted by nonpositively curved&lt;br/&gt;spaces built by gluing together polygons along their edges. This&lt;br/&gt;project is an attempt to bridge the gap between the mathematical&lt;br/&gt;fields of geometric group theory and linear algebraic groups.</AbstractNarration>
