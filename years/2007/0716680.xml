<AbstractNarration>Amphibians are important components of aquatic and terrestrial habitats and can represent an important energetic link between the two, particularly in the tropics where diversity and abundance are greatest. However, amphibian populations are declining dramatically around the world, with catastrophic losses occurring even in remote, undisturbed regions of the tropics. Declines often result in the disappearance of over 75% of amphibians at a site, particularly species that breed in streams, and massive losses are reported from 13 Latin American countries in the last 20 years. This research will assess the ecological consequences of amphibian declines by investigating how these losses affect stream structure and function, including biodiversity, productivity, nutrient cycling, and energy and nutrient exchanges between streams and forests. This will be accomplished through intensive examinations of streams located along a moving disease front in Panama before and after disease-driven declines occur. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research addresses an urgent, global problem and will provide information critical for understanding the ecological consequences of extinction and the loss of biodiversity, one of the eight ?grand challenges? and four focal areas of research in the environmental sciences recommended by the National Research Council. Understanding the potential large-scale and far-reaching consequences of catastrophic reductions in biodiversity and extinction events such as these will allow for more accurate predicting of ecological function in light of declining global biodiversity.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The purpose of the research was to make a quantitative assessment of the impacts of a disease-driven extinction event.  Frogs are very susceptible to a fungus that attacks their skin.  The occurence of this fungus moved across Panama at about 25 km/year, so we studied frogs in upland streams before, during and after the wave of attack occurred.  There were 45 species of frogs whose tadpoles grew in the streams.  99% of the frogs were extirpated within 6 weeks of the appearance of the fungus.  Only a few tadpoles of 3 frog species have returned to these streams after a decade.  Many aspects of ecosystem processes were dramatically affected by the loss of tadpoles.  For example, more than 95% of the nitrogen cycling was lost because the tadpoles were the major grazers in the stream ecosystem and their excretion and recycling role was lost.  The insect larvae in the stream were unable to compensate for this role after the extinction.  The algae in the stream increased four-fold and were still above the original background level 10 years after the wave of fungus moved through.  The community structure of the remaining species was altered greatly as well.  There were declines in insect larvae shredders that resulted in changes in decomposition and the grazer species shifted to larger bodied species.  The extinction even affected the frog-eating snakes that lived near the streams.  They were largely extirpated as well.
