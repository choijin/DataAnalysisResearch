<AbstractNarration>This new REU site is a partnership between the Virginia Bioinformatics Institute and the Interdisciplinary Center for Applied Mathematics, both at Virginia Tech.  The objective of the program is to provide a 10-week residential summer research experience for undergraduate students from around the U.S. including Puerto Rico, with the goal of increasing their desire and preparation to enter a Ph.D. program in mathematics or computational biology.  The students are paired with mentors working on research projects focusing on mathematical models of biological networks, from the cellular to the organism and population scales.  The two partner institutes provide a vibrant multi-disciplinary research environment, involving a broad range of the mathematical and life sciences.  Special emphasis is placed on recruiting a diverse group of participants.</AbstractNarration>
