<AbstractNarration>Abstract &lt;br/&gt;Dissolved organic matter, DOM, is a major reservoir of organic carbon in estuaries and the ocean. It plays a key role in coastal ecosystem ecology as a food source for microbes, sunscreen against ultraviolet radiation for plankton, and a chemical reactant affecting water quality. This project seeks to understand the role of tidal marshes as sources of DOM. The abundance of marshes in the Chesapeake Bay (70,000 ha) make this an ideal place for addressing several key questions. Do the properties of DOM differ between freshwater and saltwater estuaries? Are differences due to the types of plants the adjacent marshes support or amount of salt in the water? Do microbes grow differently on DOM from certain marsh types? A comprehensive array of methods will be used to answer these questions including field studies, optical properties, chemical analyses and novel laboratory studies. The ultimate goal is to better understand what regulates sources and fates of DOM as it is transported by estuaries to the coastal ocean. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will improve our ability to use ocean color remote sensing to understand aspects of the ecology of the Chesapeake Bay and other coastal zones. Because DOM production is an important process in global carbon cycling, the research also will contribute to our understanding of the controls on atmospheric carbon dioxide and, hence, climate change. The work promotes teaching, training, and learning by incorporating research into the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center's (SERC) public education programs, which brings hands-on science experiences to nearly 10,000 children every year. The public will learn about the research through mass media, websites, and public events hosted at SERC and the University of Maryland. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Dissolved organic matter (DOM), a major reservoir of organic carbon in the ocean, plays a central role in many biogeochemical processes in aquatic ecosystems, affecting carbon budgets, nutrient availability, ecosystem productivity, ocean color, and aquatic photochemistry. Tidal marshes have been previously shown to be important sources of carbon and nutrients to near-shore waters. The focus of our project was the largely uncharacterized optical and chemical quality, photo-reactivity, degradability, and molecular composition of the DOM exported from tidal marshes.   Information on these characteristics are needed to better understand the effects of marsh tidal exchanges on estuarine photochemical and biological processes.     We performed measurements for tidal marsh systems from all parts of the Chesapeake Bay region (Figure 1), in general these showed that both freshwater and estuarine marshes had strong effects on the dynamics and characteristics of the DOM in adjacent bay waters.   Tidal marshes export DOM which is highly absorbing of visible and ultraviolet radiation (especially long wavelength UVA) and is enriched in high molecular weight compounds. A considerable fraction (as much as half) of tidal marsh DOM can be digested by bacteria.  As a carbon source for bacteria, and thus for other organisms that consume bacteria, it is more important than other Bay DOM.  Sunlight exposure quickly bleaches the tidal marsh DOM specifically breaking down the high molecular weight compounds.  Solar action starts bleaching DOM as soon as it is discharged from a marsh into estuarine waters.  Nevertheless, in our mapping studies, we observed that the elevated DOM can be optically detected for hundreds of meters downstream from a tidal marsh.  This means that the influence of tidal marshes on estuaries can be monitored remotely, for example, by satellite sensors.     The results from this study will be used to better integrate tidal marshes into computer models of the Bay ecosystem.  The activities were also the basis for providing training to three research assistants and six undergraduate interns (five female, one African-American) (Figure 2).  The results are being transmitted to the scientific community and general public through many different media including scientific papers, invited book chapters and a web site (listed separately), talks and posters at scientific conferences (23 so far) and public lectures  (10 so far).
