<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit:  This award supports a workshop to address the topic of Antarctic Integrated &amp; System Science.  Approximately 40 accomplished US scientists, including 6 early career scientists will be convened for 2.5 days in June 2007 to address whether there are Antarctic research themes and topics that would be better served by integration and a systems approach to their organization.  They will also consider whether there are lessons to be learned from experiences in the Arctic System Science that would facilitate an integrated and systems approach in Antarctica.  Finally they will address how the community wishes to provide guidance for an Antarctic Integrated &amp; Systems Science program at NSF.  The timing of this workshop is to take advantage of momentum provided by International Polar Year activities and a host of international planning activities currently underway.  The intellectual merit of this workshop is in focusing the US community to lay out desired research directions and advisory governance structure for an Antarctic Integrated &amp; System Science Program at NSF. The objective is to assure that compelling and relevant science questions are addressed in this domain.&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: This workshop will help to broaden the perspective of U.S. scientists, and provide an opportunity for the next generation of scientists to interact with leaders in the field. This award will also provide support for applicants from underrepresented groups, as well as early career scientists and students.  A major outcome of this proposal will foster a new way of undertaking science in Antarctica that should promote potentially transformative findings. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
