<AbstractNarration>This is a project to conduct a 10.5-day cruise to collect deep-towed sidescan sonar and chirp sub-bottom profile data, CTD measurements, water samples, and TowCam imagery over a large region of the off-axis seafloor in Guaymas Basin in order to identify areas of venting fluid and gas. This work will test the hypothesis that substantial venting of carbon-rich fluid and gas occurs off axis in Guaymas Basin as a result of thermogenic reactions driven by off-axis magmatic intrusion into organic-rich sediments.&lt;br/&gt;These data will identify bathymetric and sub-bottom features such as mounds, pock marks, and faults that are indicative of present and past venting; image and photograph high backscatter features such as bacterial mats, authigenic carbonate, or biological communities that are indicative of fluid flux; and provide a means, through analysis of water samples, to distinguish between biogenic and thermogenic sources of methane and other hydrocarbons in the off-axis sedimented ridge setting.&lt;br/&gt;This work supports IODP Birth of Oceans Mission Proposal and IODP proposal 658 Full related to sill production and methane generation during breakup of N. Atlantic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt; This effort will contribute to knowledge of sources and sinks in the global carbon cycle, which is a strong forcing function in past and present climate change. The project promotes international collaboration through the participation of Dr. Bill Bandy and Dr. Carlos Mortera of Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, and it promotes education through the participation of two U.S. and two Mexican graduate students in the research cruise and subsequent analyses.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant funded a cruise (AT15-54) to Guaymas Basin, in the Gulf of California, aboard the R/V Atlantis in October, 2009.  The main goal of this cruise was to test the hypothesis that magma from the mantle intrudes through the igneous crust and into sediments over a wide area within Guaymas Basin.  The Gulf of California is a young sea that formed when the Baja California peninsula rifted away from Mexico.  The peninsula is actually the southern extension of a "micro" plate that encompasses the peninsula as well as a large portion of the state of California.  The plate boundary between this micro-plate and North America is effectively the San Andreas fault system within California.  To the south, the San Andreas fault transitions into a system of short mid-ocean ridge (MOR) segments bounded by transform faults.  Each of these spreading segments has a name, and Guaymas Basin is a spreading segment in the central part of the gulf.  We collected seismic data in Guaymas Basin during an NSF-funded cruise in 2002.  Results from that project suggested that active magmatism extends to distances of 40-50 km from the spreading center in Guaymas Basin.  This is very different than most other MORs, where magmatism is confined to less than 10 km from the plate boundary.  In addition, the spreading center in Guaymas Basin is covered by thick sediments, and intruding magma is emplaced into these sediments.  When hot (&gt;1000&deg;C) magma intrudes carbon-rich sediments, the resulting reactions release large quantities of CO2 and methane, both important greenhouse gases.  Thus, results from the 2002 cruise suggest that Guaymas Basin and other similar sediment-covered spreading systems may release far more greenhouse gases than previously thought.  The 2009 cruise, funded by the grant described here, was designed to test this hypothesis.  Our hypothesis predicted that widespread, active magmatic intrusion into organic rich sediments would have an obvious expression at the seafloor in the form of biological communities that are hosted by the methane release from the reactions taking place below the seafloor.  The AT15-54 cruise involved seafloor mapping, seafloor photography, and near-seafloor water sampling to look for and then verify the existence of these communities.  We found more than a hundred such sites over a 20-by-85 km region around the spreading center.  These sites were revealed by the side-scan sonar data as ~200-m-diameter bright backscatter features distributed throughout the survey area, which otherwise has a low-relief, low-backscatter, muddy seafloor.  At seven of these sites, we lowered an instrument package consisting of a digital camera, water-sampling bottles, and a conductivity/temperature/depth (CTD) sensor.  Seafloor photographs revealed that the high-backscatter of these sites was due to biological communities typical of warm seep areas, including clams, tubeworms, bacterial mats, and authegenic carbonate.  The CTD showed temperature increases above the communities, and the water samples showed methane concentrations well above background.  In addition, Helium isotopes were measured for several of these samples, and they all indicated 3He/4He ratios indicative of a magmatic origin for the heat driving thermogenic methanogenesis.  The consistency of these combined observations strongly suggests that most if not all of the identified high-backscatter locations are also sites of seafloor biological communities.  The broad distribution of these sites in turn implies a broad zone of active, shallow magmatic intrusion into the organic-rich sediments.  These findings have implications for the carbon budget of sedimented spreading systems and for the geodynamic controls on melt focusing at mid-ocean ridges.  Sedimented spreading systems exists in many places, such as the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden, the Sea of Japan, the South China Sea, the Okinawa Trough, the back-arc basins of Tonga, Mariana, and other arcs, and numerous ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
