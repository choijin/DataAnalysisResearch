<AbstractNarration>This award is an outcome of the National Science Foundation 07-506 program solicitation "George E. Brown, Jr. Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES) Research" competition. This project is led by the University of Nevada, Reno, and includes subawards to the Consortium of Universities for Research in Earthquake Engineering, Cornell University, Georgia Institute of Technology, North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, North Carolina State University, Rutherford and Chekene, State University of New York at Buffalo, and University of California-San Diego. Nonstructural systems represent 75 percent of the loss exposure of U.S. buildings to earthquakes, and account for over 78 percent of the total estimated national annualized earthquake loss. A very widely used nonstructural system is the ceiling-piping-partition system.  Ceiling-piping-partition systems consist of several components and subsystems, have complex three-dimensional geometries and complicated boundary conditions because of their multiple attachment points to the main structure, and are spread over large areas in all directions. Their seismic response, their interaction with the structural system they are suspended from or attached to, and their failure mechanisms are not well understood.  Moreover, their damage levels and fragilities are poorly defined due to the lack of system-level experimental studies and modeling capability. Their seismic behavior cannot be dependably analyzed and predicted due to a lack of numerical simulation tools. In addition, modern protective technologies, which are readily used in structural systems, have never been applied to these systems.  This project integrates multidisciplinary system-level studies that will develop, for the first time, a simulation capability and implementation process for enhancing the seismic performance of the ceiling-piping-partition nonstructural system.  The experimental program will use the NEES equipment sites at the University of Nevada, Reno and State University of New York at Buffalo to conduct subsystem and system-level full-scale experiments. A payload project using the Japanese E-Defense shake table facility in Miki, Hyogo, Japan, is planned in coordination with Japanese researchers.  Integrated with the experimental effort will be a numerical simulation program that will develop experimentally verified analytical models, establish system and subsystem fragility functions, and develop visualization tools that will provide engineering educators and practitioners with sketch-based modeling capabilities.  Public policy investigations are designed to support the implementation of the research results, including the use of representative index buildings and urban planning tools to estimate the cost benefits of the new protective devices and design concepts at both the individual building and the metropolitan area scales.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results will address implementation barriers and provide public policy rationales for amendments to building codes and standards and related guidelines. The project collaborates closely with industry through a Practice Committee consisting of experts representing all aspects of the ceiling-piping-partition nonstructural systems.  This project includes a science museum interface with K-12 students and the general public; summer engineering camps for minority and female students; hands on experience to students of a community college; outreach programs to engineers, architects and industry practitioners; and plans for revisions to building codes, standards, and performance-based earthquake engineering guidelines.  Data from this project will be made available through the NEES data repository (http://www.nees.org).</AbstractNarration>

Therefore, to better understand the acceleration demands on nonstructural systems, a portion of this study focused on the influence of building characteristics (e.g. dimensions and flexibility) on the horizontal and vertical floor acceleration response. Several component-level tests were conducted on ceiling systems to better understand individual responses such as strength capacities of interlocking ceiling grid member connections, perimeter connections, and supporting elements.  Full-scale experimental results on ceiling systems show that complete ceiling collapse initiates from perimeter damage such as the ceiling grid members unseating from the perimeter angles in which they rest.  Fragility curves representing the seismic vulnerability of a system were developed from experimental data and show that ceiling systems become more vulnerable to damage when the system is excited by multiple directions, when heavier tiles are used, when the ceiling area increases, and when restraints are removed.  A series of analytical models were established to evaluate damage in ceiling systems caused by: system deformations, vibrations of supporting floor decks, uplift of ceiling tiles, and perimeter connection joints.

In addition, system-level results show that damage caused from pipe displacement is more common than damage caused by joint rotation or the weight of the system on supporting members. Numerical models for piping systems were developed that are capable of providing good estimates of dynamic responses in terms of piping displacements, piping accelerations, piping joint rotations at critical locations, progression of damage in supporting elements, as well as severe water leakage prediction.
