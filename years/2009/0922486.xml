<AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this project is to acquire instrumentation for a new high-power energy storage system research laboratory facility.  This equipment will enable crucial research that bridges the gap between electrochemical mechanics and the need for control models and algorithms at the battery-pack scale.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: Basic research conducted with this equipment will investigate (1) new electrochemical cell formulations for increased performance; (2) surrogate modeling for real-time control system imple-mentations; (3) advanced sensing to accurately and robustly estimate cell internal state; (4) battery con-trols to maximize lifetime and optimize performance, including (5) hardware-in-the-loop validation.  Results from this research have very practical application to control of batteries for electric drive vehicles, optimizing the multiple objectives of performance, safety, and longevity.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: This work will help to accelerate the development and deployment of the electrified drive-train, enhance environmental and quality-of-life factors, and improve national security by reducing dependence on foreign oil. Hands-on, research-focused experiences will give expert training to under-graduate and graduate students of diverse backgrounds, preparing them to pursue careers in academia and the battery industry.  Cell test results will be made broadly available via an on-line database, and special-ized data sets and demonstrations will be generated for K-12 students and teachers to stimulate excite-ment in STEM.  Industry partners will conduct research projects using the laboratory facility.  A three-way collaboration will be established between diverse educational institutions, involving students and faculty from multiple disciplines.  Results will be disseminated in multi- and interdisciplinary conference proceedings and journals.</AbstractNarration>
