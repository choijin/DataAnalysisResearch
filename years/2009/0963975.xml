<AbstractNarration>The probabilistic method is a powerful tool to establish the existence&lt;br/&gt;of diverse objects of importance in several applications. For example,&lt;br/&gt;Shannon's famous theorem asserts that a random codebook can be used&lt;br/&gt;for reliably transmitting information at optimal rates on a noisy&lt;br/&gt;channel. It is well known that a random graph is typically "Ramsey"&lt;br/&gt;and has no large clique or independent set, and a random sparse graph&lt;br/&gt;is very likely to be an expander with excellent connectivity.  Yet, in&lt;br/&gt;applications it is important to explicitly construct such an object&lt;br/&gt;with a certified guarantee of the desired property. Obtaining such&lt;br/&gt;constructions of comparable strength to what is guaranteed by the&lt;br/&gt;probabilistic method is typically much harder and often unknown.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pseudorandomness is a broad area that deals with efficiently&lt;br/&gt;generating objects that exhibit the desirable properties of&lt;br/&gt;"random-like" objects despite being constructed either explicitly or&lt;br/&gt;with limited randomness. Such pseudorandom constructions are important&lt;br/&gt;in the study of error-correcting codes, complexity theory,&lt;br/&gt;combinatorics, cryptography, and high-dimensional geometry. Research&lt;br/&gt;in recent years has addressed some of these challenges and led to&lt;br/&gt;powerful constructions of error-correcting codes, expander graphs,&lt;br/&gt;randomness extractors, Ramsey graphs, compressed sensing matrices,&lt;br/&gt;etc. Despite the seemingly different definitions and motivations for&lt;br/&gt;the study of these objects, much of this progress was based on&lt;br/&gt;insights uncovering intimate connections between them, leading to a&lt;br/&gt;rich theory with a common pool of broadly useful techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This progress notwithstanding, explicit constructions with optimal&lt;br/&gt;parameters typically remain open, and the area is full of exciting new&lt;br/&gt;directions motivated by emerging applications. This project will&lt;br/&gt;involve a comprehensive collection of interconnected research&lt;br/&gt;activities focusing on the theory of error-correcting codes and&lt;br/&gt;pseudorandomness. The directions pursued will include strengthening&lt;br/&gt;the existing connections between various pseudorandom constructs and&lt;br/&gt;discovering new computational applications thereof, and investigating&lt;br/&gt;the pseudorandom properties of codes and related objects that have&lt;br/&gt;important structural characteristics often needed in applications&lt;br/&gt;(such as linearity or sparsity). Topics in coding theory inspired by&lt;br/&gt;complexity theory such as list decoding and locally testable codes,&lt;br/&gt;and codes for poorly understood noise models such as deletion channels&lt;br/&gt;will be studied.  Another important goal of the project is to bridge&lt;br/&gt;the gap between worst-case and probabilistic noise models via codes&lt;br/&gt;for channels with natural computational restrictions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will use ideas from computer science in setting new&lt;br/&gt;directions for research in coding theory as well as discovering new&lt;br/&gt;constructions of codes and decoding algorithms, thereby enhancing the&lt;br/&gt;connection between the computer science and information theory&lt;br/&gt;communities.  The discovery of new coding schemes has potential direct&lt;br/&gt;applications in communication and storage of data. Many of the&lt;br/&gt;questions to be addressed, therefore, have a natural practical&lt;br/&gt;connection alongside their fundamental theoretical appeal.  On the&lt;br/&gt;education front, the project will engage several graduate students and&lt;br/&gt;provide a stimulating research environment for them, and help with the&lt;br/&gt;planned writing of a "goal-oriented" textbook on coding theory.</AbstractNarration>
