<AbstractNarration>CMMI ? 0926851:  Nonlinear Mechanics of Graphene-Based Materials&lt;br/&gt;PI: Rui Huang, University of Texas at Austin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). The objective of this project is to develop a theoretical framework for monolayer graphene based on nonlinear continuum mechanics and atomistic modeling. Within the framework, the fundamental mechanical properties of monolayer graphene and its derivatives will be systematically studied. First, a nonlinear continuum theory will be developed for two-dimensional sheets under arbitrary deformation in the three-dimensional space. Next, atomistic modeling approaches will be developed to simulate and deduce the fundamental mechanical properties of monolayer graphene. The continuum theory and atomistic modeling methodology will then be combined to study carbon nanotubes and graphene nanoribbons as two basic forms of graphene-based materials. Finally, integrated graphene structures with graphene monolayers interacting with supporting substrates will be investigated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With a wealth of exceptional physical properties, graphene holds great promises for a variety of applications, including graphene-based composite materials, nanoelectronics and electromechanical resonators. The research on mechanical properties of graphene will complement the already abundant research activities in material science and condensed-matter physics that have largely focused on its electronic properties. It is envisioned that fundamental understanding of the mechanics of graphene-based materials will open new perspectives for both fundamental physics and practical applications. In addition, education and outreach activities will be incorporated within the proposed project to enhance its societal impacts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
