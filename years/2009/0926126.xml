<AbstractNarration>The proposed U.S.-Brazil planning visit will allow the U.S. PIs Drs. Christopher Steiner and Keshav C. Das (University of Georgia, UGA) to meet with Brazilian collaborators at EMBRAPA (Agricultural Research Agency of Brazil) Drs. Wenceslau Teixeira and Marcos Garcia to plan an interdisciplinary, collaborative research program in agricultural productivity.  Deforestation by the use of fire is a major environmental concern for both the world and Brazil.  An alternative known as "slash and char" would produce charcoal out of re-growing biomass for soil amelioration purposes instead of conversion to CO2 by fire (slash and burn).  Its efficiency has been demonstrated in Brazil by EMBRAPA.  The use of charcoal as soil amendment (biochar) would establish a carbon sink and improve sustainability of tropical agriculture.  For the planning visit the UGA team will bring its expertise in carbon cycling and transformation while EMBRAPA will provide its ample experience with tropical agriculture and biochar.  Because Brazil is a leader in the area of biomass and alternate energy, both sides will benefit much from the successful establishment of research collaborations in agricultural productivity.</AbstractNarration>
