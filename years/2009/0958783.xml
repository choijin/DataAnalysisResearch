<AbstractNarration>This PAARE grant will strengthen an existing partnership between researchers at the University of Texas at El Paso and the University of Texas at Austin. The research areas of the proposed work are related to interacting binary stars, in particular the study of accreting black holes and neutron stars in X-ray binary systems. Observations will be conducted primarily at the McDonald Observatory which is operated by UT-Austin; however, this research will be supplemented by work done at the UTEP campus observatory. The proposed research has broad scientific impact since the formation and growth of massive black holes is related to the formation of galaxies, quasars, and gamma-ray bursts in ways that are not yet understood. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The partnership will strive to attract and include Hispanic astronomers and educations to the program through access to the front-line research capabilities of McDonald and the well-known reputation of UT-Austin as a center for astronomy research. The main goal of this partnership is the development of a sustainable astronomy and astrophysics program at UTEP that emphasizes both astrophysical research and a culture of education and outreach within the program. The team will reach out to the local Hispanic community by providing direct observational experience to students at UTEP and McDonald, by providing promising students a path to a career in astronomy through UTEP to UT-Austin or other schools, and by establishing the UTEP astronomy program that will continue on after this PAARE grant is finished. An additional ~500 students per year will gain astronomy experience by performing night-time observing at the UTEP facility.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The scientific goal of this project was to study masses of black holes and neutron stars to get a better understanding of the equation of state of neutron star matter.  The broader-impact goal was to provide research opportunities in astronomy to minority students of the El Paso, Texas region. The project consisted of a series of telescope observations using the 2.1m telescope of McDonald Observatory between September 2010 to June 2015 and the corresponding data reduction using IRAF.  In summary the observations were high speed and long term optical photometry on several neutron star and black hole X-ray binaries. We also participated in the international campaign to observe to observe an ultra-compact X-ray binary for 72 continuous hours with a contribution of 21 hours of data over three nights.  These activities were directed by PI Dr. Paul Mason (UTEP) and co-PI Dr. Robinson (McDonald Observatory) from 2010 to 2014 and by Dr. J. Lopez during 2014-2015. Nine undergraduate students participated at different times: Aurelio Paez (Spring 2011 to Spring 2012), Alex Price (Spring 2011 to Spring 2012), Lorena Monroy (Spring 2011 to summer 2012), Ryan Lee (Spring 2012), Emmanuel Gonzalez (Spring and summer 2012, 2014-2015), John Morales (Spring and summer 2012, 2014-2015), Sebastian Gomez (Summer 2012), Issac Lopez (Spring 2011, 2015). In the summer of 2015 a computational study of neutron star crusts was performed by UG student Enrique Ramirez-Homs.  Other participants were Dr. Amanda Bayless. (Southwest Research Institute) and Dr. Robert Hynes (Louisiana State University). The main results of the project were the measurement of masses of accreting black holes and neutron stars to find limits on a possible gap in the mass distribution between these sources, which helps constraining the equation of state of neutron star matter. We also measured the mass of what is likely the lowest mass black hole known.  In particular, we derived long-term ephemerides for 5 low-mass X-ray binaries, determined that UW CrB has an elliptical accretion disk, detected ellipsoidal variations in the LMXB, V1727 Cygni for the first time, managed to model observations of V1408 Aql with a simple 'text-book' accretion disk. We improved in optical photometry of interacting binaries due to the speed of data collection (1-10 seconds), the amount of time devoted to each target(20-30 nights of data covering 2 or more years) on a moderate sized telescope, and the small number of LMXB observers observing at optical wavelengths. These results were presented in seven journal articles and in over twenty presentations of the participating students and PI Mason at several international, national and regional conferences.  Some of these conferences were the 1/2012 AAS meeting (Austin), 7/2012 Chandra X-ray Binaries workshop (Boston), 8/2012 IAU General Assembly (Beijing), five posters 1/2013 AAS meeting (Long Beach), 2014 223rd American Astronomical Society Meeting (Washington DC), 10/2013 Meeting TS-APS at The University of Texas at Brownsville, and two student seminars at the Physics Department at UTEP. On the training of human resources, the project provided research opportunities to nine undergraduate students, out of which seven were Hispanics and one female. One of these students (Sebastian Gomez) won the prestigious Chambliss award for the top undergraduate presentation at the American Astronomical Society in June 2014, and another received a NIH/MARC scholarship at UTEP covering two full years.    On the educational side, in the Summer 2011 the "Astronomy option" was created in the Advanced Undergraduate Physics Laboratory with an enrollment of three students.  A ccd camera was obtained and the roof top observatory was made remotely operational. The programmatic goal of establishing an astrophysics research program at UTEP was achieved. An astrophysics course was offered in 2012. We also hosted and mentored five Early College High School student from El Paso Commu...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
