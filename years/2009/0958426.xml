<AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award from the Major Research and Instrumentation (MRI) program, supported by the Chemistry Division and the Office of Polar Programs, Professor Stanton S.H.Y. Ching, Stephen H. Loomis, T. Page Owen, Jr., Joseph Schroeder and Peter A. Siver will acquire a flame atomic absorption (AA) spectrometer to advance research and research training activities in chemistry and the life sciences at Connecticut College.  The following research will be carried out: (1) determining elemental compositions of microporous and nanostructured manganese oxides to correlate the influence on particle growth, catalytic activity, and electrochemical performance; (2) establishing relationships between concentrations of base cations (Na+, K+, Mg2+, and Ca2+) and the presence of specific species of chrysophyte and diatom algae in freshwater lakes along the North American east coast; (3) determining intracellular volumes in freshwater sponge gemmules by Li+ analysis; (4) analyzing Pb levels in blood and brain tissue of rats to study neuroprotective effects of chemical treatments for Pb poisoning; and (5) measuring soluble metal concentrations in digestive fluids and epidermal peels of carnivorous pitcher plants to study ion transport and salt tolerance in plants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flame Atomic Absorption spectroscopy enables researchers to perform elemental analysis of a sample particularly its metal content.  A flame atomizes the sample that is probed by a light source.  Since atoms and ions absorb light at characteristic wavelengths, identification and quantification of them from their spectral characteristics are realized.  The instrument will be used in research and undergraduate laboratory classes by students at Connecticut College and the nearby U.S. Coast Guard Academy.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[      The atomic absorption spectrometer obtained through this grant was used to advanced research and research training at Connecticut College.  The main function of this instrument is quantitative analysis of elements, especially metal elements, at both high and low concentrations.       The research applications were broad.  They included: (1) characterization of new nanostructured manganese oxides that have applications as solid catalysts for chemical syntheses of industrial chemicals, as sorbents for heavy metals and toxic organic compounds that might clean up of contaminated fresh water, and as new inexpensive and environmentally friendly electrode materials for rechargeable batteries; (2) neuroscientific  studies on the effect of lead poisoning in rats and how this affects their neurodevelopment and deficits in spacial learning and memory; (3) metal analyses of nectar from carnivorous pitcher plants to determine how these organisms process and absorb minerals extracted from their prey; (4) analysis lake water in New England for common metal ions such as sodium, potassium, magnesium, and calcium to determine their affects on lake alkalinity.       Educational activities related to research training involved use of the atomic absorption instrument in a variety of courses.  It was used in project-based labs in advanced general chemistry and inorganic chemistry.  It was also used in research-like applications or projects in advanced inorganic chemistry and instrumental methods of analysis.  The instrument was also used extensively in independent study research projects and honors study research.       Last Modified: 05/01/2013       Submitted by: Stanton S.H.Y. Ching]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
