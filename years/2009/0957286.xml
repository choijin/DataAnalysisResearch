<AbstractNarration>In this project supported by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and  Mechanisms Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor George McBane  and his students at Grand Valley State University will conduct calculations that will seek to describe the energy transfer reaction of  electronically excited oxygen molecules (O2) with nitrogen (N2). The goal of the  research is to identify the major pathways of the reaction, determine  the relative importance of each, estimate their rates, and determine how  the excess energy is deposited in the products. Diabatic potential  energy surfaces will be constructed using ab initio techniques and the  atomic motion on those surfaces will be modeled with trajectory surface  hopping calculations. A series of studies at restricted geometries will  be used to guide the final computational approach, since a brute-force  computational attack on the problem is too expensive to be practical. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The results of this research will be useful both to atmospheric modelers  and to experimentalists seeking new information on excited states of  oxygen in the atmosphere. The work will be carried out by Professor  McBane and undergraduate students at Grand Valley State, and  collaborator Dr. Reinhard Schinke of the Max Planck Institute for  Dynamics and Self Organization in Germany, who brings expertise in  electronic structure calculations. The research will strengthen the role  of computational research in the student community at GVSU, improve the  computational infrastructure there, and bring modern theoretical tools  to bear on an outstanding problem in aeronomy.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Electronically excited oxygen molecules (O2 in the "triplet Herzberg states'') are formed high in the atmosphere by several mechanisms, and act as a reservoir of solar energy.  This energy ultimately becomes distributed in the atmosphere as heat.  The initial steps in the distribution mechanism are largely unknown, though it is known that the first step for the majority of the excited molecules involves collision with nitrogen [1].  This project used computational methods to study collisions between the Herzberg-state oxygen molecules and nitrogen. Computational models of collisions with neon, a simpler one-atom collider with some properties similar to nitrogen, were also constructed. Four undergraduate students and one high school teacher participated in the work.   Laboratory studies from several different groups have provided clues about the relaxation process.  When isolated ozone (O3) molecules are dissociated with ultraviolet light at 226 nm, a few of the product oxygen molecules are formed in the  triplet Herzberg states [2].  When ozone is photodissociated in a bath of excess N2, ground state oxygen molecules with very large vibrational excitation are present with stable concentrations after two microseconds [3]. Oxygen molecules in the triplet Herzberg states with vibrational  excitation lose that vibrational energy very inefficiently in collisions [1]. Oxygen molecules can switch efficiently betwen one triplet Herzberg state and another in collisions [1].   The experimenters who measured the highly vibrationally excited O2 arising from ozone photodissociation in a nitrogen bath interpreted it as an immediate product of the dissociation reaction,and the nitrogen as playing no important role in its formation [3].  However, later theoretical study could find no apparent means of production of O2 with that much vibrational energy directly from the photodissociation, though a means of producing O2 in the triplet Herzberg states was apparent.  The theoretical work inspired the more recent experiment that showed that the triplet Herzberg states were definitely formed as a minor product of the dissociation [2].    These results suggested that the vibrationally excited O2 from ozone photodissociation in an N2 bath had come from a two-step process: first, dissociation to produce O2 in the triplet Herzberg states, and then conversion of the triplet Herzberg states to ground state, vibrationally excited, oxygen molecules by collisions with nitrogen. If that hypothesis was correct, then this same process would also play an important role in the atmospheric process that removes the triplet Herzberg states.  The current study was designed to model collisions between oxygen in the triplet Herzberg states and nitrogen, and if possible identify and characterize the conversion process.  The computational study confirmed and explained two characteristics of the collisions named above.  First, it is relatively easy for the excited molecules to switch from one triplet Herzberg state to another during collisions.  Second, vibrational excitation in those electronic states is not removed quickly during collisions; a typical molecule would require hundreds of collisions to lose one quantum of vibrational energy. The study identified the pathways by which both of those processes occur, and showed that they should be present for collisions with either nitrogen or neon.   However, the primary mechanism that was being sought has not yet been found.  While the models constructed during this project show clear paths between the different excited Herzberg states, they do not show a clear path between the Herzberg states and the ground electronic state.  In addition, for collisions with N2 to explain the appearance of highly vibrationally excited O2,  the O2 bond would need to stretch during the collision.  The study was designed to search for arrangements of the colliding molecules that would produce stretching, but none were found.   It is not cle...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
