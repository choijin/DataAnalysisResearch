    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a navigation grade chip-scale, low cost, rugged MEMS gyroscope sensor based on a matched resonance tuning fork architecture. In contrast, present day navigation grade gyroscopes are mechanical, fiber optic or ring laser systems that are very bulky, expensive and prone to failure over time. The goal of the Phase I project is to demonstrate the feasibility of the concept design by increasing the understanding of and addressing the various loss mechanisms in the device. The specific objectives include demonstrating the effect of (a) architecture design scaling and optimization (b) improvements to the mechanical quality factor and (c) development of methods for temperature compensation and management. In Phase I, these technical areas will be explored in order to demonstrate feasibility and the commercial potential of the design to achieve navigation grade performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will enable the manufacturing of high reliability, chip scale MEMS gyroscopes suitable for inertial systems capable of gyrocompassing. The research will greatly impact the development of devices for commercial, military, and homeland security markets. Specific gyrocompassing applications include high accuracy advanced survey tools for oil/gas exploration, and construction industries, defense systems, and navigation systems. In addition, this fundamental technology could enable new emerging inertial based navigation market opportunities where size, weight, cost and power are extremely critical factors such as micro-robots, small unmanned aerial systems and personal navigation.</AbstractNarration>
