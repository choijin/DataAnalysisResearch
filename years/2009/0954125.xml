<AbstractNarration>Graphs and networks are ubiquitous, encoding complex relationships &lt;br/&gt;ranging from chemical bonds to social interactions.  Hidden in these&lt;br/&gt;networks are the answers to many important questions in biology,&lt;br/&gt;business, and sociology.  In order to analyze complex networks, users &lt;br/&gt;have to master sophisticated computing and programming skills.  It &lt;br/&gt;indeed becomes a pain point for many scientists and engineers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is to change the state of the art by developing a &lt;br/&gt;general graph information system, which is able to address the needs &lt;br/&gt;of searching and mining complex networks.  Real-life networks are &lt;br/&gt;complex, not only having topological structures, but also containing &lt;br/&gt;heterogeneous contents and attributes associated with nodes and &lt;br/&gt;edges. The mixture of structures and contents raises two challenges &lt;br/&gt;that require new solutions for smarter and faster graph analysis.  &lt;br/&gt;First, new types of graph search and mining operations, such as graph &lt;br/&gt;aggregation, graph association, and graph pattern mining, are &lt;br/&gt;emerging.  Second, when graphs become complex and large, most of &lt;br/&gt;existing graph mining algorithms cannot scale well.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses these challenges and performs a &lt;br/&gt;comprehensive study of a general graph information system.  &lt;br/&gt;The system includes three major components: complex graph search, &lt;br/&gt;graph pattern mining, and graph indexing.  &lt;br/&gt;It covers emerging structure queries in social, &lt;br/&gt;biological, and information networks, new graph mining operators &lt;br/&gt;such as graph summarization and association, and innovative indexing&lt;br/&gt;methodologies, e.g., differential graph index.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is tightly integrated with education through student &lt;br/&gt;mentoring and curriculum development. Publications, software and &lt;br/&gt;course materials resulted from this project are disseminated on the &lt;br/&gt;project website: http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~xyan/gis.html.</AbstractNarration>

Publications, dissertations and tutorial materials resulted from this project are disseminated via http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~xyan/gis.html.  Multiple conference tutorials were produced, including "Network Mining and Analysis for Social Applications," (SIGKDD?14), "Mining Knowledge from Interconnected Data: A Heterogeneous Information Network Analysis Approach," (VLDB?12, ICDE?12, SIGKDD?10, SIGMOD?10).  This research was tightly integrated with education through student mentoring and curriculum development.  It graduated six PhDs during the course of the research period.  They are now employed as research scientist (Facebook and NEC-Labs) and faculty member (NTU, Ohio State).  The project also trained more than ten high-school and undergraduate students including underrepresented minorities through summer internship programs at the University of California, Santa Barbara.
