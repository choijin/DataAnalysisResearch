<AbstractNarration>Dr. Giles Novak (Northwestern University) will carry out a campaign to observe the magnetic field morphology in 13 relatively isolated molecular cloud cores containing embedded low-mass protostars.  The observations will be carried out using the Submillimeter High Angular Resolution Polarimeter (SHARP), a fore-optics module that adds polarimetric capability to the powerful Submillimeter High Angular Resolution Camera generation II camera at the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory on Mauna Kea.  The survey is designed to test a wide class of protostellar collapse models that invoke magnetic fields as a dominant factor in controlling the collapse. According to these models, the field regulates the transfer of angular momentum thereby solving the so-called "angular momentum problem", and strongly influences the properties of the protostellar disks out of which new planets are formed.  Preliminary results for two of the 13 targets indicate that levels of polarization are above the detection threshold. If these levels are typical, the magnetic field survey will provide a conclusive test of the magnetically-controlled collapse models. The survey data will either rule these models out, or set them on a sound observational footing as an important step in their further development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a part of this work, Dr. Novak and collaborators will upgrade SHARP to convert it into a "Facility Instrument" available to the world astronomical community.  The upgrade will allow investigators from around the world to use SHARP to study a diverse range of objects including external galaxies, evolved stars, and the black hole at the Galactic Center.  In addition, the investigator's research group will continue to provide students with hands-on experience in building and using cutting-edge astronomical instrumentation, preparing them for a variety of careers both inside and outside of academia.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ One of the most pressing questions in astrophysics research today is "How do stars and planets form?".  Using high angular resolution telescopes like the Hubble Space Telescope, astronomers have discovered thin disks of interstellar gas and dust swirling around recently formed stars, and we presume that these are "protoplanetary" disks, by which we mean disks of "left-overs" from star formation that will eventually break up and coalesce into individual planets.  However, we still do not understand how such protoplanetary disks can ever form in the first place, given the strong "braking" torques that are expected from the cosmic magnetic fields that are frozen into the interstellar gas out of which new stars form.  Such magnetic torques should stop the protoplanetary disk in its tracks, leaving gravity free to pull the disk material down into the central star itself.    Two explanations are commonly invoked by astronomers to circumvent this problem: (a) the presence of "non-ideal" magnetic effects, by which we mean effects that are not included in the standard equations describing the interactions between magnetic fields and interstellar gas ("magnetohydrodynamic" interactions), and (b) a significant misalignment between the initial spin axis of the pre-collapse interstellar molecular cloud and the orientation of its magnetic field.  Some models based on the second explanation would seem to be contradicted by the results of our NSF project "Mapping Magnetic Fields near Low-Mass Protostars".  (These results were reported in an Astrophysical Journal paper by Nicholas Chapman and collaborators in 2013.)  Chapman and collaborators mapped the magnetic fields of seven low-mass molecular cloud cores harboring "protostars" (newborn stars still accreting gas from their natal cocoons) and found evidence of a positive correlation between the orientation of the protostellar disk/jet system (that should reflect the initial cloud spin axis) and the magnetic field direction revealed by their observations.  Because several of the models based on the misalignment hypothesis would predict a negative correlation rather than a positive one, the discovery by Chapman and collaborators is stimulating more work on the first of the two explanations - "non-ideal" magnetohydrodynamics.    The magnetic field survey by Chapman and collaborators was carried out using Northwestern University's "SHARP" polarimeter, which was built ten years ago for use at the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory (CSO) located at the summit of Mauna Kea on the island of Hawaii.  In addition to carrying out this survey, an important part of our research project was to maintain and improve the SHARP instrument, which has been used by many researchers around the world for many different types of investigation.  The CSO will be decomissioned this Fall, but already thirteen papers based on SHARP observations have been published in the Astrophysical Journal or Astrophysical Journal Letters.  The last eight of these would not have been possible without the support provided by NSF to Nortwestern via the "Mapping Magnetic Fields near Low-Mass Protostars" project.
