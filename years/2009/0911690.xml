<AbstractNarration>In this multi-investigator project funded by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division and cofunded by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry Program of the Division of Materials Research, Mohammad Omary, Thomas Cundari, and Jincheng Du of the University North Texas and Bruce Gnade of the University of Texas at Dallas will synthesize new multinuclear Au, Ag, and Cu complexes, study their photophysical properties, and explore their efficacy in metal-organic field effect transistor (MOFET) devices.  The four investigators will collaborate on the synthesis, theoretical calculations/modeling, and device testing of the title complexes.  The film forming properties and solid state device behavior of these compounds will be examined, and information gained from these studies will be fed back to develop new design parameters for the materials.  It is suggested that the stability of some of these materials towards light, heat and moisture are encouraging factors for stable film and device fabrication.  These cyclotrimer complexes also have the potential to perform better than purely organic field effect transistor (OFET) devices.  Any or all of these improvements to the state-of-the-art would significantly impact the optoeletronic device field.  .  The investigators will also work with two University of North Texas research centers of excellence in nanophotonics (BNPC) and advanced computing (MMRC) to enhance graduate and post-doctoral interdisciplinary training as well as to involve local undergraduate institutions in the research.</AbstractNarration>
