<AbstractNarration>Modern automobiles are no longer mere mechanical devices; they are pervasively monitored and controlled by dozens of digital computers coordinated via internal vehicular networks and bridged to external networks as well.  While this transformation has driven major advancements in efficiency, safety and convenience, it has also introduced a broad range of new potential risks.  In this effort, we are evaluating these risks by experimentally mapping the attack surface of the modern automobile, identifying architectural security and privacy vulnerabilities, and developing new defense methodologies that can provide safety within the rubric of the existing automotive design ecosystem.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Overview:   The major goal of this project is to study and improve the computer security and privacy properties of modern automobiles.  The results will be broadly applicable to cyber-physical systems.   Major Activities:    One major activity focused on the experimental computer security  analysis of a modern automobile, assuming that an adversary was able to  somehow connect to the carÃ†s internal computer network.  A key focus of  this effort was to assess the limits of what an adversary might be able  to accomplish, as well as develop an informed understanding of how the  automotive industry might increase security.     One major activity focused on developing automated tools to assist in the security analysis of embedded systems, such as the embedded systems used in modern automobiles.  Automated security analysis tools exist for desktop applications.  We sought to create an infrastructure for the automated analysis of embedded systems because, in the absence of such an infrastructure, security analysts must analyze automotive embedded systems largely by hand, which requires significant technical sophistication.  By empowering automotive manufacturers with automated analysis tools, we hope to increase the overall computer security of automotive embedded systems.     One major activity focused on developing a toolkit to assist in computer security threat brainstorming and education.  Through threat modeling, and a cultivation of the security mindset, industry leaders can proactively avoid introducing systems (like the cars that we studied) with security vulnerabilities.     Professional Development:   We presented this work at events targeted at K-12 students.   A Scholastic Educational video for K-12 math students incorporates some of our results as motivating examples (see Key Outcomes or Other Achievements section above).   We disseminated physical copies of our security cards (http://securitycards.cs.washington.edu) to educators around the country, and also hosted sessions with the cards with students, large companies, and U.S. congressional staff.   Results Dissemination:    Publications   Talks   Discussions with key industry members   Discussions with policy makers   Discussions with media   Two NOVA documentaries (the 2012 NOVA ScienceNow "Can Science Stop Crime?" and the 2015 NOVA "CyberWar Threat" documentaries)           Last Modified: 11/30/2015       Submitted by: Tadayoshi Kohno]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
