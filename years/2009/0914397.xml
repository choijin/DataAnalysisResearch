<AbstractNarration>Lyme disease (LD) is the most common vector-borne disease in the U.S., with most cases acquired from blacklegged ticks. These ticks are found throughout the eastern U.S., yet 93% of LD cases occur in ten states found in the Northeast and Upper Midwest.  Various explanations have been proposed for the puzzling absence of LD in some areas where blacklegged ticks occur, but no agreement has been reached. The absence of an explanation contributes to uncertainty and confusion felt by citizens and healthcare providers faced with expanding tick populations in many parts of the U.S.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research team represents five universities as well as national and international governmental agencies. They have a strong commitment to disseminating research findings to scientists, public health agencies, land managers, and the public.  They will test three key hypotheses concerning LD distribution using field, laboratory, and computer modeling studies.  Data on tick-host relationships, tick seasonal biology, and tick genetics will be collected from field sites in four widely-separated regions of the eastern U.S.  Application of modeling and molecular tools will reveal the ecological and evolutionary processes responsible for the variation in LD risk in different regions of the U.S., as well as help predict how climate change could alter this risk.  Furthermore, this improved understanding of factors determining the distribution and abundance of infected ticks will assist in human disease diagnosis and treatment, tick control measures, and public education on regional differences in the risk of LD and other tick-borne disease.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This 6-year research program &ndash; investigating ecological drivers for variation in Lyme disease risk &ndash; was a multi-institution effort led by Michigan State University and involving The University of Tennessee, The University of Montreal, Hofstra University, Georgia Southern University, The University of Rhode Island, and the U.S. Geological Survey.  Lyme disease is the most common vector-borne disease of humans in the U.S., with most cases acquired from the bite of nymphal blacklegged ticks (= ædeer ticksÆ). This tick species is found throughout the eastern United States, yet ~95% of Lyme disease cases are reported from ten Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and Upper Midwest states. Various explanations have been proposed for the puzzlingly low incidence of Lyme disease in southeastern states &ndash; contributing to uncertainty among citizens and healthcare providers in states with expanding tick populations.   Data on tick-host relationships, tick seasonal biology, and tick genetics were collected by applying standardized methods, at monthly intervals, at 8 field sites located in widely-separated regions of the eastern U.S.  These surveys demonstrated firstly that blacklegged tick populations in the north are far more abundant than at inland sites in the southeast, although tick abundance at one coastal southeastern site was unexpectedly high. Cross-breeding experiments and genetic analysis confirmed that the northern and southern populations belong to a single species (Ixodes scapularis).  Secondly, adult blacklegged tick populations at southern sites (Florida, Alabama,Tennessee, South Carolina and North Carolina) were found to have very low (0-3%) infection prevalences of the Lyme disease pathogen, whereas prevalences were ~40% at all three northern sites (Wisconsin, Massachusetts and New Jersey).  An important factor contributing to this low prevalence is that many immature ticks in the south feed on lizards, and our lab studies indicated that the lizard species involved were not reservoir competent for the Lyme disease pathogen.    Thirdly, in collaboration with the Department of Defense Tick Test Kit program, we demonstrated that very few human tick bites in the Southeast are from blacklegged ticks; most are instead from lone star ticks or American dog ticks (neither of which spread Lyme disease). Of the occasional blacklegged tick bite recorded, a large majority were from adult ticks that are active from late fall through early spring.  In contrast, in Northern states most bites were from blacklegged nymphs that are active from late spring through summer.  By observing northern and southern nymphs in æcommon gardenÆ field experiments, we showed that southern nymphs are much less likely than northern nymphs to host-seek (= æquestÆ) above the leaf litter.  Regardless of whether such ticks are infected, or not, if they remain below the surface of the leaf litter they have minimal opportunity to attach to passing humans, and consequently no opportunity to bite or transmit disease to them.  These insights into tick abundance, infection and behavior provides a basic explanation of the current geographic pattern of Lyme disease risk in the eastern U.S.  New questions have been raised, however, regarding how this pattern may change as northern tick populations expand southwards.  On the one hand, the southern host community may continue to be æprotectiveÆ against Lyme disease transmission, and indeed that effect has the potential to move northwards under the influence of future climate-change.  Conversely, if high-questing northern ticks continue to invade southwards, Lyme risk in states such as Kentucky, West Virginia, Tennessee and North and South Carolina could increase significantly in the coming decade.  Further studies to better predict these changes would help inform cost-effective allocation of tick control measures, and help educate the public and health-care providers on regional differences in the risk of Lyme disea...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
