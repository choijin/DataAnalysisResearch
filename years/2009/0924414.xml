    <AbstractNarration>This proposal seeks NSF funding for an interdisciplinary conference to be held at Florida Atlantic University in 2010. The conference will focus on improving our understanding of the networks in the brain that are responsible for the generation of thought. The study of human brain function is possibly one of the most important endeavors for society. While there has been an explosive amount of research in basic neurobiology in recent years, progress has been limited in understanding the brain networks that govern the cognitive processes of thinking and intelligence. Conference participants will gain an overview of the present state of research on brain networks from various perspectives, including neurobiology, functional brain imaging, and cognitive science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding the integrated functioning of brain networks remains a significant scientific challenge with enormous implications for the diagnosis and treatment of cognitive disorders that result from impairment to the brain. These disorders include a wide array of symptoms associated with stroke, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and depression, to name a few. The overall aim of the proposed conference is to bring together an outstanding group of researchers to examine the dynamics of cooperative brain function from a multidisciplinary approach, and to educate the next generation of researchers on important topics at the frontier of studies in these disciplines. The highly interdisciplinary nature of the proposed conference is likely to promote new and existing collaborations. The funding will bring world-class experts to the meeting, and also enable undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows to participate in the meeting with reduced fees and opportunities for travel support. The speakers will include women and members of underrepresented minorities. A critical outcome of the conference will be to produce an ongoing web-based resource providing essential information on the brain networks of cognition to the scientific community and the general public.</AbstractNarration>
