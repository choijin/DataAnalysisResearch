<AbstractNarration>Streams and rivers are important sites of global carbon processing. Carbon in the form of dead leaves and wood (detritus) from the land enters streams and is colonized by bacteria and fungi (heterotrophic microorganisms). This complex of microorganisms and detrital carbon fuels food webs that support fish, amphibians and other consumers. Detrital carbon is consumed by organisms but is also converted to carbon dioxide by bacteria and fungi. Problematic to this important detritus-fuelled pathway is that human-derived nutrient inputs (nitrogen and phosphorus) stimulate microbially-driven release of carbon dioxide and decomposition of detritus, resulting in less available carbon for important ecosystem functions. In this study, laboratory incubations, streamside channels and whole-stream nutrient additions will be used to determine the concentrations and ratios of nitrogen and phosphorus that elicit such ecosystem changes. Knowledge of these threshold concentrations and ratios can guide management of aquatic ecosystems to maintain water quality for wildlife conservation and human utilization. Study findings can aid predictions of how excess nutrients affect the fate of detrital carbon in streams, which is relevant to global carbon budgets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Excess nutrient loading is the primary source of impairment to more than half of the freshwater and coastal ecosystems in the U.S. While hundreds of scientific studies have assessed autotrophic (e.g. algal) response to nutrient loading, few have tested nutrient effects on detritus, heterotrophic microorganisms and the larger aquatic organisms they support. The proposed research will advance our understanding of how aquatic ecosystems are affected by nutrients via detritus-fuelled pathways that potentially lead to carbon loss, a perspective that is currently lacking in management decisions related to nutrient enrichment. This project will provide critical research support to four early-career investigators, as well as experience and training for undergraduate and graduate students at three institutions in the southeastern U.S. The project will include public and K-12 educational components that will focus on how excess nutrients affect aquatic food webs and water quality. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our nationÆs streams are in poor health due to excess loading of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P).  In many cases we donÆt know how N and P affect systems, nor the concentrations of N and P that result in reduced vitality.  Our studies helped determine why streams become ill by determining the effects of N and P on stream food webs that are based on leaves and wood.  Leaves and wood are the main energy source in many stream food webs, but the effects of nutrients on these food web pathways are not as well understood as algal-based food web pathways that result in algal blooms and low oxygen dead zones.     We conducted studies on nutrient effects in the laboratory, in streamside channels, and in natural streams.  Our studies included adding N and P, mimicking low to moderate run off from farms or cities.  This research helps us understand the specific ways that nutrients affect stream food webs when all other conditions are the same.  We studied all parts of the stream food web, from microorganisms (bacteria and fungi) and the dead leaves they colonize, to stream insects and salamanders.   In laboratory studies, we found that N and P stimulated growth of fungi and bacteria.  In our whole-stream studies, N and P addition altered all parts of the food web.  Nitrogen and P caused depletion of the stream food base, by stimulating bacteria and fungi and increasing the rate that dead leaves break down.  Phosphorus was more important than N in affecting food quality to stream insects and their predators, the salamanders, which grew faster with high P.  Together, these food web alterations mean that rates of growth of stream organisms and processing of the food web base are sped up by nutrients, resulting in very low levels of food during parts of the year.  This is a negative impact for streams that we depend on to retain leaves and wood and provide food for stream consumers year-round.   We are communicating our results to state agencies where guidelines for acceptable nutrient concentrations are made. Our results are important for differentiating the effects of N and P, which come from different human-derived sources.  For example, N can be deposited with increased fossil fuel production without proportionate inputs of P, whereas P is high in sewage effluent.  Our work helps inform how the independent enrichment of these nutrients may cause divergence in stream processes.  Our research team has included professors, students working on undergraduate degrees, students working on graduate degrees and high school interns. Support from this project has provided scientific experience for students from several states and will increase the competitiveness of our students for jobs.  Our research findings are being shared with other scientists to understand the effects of nutrients and are used as examples in teaching college students about freshwater ecosystems.  Our findings have been shared with local governments in watershed improvement planning.  Many members of our research team have also been active in educational and hands-on activities to inform school children and citizens about maintaining and improving stream health in their communities.
