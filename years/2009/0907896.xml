<AbstractNarration>In collaboration with the Benjamin Banneker Association, Temple University, Arcadia University, and Georgia State University convene a series of two professional mini-conferences and one professional summit to address issues related to the mathematical education of African American students, Pre-K-16. Previous research (Kitchen, 2007; Stiff &amp; Harvey, 1988) suggests that there is a negative relationship between African American students and mathematics. This relationship is exacerbated by the underrepresentation of African American students in advanced mathematics classes, even when they are the majority of school populations (Martin, 2007), and the overrepresentation of African American students in lower-track mathematics courses and special education (Blanchett, 2006). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The series of conferences addresses the following pressing questions: (1) In what ways do school structures and institutional policies impact African American students' success in school mathematics? (2) In what ways can technological tools and other forms of multimedia be used to motivate and encourage African American students to learn rigorous mathematics? (2) In what ways do highly qualified mathematics teachers understand issues of race and equity, and how might teacher education programs develop highly qualified mathematics teachers for urban schools? (3) What is the nexus of race and identity for African American students in the South and other spaces where African American students are the majority, and how does racial-identity and individual agency impact their mathematics attainment? (4) What are the best practices that facilitate learning and mathematical empowerment among African American students, and how might culturally relevant and critical pedagogy assist in developing academic success, cultural competence, and critical consciousness among African American students?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Numerous stakeholders, including classroom teachers, school administrators, experts in STEM education research, and scholars in psychology come together to speak to the pressing issues facing the mathematical education of African American students. The conferences bridge research and practice and challenge policymakers and school system leaders to establish frameworks and infrastructures that encourage African American students to develop positive mathematics identities and high levels of mathematics attainment. Outcomes include articles in research and practitioner journals and professional development materials.</AbstractNarration>

The special issue was published by the Journal of Urban Mathematics Education at Gerogia State University in July 2012. The book, edited by Jacqueline Leonard and Danny B. Martin, is forthcoming and will be published by Information Age Publishers in December 2012.   Intellectual impact: Our conference addressed and analyzed critical issues related to mathematics attainment among African American students. Specific questions that guided the presentations included: (1) In what ways do school structures and institutional policies impact African American studentsÆ success in school and in mathematics? (2) (Philadelphia) In what ways can technological tools and other forms of multimedia be used to motivate and encourage African American students to learn rigorous mathematics? (2) (Atlanta) In what ways do "highly qualified" mathematics teachers understand issues of race and equity, and how might teacher education programs develop highly qualified mathematics teachers for urban schools? (3) What is the intersection of race and identity for African American students in the South and other spaces where African American students are the majority, and how does racial identity and community support impact their mathematics attainment? (4) What are the best practices that facilitate learning and mathematical empowerment among African American students, and how might culturally relevant and critical pedagogy assist in developing academic success, cultural competence, and critical consciousness among African American students?   Broader impacts:  We brought numerous stakeholders together to speak about critical issues affecting the mathematics education of African American students. We used the conferences described above as forums to bridge research and practice as well as to challenge policymakers and school system leaders to establish frameworks that encourage African American students to develop positive mathematics identities and achieve high levels of mathematics attainment. Our target audience included secondary mathematics teachers, mathematics educators, mathematics specialists, school counselors and administrators in Philadelphia and Atlanta and surrounding regions. We used technology to ensure that viable information was disseminated to BBA members who are mathematics teachers and educators in each BBA region (Southeast, Northeast, South Central, North Central, Southwest, and West).
