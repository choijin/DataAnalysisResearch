<AbstractNarration>A team led by researchers at the University of Pittsburgh is reviewing and analyzing policy documents and studies related to Algebra I learning and teaching, in order to (1) gain a better understanding of algebra education in the United States; and (2) conduct an accounting of research questions that have and have not been taken up by policy documents to date (i.e., what we know and what we need to know).  The results are to be disseminated to both the mathematics education research community and to the education policy community.  Further discussion and dissemination is planned through an invitational conference in Washington, DC.  The findings will also be used to set a research agenda for algebra learning and teaching.</AbstractNarration>
