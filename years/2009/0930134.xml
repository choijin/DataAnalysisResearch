<AbstractNarration>This project is combining the theoretical perspectives of "communities of practice" and "situated learning" with the innovative research, curriculum, and community best practices developed in four Integrative Graduate Research and Education Traineeship (IGERT) projects.  This is done horizontally across the institution's STEM graduate programs and centers, and vertically within the undergraduate research experience programs.  This extensive program of activities is improving the quality of undergraduate and graduate students completing STEM degrees.  Additionally, the project is using proven methods to increase the participation of groups underrepresented in STEM fields, including first generation, economically disadvantaged, and disabled students.  With attention to addressing critical educational junctures, the senior leadership team is creating the Graduate Innovation and Integration Center (GIIC) to enhance the integration of the institution's and research and educational efforts.  GIIC center is working with five existing interdisciplinary campus centers to build collaborations and synergistic outcomes.  A comprehensive plan is evaluating each aspect of the project including critical junctures as well as the impact of the project on promoting institutional collaboration and synergy.  Longitudinal studies are being planned that follow students for three years post graduation.  The broader impact of this project is the synergy between a wide array of undergraduate and graduate programs; the broadened participation of undergraduate students in research experiences, particularly students from populations underrepresented in STEM disciplines; the improved retention of a diverse body of graduate students; and a model for student success that can be used at other institutions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Graduate School of Rutgers University New Brunswick (GSNB) was awarded a grant from the National Science Foundation under a program whose goals are to achieve Innovation through Institutional Integration (I-3).  The Rutgers I-3 project (1) developed new and sustainable mechanisms to integrate best practices across graduate programs, focusing on those practices that prepare graduate students for careers, and (2) created new programs that trained graduate students to serve as teachers and mentors of undergraduates.  Intellectual Merits consisted of the development of new methods to develop important skills in graduate students, including scientific writing, critical thinking about research practices, and teaching and mentoring undergraduates.  Broader Impacts were twofold: (1) The educational benefits for the large and diverse cohort of graduate and undergraduates who participated in novel training activities, and (2) the creation of new and sustainable structures within the university to address important training needs of graduate students that are typically not met by individual graduate programs alone, and that involve graduate students in hands-on activities (teaching, mentoring) which provide important key services to the large and diverse undergraduate population.    Main outcomes include the development of a series of new courses that address fundamental training needs of graduate students.  These new courses, each taught in interdisciplinary environments, covered Scientific Writing, Responsible and Ethical Research, Teaching in online formats, and training in mentoring.  Graduate students also received training via hands-on activities, including serving as mentors for summer undergraduate interns participating in NSF funded REU (Research Experience for Undergraduate) sites, and developing and teaching topics in science to middle-school students.    The format for each activity emphasized discussion and interaction, allowing graduate students to develop necessary skills in critical and analytic thinking.  For example, students in Scientific Writing engaged in real writing projects (manuscripts for publication or theses) while continually critiquing and evaluating each otherÆs work.  Students in Responsible and Ethical Research reasoned as a group through contemporary ethical dilemmas and through this learned about their own rights and responsibilities.  Students who received training as mentors kept detailed logs about their experiences, thus enabling them to better understand the evolution of projects from initial inception to completion, as their understanding of the skills and abilities of the mentees deepened.  Students participating in outreach activities (Science Explorer Bus) developed skills in using active learning to teach science to middle-school students in a traveling science laboratory.   Based on the positive evaluations of these activities, the university and graduate school are implementing a new and sustainable structure that will offer the courses and activities created by the I-3 to the population of graduate students, and will add to these activities to meet evolving needs.
