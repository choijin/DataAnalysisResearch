<AbstractNarration>The proposal is a request for funds to support the biennial MMDS&lt;br/&gt;meetings on Algorithms for Modern Massive Data Sets.  The goals&lt;br/&gt;of these meetings are: (1) to explore novel techniques for&lt;br/&gt;modeling and analyzing massive, high-dimensional, and&lt;br/&gt;nonlinearly-structured scientific and internet data sets; and&lt;br/&gt;(2) to bring together computer scientists, statisticians,&lt;br/&gt;mathematicians, and data analysis practitioners to promote&lt;br/&gt;cross-fertilization of ideas.  The meetings will occur in the&lt;br/&gt;wake of two related meetings in 2006 and 2008 that addressed&lt;br/&gt;similar topics.  Both MMDS 2006 and MMDS 2008 were an enormous&lt;br/&gt;interdisciplinary success, and they clearly highlighted the&lt;br/&gt;need for a regular meeting forum to bring together junior and&lt;br/&gt;senior researchers from a range of backgrounds to address the&lt;br/&gt;challenging foundational problems that will be faced in upcoming&lt;br/&gt;years as increasingly large and complex data sets are generated&lt;br/&gt;in a wide range of application domains.  The proposed meetings&lt;br/&gt;will capitalize on these past successes and extend the MMDS&lt;br/&gt;series into a more regular series of meetings to address&lt;br/&gt;algorithmic, statistical, and computational aspects of modern&lt;br/&gt;massive data set analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The topics covered by MMDS address fundamental algorithmic&lt;br/&gt;questions underlying much of the recent work in large-scale data&lt;br/&gt;analysis.  In addition, topics of interest at MMDS include data&lt;br/&gt;problems ranging from better search and ranking at internet&lt;br/&gt;sites to improved methods for extracting structure in genetics&lt;br/&gt;applications to analyzing biomedical images for improved disease&lt;br/&gt;detection.  Progress on these fronts will be fueled by junior&lt;br/&gt;researchers as well as researchers from a wide range of&lt;br/&gt;application areas.  Thus, every effort was be made to include&lt;br/&gt;junior researchers, including women and minorities, at past&lt;br/&gt;meetings and to disseminate the information presented at the&lt;br/&gt;meetings to people who were not able to attend.  This will be&lt;br/&gt;continued at future meetings.  For more information, please see&lt;br/&gt;the meeting webpage: http://mmds.stanford.edu/</AbstractNarration>
