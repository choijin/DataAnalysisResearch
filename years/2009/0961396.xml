<AbstractNarration>The cause of the bifurcating tracks of seamounts and seafloor swells in the Walvis Ridge area in the South Atlantic just off South Africa has been a longstanding enigma in Marine Geology and in our understanding of hotspots and the plate tectonic evolution of Africa. This project will go to sea to dredge and analyze rocks from the part of the seafloor to the west of the Walvis Ridge and examine changes from hotspot to diffuse volcanism. The present location of the Walvis hotspot and the reason for its waning volcanic activity over the last 60 Myr will also be determined. Argon trapped in minerals in the collected seafloor volcanic rocks will be used to determine the age progression of the volcano tracks. Rock, major and trace element geochemistry and isotopes will be used to see if the younger rocks in the bifurcated tracks can be linked to the older Walvis Ridge. Multibeam bathymetric mapping and a map of seafloor magnetics will also be generated to examine structural trends and plate tectonic motions of this part of the ocean floor. Broader impacts of the work include international collaboration with a complementary German effort that is studying the older part of the Walvis Ridge, K-12 teacher and graduate and undergraduate student training, and support of a PI whose gender is under-represented in the sciences.</AbstractNarration>

Given its longevity, the Walvis Ridge in the South Atlantic represents the most important hotspot trail on the African Plate with ~130 million years of continuous volcanism. It is a rare example of a seamount trail that can be connected with a massive large-igneous province (LIP) that is located today on both the South American and African continents, making up the so-called Paran&agrave;-Etendeka continental flood basalt. With this it represents one of the few "primary hotspots" consistent with the thermal plume model. However, around 60 million years ago, the morphological expression of the Walvis Ridge changed drastically from a robust 200 km wide aseismic ridge into a 400 km wide region of diffuse and diminished volcanism. As a result, the "young" end of the Walvis Ridge, also called the Guyot Province, may include two or more subtracks, one ending at Tristan da Cunha Island and another at Gough Island, more than 400 km to the SSE, which is at odds with the classical definition of a narrow, linear and continuous primary hotspot trail.

We successfully carried out seagoing expedition MV1203 on the R/V Melville for in total 49 days (from 11 February to 30 March, 2012) with port calls in Cape Town and Cape Town (South Africa). In this cruise we mapped in total 50 seamounts in the Guyot Province and placed in total 62 dredges of which 47 contained relatively fresh basaltic rocks that are extremely valuable for age dating and performing geochemical analyses. In total we carried out 120 incremental heating experiments with the 40Ar/39Ar geochronology technique in the OSU Argon Geochronology Laboratory, resulting in a single PhD thesis (Schnur 2017). This large new age data set provides important insights into the volcanic and geodynamic history of the Walvis Ridge.  First, Tristan da Cunha, traditionally considered one of the two proposed hotspot locations, does not align with the overall age progression formed by other Walvis Ridge seamounts.

Finally, previously-published absolute plate motion models for the African Plate do not accurately predict our new age data, suggesting these new ages conversely could significantly impact global plate circuits.
