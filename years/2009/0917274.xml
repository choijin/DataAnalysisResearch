<AbstractNarration>New Theoretical Foundations of Tensor Applications: Clustering, Error Analysis, Global Convergence, and Robust Formulations&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tensor decompositions become increasingly important in analyzing high-dimensional multi-index data. However, applications of tensor decompositions are so far restricted: (1) they are mainly used for data compression ? critically important tasks such as data clustering have not been addressed. (2) No bounds on reconstruction error exist ? the compression parameters are determined on a trial-and-error basis. (3) As solutions to non-convex optimizations, tensor decompositions are not unique. This could severely affect the reliability of tensor analysis. (4) Tensor decompositions are obtained via minimizing the sum of squared errors, thus are prone to noise or outliers in the data. A robust formulation of decomposition is highly desirable for applications with large noises. In this proposal, we investigate these new fundamental aspects of tensor applications: &lt;br/&gt;(1) Investigate the clustering capabilities of tensor decompositions, in addition to the established theoretical results on clustering; &lt;br/&gt;(2) Provide comprehensive error analysis of tensor decompositions and derive lower and upper error bounds; &lt;br/&gt;(3) Investigate conditions for global convergence for tensor decompositions and investigate good initializations for the cases where global convergence fails. &lt;br/&gt;(4) Develop robust formulations for tensor decompositions.&lt;br/&gt;In addition, we will develop user-friendly software toolbox that contains the resulting algorithms and make it available to the public. We will also educate graduate and undergraduate students with fundamentals in matrix and tensor computations. We will present tutorials and organize workshops on this new direction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The investigation of this project produces several important outcomes.  1. Tensor decompositions have inherent clustering capabilities, i.e., it projects data into a subspace where the cluster structures become more apparent then in the original space.  2. Errror analysis show that there exist  lower bounds on the cost function that can guide the applications when error estimations are required.  3.  Although the tensor decompositions are nonconvex, we show that the most popular Tucker decomposition in fact converge to a global optimal solution in all practical data /situations. We also show that ParaFac decomposition comverge to local optimal solutions that depends in initialization. Thus care must be taken in data analysis.  4. We developed several robust formulations of tensor decompositions? and demonstrate the severally corrupted data such as occluded images can be recovered through these robust tensor decompositions.  We published 29 papers relating to this project on top tier conferences and jounrals.  This project supported two Ph.D. students who has graduated and working in US R&amp;D research labs.  The research materials produced in this project are used in teach new graduate course in UT Arlington.  We continue to organize International Workshop on Data Mining using Matrices and Tensors assoicated with IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM) since 2009.
