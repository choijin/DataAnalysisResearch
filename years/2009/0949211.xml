<AbstractNarration> An award has been made to Robert A. Andersen (Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences, West Boothbay Harbor, Maine), Rose Ann Cattolico and Gabrielle Rocap (University of Washington, Seattle, Washington), Robert Jansen, Elizabeth Ruck and Edward Theriot (University of Texas, Austin Texas), Matt Julius (St. Cloud State University, St. Cloud, Minnesota), Stefano Draisma (National Herbarium and Leiden University, Leiden, The Netherlands) and Hiroshi Kawai (Kobe University, Kobe, Japan) to determine the relationships among the heterokont classes by generating two large molecular data sets.  Currently, 14 taxonomic classes of heterokont algae are recognized, and they include over 100,000 described species (as many as one million total species has been estimated by experts).  Common members include brown seaweeds (e.g., kelp) and the diatoms.  Remarkably, despite two centuries of light microscopic study, 50 years of electron microscopic study, and 20 years of molecular investigations, the phylogenetic relationships among the 14 classes remains unknown. DNA sequences of seven nuclear, mitochondrial, and chloroplast genes from 270 heterokont algal species and 30 nonalgal relatives will be obtained and, entire chloroplast genomes from 30 species will be sequenced. The genome sequences will provide important new data for understanding chloroplasts and their origin(s), especially since knowledge in this field is greatly biased toward land plants. Algae serve as the base of the food chain for all organisms that dwell in the ocean and account for approximately half of the global photosynthesis, and therefore they provide approximately 50% of the oxygen we breathe.  Members of the heterokont algae vary in morphology from simple unicells to highly complex seaweeds. Brown algae are the principal elements of seaweed beds and these macroalgae have high economic values as food and biomass resources.  A number of heterokont algae are harmful to marine life. For example, some algae produce toxins that when concentrated in shellfish kill humans, while other species of heterokonts are well-known fish killers. Conversely, other heterokonts serve as a human food source, they are used in industrial processes and they have found new recognition in the nanotechnology industry. The closest relatives to the heterokont algae are the pseudofungi, which include many plant pathogens, such as the fungus that caused the Irish potato famine, and various molds and mildews. Graduate and undergraduate students and postdoctoral fellows from diverse cultural and ethnic backgrounds will be supported and trained in a wide diversity of fields, including evolution, genomics, molecular biology, computational biology, and plant biology. The research will be integrated with K-12 educators, public museums and parks using already established programs at several of the participating institutions. A Deep Brown web site already has been established, and it will be greatly expanded as part of this project.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

The heterokont algae are a large group of organisms that are little known to the average person but very important in our world.  Products from these algae are used to make many items including toothpaste, ice cream and cosmetics. The diatoms, tiny single-celled algae with walls made of opaline glass (windowpane glass), are very rich in species, and they are sometimes called the insects of the algal world.  Diatoms are estimated to produce 25% of the oxygen on year, which is every fourth breath that we breathe. The brown seaweeds, which include the kelps, are important "forests" in the oceans.  Brown seaweeds are important sources of foods, vitamins and trace elements in many parts of the world. The remaining 14 classes are known by scientific names; for example, a taxonomic class is characterized by a set of features (the Class Mammalia produce hair, mammary glands, etc).  Prior to our study, the phylogenetic relationships among the heterokont algal classes were unknown.  Morphological data, widely used to classify organisms, was not sufficient because the group was too diverse.  For example, the brown algae have cellulosic wall, the diatoms have glass walls and the raphidophytes have naked cells, and therefore, because they lack common features, they could not be compared.  Our group established the relationships by using seven genes from over 300 species and by sequencing the entire chloroplast genome for 30 representative species.  We found that the heterokont algae form three large subgroups, which we named S1, S2 and S3 (the S = stramenopiles, which is an alternative name for the heterokonts).  We also resolved the relationships within each of the large subgroups.  Using statistical tests, we showed that the three subgroups were distinct and that the 16 classes within the group.  The S1 group is the most ancient lineage, and it shares certain molecular and morphological features with nonalgal relatives, such as the oomycete fungi that cause many plant diseases.  The S1 group includes the brown seaweeds, the fish-killing raphidophytes, the largely freshwater yellow-green algae, and several poorly represented groups (Aurearenophyceae, Chrysomerophyceae, Phaeothamniophyceae, Schizocladiophyceae).  The S2 group includes some commercially important algae, the eustigmatophyte and pinguiophyte algae, as well as common freshwater chrysophytes.  The eustigmatophytes, like Nannochloropsis, produce poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), and this alga is grown in large ponds for commercial production of PUFAs.  The pinguiophyte algae produce large quantities of eicosapentaenoic acid acid (EPA), a PUFA that has been shown to improve IQ in children when included in baby formula.  The freshwater chrysophytes and synurophytes are important phytoplankters in lakes where they provide food for juvenile fish and small animals.  The Synchromophyceae, a group of odd marine amoebae with many chloroplasts, belongs in the S2 group.   The S3 group is predominated by organisms with a reduced flagellar (swimming) apparatus.  It includes the diatoms, which are the most speciose of all the algal groups; scientists continue to describe new species at a very high rate and indications are that perhaps a million or more diatom species exist around the world. The S3 group also includes the Pelagophyceae, which include some of the most abundant picoplanktonic algae found in the oceans.  The silicoflagellates and pedinellids, along with an unusual group of marine amoebae growing on marine snow, are also found in the S3 group.  Humans have a natural curiosity for the many species and varieties of life that inhabit our planet, and this curiosity extends algae found in the oceans, coral reefs, freshwater lakes, and so forth.
