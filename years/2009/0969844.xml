<AbstractNarration>Compact stars are natural laboratories that provide extreme densities and strong magnetic fields. In inner parts of such stars, several types of exotic matter can exist.  The nature and the physical properties of such matter are not always well understood. This project aims at determining the properties of stellar matter that can affect the observational data in a qualitative way and, therefore, be inferred from such data.  In the long term, this study in combination with other theoretical and observational approaches should pave the way to the possible discovery of new forms of stellar matter.  The general insights regarding stellar matter, as well as the methods and techniques used, can also be utilized in studies of graphene and trapped gases of cold atoms, both of which are likely to affect future technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the important components of the project will be training of graduate students by involving them into a modern research in theoretical nuclear physics.  This is in line with the broad mission of the Arizona State University Polytechnic, which is to provide excellent programs in natural and physical sciences, mathematics and engineering through project oriented and problem based learning.</AbstractNarration>
