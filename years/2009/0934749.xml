    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Teachers for Tomorrow Noyce Scholarship program provides, over 5 years, a total of forty-nine $15,000 stipends to post-baccalaureate candidates with science and math degrees who commit to teaching in high-need school districts. Recipients are enrolled in the University of Connecticut's Neag School of Education Teacher Certification Program for College Graduates (TCPCG). TCPCG is a highly competitive one-year teacher preparation program that integrates coursework with school-based clinic experiences. Completion of TCPCG leads to certification for grades 7-12 and a Masters degree in Mathematics or Science Education. Recruiting for Noyce awards includes a strong emphasis on diversity. The selection of Noyce scholarship applicants follows existing TCPCG guidelines, which include consideration of both academic and interpersonal skills. Partner schools, many in high need districts (Hartford, Windham, Waterbury), provide fieldwork placements for all teacher candidates. A robust data collection and evaluation plan measures progress toward project goals. The Teachers for Tomorrow project increases the depth of the mathematics and science taught in the schools. The gathered data are analyzed to better understand the factors that call students into teaching as well as factors that characterize effective teachers. Research papers are submitted for publication and posted online. The 49 new Noyce Scholarship teachers impact the learning of thousands of science and mathematics students and help address a critical need of STEM education.</AbstractNarration>
