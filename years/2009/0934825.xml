<AbstractNarration>This award provides support for 14 junior scientists from US institutes to attend the 2009 Gordon Research Conference on Nuclear Chemistry. With subtitle ?Nuclear Structure through Spectroscopy and Reactions? the conference focuses on the latest and sometimes controversial research at the cutting edge of fundamental nuclear science. Topics include: Structure of light nuclei: Abinitio calculations and clustering; Structure of exotic nuclei from spectroscopy and reactions; Nuclear structure near exotic shell closures; Advances in nuclear astrophysics; Novel nuclear shapes and high-spin structure; Production and spectroscopy of heavy nuclei; Phonon excitations and algebraic models; Structure from masses, moments and transition rates; Exotic decay modes and weak interactions; New instruments for frontier research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference addresses key questions stated in the NSAC Long Range Plan for Nuclear Physics, particularly concerning the science associated with the latest generation of radioactive beam accelerator facilities. This being the 57th Nuclear Chemistry GRC, the conference has a proven record of gathering the key players in a format that is conducive to the conception of future directions for the field and the formation of new research partnerships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The participation of under-represented minority groups, women and younger scientists in the conference will be encouraged, applying the principles of affirmative action. The invited speakers include several women; in fact the first two speakers on the program are women. The vice chair of the conference is a woman, as is the previous chair.</AbstractNarration>
