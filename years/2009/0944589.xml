<AbstractNarration>Abstract &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;High nutrient low chlorophyll regions of the Southern Ocean are conventionally explained by lack of bioavailable iron (Fe). Various localized sources of Fe in the Southern Ocean/Antarctic continental margins have been proposed and studied. In areas removed from obviously localized terrestrial dust sources, air-sea deposition of aerosol Fe, the particle size distribution of atmospheric Fe and the variability of aerosol composition, including other atmospheric constituents that may affect the bioavailability of Fe and micronutrients, is not well observed. This project seeks to conduct shipboard atmospheric sampling and analysis from a Chinese ice breaker (R/V Xue Long)  passing through the Southern Ocean on route from Shanghai to Zhongshan Station, Antarctica &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bulk aerosol and size segregated aerosol samples will be measured for their chemical, physical and morphological properties, Fe content by capillary waveguide spectrophotometry, elemental composition by mass spectrometry (ICPMS), along with corresponding water soluble fractions. Precipitation samples, when encountered, will also be analyzed to derive wet deposition fluxes. Satellite remote sensing of aerosol dust products and chemical transport modeling approaches will also be used in data interpretation.</AbstractNarration>

The Southern Ocean, surrounding Antarctica, plays an important role in regulating the global carbon cycle. Large areas of the Southern Ocean bear the feature of high-nutrient low-chlorophyll (HNLC) waters, where phytoplankton growth is partially limited by the micronutrient Fe, in addition to temperature, light, and other nutrients. Among the sources of Fe in the Southern Ocean is atmospheric dust that deposits in the sea surface, but the uptake of Fe by phytoplankton in seawater depends on the properties of Fe, in particular Fe bioavailability, which is the portion of Fe in the dissolved forms that can be taken up by marine organisms and a process that is poorly understood. At present, the Southern Ocean is extremely under sampled due to its vast area and poor atmospheric and oceanic conditions, which include high winds and sea spray, high cloud coverage, and low dust loading in the atmosphere. To characterize atmospheric Fe over the Southern Ocean addressing a fundamental gap in knowledge, a shipboard aerosol experiment was carried out during a cruise between 34<sup>o</sup>S, 109<sup>o</sup>E and 69&deg;S, 76&deg;E and between 69&deg;S, 76&deg;E and 66<sup>o</sup>S, 110<sup>o</sup>E during the period of November 2010-March 2011 through the US-China international research collaboration. The forms of dissolvable atmospheric Fe were then measured and the atmospheric deposition fluxes of dissolved Fe to the Southern Ocean were estimated with the new measurement data from this project. Results showed that the average atmospheric concentrations of Fe(II), a form of dissolved Fe, were 0.22 ng m<sup>-3</sup><span>&nbsp;</span>(range: 0.13&ndash;0.33 ng m<sup>-3</sup>) over the Southern Ocean and 0.53 ng m<sup>-3</sup><span>&nbsp;</span>(range: 0.18&ndash;1.3 ng m<sup>-3</sup>) over coastal East Antarctica. Dissolved atmospheric Fe was enriched in submicron particles. The percentage of dissolved Fe in the form of Fe(II) ranged from 0.6% to 7% and decreased with total Fe concentration increase. The estimated atmospheric fluxes of Fe(II) were 0.007-0.092 mg m<sup>-2</sup><span>&nbsp;</span>yr<sup>-1</sup><span>&nbsp;</span>over the Southern Ocean and 0.022-0.21 mg m<sup>-2</sup><span>&nbsp;</span>yr<sup>-1</sup><span>&nbsp;</span>in coastal East Antarctica. Total dissolved Fe fluxes were 0.007-0.52 mg m<sup>-2</sup><span>&nbsp;</span>yr<sup>-1</sup><span>&nbsp;</span>over the Southern Ocean. Several water-soluble organic aerosol species including oxalate and methanesulfonate that were measured at the same time were also enriched in submicron particles, which may affect aerosol Fe dissolution. New results from this project fill the data gap of atmospheric Fe over the Southern Ocean.

Thirdly, this project involved international research collaboration with scientists from China, promoting research cooperation for jointly studying high-latitude atmospheric chemistry on the international level.
