<AbstractNarration>Emerging trends suggest that a significant share of Internet traffic will be due to real-time streaming applications. However, given the unpredictable  nature of popularity of any content and the significant swings seen in user demand, provisioning a centralized content distribution system that can guarantee the strict quality of service constraints needed for real-time streaming is a very difficult task.  Therefore, this project studies modeling paradigms and systems design for utilizing end-user resources for real-time streaming in a peer-to-peer (P2P) fashion. The rationale is that P2P networks can dynamically adapt to changing network conditions and service requirements more easily than centralized content distribution systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research effort takes a holistic approach in which, on one hand, we study fundamental performance limits of peer-to-peer streaming and design distributed algorithms to achieve these limits. On the other hand, we use these algorithms as building blocks to construct practical protocols that are implemented and validated on an emulation testbed. We bring together a rich set of analytical tools drawn from stochastic processes, optimization and control theory to merge them with real-life multimedia issues of video coding, frame dropping and trans-coding as well as practical implementation issues. Besides the technological impact of developing viable video-streaming ideas for an increasingly networked world, our project also informs and educates both students and the broader society with curriculum development, outreach and integration of under-represented groups.</AbstractNarration>

However, given the unpredictable nature of popularity of any content and the significant swings seen in user demand, provisioning a centralized content distribution system that can guarantee the strict quality of service constraints needed for real-time streaming is a very difficult task. Therefore, this project studied modeling paradigms and systems design for utilizing end-user resources for real-time streaming in a peer-to-peer (P2P) fashion. The rationale was that P2P networks can dynamically adapt to changing network conditions and service requirements more easily than centralized content distribution systems.  This research effort took a holistic approach in which, on one hand, we studied fundamental performance limits of peer-to-peer streaming and designed distributed algorithms to achieve these limits. On the other hand, we used these algorithms as building blocks to construct practical protocols that were implemented and validated on an Android smart phone testbed.  Main results of this project included the design of coordination mechanisms across peers to ensure that each peer contributes a fair share, and that the contributed resources are utilized in a socially optimal fashion.  We also developed optimal chunk and peer selection schemes in dynamic peer-to-peer networks, scheduling algorithms with hard deadlines and scheduling algorithms for coded wireless transmissions such that a certain quality of service can be maintained across all peers.  The research and technological impact of this project was to bring together a rich set of analytical tools drawn from stochastic processes, optimization and control theory to merge them with real-life multimedia issues of video coding, frame dropping and trans-coding, deadline constrained communications as well as practical implementation issues.  The project also informed and educated both students and the broader society with curriculum development on courses on computer networking and outreach to high school students via summer camps.  Several female and minority students were involved in all aspects of the project ranging from working on course projects to graduate theses.  Thus, the project also played a role in the integration of under-represented groups to the scientific community.
