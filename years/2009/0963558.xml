<AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). Atmospheric research has been conducted at the Desert Research Institute's Storm Peak Laboratory (SPL) at 3220 m ASL in northwestern Colorado for nearly 30 years. The last major renovation of SPL was done in 1995. This award will fund renovations that will allow air sampling, chemical and biological measurements under up-to-date conditions in warm and cold laboratories. A chemistry laboratory with laminar flow benches and chemical hood will meet current and future needs for preparation of aerosol filters, cloud water and snow samples. Cyberinfrastructure will be improved by upgrading SPL's internet connection to a high-bandwidth, direct microwave connection. Expanded capabilities for atmospheric sampling will be enabled through construction of five new air-handling manifolds that will allow contamination free collection of natural, anthropogenic, and biogenic aerosols and gases under well characterized aerodynamic conditions. A climate-control system will be added to ensure proper functioning of temperature-sensitive instruments. The proposed improvements will transform science at SPL by enhancing the ability to conduct atmospheric research and creating new opportunities in atmospheric biogeochemistry for research and research training.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SPL's remote continental location, year-round access, and extensive instrumental facilities allow measurement in the free atmosphere by scientists from the Desert Research Institute, eight national laboratories, and nineteen other universities in the U.S. and Europe. Research activities at SPL always involve participation by undergraduate and graduate students and post-doctoral fellows. SPL hosts atmospheric science field courses from a multitude of universities for both undergraduate and graduate students. In 2009, SPL hosted 43 undergraduate, graduate, and high school students via field courses. These classes give students experience in all facets of atmospheric science, from development of the research proposal to experiment and project planning plus final reporting. The renovations will expand the scope and focus of research conducted at SPL and thus provide additional opportunities for field training.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Exciting enhancements were completed at an exceptional mountain-top research facility by the Desert Research Institute under the National Science Foundation grant number 0963558 titled "Upgrades to Storm Peak Laboratory, A High Elevation Atmospheric Research and Education Station".    This grant has enabled dramatic improvements in air sampling of chemical and biological species under up-to-date conditions in warm and cold laboratories at Storm Peak Laboratory. A chemistry laboratory with a laminar flow bench and chemical hood now meets current and future needs for preparation of aerosol filters, cloud water and snow samples. Cyber-infrastructure has been greatly improved at the facility, allowing for expanded communication methods including frequent video conferencing. New capabilities for atmospheric sampling have been enabled through construction of air-handling manifolds, which allow contamination-free collection of natural, anthropogenic, and biogenic aerosols and gases under well-characterized aerodynamic conditions. A climate-control system has been added to ensure proper functioning of temperature-sensitive instruments. The improvements are transforming science at Storm Peak Laboratory by enhancing our ability to conduct atmospheric research.  These improvements are already creating new opportunities in atmospheric biogeochemistry for research and research training.       Storm Peak Laboratory is now used for graduate-level hydrology field courses from the University of Colorado and Ohio State University, which are integrated with an atmospheric science course from the University of Wisconsin.  These students visited Storm Peak Laboratory from March 23-30, 2013.    The upgrade to Storm Peak Laboratory made this interdisciplinary field research and training experience possible.  The previous facility did not have the functional space required for this large of a research group.   Storm Peak Laboratory hosted twenty-two researchers during this week-long field course.  There were five undergraduate students, twelve graduate students, two postdoctoral researchers, and four professors collaborating and participating with this course.  Storm Peak Laboratory also hosted a graduate level atmospheric science winter field courses from the University of Nevada, Reno in January 2013. This course was successful with five students living at Storm Peak Laboratory for one week.  This class gives students experience in all facets of atmospheric science, from development of a research proposal to experimental design, project planning, and final reporting.  Nine graduate students from Colorado State University visited for a two-day course on atmospheric aerosols in early April 2013.
