<AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II research project will develop and apply a principled design methodology to confront the serious problems associated with deep sub-micron, system-on-chip, integrated-circuit designs. The project will develop design services for companies wishing to market complex, proprietary, low-power integrated circuits through the development of a unique design tool, one which will apply a mathematically sound approach to the production of large, hazard-free, network-on-chip products. The goal for this tool is to reduce traditional design cycles by eliminating most of the global verification effort while improving the robustness of the design. New results in predicting the behavior of deep submicron arbiter circuits are essential to this work and will also be reported.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this research are to reduce design costs, time-to-market and power consumption. More broadly this can: 1) significantly increase the productivity of integrated-circuit design engineers, 2) reduce power consumption of electronic control, communication and computational systems and 3) increase our competitiveness against off-shore system-on-chip designers particularly with respect to low volume products. Thus, successful completion of this project is important to the future of the national electronics marketplace because, without a major reduction in the time spent on global verification, the benefits of higher levels of integration, including reductions in time-to-market, conservation of power and increases in reliability, will not be available to many important electronics market sectors.</AbstractNarration>

All these products and many others are made possible by integrated circuits popularly know as "computer chips." Every year the semiconductor industry turns out billions of tiny bits of silicon and every year each new chip is more powerful than in years before.

Blendics has addressed these two challenges with its two major technologies:     DANI is a Delay-tolerant Asynchronous Network Interface. This silicon intellectual property (IP) is a patented technology for interconnecting independently clocked domains. DANI eliminates the need for a global clock tree and for absolute timing constraints on clock domain crossings. DANI supports independent clock domains and relative timing constraints.  MetaACE is an analysis tool for assessing the reliability of clock domain crossings. This EDA tool will become essential as safety-critical applications of computers proliferate and clock-domain crossings grow in number to many hundreds on a single chip.

An MTBF exceeding a million years is required for any SoC that performs advanced safety features in an automobile in volume production. MetaACE can give that assurance to the automotive manufacturer and the public.      With NSF support two important milestones have been reached for these Blendics products.     The DANI technology is being licensed to a financial services provider as an essential component of a high-performance trading system. Without DANI the components of this trading system cannot be made to work together at the required speed. This is true even using the advanced design software provided by the FPGA vendor. Thus, DANI has demonstrated the advantages of an asynchronous network-on-chip in a complex, high-performance design, a design that...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
