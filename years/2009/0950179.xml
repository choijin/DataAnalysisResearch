<AbstractNarration>All organisms require chemical elements such as carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) for growth and development. P is of particular interest because it is especially important in construction of genetic material such as DNA and RNA and is often present in limiting concentrations in the environment. This project will investigate the biological rules that determine the elemental recipe ("stoichiometry") of microorganisms that grow under severely P deficient conditions in a set of unique desert springs in Mexico.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will use both laboratory and field experiments, combined with cutting-edge methods of molecular biology and genomics, to investigate how changes in P supply alter the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of these microorganisms and to reveal how they cope with shortages of this essential chemical element. Furthermore, the study will help us understand how human alterations in P supply, such as those driven by inefficient use of fertilizer or by inputs of P-rich sewage, affect microbial ecosystems. It will also help in discovery of new genes and genetic strategies by which organisms efficiently use P. These discoveries may be useful for agriculture and other settings in light of growing concern about the finite supply of economically recoverable P for fertilizer production. Finally, the project will produce bi-lingual science education products that will enhance science education in Arizona and nationally for both K/12 students and the general public.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Chemical elements such as carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) are essential to all life forms.  While each of these elements is essential, the relative use of these elements (their "stoichiometry") differs among various groups of organisms and across environmental gradients.  A primary hypothesis to explain variation in the C:P and N:P stoichiometry of living things is the Growth Rate Hypothesis (GRH), which proposes that variation in P use (and thus C:P and N:P) occurs because of variation in the use of P-rich ribosomal RNA in biota.  Ribosomal RNA is the primary structural component that makes up ribosomes, the key protein synthesis driver of rapid growth.  To test the GRH in microbial ecommunities, we perfomed a series of nutrient enrichment experiments in a severely P-limited pond in Cuatro Cienegas, a desert valley in northeastern Mexico.  After nutrient (N,P) enrichment, we quantified ecological responses of the microbes including key components of their genomes connected to growth rate and ribosome production and function, as well as other traits.  Our findings provide provisional support for the GRH as we observed that, as predicted, microbial taxa with relative high copies of the the ribosomal RNA gene, as well as other traits associated with rapid growth, were favored by nutrient enrichment.  Our findings have strong relevance for human society because of the key role that P plays in driving human agriculture and in degradation of water quality.  By uncovering some of the ways that aquatic and soil bacteria cope with P limitation, we provide information that may facilitate approaches to improve management of agricultural soils to increase agronomic P efficiency, a key goal given emerging societal challenges in the area of P sustainability.
