<AbstractNarration>Applied Computer Security Associates, Inc. (ACSA), the sponsor of the Annual Computer Security Applications Conference (ACSAC) requested funding to support undergraduate and graduate students attendance at the 25th ACSAC, to be held December 7-11 2009.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ACSAC conference, currently celebrating its 25th anniversary, is a top-tier academic security conference which averages about 200 highly skilled security professional attendees per year. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ACSAC regularly brings together the foremost minds in academic, governmental and commercial computer security to both address the most pressing problems in applied computer security, as well discuss seminal works in Computer Security. Besides our keynotes (the "Invited Essayist" and "Distinguished Practitioner"), in 2000, ACSAC introduced the "Classic Papers" series, in which two or three authors of seminal papers in computer security are invited to update those papers and present lessons learned. These papers, available free on the ACSAC web site, familiarize a new generation of students with key security research developments of the past, and provide a valuable resource for undergraduate and graduate instruction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NSF funding will provide worthy students with an opportunity to meet and interact with notable figures at the conference, whose past attendees have included luminaries such as Whitfield Diffie (Sun), Stephanie Forrest (U of New Mexico), Brian Snow (NSA), Steve Lipner (Microsoft), Gene Spafford (Purdue), Peter Neumann (SRI), and Steve Bellovin (Columbia). There have been many examples where speakers at ACSAC have been seen "holding class" with attendees after the formal session has ended.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The 25th Annual Computer Security Applications Conference (ACSAC) was  held Dec 7-11 in Honolulu Hawaii. Over 250 attendees from 20 countries  attended five days of tutorials, workshops, panels, keynote speeches,  and refereed papers.  Among the 250 attendees were over 45 students.  ACSAC  is a highly selective security conference.  Of over 270 papers  submitted, fewer than 40 were accepted for inclusion in the conference  and publication in the proceedings.  NSF funding  allowed ACSAC to provide sponsorship (registration fees and partial  travel support) to US students whose home institutions were unable to  provide funding, as well as registration fees for local students from the University of Hawaii.  ACSAC also provided funding from general registration  fees for non-US students; in total, 15 students (9 US, plus students  from India and China) received financial support to participate  in the conference.  An additional 30 students received discounted  registration fees, paid by ACSAC from general regisration fees.  The  winner of this year's Best Student Paper award, who attends Rutgers University, also received travel support from ACSAC, as  well as an honoraria.   In short, students are an integral part of the ACSAC  community.  They are encouraged to interact with speakers and  experienced government and industry experts through sessions, luncheons,  and receptions.   ACSAC appreciates NSF support in allowing us to expand our historical support for student participation in the conference.
