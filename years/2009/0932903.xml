<AbstractNarration>0932903&lt;br/&gt;Enderle&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this proposal is the continued publication for an additional five years of an annual review of completed senior design projects for persons with disabilities that have been supported by the NSF through the Research to Aid Persons with Disabilities (RAPD) program. The academic years to be funded include 2007-2008 through 2011-2012. Previous editions have been compiled annually since 1989. A total of 18 books have been published (1989-2006). The 2006-2007 annual publication will be funded by another pending grant application. Over 2,200 projects have been detailed in these publications between 1989 and 2005, involving over 6,000 students. The projects described are custom designed to address the specific needs of the persons with disabilities, serving over thousands of persons with disabilities. Publication in this annual publication is required of all senior design projects funded by the NSF for persons with disabilities. Each annual review begins with a title page, a table of contents and a forward describing the history of the program. Following the introduction and several chapters on best practices in design and assessment are the project description chapters. Each project description chapter is devoted to one of the participating schools in the RAPD program. The first project of each chapter is described with more detail than the projects that follow so that the analytic content of the project can be more fully described. Due to space constraints, the remainder of the chapter includes one- or two-page reports for each of the completed projects. For ease in reading, each report uses a consistent format: Introduction, Summary of Impact, and Technical Description. At the end of the book, an index is provided so that projects can be easily identified and cross-referenced. &lt;br/&gt;A WWW site was created at http://nsf-pad.bme.uconn.edu to boost the dissemination of these publications. The entire site is fully searchable for ease in locating projects of interest for all published books. In the past, 600 copies of each edition have been printed using a soft cover and heavy weight glossy paper. Now, 25 copies of the book will be printed each year, along with 600 professional quality CDs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit. The annual review of NSF funded projects to aid persons with disabilities serves as a handbook for future design projects to aid persons with disabilities and acts as a reference for individuals dealing with implementing the Americans with Disabilities Act and related legislation. The web feature of the publication makes it easy to locate projects or ideas for persons working in the field of rehabilitation engineering. The annual publication has also been used by the NSF to brief Congress on NSF funded projects that impact the lives of persons with disabilities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact. The annual review of NSF funded projects to aid persons with disabilities has motivated universities to participate in this program because of the potential benefits to the students, individuals with disabilities, colleges and universities, and communities. Over 6,000 students have participated in the publications, including many from underrepresented groups. The books are broadly distributed throughout the US to those working with persons with disabilities. For universities participating in this program, the books provide substantial guidance to instructors and teaching materials for future design projects. It also has inspired all individuals to work more actively in the field of rehabilitation, leading to an increased technology and knowledge base to effectively address the needs of people with disabilities. The projects reported have had a tremendous impact on thousands of persons with disabilities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   In 1988, the National Science Foundation initiated a program to provide funds for student engineers at universities throughout the United States to construct custom designed devices and software for individuals with disabilities. Through the General &amp; Age-Related Disabilities Engineering Program, funds are awarded competitively to universities to cover supplies, equipment and fabrication costs for design projects.  The PI has received funding from the NSF to edit and publish a yearly publication reporting on NSF-sponsored senior engineering design projects to aid persons with disabilities since 1988.  Typically, 15 universities have participated in the program each year, with a typical book containing 400 pages.  A total of 19 books were published previously under previous awards from 1989-2007 describing over 2,300 projects built by approximately 6,500 students.      The objective of this project was the publication of an additional five annual reviews of completed senior design projects at universities throughout the United States for persons with disabilities for academic years 2007-2008 through 2011-2012.  The introductory chapters describe best practices in design, outcomes assessment, and writing about and working with individuals who have disabilities.  After these chapters, each of the following chapters includes descriptions of design projects at a single university, written by students and principal investigator(s) at that university, and edited by the PI.  For the most part, a two-page project description format is used for each book. Each project is first briefly described. A summary of impact then illustrates the effect of the project on a person's life. A detailed technical description follows. Photographs of the devices and other important components are incorporated throughout the report. Some of the projects are described more extensively, covering many pages; these projects are typically the first or last project in a chapter. During the five years covered by this project, 711 projects are described involving over 2,100 students.
