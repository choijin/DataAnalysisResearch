<AbstractNarration>One of the most important recent advances in nonlinear optics has been the development of a new generation of very stable short-pulse lasers, with typical pulse durations of just a few femtoseconds.  Such lasers have numerous applications.  Among others, they provide precise sources for spectroscopy and frequency metrology, and are an essential component in optical atomic clocks.  Because of the many physical effects present and the vastly different timescales involved, however, making quantitative predictions about the behavior of these systems and their fundamental performance limits is a challenging task.  This project will address these challenges by developing new mathematical models aimed at describing these lasers' behavior and an accompanying set of analytical and computational tools.  The new models, which will explicitly take into account the inherent complexity of these systems and the multiple time scales present, will then be used to analyze the mode-locking and nonlinear dynamics of pulses in the laser cavity.  Moreover, these new models will guide the development of statistical computational algorithms that can accurately quantify the impact of noise and calculate the probability of the rare events that limit the accuracy and ultimate reliability of these systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Femtosecond lasers have a wide range of applicability.  Beyond metrology and atomic clocks, already mentioned, important applications are a new generation of global positioning systems, the probing of transients occurring during chemical reactions and the ablation of tumors.  Thus, this project will impact not only the scientific community, but also society at large.  The new mathematical models and computational methods that will be derived as part of this project will substantially advance the theory of femtosecond lasers, and they will make it possible to accurately and efficiently predict the performance of these lasers. As a result, they will provide useful tools for the scientists and engineers who design and build these systems.  An important part of the project will also be the training of students and junior researchers: through this interdisciplinary effort, students will be trained to use concepts, methods and techniques outside their main discipline, thus greatly enriching their educational and professional experience.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The aim of the project was to study analytically and numerically various systems of equations that model the propagation of coherent light (e.g., laser) in a variety of media (optical fibers as well as certain kinds of crystals), as well as the resonant interaction of light and matter.  In addition, various numerical have been investigated to efficiently compute error probabilities in optical fiber communication systems as a result of the presence of amplier noise and random birefringence.  The specific outcomes of the project can be divided in the following 3 tegories:  1. Efficient analytical and numerical methods for estimating error probabilities  1a. Importance sampling (IS) methods for noise-induced perturbations of solitons in dispersion-managed (DM) systems have been generalized in order to study the effect of noise on the pulse phase, and these techniques have been use to compute the noise-induced distributions of the pulse parameters.  1b. A numerical study has been performed to quantify the efficiency increase in computational time afforded by the use of variance reduction techniques (VRTs) applied to polarization-mode dispersion (PMD) in installed fiber transmission links. Various performance measures have been monitored, such as coefficient of variation and number of samples needed to obtain a given level of accuracy.  1c. A new model for PMD in installed fiber transmission systems has been proposed, which contains previously existing models as special cases but can also describe more general kinds of behavior. The properties of this new model have been studied analytically and numerically; appropriate VRTs have been formulated; and numerical simulations have been performed to compare the system impact of different PMD models.  2. Study of boundary-value problems for discrete and continuous wave equations relevant to optics applications.    In particular, three models have been successfully studied: (i) focusing nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) equation on the half line,  (i) the defocusing NLS equation on the half line with non-zero boundary conditions (NZBC) at infinity, and (iii) the Ablowitz-Ladik lattice on the natural numbers. In all cases, symmetries of the discrete spectrum and the norming constants have been identified, and the resulting boundary-induced behavior of the solitons has been elucidated.  3. Development of inverse scattering transform (IST) for systems with NZBC at infinity   3.1: The IST for multi-component NLS equations with NZBC has been developed, and explicit solutions are in the process of being obtained.  3.2: The IST for Maxwell-Bloch systems with NZBC has been developed, and explicit solutions are in the process of being obtained.
