<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program aims to control the functionality of materials by targeting specific electronic structures through "internal design" principles rather than through less direct structure-property relationships.  This approach will be used to find new thermoelectric materials within the class of transition metal oxides with direct metal-metal bonding, which lifts the typical degeneracy of the d-electron states giving rise to both small band gap semiconductors and high density-of-states metals.  A thorough investigation of physical properties (such as resistivity, magnetism, thermopower, and thermal conductivity) will be undertaken to explore whether the fÂ¬-electron-like states of these compounds can be tuned to produce improved materials performance, and whether these unusual electronic states give rise to any unexpected phenomena.  In addition, spectroscopic studies of these materials will be carried out to test the potential of these materials as stable small band gap semiconductors for optical applications.  Through these investigations, it should be possible to develop a framework for better understanding this intriguing class of compounds.  This work will be supported by efforts to develop synchrotron microcrystallography techniques with the long term goal of obtaining single crystal diffraction data from the crystallites in typical powder samples.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The performance of many high-tech devices is limited by the properties of the solid state materials from which they are built.  This project will test new strategies for designing solid state materials for energy applications, directly incorporating theoretical calculations into the design process to efficiently discover improved materials.  The primary target of this project is better thermoelectric materials, which have applications for electricity production through waste heat recovery, satellite power generation, and efficient solid state refrigeration.  The metal oxide systems being studied may also provide new superconducting compounds and new small band gap semiconductors for infrared (IR) detection applications that can serve as air stable and non-toxic alternatives to current systems based on cadmium mercury telluride compounds. The fundamental synthesis, characterization, and theoretical skills necessary to understand and carry out the "internal design" of materials will be integrated into teaching and outreach efforts, as they provide the key insights needed to generate materials solutions for energy and other societal challenges.  Particular emphasis is placed on crystallography, including national educational efforts aimed at addressing deficiencies in typical academic curricula and at broadening participation in experiments at x-ray and neutron national laboratory facilities.  Active research mentoring of students interested in energy research at all levels will be a key component of this effort, including the diverse undergraduate and high school students in the New York City Metropolitan area.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Transition metal oxides are one of the most important classes of functional materials as they play a central role in many high-technology applications (batteries, sensors, actuators, superconductors, etc.).  The functionality in transition metal oxides is typically derived from chemical bonds between the transition metal cations and the oxygen anions.  In this project, we investigated an anomalous family of transition metal compounds in which the bonding occurs not just between the metals and oxygens, but also directly between metals, which therefore leads to the possibility for unusual properties and novel functionality.    The investigations in this project were focused on lanthanum molybdenum oxides. The molybdenum cations are most responsible for the electronic and magnetic properties while the lanthanum cations play more of a structural role and dictate the connectivity of the functional molybdenum-oxide framework.  In the course of this work, we both discovered new compounds and gained a new structural understand of existing compounds.  By looking comprehensively across this entire family of compounds we were able to for the first time gain an understanding of how the crystal structure of these compounds affects the chemical bonding within these compounds and therefore the properties of these materials.  Despite the complex nature of these compounds, we were able to use general and simple chemical bonding arguments to explain the interactions between the metal-oxygen bonds and the metal-metal bonds that dictate the electronic structure of these materials.  In the future, this will allow more accurate initial predictions about the properties of this class of materials to better choose the most appropriate candidates for in-depth study of functionality.    The electronic structures of these compounds determine their band gaps.  From our optical measurements, it was clear that the lanthanum molybdenum oxide materials with direct metal-metal bonding absorb light over a much wider range than typical transition metal oxides, with absorption features extending far into the infrared regime.  While a full understanding of the optical features has not yet been attained, we were still able to identify the origin of some of the most intense optical features in these compounds as deriving from interactions of light with molecular orbitals specifically associated with the metal-metal bonds.  These properties are intriguing in that the materials presently used for infrared applications are non-oxide materials which tend to have much lower stabilities and much higher toxicities than the oxide compounds studied in this work.  Additionally, the wide range of light absorption of these materials (involving many distinct peaks in both the infrared and visible ranges of the electromagnetic spectrum) made them particularly useful in establishing and validating new general methods for determining the refractive index and absolute absorption coefficients of loose powder samples, something that was not previously possible.  In the past, the determination of these optical properties required either the laborious growth of single crystal samples or very time-consuming measurements on densified powder pellets.  The new optical methods that were developed with the help of this project will reduce the timescale for obtaining this optical information from months to days.  These advances in measurement methodologies will thus lead to a greatly improved general understanding of the absorption of light by solids, which is of key importance in the development of function materials for light harvesting applications, thus supporting the development of semiconductors for photovoltaics, for solar water splitting, or for dyes and pigments.    Since many of the materials studied in this work could be much more readily prepared as powders than as single crystals, we also developed advanced powder diffraction approaches for the study of their crystal structures, including the identification of previously unknown superstructures, stacking faults, and oxygen vacancies.  The expertise gained through this project was disseminated in the form of a new summer school, "Modern Methods in Rietveld Refinement and Structural Analysis", taught annually to 30 - 40 participants of the course of about a week.  In this school, participants had the opportunity to learn how to collect and analyze powder diffraction data from premier national user facilities for synchrotron X-ray and time-of-flight neutron powder diffraction, directly working with scientists who run beamlines at these facilities.  In this manner, this project has supported the training of scientists in a about a hundred different research groups (that are carrying out research in high-tech materials for many different applications) in cutting-edge methods for structural analysis, thus leveraging the national investment of billions of dollars in these superb user facilities with unique capabilities for the analysis of solid state materials.  All the course materials have been made available online, thus providing a unique educational resource for the materials community and impacting many more researchers than were able to directly attend the course in person.
