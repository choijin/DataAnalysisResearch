<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to explore a novel idea for circumventing the fundamental superparamagnetic limit that causes thermal instability leading to arbitrary switching of the nano-sized magnetic elements required for increasingly high density disk drives beyond 1 Tbit/in2. The approach is to fabricate nano-patterned graded anisotropy magnetic media using top-down nano-imprint lithography patterning of sputter-deposited films. Recent theoretical predictions indicate that by creating nano-columns of magnetic media that gradually change from a soft magnetic material with low anisotropy at one end to a hard magnetic material with high anisotropy at the other end, the thermal instability may be avoided. Moreover, small magnetic fields can be used to switch high anisotropy materials, making it easier to design the read-write head that is the other essential component of the disk drive.&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project is that it will address a fundamental physical problem that is at the heart of the current limitations of data storage. The project is interdisciplinary in nature, and the shared graduate student will combine an in-depth study of various magnetic materials for creating the graded media with device aspects related to the actual nano-column fabrication and testing. &lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts resulting from this GOALI project will be the multi-disciplinary education and exposure of a female graduate student to industrial pressures as well as academic rigor, and the opportunity for experimental proof of a revolutionary concept for  future data storage. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ As industry tries to increase the areal density of data storage, it becomes necessary to develop nanopatterned media. The "GOALI: Nanopatterned graded media" project was focused on finding methods to pattern advanced perpendicular media. The media that was deposited for patterning included Co/Pd multilayers, and CoPt and FeBPt alloys. These were all perpendicular anisotropy, high coercivity materials.  Patterning was accomplished by nanosphere lithography and block copolymer templating. The nanosphere lithography method did not produce uniformly patterned nanopillars over large areas, so we focused on the block copolymer templating using PS-PFS.

The nanopillars achieved by this technique were 30 nm in diameter, and the coercivity of the patterned films were significantly higher than the as-deposited films.  Another thrust of the research was development of nanorods of media using glancing angle deposition (GLAD). This technique used self-shadowing to grow nanorods of the media material. The coercivity of the nanorods was found to be much higher than that of the unpatterned film.  The GLAD deposition and nanosphere lithography were combined to produce distinct nanorods, but they were too large to be of much use for data storage. Ou main project outcomes were therefore the enhancement of coercivity by block copolymer templating and by glancing angle deposition of nanorods.  We also studied the structural and magnetic properties of patterned perpendicular media with linearly graded anisotropy. L10-FePt thin films with linearly distributed anisotropy were fabricated by continuously varying substrate temperatures. The patterned nanopillar arrays exhibit an enhancement in both remanence and coercivity. Dynamic coercivity measurement shows that the nanopillar arrays with linearly graded anisotropy have a relatively small intrinsic coercivity and a relatively high value of the figure of merit.  In addition, we systematically studied ion damage in fabrication of bit-patterned media and demonstrated the various degradation of magnetic properties at different ion milling angles and accelerating voltages.
