<AbstractNarration>"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5)." &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides funding for a 3 year standard award to support a Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) in Engineering Site program at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University (ERAU) entitled, "Research Experiences for Teachers: Aviation and Aerospace", under the direction of Dr. Christopher D. Grant. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program hosted by the ERAU College of Engineering will provide a 6 week summer experience for a total of 30 in-service high school science teachers from local school districts (10 per year for 3 years).  These teachers will be given the opportunity to be actively involved in research that will allow them to bring knowledge of engineering and technological innovation related to aviation/aerospace into their classrooms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of the program are: 1) Actively involving high school teachers in engineering research that has an aviation or aerospace focus; 2) Having the teachers bring knowledge of engineering and technological innovation from the research lab into their classrooms; 3) Improving the teachers' understanding of engineering, the engineering design process, and research activities in universities;  4) Building long-term collaborative partnerships between the teachers and the ERAU researchers both during the summer and continuing throughout the academic year; and 5) Helping the teachers translate their research experiences and new knowledge of engineering into classroom learning modules disseminated across the participating teachers' districts, high schools which have joint agreements with ERAU, and the national SECME network of STEM teachers.</AbstractNarration>
