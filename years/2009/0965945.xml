<AbstractNarration>The transformation of stem cell biology discoveries into technologies for a range of applications has enormous promise to impact a broad spectrum of society; however, achieving this aim will only occur if individuals are trained with the necessary interdisciplinary expertise to facilitate growth of the field. This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Training (IGERT) award to the Georgia Institute of Technology provides such training for Ph.D. graduate students by creating a comprehensive educational program that brings together technological innovation, commercialization, and public policy aspects of stem cell research. The specific research projects conducted as part of this training focus on developing standardized and quantitative methods necessary for stem cell isolation, characterization, propagation, and differentiation. Scalable biomanufacturing practices will be developed to efficiently produce sufficient numbers of stem cells and derivatives in readily accessible formats in order to meet the need for novel therapeutic and diagnostic applications of stem cells. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the research and educational activities to train Ph.D. students to be leaders in the field of stem cell biomanufacturing, one of the broader impacts of this program will be to provide students with a global scientific perspective based upon the established relationships with our international partners. Graduates will contribute to the burgeoning stem cell industry, catalyzing new biomedical and biotechnological opportunities for stem cells to impact society. A key broader impact and long-term objective of the program will be to foster the participation of members of underrepresented groups in stem cell engineering. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to meet the challenges of educating U.S. Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the interdisciplinary background, deep knowledge in a chosen discipline, and the technical, professional, and personal skills needed for the career demands of the future. The program is intended to catalyze a cultural change in graduate education by establishing innovative new models for graduate education and training in a fertile environment for collaborative research that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This National Science Foundation-funded IGERT on Stem Cell Biomanufacturing has stimulated the establishment of an educational program for Ph.D. students at the Georgia Institute of Technology in the area of the manufacturing of cells. Such a program is necessary if basic stem cell research is to be translated into clinical treatments for patients. This IGERT provided a foundation for Georgia to secure an award from the National Institute for Standards and Technology to fund the development of a roadmap for cell manufacturing. This resulted in the creation of a joint academic and industry cell manufacturing consortium. Because of the leadership of Georgia Tech in this area, the Marcus Foundation made a gift of more than 16 million dollars to the institution in order to establish the Marcus Center for Therapeutic Cell Characterization and Manufacturing. These funds together with the cost-sharing from Georgia Tech are being used to establish new core facilities and in the recruitment of additional faculty. The Marcus Center also has submitted a proposal to the National Science Foundation for the establishment of an Engineering Research Center (ERC) in this area. In addition, in order to further the education of our IGERT Ph.D. students an international short course has been organized in partnership with institutions in the United Kingdom and Portugal. This was first held in 2013 in Portugal, and in 2016 Georgia Tech hosted this course in Hilton Head, South Carolina. It next will be held in 2018 back in Europe. Originally funded for five years, this IGERT was given what totaled two years in no-cost extensions. Over this total of seven years, the Ph.D. students supported by this IGERT were provided a unique education.
