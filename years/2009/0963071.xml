<AbstractNarration>This project will develop software for the application of rapid, robust, and interactive dimensionality reduction and clustering algorithms to real-world datasets.  The software, called Divvy, will provide parallel visualization of multiple dimensionality reduction and clustering techniques, flexible domain knowledge integration, customizable exemplar and outlier visualization, and dynamic indicators of cluster quality using theoretically sound cluster quality measures.  Divvy will leverage recent advances in parallel and graphics processing unit computing in order to deliver near real-time calculation of partitions on many datasets.  Divvy also will be used as a platform for psychophysical studies that investigate the role and behavior of human researchers in the data-analysis process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Machine learning techniques are increasingly essential for scientific analysis in many different fields.  As datasets increase in size and dimensionality, scientists need access to tools that can help them quickly and easily perform exploratory data analysis and visualization.  Divvy will allow a user to rapidly interact with and visualize the results of many different dimensionality-reduction and clustering algorithms through an intuitive interface.  By collecting a broad set of cutting-edge machine-learning tools in one user-friendly interface, Divvy will enable substantial improvements in data analysis methodology for researchers outside of machine learning and related fields.  This project will support workshops and tutorials at conferences outside the machine learning field in order to evangelize recent machine learning techniques and encourage adoption of Divvy.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Research in machine learning has created many valuable data analysis techniques but most of these techniques are not easily accessible to others outside the field. New algorithms are often difficult to learn and apply correctly; research papers are not usually written for a general audience and software implementations may not be provided or may be provided for an unfamiliar or expensive language or platform.  Additionally, algorithms often make strong assumptions about the structure of their inputs, or are very sensitive to parameter changes.  The goal of this grant was to create Divvy - a free, open-source user-friendly exploratory data analysis tool.  The idea was to develop a package that allows users to access sophisticated contemporary unsupervised machine learning techniques without having to implement them themselves.  By providing several different algorithms, the package also allows users to experiment with different methods to better understand their data.  At the same time machine learning researchers can increase the accessibility of their algorithms and extend Divvy's functionality by using Divvy to publish easy to use reference implementations of their own algorithms.  The code is written to use plugins with a specific user interface protocol to make it easy for advanced users to develop and distribute their own plugins with new capabilities.  Divvy is a 64-bit Mac OS X 10.6 or 10.7 (Snow Leopard or Lion) application for applying unsupervised machine learning techniques (clustering and dimensionality reduction) to the data analysis process. Divvy provides a novel user interface that allows researchers to quickly see the result of changing algorithms and parameters.  For visualization Divvy provides support for both the whole dataset (e.g. a scatter plot) and individual data points (e.g. transforming a particular point into an image).  Divvy is task-parallel so that you can continue to interact with the software while waiting for longer algorithms to finish and the core parts of the algorithms are coded using parallel GPU and CPU algorithms to speed up the processing. Dataset views appear quickly and can be scaled in real time like album art in iTunes all the way from filling the window to a tiny thumbnail. The Divvy application automatically saves state between runs, so a researcher can quit the program and upon restarting it have exactly the list of datasets and corresponding views from the previous session.
