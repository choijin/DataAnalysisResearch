<AbstractNarration>Continuing support is provided for the international oceanographic activities of the Scientific Committee on Oceanic Research (SCOR)  that are relevant to U.S. interests in marine sciences and the  Division of Ocean Sciences. Support of these international activities through SCOR began in 1987. The SCOR provides an international, interdisciplinary, non-governmental focus for ocean research and makes it possible for national ocean science communities to (1) participate in international research projects, (2) identify important ocean science issues and create working groups to address the issues, and (3) participate in capacity-building activities (40% of SCOR national committees are based in developing countries).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funds provided by NSF for the activities of international Scientific Steering Committees (SSCs) of large-scale ocean research projects ensure SCOR oversight of these projects in terms of SSC membership, terms of reference, and scientific directions and progress. The proposed support from NSF is especially important for SCOR involvement in and oversight of the major ocean projects. Funding is requested for partial support of the SSCs of the Global Ocean Ecosystem Dynamics (GLOBEC) project, the Surface Ocean ? Lower Atmosphere Study (SOLAS), the Global Ecology and Oceanography of Harmful Algal Blooms (GEOHAB) program, the Integrated Marine Biogeochemistry and Ecosystem Research (IMBER) project, and the GEOTRACES project. These activities also are supported by other international and national sponsors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These major programs have origins in U.S. and have turned to SCOR to provide a forum for international planning and coordination. SCOR's impact has and will continue to be evident in the standardization of measurement protocols, sharing of data, coordination of ship time, and the enlargement of field studies which would be impossible without international coordination.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
