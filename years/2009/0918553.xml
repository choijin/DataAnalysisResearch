<AbstractNarration>Ecological properties that facilitate the invasion of weedy species into native populations have been studied intensively.  In contrast the potentially critical role for evolutionary processes in many biological invasions has rarely been considered.  This project will explore the extent to which hybridization (crosses between species) influences invasion of the aquatic plant Myriophyllum heterophyllum (Water Milfoil), and the effects of invasion history on the evolutionary trajectories of genetically distinct lineages.  Specifically, this research will utilize numerous molecular markers to compare patterns of gene flow in the native and invaded range, and will utilize a field reciprocal transplant experiment to determine whether hybrid lineages grow more invasively than non-hybrid lineages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Biological invasions are widely recognized as a major social, economic, and environmental threat.  Water Milfoil is a significant invasive in the northeastern United States and severely impacts recreation and property values.  The proposed research activities will highlight the evolutionary and genetic contributions to invasiveness and will directly influence aquatic plant management decisions and policy.  Resulting data also will be incorporated into a new course in Molecular Ecology and the project will provide research experiences to several undergraduate students and one Master's degree student at an undergraduate institution.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Genetic variation and evolutionary processes are increasingly recognized as playing an important role in the success of many invasive species.  In particular, hybridization &ndash;either between native and introduced species or between genetically distinct lineages of introduced species &ndash; has been hypothesized to facilitate the evolution of invasiveness.  However, direct empirical comparisons of introduced parental and hybrid lineages are limited in number.  This project used a combination of molecular, field, and laboratory studies to determine the influence of cryptic genetic variation and hybridization on biological invasions of two species of aquatic weeds, variable-leaf watermilfoil (Myriophyllum heterophyllum) and Eurasian watermilfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum).  Overall, the results of the research provide empirical support for a role of hybridization in the evolution of invasiveness, although introduced parental lineages can be equally invasive in some ecological contexts.     An extensive set of molecular markers were used to distinguish morphologically cryptic lineages of watermilfoils.  In the northeastern and western United States, molecular markers distinguished three cryptic introductions of variable-leaf watermilfoil (M. heterophyllum): one lineage originates from native populations along the Atlantic Coastal Plain, a second lineage originates from interior portions of the US, and a third lineage is an interspecific hybrid (M. heterophyllum x M. laxum) that originates from the southern US where the two speciesÆ ranges overlap.  Similarly, molecular markers identified two introductions of genetically distinct but morphologically cryptic Eurasian watermilfoil (M. spicatum), and numerous independent hybridization events between this introduced species and its native sister species, northern watermilfoil (Myriophyllum sibiricum).     Field and laboratory experiments were used to determine whether cryptic lineages of watermilfoils, and hybrids in particular, were ecologically distinct.  In the northeastern US, the three cryptic lineages of variable-leaf milfoil exhibit distinct growth characteristics.  Some evidence was found in support of the hypothesis that hybrids are more invasive than pure introduced parental lineages because the interspecific hybrid lineage exhibited higher biomass, individual plant size, and greater branching than at least one parental lineage of introduced M. heterophyllum.  However, introduced parental lineages did not differ from the hybrid for some traits, demonstrating that pure parental lineages can also be invasive.  Clearer support for the hypothesis that hybrids are more invasive than parental lineages was found for Eurasian watermilfoil, which exhibit faster growth rates and decreased sensitivity to some herbicides used to limit their growth and spread in comparison to parental lineages.      This project had far-reaching Broader Impacts.  Three graduate students developed their Masters of Science theses under the framework of this project, and seven undergraduate students participated in the project.  The research has resulted in six peer-reviewed publications to date, and each publication has one or more student authors.  In addition, data collected as part of this research were incorporated into my Molecular Ecology course, and several of the molecular concepts have been incorporated into a hands-on educational module as part of the K-12 Education &amp; Outreach program at my home institution.  Finally, the research contributed to partnerships with government and industry and had direct impacts on invasive aquatic plant species regulation and management.  For example, one published study from this project used molecular methods to identify the widespread sale of prohibited watermilfoils in the aquarium trade.  In addition, I worked with several state regulatory agencies to develop management strategies based on the combined genetic and ecological data collected on various mor...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
