<AbstractNarration>This project will develop complementary techniques to analyze the stability behavior of stochastic delay systems.  In addition, we will examine phenomena caused by the combination of noise and time delays.  These investigations will be tailored towards the specific applications of real time dynamic substructuring and machining experiments.  We will also investigate two alternatives for parameter identification in nonlinear systems that contain delays and stochastic parameters.  In summary, the proposed research will provide new tools that could potentially impact a broad scope of applications in engineering, physics, biology, and signal processing.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The above research objectives consider timely and relevant studies to advance the frontiers in two important application areas. Educational efforts will include outreach activities in teaching Jr./Sr. high school students about vibrations through demonstrations.  Graduate student experiences will include cross-training at both universities, industry interactions, and research interactions with international collaborators.  The PIs will work with the Society of Hispanic Engineers, Alliance for Minority Participation, and the Society of Women Engineers to identify under-represented students with compatible interest.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Time delays are inherent to many highly disparate application areas.  Some examples include the response time of neurons, human reaction time, the time delays in sensing, processing, and feedback control systems, and the models of the cutting forces in machining.  However, the complexities of these mathematical models have often prevented investigators, researchers and companies, alike from gaining insight into the behavior of these systems.  In particular, many applications involve piecwise forces whic prevent the application of many current techniques for reolving the systems behavior.  Some examples include balancing during human walking or interrupting cutting operations found in the world of manufacturing.  This research takes aim at removing this current limitation in understanding the stability of these systems when the math models include the inherent time delays.  Our progress in this area should enable the comprehensive investigation of these types of systems.  We have developed fundamental mathematical approaches to solve for the system stability behavior.  This research resulted in many research publications which include a book chapter, more than twelve journal articles, and a series of conference publications.    The broader impacts of this research include the hosting of underrepresented groups for summer research experiences, supporting another underrepresented group towards her PhD, and creating science demonstrations for local elementary schools.
