    <AbstractNarration>0926841&lt;br/&gt;Granick&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests partial funding to support the 2009 Liquids, Chemistry &amp; Physics of Gordon Research Conference: Today's Problems &amp; Tomorrow's Solutions Challenging Our Needs in Liquids Research to be held August 2-6, 2009, Holderness School, Holderness, New Hampshire. Liquids the study of their engineering, chemistry, and physics affects us all. Controlling their structure and multiphase flow can either inhibit or enable technological advances from energy dissipation in pipelines, particle technology, and large engines, to body prostheses, MEMS and nanotechnological devices. Thus, in the 21st Century, liquid flows will continue to critically impact all aspects of our quality of life, health, wealth and livelihood and there are significant challenges to be addressed, many requiring paradigm shifts in both our approaches and thinking. The biennial Gordon Research Conference in Liquids is the premier basic research meeting for this research field and supporting scientists. Coming from all parts of the world, leading scientists from universities, national labs and industries gather with young scientists and newcomers to the field for one week of formal and informal discussions on state of the art issues in this multidisciplinary and multi scale subject. Today's Problems &amp; Tomorrow's Solutions Challenging Our Needs in Liquids Research theme is our attempt to explore how underlying science, including recent advances in our understanding of multiphase flow, physics, chemistry and characterization tools can help solve the problems posed by tomorrows applications. Simultaneously we wish to examine the converse problem: how the perceived demands of tomorrow's innovative devices and applications can reveal the blanks in our current understandings and research capabilities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit is that the speakers and discussion leaders chosen for the 2009 GRC Conference on Liquids are amongst the most eminent scholars and researchers in the world. Besides bringing many of the established intellectual leaders of the subject together to brainstorm the future, there is also a very strong commitment to fully involve practicing engineers and young scientists from a range of related disciplines so that they may not only learn of the latest research tools but also contribute to the paradigm changes in approach which are necessary for underpinning and enabling the future. The conference this year will emphasize the freshest topics from the viewpoints of theory, experiment, and computer simulation. This conference aims to cross-fertilize between different communities and to resist their balkanization. An important aspect of the conference in 2009, as distinct from past years, is the heavy representation by speakers and attendees in the field of multiphase flow. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact is to support both travel/registration support for students and young researchers who will markedly benefit from the networking experience which the Gordon Conferences provide but who could not otherwise be able to attend because of funding restrictions. On the final day we will have a session in which the best posters are presented orally. We will recognize the most outstanding posters, especially those presented by graduate students and postdocs. Among the speakers and discussion leaders, this conference has excellent representation from women. Applications for support will be open to all interested individuals, but if this conference becomes over subscribed, we will impose priorities in selecting attendees and special consideration will be given to students and postdocs who are female, and also under-represented ethnic minority or disabled individuals.</AbstractNarration>
