<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spectacular blooms of Phaeocystis antarctica in the Ross Sea, Antarctica are the source of some of the world's highest concentrations of dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) and its volatile degradation product, dimethylsulfide (DMS). The flux of DMS from the oceans to the atmosphere in this region and its subsequent gas phase oxidation generates aerosols that have a strong influence on cloud properties and possibly climate. In the oceans, DMS and DMSP are quantitatively significant components of the carbon, sulfur, and energy flows in marine food webs, especially in the Ross Sea. Despite its central role in carbon and sulfur biogeochemistry in the Ross Sea, surprisingly little is known about the physiological functions of DMSP in P. Antarctica. The research will isolate and characterize DMSP lyases from P. antarctica, with the goal of obtaining amino acid and gene sequence information on these important enzymes. The physiological studies will focus on the effects of varying intensities of photosynthetically active radiation, with and without ultraviolet radiation as these are factors that we have found to be important controls on DMSP and DMS dynamics. The research also will examine the effects of prolonged darkness on the dynamics of DMSP and related compounds in P. antarctica, as survival of this species during the dark Antarctic winter and at sub-euphotic depths appears to be an important part of the Phaeocystis? ecology. A unique aspect of this work is the focus on measurements of intracellular MSA, which if detected, would provide strong evidence for in vivo radical scavenging functions for methyl sulfur compounds. The study will advance understanding of what controls DMSP cycling and ultimately DMS emissions from the Ross Sea and also provide information on what makes P. antarctica so successful in this extreme environment.  The research will directly benefit and build on several interrelated ocean-atmosphere programs including the International Surface Ocean Lower Atmosphere Study (SOLAS) program.  The PIs will participate in several activities involving K-12 education, High School teacher training, public education and podcasting through the auspices of the Dauphin Island Sea Lab Discovery Hall program and SUNY ESF. Two graduate students will be employed full time, and six undergraduates (2 each summer) will be trained as part of this project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The marine phytoplantion species Phaeocystis antarctica (Prymnesiophycea) is responsible for massive blooms that occur in the Austral spring covering large swaths of the Ross Sea, and accounting for approximately 23% of the total annual primary production in the Southern Ocean. P. antarctica often grows in millimeter to centimeter-sized spherical colonies where cells are embedded in a thin mucous layer surrounding a hollow center.  Associated with colonial P. antarctica blooms are very high concentrations of the volatile sulfur compound, dimethyl sulfide (DMS) which exchanges with the atmosphere and potentially plays a role in climate dynamics by affecting atmospheric aerosols.  DMS arises from the enzymatic breakdown of dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP), an osmolyte and anti-stress compound produced in large quantities by P. antarctica.  Prior to this study little was known about the DMSP lyase enzymes in P. antarctica. We carried out a detailed characterization of the DMSP lyase enzyme activities in colonial P. antarctica and in a closely related temperate species, P. globosa, which also grows colonially.  We compared the lyase characteristics of these colonial species with those from two non-colonial temperate species, P. cordata and P. jahnii.   The Phaeocystis species studied here have very high DMSP lyase activities (when normalized to Chlorophyll a) putting them in the upper end of the ranges observed in other algae and in the field.  This finding helps to explain why DMS concentrations can be exceptionally high in Phaeocystis blooms. The DMSP lyase activity showed optimal activity at acidic pH (pH 5), consistent with most previous work on prymnesiophytes, and perhaps indicating adaptation to function in acidic sub-cellular environments.

We therefore carried out experiments in which growing cultures of P. antarctica  1374 were subjected to continuous darkness for up to 440 days to evaluate how they survive and what happens to their intracellular DMSP pools.  Several such experiments showed that cell numbers and the photosynthetic pigment, Chlorophyll a, decreased by about 35% during the first week of darkness but that the cellular biomass then held steady for the next two months. DMSP concentrations followed the same pattern.  After two months there was a slow decline in all the cellular pools but even after periods of six months or more in total darkness, significant numbers of intact, photosynthetically-competent cells of P. antarctica remained and these contained Chlorophyll a and DMSP. A different pattern was observed for cellular dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), an oxidation product of DMSP and DMS.  Cellular DMSO decreased rapidly within the first month of darkness and was undetectable after 60 days.  Intra...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
