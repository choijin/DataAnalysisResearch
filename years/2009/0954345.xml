<AbstractNarration>In this CAREER project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Alexander Star of the University of Pittsburgh will study how to synthesize graphitic nanocups and assemble them into nanocapsules that can capture and release chemicals and materials. Graphitic nanocups doped with nitrogen atoms will be synthesized, and the chemical derivatization of the nitrogen sites will be explored.  Via linker molecules with dual functionality, two cups will be assembled into a closed nanocapsule.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will enhance our fundamental understanding about how to generate nanoscale structures and manipulate them to do useful mechanical functions.  The results of these studies could have many important long term applications in which the capture and release of molecules are important, including drug delivery, sensing, and contaminant sequestration. The educational plan focuses on integrating experimental nanoscience into the four year curriculum of the chemistry major and then developing a capstone nanoscience course that students would take in their final year.</AbstractNarration>
