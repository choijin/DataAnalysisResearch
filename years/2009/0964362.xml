<AbstractNarration>The wide use of wireless data services leads to sensitive and confidential information delivered over wireless links. With e-crimes resulting from such information being compromised to unauthorized parties at an all time high, the ?all wireless? vision can truly materialize only if the security of wireless information transfer can be guaranteed. Conventional approaches to information security are designed for wired networks with assumptions that lead to a disassociation from the physical medium in which communication takes place, and provide guarantees against adversaries that are computationally limited. This project provides a new approach for wireless networks to deliver provable and unconditional security. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research designs wireless networks with a secure foundation guaranteeing reliable and secure delivery of information.  In doing so, the investigators account for untapped and rich resources provided by wireless systems naturally, including sources with correlated observations or application content, channels that provide spatial and temporal diversity, network nodes that are helpers or relays providing interaction, and broadcast and bi-directional nature of the medium enabling communication with feedback. The project calls for a network design paradigm that has security in its foundation and provides enlightened system design principles and protocols that are optimized to jointly exploit these resources. Some examples of this, which form the intellectual backbone of this project, include the optimal use of correlated sources and broadcast channels, the role of multinode interaction, the opportunistic use of potentially untrusted relay nodes, the creative use of feedback channels, in order to render intelligent and computationally unlimited (passive and active) adversaries ineffective. An extended goal is to integrate the resulting design principles for unconditional security with cryptographic approaches towards exploiting synergies between the two.</AbstractNarration>

Information theoretic approaches provide security guarantees irrespective of the computational power of the attacker.

The major research goals included utilizing sources, channels and user interaction to enable secure wireless communications in the physical layer.     This project resulted in a number major outcomes and design insights that can help in clean slate design of future networks where security guarantees would be considered at the foundation of system design. The intellectual highlights include: demonstrating that (i) cooperating terminals can improve overall secure rates by introducing judicious interference, termed cooperative jamming, into the communication medium; (ii) feedback signals can be used in multistage protocols that work synergistically with  cooperative jamming to improve secure rates; (iii) structured codes from legitimate parties both for message transmission and cooperative jamming improve secure rates by allowing alignment of received signals favorably at legitimate receivers and unfavorably at the eavesdropper; (iv) cooperative relay networks even when the relays are untrusted can be useful for communication; and (v) lattice codes can provide secrecy rates that scale with power and/or number of eavesdroppers in various cooperative settings.     Educational outcomes of this research include incorporation of the produced research results into graduate curriculum; in particular in the form of a group of lectures as part of the newly developed graduate level course Emerging Topics in Networked Systems. Educational outreach activities included several keynote lectures the PI offered at international workshops.     Human development and training outcomes of this research include training of PhD students on information theoretic security and gave them opportunities to conduct research on contemporary network information theory and security.
