<AbstractNarration>The University of South Carolina is awarded a grant to develop tools for peptide identification. Tandem mass spectrometry has become increasingly important in high-throughput protein identification. The most popular approach to identifying peptides from mass spectra uses the experimental spectrum to query a database of known peptides.  A major weakness of all database approaches is that they are unable to identify peptides that are not contained in the database. This is a particularly important limitation in the case of microbial peptides. It is well known that only 1%-10% of all microbes found in the environment can be cultured. Thus there are many bacteria that have not been previously identified. Indeed, even among culturable organisms many remain uncharacterized due to extreme diversity. Only de novo sequencing offers the possibility of identifying novel peptides.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to make significant improvements in the accuracy of de novo peptide sequencing. This will be accomplished through a systematic study of the use of amino acid usage models in fragmentation and cross-correlation peptide scoring functions.  Preliminary results strongly support the hypothesis that a scoring function that considers amino acid usage patterns will be better able to distinguish between candidate peptides. This in turn will lead to much higher accuracy in peptide prediction. In addition, a Bayesian model for exploring the uncertainty of candidate peptides produced by de novo sequencing will be developed.  A major difference between this model with that developed by other groups is that the proposed approach will incorporate the concept of proteome signature as a prior. Existing models for de novo sequencing do not expressly indicate amino acid usage, and thus implicitly assume flat priors for amino acid usage. The proposed research will be integrated into undergraduate and graduate courses taught in computer science and statistics at the University of South Carolina. The research will also be leveraged to support training and education through the development of training workshops to be presented at annual SC-INBRE Bioinformatics Core statewide meetings. The target audience of the annual workshops will be undergraduate and graduate students as well as faculty and staff in bioinformatics-related disciplines (biology, computer science, statistics, etc.) in South Carolina.</AbstractNarration>

Quasinovo: de novo peptide sequencing program  One important piece of information that has been missing from de novo peptide sequencing likelihood formulations is the prior distribution of amino acid usage. By leaving this information out, one is effectively using a flat prior that treats all combination of amino acids as equally likely.  It is clearly not the case that amino usage in peptides is random.

The current scoring function contains the following terms:  SNN() &ndash; the aggregate score for  the observed peaks associated with the hypothesized spectrum.  EF() &ndash; the edge frequency score which incorporates confirming evidence from neutral losses and isotopic peaks.  AAU() &ndash; the amino acid usage score which encapsulates the probability of seeing the particular sequence of amino acids of the proposed peptide given the amino acid usage model.  The current scoring function has demonstrated accuracy on par with that of current a state-of-the-art program PepNovo+. We are currently extending the function in two ways:  1)     We are adding a "proteotypic" term which measures the likelihood that the proposed peptide could be  observed by a tandem mass spectrometer and  2)     We are refining the AAU term by replacing it with two terms. The first term will more accurately focus on amino acid usage by only considering amino acid tuples of length 2. The seond term will focus on homology by considering amino acid tuples of length 5.
