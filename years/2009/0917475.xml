<AbstractNarration>Award #:  0917475&lt;br/&gt;Title:  Science Friday Radio Program and Social Community&lt;br/&gt;Start/end dates:  August 2009-July 2011&lt;br/&gt;Program Officer:  Sandra Welch&lt;br/&gt;PI:  Ira Flatow&lt;br/&gt;Program:  Informal Science Education&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to extend the impact of the nationally broadcast weekly radio program, Science Friday to a new, young audience through the various new cyber-space platforms and interactive tools such as Facebook, Twitter, and Second Life as well as new emerging social networking tools. The STEM content over the course of the two year project will include a wide variety of topics in all disciplines.  The relationship between art and science will also be a focus.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NPR radio broadcasts currently reach 1.3 million listeners every week, and that audience is expected to increase.  In addition to that audience, this project will target a new audience of adults under the age of 35 using various cyber platforms and new social networking tools such as Second Life, Facebook, YouTube and Twitter.  Audiences will also be reached through remote broadcasts from science centers and art centers around the country. Over 30 science centers will use this project's web content on their own web sites, reaching their audiences as well.  The web content will be translated into Spanish and widely disseminated to Hispanic audiences.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each Friday afternoon, Ira Flatow, the PI will produce and host the nationally broadcast Science Friday radio program interviewing scientists and engineers in a lively engaging format.  In addition, the Science Friday digital media team will be producing and inviting others to create and post digital content and commentary on the Science Friday web site for further dissemination through Second Life, Facebook, as well as other  emerging networking platforms. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The evaluation will use a quasi-experimental design to study the appeal of both the radio broadcasts and the cyber-platforms with both older and younger audiences.  Proposed audience impacts include increased STEM knowledge, interest, and behaviors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Partner organizations include the Self Reliance Foundation, the New York Hall of Science, LA Theatreworks, and Tribeca Film Festival.</AbstractNarration>
