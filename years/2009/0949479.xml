<AbstractNarration>The interplay of genetic exchange and reproductive isolation is central to the origin and maintenance of adaptation and biodiversity. Ultimately, biological diversification involves speciation, which occurs when reproductive isolation results from development of barriers to interbreeding, such as selective mating or hybrid sterility. Reproductive barriers lead to relatively infrequent interbreeding and hybrid formation, but the production of hybrids still can have important evolutionary implications, particularly when hybrids mate with their parent taxa. Mating between hybrids and their parent taxa can lead to the transfer of important genetically-based adaptations (e.g., traits such as tolerance to flooded conditions) between the parent species through genetic introgression.  This project will apply a new technique that allows very fine-scale analysis of the genome to study speciation that is accompanied by introgression between two species of Louisiana Irises in order to determine how the genes underlying reproductive barriers affect introgression.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will contribute to understanding of mechanisms of biodiversity increase and adaptation and will advance applications of new molecular genetic techniques. This project will provide training for undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral researchers at two universities and will provide scientific information to the public. This research into the process of introgression is directly applicable to the selective breeding of microorganisms, plants, and animals upon which humans depend for food, clothing, and shelter.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Since DarwinÆs time scientists and non-scientists have envisioned the Evolutionary Process with the metaphor of a tree; the ever-branching, ever-expanding development of independent twigs that eventually form the trunk and branches that then give rise to new twigs.  But, there have been persistent murmurings from scientists suggesting that maybe the production of the life around us was not nearly as neat and clean as we wanted it to be.  Linnaeus, the Father of our modern taxonomic code, "It is impossible to doubt that there are new species produced by hybrid generation".  Even Darwin noted that some man-made crosses between divergent forms were sometimes "favourable to the vigour and fertility of their offspring&hellip;"  Over the last two decades, evolutionary biologists have become increasingly aware of the messiness of evolutionary diversification.  Every year humans battle a new set of influenza types generated by genetic mixing between previous æbird-flus.Æ  Grey wolves in North America and Europe arenÆt so grey in some places they live because they have taken in genes from domestic dogs that turn their coats black.  DarwinÆs finches eat seeds that previously they could not crack because they have beaks reshaped by hybridization with related species.    The work supported by this grant helped to bring into focus how the exchange of genes via interspecific matings between so-called 'Louisiana Irises' has shaped adaptations to various environmental components -- components including pollinators, soil moisture and light regimes.  The various laboratory-, greenhouse- and field-based experiments defined the portions of the iris genomes causal in making a plant, for example, tolerant to the flooded conditions found in cypress swamps, or attractive to ruby-throated hummingbirds.  Because of the research findings generated through this NSF-funded project, we now have a clearer understanding of how these wonderful organisms, found in marshes, swamps, the banks of bayous and, even on the helmets of the New Orleans Saints, were formed and adapted to their environment.
