<AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Department of Geosciences and the Electron Microscopy Center at Missississppi State University (MSU) in partnership with Delta State University (DSU) and East Mississippi Community College (EMCC) share the goal of increasing the number of African-American students in the geosciences by using participation in research as the catalyst for cultural transformation.  This OEDG project has two desired outcomes:  1) to attract African-American students who might not have considered geoscience careers by increasing their perceived relevance of the geosciences, and 2) to encourage outstanding African-American students to major in geoscience-related fields.  The first phase of the project will inform students about programs of study and career paths in the geosciences through dynamic, hands-on geoscience demos presented to students in introductory geoscience courses at MSU and/or basic science courses at DSU and EMCC as well as in K-12 classrooms across the region.  This will increase the perceived relevance of the geosciences to the students.  The second phase of the project is to involve students in real research.  During an intersession course at MSU students from MSU, DSU and EMCC will participate in and contribute to an ongoing research project, take field trips, prepare a presentation, and submit an abstract for publication.  Students at MSU will also participate in a weekly one-credit-hour seminar designed to introduce them to faculty members who are part of broad-based interdisciplinary geoscience research network.  Seminar participants will also be informed about career paths in the geosciences and, through carefully designed exercises, they will be taught critical skills needed for professional success.  Participants at MSU will be matched with research groups across campus where they will participate in research projects and be mentored by faculty as well as near-peer upper classmen and graduate students.  Involving students in research will encourage them to further their education and pursue careers in geoscience while providing them with skills to achieve such goals.  During each phase of the project, assessments will be carried out to determine how to best achieve the long-term goal of establishing an effective, sustainable program.</AbstractNarration>
