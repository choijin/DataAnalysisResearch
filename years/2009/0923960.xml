<AbstractNarration>PI: Adrian D. Hegeman (University of Minnesota - Twin Cities)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CoPI: Jerry D. Cohen (University of Minnesota - Twin Cities)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Key Collaborators:  Christopher P. Keller (Minot State University), Paul J. Overvoorde, Christopher T. Calderone, Rebecca C. Hoye, Keith T. Kuwata, and Kathryn E. Splan (Macalester College).  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ability to quantitatively monitor the dynamics of metabolites in an organism is critical to fully understand the complex interactions of biology's Central Dogma: DNA to RNA to Protein to Metabolite. In part because of the diversity of compounds found in living organisms, especially in plants, the ability to define this critical area in the functional analysis of living plants has been slower to develop than nucleic acid and protein methods. This project addresses impediments to the development of techniques for measuring metabolic dynamics in biological systems. The present limitations include the rather low numbers of compounds that have typically been identified, relatively insensitive procedures that yield insufficient spatial resolution and the dearth of true quantitative methods. The specific aims are: 1) provide improved sample preparation and derivatization methods that yield structural information to create new spectral library resources for metabolite identification by liquid chromatography (LC) and gas chromatography (GC) coupled to mass spectrometry (MS), and 2) use stable isotope metabolically labeled plant materials for isotope dilution with robust quantification by LC and GC MS and tandem MS. The work will be focused on rice and tomato, with the expectation that the methods and procedures will be generally applicable to many plant species.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Metabolomics as an emerging discipline has yet to realize its full potential for discovery. It is important, therefore, to continue investing in methodological development and access to resources to collect, process and understand metabolomics data. A major component of this project focuses on method development and as such may have its greatest impact by providing educational resources for method implementation. The investigators are strongly committed to recruiting and training people belonging to groups underrepresented in the sciences and attempt to provide undergraduate and graduate students, as well as postdocs with a multidisciplinary education in an open minded, diverse and supportive environment. This includes quality mentoring in professional development and research and participation in graduate and postdoctoral programs on the campus. In addition, this proposal will expand the core training in a summer workshop in metabolomics to be held at the University of Minnesota. Interaction with primarily undergraduate institutions will provide access to advanced metabolomic experiences to a wider student population. Short-term dissemination of data, processing algorithms and methods will be accomplished by means of the project website that will be administered and maintained at the University of Minnesota (http://www.metabolomics.umn.edu/).  Metabolite mass spectral libraries will be deposited for long-term access with the Biological Magnetic Resonance Data Bank (BMRB) (http://www.bmrb.wisc.edu/metabolomics/).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Metabolomics is an emerging field that utilizes a variety of high throughput analytical techniques coupled with statistical methods to analyze as many chemical constituents of the biological system as possible. In contrast to approaches to proteins and nucleic acids, global metabolite profiling is faced with the enormous chemical diversity of the metabolome.  The ultimate goal of metabolomics is to be able to identify and quantify all metabolites, their distribution and inter-conversions within a biological system. This is not currently possible because, in contrast to genomic analysis, it is currently impossible to measure the complete set of metabolites in an organism.  Metabolomics methodology thus has been limited by multiple analytical challenges.  Metabolite identification:  -Polyphenols are important metabolites of plants and are generally thought to be involved in stress as well as having potential health benefits for humans. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) is a highly sensitive tool, however, the degree of isomerism among polyphenols complicates LC-MS.  We developed a mild-acid catalyzed deuterium (MACD) labeling for elucidating polyphenolic structure.  The applicability was demonstrated in red wine where the extent of deuterium exchange, together with accurate mass information, lead to identification of unknowns.  With the capacity to discriminate between isomeric forms, MACD labeling provides structural information that complements other polyphenolic methods.  -We developed a methods using chromatographic information that has the potential for greatly improving metabolite identification. While linear retention indices have been commonly used to identify compounds in programmed-temperature gas chromatography (GC), they are unreliable unless the original experimental conditions are stringently reproduced proved also difficult to extend to LC. Differences in many experimental conditions may be properly taken into account by calculating programmed-temperature or solvent gradient retention times of compounds from their measured isothermal retention vs. temperature or isocratic retention relationships. We call this approach "retention projection". Until now, retention projection has been impractical because it required very precise, meticulous measurement of profiles actually produced by a specific chromatographic instrument to be accurate. We developed a new, easy-to-use methodology to precisely measure those profiles.  We also developed new, open-source software (http://www.retentionprediction.org) to demonstrate the system. Creation of an accurate chromatographic retention index system provides sufficient orthogonal information such that MS and LC or GC retention information together can be used to dramatically improve assignment of unknown chemical identities in metabolomic assays.  Metabolite quantification and turnover:  We designed and assembled automated plant growth enclosures where the systems simultaneously monitor humidity, temperature, pressure, and 13CO2 concentration with continuous adjustment of humidity, pressure and 13CO2 levels controlled by computers running LabView software. Metabolites extracted from plants grown in the chambers exhibit exceptionally high enrichment rates.  The utility of this labeling system for turnover and quantification experiments has been demonstrated by evaluation of amino acid turnover using GC-MS, and whole protein turnover using LC-MS/MS.   We also analyzed and developed a strategy to optimized plant extractions for phytochemical library construction by evaluating solvent systems using metabolomics approaches.  Application of developed methods:  Diverse problems were approached using the procedures enhanced for untargeted metabolomics, including metabolic fingerprinting of anti-microbial plant resins, metabolomics for breeding rust resistance in perennial ryegrass, measuring chemical variation in commercial kava products.
