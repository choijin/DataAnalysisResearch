<AbstractNarration>Twenty academically talented students at the University of Central Florida (UCF) are being selected each year from science and engineering disciplines, with a special focus on mathematics and computer sciences, for scholarships in the range of $4,000 to $10,000 depending on financial need. Recruited students are in one of the following three groups (a) recent transfers to the university, (b) freshman undergraduate students and (c) first-year graduate students. New transfer students to UCF are being provided moral and financial support to help them with the transition and to ensure they will successfully complete the bachelor's degree in a STEM field. In particular, juniors are in a critical period in their university studies because it is when they embark on advanced courses in the major. The support of the S-STEM mentors ensures these transfer students are being supported during this critical period of time. The support for freshman undergraduates is providing them with much-needed study skill development and academic guidance when they are adjusting to a more independent life. Support for incoming graduate students is stabilizing their transition to heightened demands and is providing release from employment duties so they can focus on their academic endeavors.   UCF has a significant population of underrepresented students and more than 80% of transfer and 60% of entering freshmen have demonstrated financial need; thus, the S-STEM scholarships are appealing to a broad range of students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Carefully designed activities are engaging all the student participants in active research seminars, lectures, departmental and college colloquia of the various academic units at UCF involved with the S-STEM project.  These activities are providing incentives to keep the students engaged in their STEM major and motivating them to excel academically. Students completing the year-long project will be streamlined into existing research groups that have good industrial partnerships. These industrial connections will be used to place qualified students directly into the workforce.</AbstractNarration>
