<AbstractNarration>Technical: This project addresses fundamental relationships between epitaxial crystal growth conditions, microstructure, and properties in wide-bandgap (Eg =2.2 to 2.3eV) metamorphic InGaP, to create high-efficiency, multi-junction solar cells. The approach involves epitaxial growth studies, structural characterization, optical/electrical/interfacial properties determination, solar cell fabrication, and modeling the impact of materials properties on solar cell performance. &lt;br/&gt;Non-technical: This project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science with high technological relevance. If successful, this project could lead to the realization of 60% efficient multijunction solar cells, transforming the economics of photovoltaic electricity for terrestrial use and leading to reduced greenhouse gas emissions. The educational component includes creation of new interdisciplinary learning opportunities at the undergraduate, graduate, and K-12 levels, and aims for increasing the participation of under-represented groups in science and engineering. Long term educational goals are: to increase the diversity of tomorrow's materials scientists and electrical engineers by providing interdisciplinary training and mentoring to both women and under-represented minorities, and to place the current generation's passion for energy issues onto a firm, physics-based foundation. The PI has recruited a diverse research group at Yale and created a new course, 'Photovoltaic Energy.' The course is enhanced through the implementation of a novel set of homework problems and the creation of an intensive laboratory component where students learn to fabricate, test, and design solar cells. In addition, the PI proposes a new K-12 teacher mentoring program focused around the annual New Haven science fair.</AbstractNarration>
