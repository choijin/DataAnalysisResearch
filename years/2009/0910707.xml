<AbstractNarration>In this award, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Weeks and his students from Emory University will study diffusion near the colloidal glass transition. In regular liquids, particles and molecules undergo Brownian motion, causing them to both translate and rotate.  For a given particle (or molecule) size and shape, the rates of these motions have a constant ratio.  For example, doubling the viscosity of the liquid will slow both types of motion by the same factor.  However, in supercooled molecular liquids close to the glass transition, this is not the case. Indirect measurements suggest that molecules translate faster than they rotate in these samples.  This then suggests that supercooled liquids are not merely simple liquids with large viscosities, but that diffusion takes place by fundamentally changed mechanisms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Weeks will use a laser-scanning confocal microscope to simultaneously and directly observe the rotational and translational dynamics of rod-like particles in a colloidal "supercooled fluid".  Colloidal suspensions are composed of micron-sized solid particles in a liquid, and manifest a glass transition as the particle concentration is increased beyond a critical value.  Because they can be viewed directly, these are ideal systems for studying the mechanisms of this transition. Confocal microscopy will be used to observe the motion of both the rod-like particles and the surrounding colloidal particles.  Thus, both translational and rotational motion can be measured simultaneously and directly, leading to an understanding of how they are related.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scientific results may help in the design new types of glassy materials, which could impact technologies such as fiber optics. Professor Weeks will conduct at least one field trip each year to his laboratory for groups of primary school students. These students will investigate the properties of "squishy" materials such as the colloidal pastes used in this project.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We are interested in glassy materials and how they differ from the more common crystalline solids.  Consider water, for example:  it freezes into crystalline ice at a well-defined temperature and pressure.  Just above the freezing temperature, water is undoubtedly a liquid and flows easily.  Just below the freezing temperature, itÆs clearly ice and doesn't flow at all.  In contrast, consider molten glass.  It flows somewhat easily and a glass-blower can form the viscous material into interesting shapes.  As it cools, it flows slower and eventually flows so slowly that we consider the material to be a solid.  However, thereÆs no clear-cut point at which its properties abruptly change, as was the case with water.  Rather, there is a gradual increase of the viscosity of the glass as the temperature is decreased.  (Viscosity is a way to quantify how easily a material flows.)  Perhaps if we were patient enough and could wait centuries, weÆd see the glass flow and still be able to think of it like a liquid, albeit one with a huge viscosity.     Materials have another interesting property as they cool from a liquid to a glass.  Microscopically, molecules in a liquid are in constant random motion and diffuse from place to place inside the material.  The amount of motion is measured by a diffusion constant (which depends on the viscosity of the liquid): larger diffusion constants mean faster motion.  As a liquid cools toward becoming a glass, the viscosity grows and thus, not surprisingly, the diffusion constant for its molecules decreases.  Diffusive motion that moves molecules left, right, up, down, forward and backward inside the liquid is called "translational diffusion."  This distinguishes it from "rotational diffusion," which is the random rotational motion of the molecules.  If one could take a movie of these molecules, one would see them moving randomly from one location to another and rotating around as they move.  Like translational diffusion, rotational diffusion is also related to the liquid viscosity.  As the viscosity increases, translational and rotational diffusion both slow down the same amount.  This is all true&hellip; except when itÆs not!  Surprisingly, as liquids are cooled and become glasses, it has been found that rotational diffusion slows down more than translational diffusion.  Understanding this mystery has been challenging as molecules cannot be directly seen in experiments.  This is one of the biggest unsolved puzzles surrounding the glass transition and is primarily understood through indirect measurements of ensembles of molecules.     We study a colloidal suspension as a model system for glass transitions.  Colloidal suspensions are made of microscopic-sized solid particles in a liquid.  Rather than changing with temperature, colloidal systems have a glass transition as their concentration is increased.  Because they can be viewed directly with a microscope, these are ideal systems for studying the mechanisms of this transition.  We use microscopy to directly observe the motion of colloidal particles in our experiments.  In particular, our goal was to study the translational and rotational motion of non-spherical particles as the glass transition is approached.  In our experiments, we observed the same behavior as in regular glassy materials:  the rotational and translational diffusion of our particles slowed as we approached the glassy state, with the rotational motion slowing down much more dramatically.  Because we see the full three-dimensional orientation of our particles, we could analyze the data in a variety of ways previously unavailable to experimentalists. Our analysis revealed that as the glass transition is approached, the material can no longer be approximated as a continuum fluid when considering diffusion. In particular, translational motion occurs via discrete steps, in contrast to the rotational motion, which explains the decoupling. The simplicity of our model system is useful for t...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
