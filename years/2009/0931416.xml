<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to develop methods for the operation and design of cyber physical systems in general, and energy efficient buildings in particular.  The approach is to use an integrated framework: create models of complex systems from data; then design the associated sensing-communication-computation-control system; and finally create distributed estimation and control algorithms, along with execution platforms to implement these algorithms. A special emphasis is placed on adaptation.  In particular, buildings and their environments change with time, as does the way in which buildings are used. The system must be designed to detect and respond to such changes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research brings together ideas from control theory, dynamical systems, stochastic processes, and embedded systems to address design and operation of complex cyber physical systems that were previously thought to be intractable. These approaches provide qualitative understanding of system behavior, algorithms for control, and their implementation in a networked execution platform. Insights gained by the application of model reduction and adaptation techniques will lead to significant developments in the underlying theory of modeling and control of complex systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research is expected to directly impact US industry through the development of integrated software-hardware solutions for smart buildings. Collaborations with United Technologies Research Center are planned to enhance this impact. The techniques developed are expected to apply to other complex cyber-physical systems with uncertain dynamics, such as the electric power grid. The project will enhance engineering education through the introduction of cross-disciplinary courses. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The objective of this research project was to develop methods for the operation and design of cyber physical systems in general, and energy efficient buildings in particular. Apart from these two original objectives, the project also made contributions to another objective: to use buildings as sources of inexpensive ancillary service to the power grid that enables stable operation of the grid in the presence of volatile sources of energy such as solar and wind.  The main scientific outcomes of the project can be divided into three categories:  (A) Development of multi-scale modeling architectures  Buildings consume 75% of electricity consumed in the United States. Their HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) systems are typically inefficiently operated, leading to large wastage of energy. Our hypothesis was that with intelligent real-time decision-making, significant energy savings can be obtained. Achieving this vision also requires research in the intersection of cyber and physical domains. The physics of the processes being controlled (indoor climate variables) are complex and uncertain, which makes their control challenging. Moreover, novel sensing and software platforms are needed to support optimal decision-making and execution of such decisions in HVAC equipment.  One of the contributions of this project was to develop certain reduced complexity multi-scale modeling architectures for modeling physics of the building problem. These models were used for development of distributed estimation and control algorithms described next.  (B) Development of novel control system for energy-efficient building climate control  The project developed a distributed control system solutions that consisted of low-cost wireless sensors and estimation algorithms to provide occupancy estimates in real-time, decision-making algorithms, along with a software platform to integrate the two so that decisions can be executed on HVAC equipment produced by existing vendors. Apart from new buildings, the control system can be used to retrofit existing building inexpensively. The effectiveness was demonstrated though a week-long test in building in the University of Florida campus (Pugh Hall). The use of the control system was resulted in approximately 40% reduction in energy use compared to the existing climate control system in the building.  (C) Novel control system for use of buildings to provide ancillary service to the electric grid  Buildings also present an unique opportunity as flexible loads that can be controlled to provide ancillary services to the electric power grid. Due to the high thermal inertia of large commercial buildings, the operation of their HVAC systems can be controlled in real-time to reduce or increase electricity demand as required by the grid operators without affecting the indoor climate. Such controllable power consumption can be used as "ancillary services" that are today provided by controllable generators. Though the flexibility offered by an individual building is small, all the buildings collectively present an enormous opportunity. With higher penetration of renewable energy sources that are intermittent and uncertain, such flexibility will be crucial in ensuring stable operation of the electric grid. The control algorithms that provide this flexibility may not make the buildings more efficient, but this technology will lead to efficiency in a broader sense, by enabling deeper penetration of alternative energy sources and thereby reducing our dependency on carbon emitting fossil fuels.  A control algorithm to enable such ancillary service was developed as part of this project and experimentally demonstrated in a building in the University of Florida campus (Pugh Hall). The demonstration test corroborated our predictions &ndash; that building HVAC systems can provide ancillary service without affecting indoor climate.
