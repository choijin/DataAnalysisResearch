<AbstractNarration>IIS - 0916129   &lt;br/&gt;HCC: Small: Collaborative Research: Asynchrony and Persistence for Complex Contact Simulations&lt;br/&gt;Grinspun, Eitan           &lt;br/&gt;Columbia University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Collaborative Proposals&lt;br/&gt;IIS - 0914833           &lt;br/&gt;Guibas, Leonidas J      &lt;br/&gt;Stanford University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;This proposal addresses the challenge of complex contact simulations by working entirely in an asynchronous setting. The project operates along three lines, combining tools from Asynchronous Variational Integrators (AVIs) and Kinetic Data Structures (KDSs) with a novel effort to perform and exploit qualitative analysis of contact simulation data. The first investigation will show that AVIs, meant to handle the continuous aspects of the physics, can be integrated well with KDSs, meant to handle discrete geometric events. The second research component addresses the fundamental problem of event scheduling when future trajectories are uncertain. Methods will be explored that improve event detection times, reduce the number of auxiliary events that have to be processed, and allow events to be processed in parallel.   The third research task will be to initiate a study of the qualitative behavior of contact simulation by building a hierarchy of coarser models which can then be used for better resource allocation, for the validation of various approximations, and in improved simulation design to attain desired effects.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Many engineering processes of national importance require or benefit from computer simulations. Computer algorithms are able to predict the motion of materials. Thin, flexible materials (aluminum sheets, composite fiber panels, textile fabrics, automotive airbags, etc.) are particularly challenging to simulate, because they can drastically change in shape, collapsing, buckling, wrinkling, and creasing under the action of large forces; examples of such large changes in shape include rapid inflation of an airbag, crumpling during automotive collisions, and twisting and knotting of fabric.   In order to simulate these processes, the computer must be able to predict the motion of materials when they collide against each other. A collision occurs when two objects attempt to occupy the same point in space at the same time. When two objects collide, there is a physical force that pushes them apart, preventing mass from passing through other mass.   Even simple simulation problems, like a crumpled aluminum can, contain an extraordinary number of these contacting points that arise and disappear through the course of a simulation. Accurate simulation of such "contact scenarios" is critical to applications spanning engineering (product design, safety analysis, experimental validation), graphics (training, virtual worlds, entertainment) and many other scientific disciplines. Yet the accurate and reliable computation of contact forces remains a challenging aspect of the process of computer simulation.    This project improved the accuracy and reliability of computer algorithms that simulate contact scenarios. The improvements are in the form of guarantees on the quality/accuracy of the predictions made by the algorithm----guarantees that were not previously available. The new set of algorithms guarantee that (a) for well-posed problems the simulation does not enter an invalid (interpenetrating) state, (b) collision response obeys physical laws of causality and conservation (of mass, momentum, energy, etc.), and (c) the algorithm completes a simulation (does not become frozen without completion). Before this project's results, no existing computer algorithm for contact scenarios provided all three of these guarantees.
