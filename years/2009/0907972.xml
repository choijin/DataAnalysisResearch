<AbstractNarration>AST-0907972&lt;br/&gt;Lewis&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project supports two students to work on numerical investigations of planetary systems involving collisional dynamics, primarily planetary ring dynamics and planetary formation, including enhancement of the codes used.  This project is funded under the auspices of the Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) program.  The Principal Investigator is working on simulation of the Saturnian ring system and on a general data analysis and visualization tool, with support from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).  This added-value project will significantly improve the research as well as strengthen the existing collaboration, while including undergraduate students on a cutting-edge project in planetary science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One student will work to organize and perform simulations of embedded moonlets, silicate material in the ring, and Saturn's F ring, and to analyze the results.  The second student will work to improve the simulation code by enhancing support for accretion, and to develop analysis tools for the code.  Their results will aid in interpreting Cassini observations and providing a general understanding of the Saturnian ring system, as well as helping to understand the early stages of planetary accretion.  Comparison with experiments will enhance the accuracy of these numerical models, and improve the quality of the tools available to the whole planetary science community.  The students will also present their results each year at an astronomy conference and at a conference on parallel computing or simulation methodologies.</AbstractNarration>
