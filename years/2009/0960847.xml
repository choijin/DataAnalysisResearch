<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Shallow coral reefs in the Caribbean basin have been severely degraded due to regional impacts from global climate change, and local effects of overfishing and pollution. This decline in coral reef health has promoted interest in mesophotic coral reefs (reefs at depths of 30 to 150 m) because they are often physically and biologically connected to their shallow water counterparts, and thus may serve as potential refugia for shallow reef taxa and a source of larvae that could promote the resiliency of shallow water reefs. The recent invasion of the red lionfish (Pterois volitans), a native of the sub-tropical and tropical Indo-Pacific ocean basin, onto shallow reefs of the Caribbean and Bahamas has had a profound effect on endemic coral reef fish populations. The investigators propose that the impacts of these lionfish have extended to mesophotic reef depths throughout the Bahamas. The PIs will examine the effects of lionfish on mesophotic reefs using a comparative approach for reefs within a region and reefs between regions (Bahamas versus Little Cayman). In the Bahamas these predators have had a significant negative effect on five distinct guilds of mesophotic reef fishes, and the ensuing trophic cascade has facilitated a phase shift towards an algal dominated (&gt;50% cover) community to depths of 60 m, or greater, due to reduced grazing pressure. This has further resulted in a significant decline in the percent cover of corals and sponges. The direct and indirect effects of this invasive species to mesophotic reefs exceeds other natural and anthropogenic stressors, and casts doubt on whether these important deep reef communities can actually stimulate the recovery of shallow Caribbean reefs where lionfish now reside.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Mesophotic coral reefs are greatly understudied and represent unique habitats compared to their shallow water counterparts. The studies that have been done suggest that mesophotic reefs could be a refuge from anthropogenic change or a supplier of propagules to shallow reefs for certain coral reef taxa. The insights provided by work on the effects of the recent lionfish invasion to mesophotic depths suggest that quick response to this novel threat to mesophotic reefs is warranted to understand the extent of change on reefs with and without lionfish. This research will complement work already funded in the shallow reefs of the same system, and nowhere else is  a combined shallow and mesophotic reef approach to the lionfish invasion being carried out. Broader Impacts will provide unique educational and outreach opportunities at high schools through the participation of the principal investiagtors in regional Junior Science and Humanities Symposia and UNH's Science and Mathematics Achievement Through Research program (SMART) by providing mentorship and lectures about the ecology, biology, and value of coral reefs. Data, graphics, and publications will be made available to both the oceanographic and marine ecology communities through the "Mesophotic Coral Ecosystems" web site.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[          Mesophotic, or deep, coral reefs (30-150 m) have been assumed to be physically and biologically connected to their shallow-water counterparts, and have been proposed to serve as refugia for important taxonomic groups such as corals, sponges, and fish under increasing environmental stress in shallow waters as a result of global climate change.  The recent invasion of the Indo&ndash;Pacific lionfish (Pterois volitans) onto shallow reefs of the Caribbean and Bahamas has had significant, negative, effects on shallow coral reef fish populations by lionfish predation and lionfish have now extended their habitat range into mesophotic depths down to 91 m where they have reduced the diversity of several important groups of fish, including herbivores.  Herbivores are essential to maintain reduced algal growth on coral reefs and in their absence a shift to an algal dominated (&gt;50% benthic cover) community as deep as 61 m has occurred and caused a significant decline in coral and sponges populations at mesophotic depths presumably by the algae directly overgrowing them.  The effects of this invasive lionfish on mesophotic coral reef fish communities and the subsequent changes in benthic community structure could not be explained by coral bleaching, overfishing, hurricanes, or disease independently or in combination.  The significant ecological effects of the lionfish invasion into mesophotic depths of coral reefs casts doubt on whether these communities have the resilience to recover themselves or contribute to the recovery of their shallow water counterparts as refugia for key coral reef taxa.  The broader impacts of this study include providing unique educational and outreach opportunities at K-12 schools by providing mentorship and lectures about the ecology, biology, and value  ofcoral reefs.  Additionally, three graduate students have received partial support/training from this project, two talks and two posters have been presented at international meetings, and the principal investigators will be hosting a special section on mesophotic coral reefs at the upcoming International Coral Reef Symposium.  Data, graphics, and publications will be made available to both the oceanographic, marine ecology and public communities through the "Mesophotic Coral Ecosystems" (http://www.mesophotic.org/index.php) web site.
