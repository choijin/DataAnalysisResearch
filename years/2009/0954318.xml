<AbstractNarration>The research objectives of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award are to create a model-based control method for discrete parts machining at the process level, and to show that this method can be scaled to effectively control systems of machining operations.  The approach to accomplishing these objectives will be to apply model-based techniques from the chemical process industry to the control of machined parts production, and to address issues of scaling the method to control of machining networks, especially model form adaptation and changes in uncertainty with system complexity.  The educational objectives of this work are to improve the instruction and experience of young technical thinkers in South Carolina, and to attract future potential researchers to pursue a graduate education in manufacturing.  This will be accomplished through leveraging ongoing work with the state of South Carolina to augment the instructor education structure for the Gateway to Technology program, part of a nationwide nonprofit middle-school technology curriculum that encourages the involvement of women and minority students.  The project structure includes an annual teacher workshop to communicate and demonstrate research results, as well as semiannual visiting days to the Clemson research center for middle school students to explore research hands-on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the broader impacts of this work will be more profitable machining and more competitive manufacturing of high-quality parts for automotive, aerospace and consumer products industries.  The results will be promulgated through the collaborating machine tool organization and their partner network of 35 equipment companies, positively impacting manufacturing quality and profitability at a national level.  Broader impacts of the educational activities will be to educate and directly expose students who are at a critical decision point in their life plan to possibilities of a research career and to establish a layered mentoring program whereby sponsored students will mentor teams of Clemson undergraduates to prepare demonstrations of the concepts.  These efforts will help to improve the quality and number of engineering students available to US manufacturers.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The research undertaken for this project intended to investigate ways in which metal-cutting processes can produce improved and more consistent quality and productivity through the application of physical models to the control of these processes. In this work, we have demonstrated that output can be greatly improved when a machine has access to a representation of knowledge of what it is trying to achieve. For instance, a machine tool that understands how forces and deflections are generated in the cutting process can compensate and produce a more consistent part.</p> <p>In the course of the project, applicability of models was deeply explored, resulting in a new concept of the <em>time scale of control</em>. Process dynamics (the speed at which the system changes) largely dictate what types of models should be applied to control, and what architectures should be used. Through creation of a spectrum of models and approaches, we discovered that the same methodology was applicable to a range of phenomena from chatter dynamics (millisecond scale) to machine wear and degradation (months or years scale).</p> <p>We also explored model learning from the process. The models incorporated to machining control can be updated in real-time in the presence of new cutting data. Through this insight, we were able to further improve process output, and identify process responses to specific instances of cutting as part-specific model parameters. These parameters could then be passed along with the material to other processes in the manufacturing chain, which in turn could optimize for each part produced. This system-level intelligence gives rise to a learning process along the digital thread emerging in the context of the current digital manufacturing revolution.</p> <p>The knowledge and methods derived were applied in the final project year to machining of nickel-based superalloys, a class of material in wide use in the energy and aerospace industries, but extremely difficult to machine due to excessive tool wear. We were able to accurately predict the wear-out of tools and the effect of wear directly on the process quality, not only dimensional consistency but also surface condition and residual stress, which can affect part failure. Our estimation and modeling methods were also informed through these materials, as data were much more limited due to wear progression. Here we applied Bayesian updating methods for more efficient model learning and improved information about the uncertainty in models. This knowledge in turn further informed the methods of control.</p> <p>The knowledge and methods generated have immediate applicability in machining operations, particularly for difficult-to-machine alloys in the energy and aerospace industries. Model-based control can also be extended to processes outside of machining such as forming and joining.</p> <p>The educational component of this project centered on integration of findings with the Project Lead The Way&rsquo;s Gateway To Technology (GTT) program for middle school students. Every year of the project, we hosted groups of up to 80 students for demonstration and discussion of project findings, as well as exposure to other aspects of Automotive Engineering. In the final years of the project, we worked with GTT instructors to revise the curriculum to allow for integration of manufacturing considerations in the design of vehicles. Student groups design and build vehicle prototypes under conflicting constraints and limited budget, then come to our research center to compete and present their design decisions to graduate students on the project. This approach is intended to inform and excite the next generation of US engineers.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/15/2016<br>      Modified by: Laine&nbsp;Mears</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/0954318/0954318_10441569_1473953254907_ScreenShot2016-09-15at11.26.30AM--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/0954318/0954318_10441569_1473953254907_ScreenShot2016-09-15at11.26.30AM--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Time Scale of Control."><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/0954318/0954318_10441569_1473953254907_ScreenShot2016-09-15at11.26.30AM--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Time Scale of Control."></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Process dynamics are an essential element for prescription of model-based control approaches and architectures.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Clemson University</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Laine&nbsp;Mears</div> <div class="imageTitle">Time Scale of Control.</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/0954318/0954318_10441569_1473952305933_ScreenShot2016-09-14at4.25.21PM--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/0954318/0954318_10441569_1473952305933_ScreenShot2016-09-14at4.25.21PM--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Modeling of Cutting Tool Wear Area."><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/0954318/0954318_10441569_1473952305933_ScreenShot2016-09-14at4.25.21PM--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Modeling of Cutting Tool Wear Area."></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Using an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) optimal state estimator, the wear area of the tool is examined, together with the estimation confidence.
