<AbstractNarration>Unlike animals, plants lack a specialized immune system. Plant cells while performing their normal functions also have to defend against pathogen infection. This makes it difficult to study plant immunity independently of other biological processes. To fully understand how plants respond to pathogen challenge, a 'systems biology' approach is most likely to uncover key regulatory networks underlying plant immunity and how they interface with processes like growth and development. The investigators of this project are in a unique position to carry out systems biology studies of plant immunity because of their pioneering work in using the model organism Arabidopsis in identifying essential components for all the major plant defense response pathways and in establishing a framework for placing these diverse components in an integrated network. However, there are still many parts missing in this network, including the identities of resistance output components and their regulators. Another major challenge is to understand the interconnections between the different immune responses. This project aims to identify these missing components and to build not only a static network but also dynamic models of the plant immune system. The results obtained from this project will be published in peer-reviewed journals and disseminated at meetings. Mutants and transgenic lines will be deposited in the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center. Large data sets will be deposited in public databases (e.g., NCBI's GEO for microarray and RNA seq data) as well as in the project database (http://ausubellab.mgh.harvard.edu/nsf2010/index.jsp) prior to or at the time of publication. Understanding plant adaptive mechanisms to environmental stress is one of the objectives of the NSF2010 Project. The success of this project will lead to better, environmentally friendly strategies for controlling crop diseases and will provide excellent training opportunities for undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows in classical genetics, phytopathology as well as cutting-edge genomics and bioinformatics technologies.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ PROJECT OUTCOMES REPORT     Combating infection is an essential part of adaptation to the environment. The sessile nature of plants and the lack of a specialized immune system make it difficult to study plant immunity independently of other plant processes. To fully understand how plants respond to pathogen challenge, a "systems biology" approach was used in this collaborative NSF 2010 project to uncover key regulatory networks underlying plant immunity and how they interface with global plant processes like growth and development. The synergistic teamwork between the Dong (Duke University), Somerville (UC Berkeley), and Ausubel (MGH, Harvard Medical School) laboratories has led to several major groundbreaking discoveries in understanding plant immune signaling and mechanisms, the publication of 56 peer reviewed papers[Office1]  (many of them in the top journals such as Cell, Nature, and Science), and the training of future scientists at the  high school to the postdoctoral level.     MAJOR SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERIES[Office2] :     Plant Immune Responses Are Timed by the Circadian Clock  In our study of genes conferring resistance against powdery mildew infection, we made the important finding that they are controlled by the circadian clock and expressed in the morning. We showed experimentally for the first time that this regulation by the circadian clock allows plants to anticipate infection at a time of the day (i.e., morning) when conditions (e.g., humidity, temperature, and pathogen spore dissemination) are the most favorable for many pathogens. This intrinsic link to the plant circadian clock also gates the immune response when pathogen challenge is present to minimize its interference on plant growth. Therefore, induction of plant defense at the wrong time of the day (i.e., at night) will lead to more detrimental effects on plants (e.g., plant water loss) than at the right time of the day (i.e., morning). This knowledge may be used to maximize the efficacy of resistance elicitors in the field by controlling the time of their deployment.     Plant Immune Responses Are Elicited by Pathogen-Encoded Protein-Degrading Enzymes  In our study of how plants detect the presence of pathogens and respond appropriately, we discovered a new mechanism that illustrates how plants and pathogens co-evolve. It is well known that plants respond to the presence of pathogens by recognizing pathogen-specific molecules such as the polymers that make up bacterial and fungal cell walls or bacterial flagella.  We unexpectedly discovered that several pathogens make protein-degrading enzymes that inactivate the plant immunity-related proteins that are responsible for recognizing the pathogens, effectively making the plants "blind" to the pathogens.  However, we discovered that during evolution, plants have developed sensors that recognize the presence of the protein-degrading enzymes, thereby thwarting the ability of the pathogens to inactivate the host defense response.  This work nicely illustrates the so-called evolutionary arms race between pathogens and hosts.     Plant Health Is Influenced by Soil Bacteria  Bacteria and fungi naturally associate with the roots of plants and confer a variety of benefits when plants are stressed. We found that specific "cultivars" of Arabidopsis plants promoted or suppressed the growth of a particular type of bacterium, Pseudomonas fluorescens, in the soil and that differences in growth of these bacteria in the soil resulted in enhanced or impaired fitness that depended on the specific Pseudomonas strains present in the soil and the nature of the stress. This work demonstrates that small plant-mediated changes in a root-associated microbial community can have large effects on plant health.     BROADER IMPACTS  The Dong, Somerville, and Ausubel labs have trained students at various levels in the STEM pipeline from high school students to postdoctoral fellows. Past students from the all-female Winsor High School, who have worked in the Ausubel lab during the summer, have gone on to major in the sciences at major universities and some have gone on to medical school. Community college students, largely from minority-serving institutions who have participated in tours and lab experiences organized by the Dong lab, have found technician jobs in local industries and enrolled in graduate programs.

Thus members of the three labs have added to the STEM-trained workforce, deemed essential for the US to remain competitive in the global economy. Furthermore, the three groups have a history of training scientists from diverse backgrounds.       Last Modified: 09/26/2016       Submitted by: Xinnian Dong]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
