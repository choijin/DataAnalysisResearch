<AbstractNarration>The Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program supports the research of Professor Richard Kemp of the University of New Mexico to investigate the reaction chemistry of CO2 and its heteroallene analogs, COS and CS2, with main group metals.  This research project has three parts:  to reduce or fix CO2 under mild reaction conditions to produce products (such as CO) that are more amenable to further reaction, to explore the differences in reactivity that are observed during heteroallene reactions with main group compounds, and to investigate the potential catalytic routes to convert CO2 into methylcarbamate or dimethylcarbamate using a nitrogen-ligated, Zn-based cycle.  These projects may impact the fixation and sequestration of CO2 on a large scale, reducing CO2 (a greenhouse gas which contributes to global warming) and providing new starting materials for chemical synthesis.  Professor Kemp has been successful in attracting and graduating both women and underrepresented minority students.  He has developed close interactions with a university in East Africa (Tanzania), bringing promising graduate students from this country to the U.S. for training.  It is expected that the majority of these students will return to their former universities as faculty, aiding the economic development of their home institutions and country.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ During the grant period of CHE09-11110 the PI and his group members have examined the reaction chemistry of CO2 and related heteroallenes with main group complexes with the primary goal to prepare valuable organic compounds from these relatively "useless" C1 compounds.  A specific interest of ours is to understand the fundamental interaction chemistry and activation of these heteroallenes (especially CO2) with inexpensive, earth-abundant s and p block (main group) elements.  During this time we have shown that we use CO2 to prepare many organic isocyanates or bis(organo)carbodiimides virtually instantaneously in 100% selectivity, as well as new phosphino-substituted isocyanates and other activated molecules containing CO2.  We have also demonstrated cleavage of CO2 into CO and O under very mild conditions &ndash; within seconds at room temperature &ndash; using main group compounds (Figure 1).  Insertions of CO2 into amido-ligands, again under very mild conditions, to form the previously unknown &ndash;[N(CO2)3]3- ligand (Figure 2) has also been shown. The work we have done using main group metals complements the large number of transition metal-catalyzed approaches ongoing in other research groups.  Another major advance from our group over the past two years is the discovery and characterization of a unique type of main group metal-CO2 "adduct" in which the CO2 is bound to the metal complex by dual Lewis acid/base interactions, somewhat related to the concept of frustrated Lewis pairs.  However, unlike previous work, our complexes do not require either large phosphines or extremely strong Lewis acids.  We can design the CO2 fragment to be tightly bound or not, in some cases popping on and off of the metal complex even at room temperature.  We have shown that in these adducts CO2 is bent at an angle of ~130 degrees (Figure 3), and we hypothesize that this "pre-bending" of CO2 in the adduct prior to electrochemical reduction should decrease the undesired overpotential requirement for direct CO2 reduction, thus speeding up the reaction. Thus, it is hoped that this mode of binding should allow for a more facile, energy-efficient transformation of CO2 using inexpensive main group or first row transition metals.  Our ultimate goal is to be able to use a renewable source of electrons in order to convert CO2 back into a useful fuel or fuel precursor such as methanol.      Our research group strongly believes that our obligation in taxpayer-funded research projects is that we must provide to the public at a minimum two work products &ndash; not only the advances in basic science mentioned above but also opportunities and education in human resources. This second product &ndash; the training, mentoring, and education of the students and Postdoctoral Fellows (PDFs) who are funded by NSF &ndash; is just as critical to the overall success of the project as are the papers we publish.  At the University of New Mexico (UNM), our group has a long and well-documented history of attracting, welcoming, and providing educational opportunities for a number of female students/PDFs as well as undergraduate and graduate students from traditionally under-represented groups.  UNM is a minority/Hispanic-serving university and we are fortunate to attract some of the best and brightest of these students. During the past funding period a total of 11 students, including PDFs (2), graduate (3), undergraduate (3), and high school students (3), have been fully or partially-supported in their education and training using our NSF funds.  Of these 11 students, 5 are female and 2 are members of under-represented groups (Hispanic, Asian-American).  We note that all of these students/PDFs have been co-authors on submitted or published manuscripts and/or presentations at outside meetings.  As well, during the last funding period one Ph.D. degree (African student) and one M.S. degree (female) were granted to Kemp group members.  An African-American middle school tea...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
