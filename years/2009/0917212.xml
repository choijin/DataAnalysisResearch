<AbstractNarration>Power consumption is an increasingly important issue across society.&lt;br/&gt;For communication, as the ranges of links in wireless networks&lt;br/&gt;continue to shrink, the power consumed in the encoding and decoding&lt;br/&gt;becomes a decidedly nontrivial factor in the choice of system&lt;br/&gt;architecture. This is particularly important in settings such as&lt;br/&gt;wireless patient monitoring, personal area networks, sensor networks,&lt;br/&gt;etc. Shannon's classical information theory only established the&lt;br/&gt;tradeoff between rate and transmit power as the probability of error&lt;br/&gt;goes to zero and the block-length goes to infinity. This research is&lt;br/&gt;about giving new conceptual tools for reasoning about the power&lt;br/&gt;consumption in encoding and decoding as well. The core idea is that in&lt;br/&gt;the age of billion transistor chips, the proper metric for complexity&lt;br/&gt;is the power consumed by the implementation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just as simplified channel models have enabled sophisticated analysis&lt;br/&gt;that has revealed deep insights into error correction and transmit&lt;br/&gt;power, this research develops simplified implementation models that&lt;br/&gt;are amenable to analysis. This reveals the fundamental tradeoffs&lt;br/&gt;underlying the interplay between transmission and processing&lt;br/&gt;powers. Crucially, the models developed are compatible with modern&lt;br/&gt;approaches to iterative and "turbo" decoding by massively parallel&lt;br/&gt;ASICs, while also not being limited to just the currently known&lt;br/&gt;families of sparse-graph codes. By developing a unified mathematical&lt;br/&gt;framework, this research allows us to understand the total power cost&lt;br/&gt;of meeting performance objectives like high rate, low distortion, low&lt;br/&gt;delay and low probability of error. This in turn leads to an&lt;br/&gt;understanding of how to better engineer wireless systems as a whole:&lt;br/&gt;opening up avenues for collaboration between circuit designers,&lt;br/&gt;communication theorists, and networking researchers working at higher&lt;br/&gt;layers.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
