<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merits of the research are in discovering how a fundamental cell process works, coupled with the development of new chemical agents and cutting edge technologies.  Cells depend on cues that they receive from the external environment to grow, divide and survive.  Plant and animal (including human) cells have evolved complex pathways for recognizing and internalizing cargo molecules from the external milieu and shuttling the cargo to various subcellular locations for processing.  The pathways that govern the handling of internalized cargo are present in all cells except bacteria and are governed by evolutionarily conserved escort proteins.  These regulatory escort proteins function together as a molecular machine that must be dynamically assembled and dissassembled according to the cargo and its subcellular destination.  The objective of the research is to unravel how a subset of regulatory escort proteins in animal cells (Rab7 GTPase, MTMR13 lipid phosphatase, hVps39 nucleotide exchange factor and TBC1D15 GTPase activating protein) recognize one another and are assembled into a functional machine that appropriately delivers its cargo.  Failure of the machine components to work together leads to a failure of the cell to survive.  The research also develops novel chemical probes, which is applicable to the study of a family of small GTPases with &gt;100 members.  The project combines state-of-the-art visualization of cellular processes; chemical biology and novel compound identification for pathway dissection; and quantitative biology for accurate measurement all with the goal of acquiring mechanistic understanding of escort proteins that are central to cell function and viability. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broad impact of the project is increased scientific literacy and elucidation of processes that are fundamental to all cells; the manipulation of which may have technologic advantage.  The head of the program is an experienced mentor, expert in cell biology, biochemistry and advanced microscopic imaging and active in science education outreach to public and secondary school students.  She serves as a board member of New Mexico Academy of Science, mentor on several grant funded training programs, director of science teaching certificate program and a post-doctoral fellow training program.  These activities:  1) provide students and underrepresented minorities with hands-on experience with cutting edge science that prepare them to assume productive science and technology intensive careers, 2) increase public awareness and understanding of current topics and debates in science ranging from stem cells to evolution and 3) engage the next generation of young people to work as part of an interdisciplinary team and invent new ways to tackle central problems in biology.  The pathway and Rab7 GTPase being studied is also relevant in plants where it is related to plant growth, pollen production, fruit ripening and nitrogen fixation.  Thus, knowledge of these processes is also the underpinning of agricultural technology development that seeks to manipulate the pathways for increased crop production and environmental sustainability through biological nitrogen fixation.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Human cells use a highly specialized machinery for sensing and responding to their environment. Growth factor receptors and Rab GTPase proteins are key components of this machinery. Under a 4-year National Science Foundation award (MCB0956027), the Wandinger-Ness laboratory at the University of New Mexico made new discoveries. The outcomes of the work include 2 awarded patents, and 17 published works &ndash;&ndash;10 peer-reviewed original scientific articles, 7 invited expert reviews or book chapters. Young scientists in the lab gave 10 oral or poster presentations at national and international scientific meetings. Value-added to the scientific community is shown by 195 citations of the work and an average of 11.5 citations per article since 2010. Among our ground-breaking discoveries was finding that the Rab7 GTPase controls growth factor receptor communication to the nucleus, considered the cell command center.&nbsp; Amazingly, any one of 4 amino acid changes that cause a human neuropathy and lie within the Rab7 protein do not inactivate the GTPase (Figure 1). Instead, the Rab7 mutant proteins make the nerve growth factor and epidermal growth factor receptors unable to properly trigger nerve cell longevity and cell growth (Figure 2). Rab7 and other Rab GTPases are central to the ability of human cells to ward off disease-causing, infectious agents (Figure 3). The results show that Rab7 and other GTPases are targets for intervention. This realization motivated a collaboration with the laboratory of Dr. Larry Sklar at the University of New Mexico. The goal was to identify small chemical compounds that target GTPase function in order to test the consequences of rapidly activating or blocking GTPase activities in cells and whole organisms. Such information is relevant to understanding how cells function and how defective GTPases result in disease. Our collaborative work has several important outcomes (Figure 4). First, patented new technology for high throughput screening advances the study of protein functions and drug discovery. Second, two patented compounds that block GTPases are marketed by multiple scientific chemical distributors and are broadly available to the scientific community. The compounds are useful for testing how GTPases control cell functions and can inform future therapeutic development. Third, a pending patent for monitoring GTPase activation can track cell responses to environmental stimuli such as growth factors, contact with bacteria or viruses, among others. In sum, the investment of public funds into our National Science Foundation sponsored project has met all benchmarks of success in terms of scientific accomplishment, training young scientists, increasing workforce diversity, intellectual property development, and broad applicability to multiple scientific disciplines.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/01/2016<br>      Modified by: Angela&nbsp;Wandinger-Ness</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/0956027/0956027_10014344_1478057794344_Fig.4NSFLaysummary--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/0956027/0956027_10014344_1478057794344_Fig.4NSFLaysummary--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 4.
