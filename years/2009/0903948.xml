<AbstractNarration>Houston-Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation-Senior Alliance&lt;br/&gt;Project Summary&lt;br/&gt;The Houston-Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (H-LSAMP) is comprised of the University of Houston, University of Houston-Downtown, Texas Southern University,Texas State University, Houston Community College, San Jacinto College, Rice University, and the Houston Independent School District. During this proposal, the senior alliance will work to institutionalize the Collaborative Learning Community system while enhancing the alliance through 1) recruiting and retaining well-qualified minority Science, Engineering, Technology, and Mathematics majors in an effort to graduate nearly 1,300&lt;br/&gt;underrepresented minority STEM majors annually, 2) developing a mechanism to&lt;br/&gt;increase community college transfer to 75% of level one students, 3) increasing student research and internship participation to over 90% of level one students, 4) sending 10 or more students overseas on meaningful international experiences.&lt;br/&gt;Student Scholars will receive stipends to support their efforts in the collaborative learning community including facilitating workshops, conducting research, providing tutor support, and assisting in enrichment workshops. Scholars will be mentored by a combination of faculty, staff, and peers; have access to student support services such as career centers, writing centers, tutor labs, and academic excellence workshops.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The H-LSAMP proposal is based on strong student support&lt;br/&gt;systems developed from current research and best practices, a proven record of&lt;br/&gt;success, and a demonstrated record of institutionalization. The H-LSAMP program&lt;br/&gt;recruits and supports a large at-risk and financially disadvantaged minority student population in the Southeast Texas region. This alliance works because of a balanced and thorough management plan, with input from all levels of the universities and school systems it serves. A comprehensive collaborative learning community is being institutionalized on all campuses. The alliance expects to contribute to the broader knowledge base by disseminating important new knowledge about the factors that contribute to retention and recruitment of underrepresented minorities, primarily Hispanic and African-Americans pursuing STEM degrees.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Texas has a growing economy; while the US lost over 279,000 jobs from August 2007-August 2008, Texas gained 252,000. This growth further outlines the need for a diversified STEM workforce, making programs such as LSAMP even more important, as economically disadvantaged students have a harder time making inroads into technology driven economies. The H-LSAMP affects over 550 level one students and an estimated 5,500-6,000 level two students annually in a comprehensive STEM program. Along with career guidance, and effective career path counseling programs, the alliance sends nearly 40% of its graduates into graduate or professional education post graduation, while placing students in the workforce nationally. With the increasing trend toward globalization in the STEM fields, the alliance is seeking to significantly increase the international exposure and cultural literacy of its&lt;br/&gt;scholars in order to better position them to take up leadership roles in a globalized workforce. Each round of funding has provided the resources required to institutionalize parts of the program, now averaging around $1 million annually. This proposal includes a strong and balanced diversity program, with numerous points of dissemination, and a multifaceted evaluation plan.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The three most significant Outcomes of  Phase III of the Houston-Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation relate to growth in minority student (UREP) enrollment in STEM programs, STEM degrees awarded, and financial support through grant, institutional, and private funding.  The Alliance UREP STEM enrollment increased from 2760 (2009-10) to 3876 (2013-14).  The number of UREP STEM degrees increased from 382 (2009-10) to 468 (2013-14).  The total number of direct participants  (level-1 students receiving financial support) increased from 390 (2009-10) to 555 (2013-14), whereas the number of UREP direct participants increased from 269 to 452, a 68% increase.  Each member of the Alliance has developed a successful program which addresses the needs of its students.  University of Houston: The Scholar Enrichment Program (SEP) is the UH component of Houston&ndash;Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (H-LSAMP).  SEP was established in 1992 for the academic enhancement and retention of undergraduate students majoring in STEM fields. SEP creates collaborative learning communities for students at risk of dropping out or not completing their course work.  SEP designs and manages peer-led learning student roles which keep scholars academically involved in collaborative learning and create a professional development pipeline for nurturing and supplying a constant flow of future workshop peer-leaders for SEP and other UH STEM related peer-lead learning environments which support student success at UH.  SEP's informal mentoring program builds a community within the university where students are able to come together and provide a strong network of support for each other.  Each semester ~40 Academic Excellence Workshops taught by student facilitators are offered in STEM subjects. These workshops focus on gateway classes such as calculus, physics, biology and chemistry &ndash; subjects that traditionally have a high student failure rate. These gateway classes are essential to successfully completing STEM degrees. Students also gain support through peer tutoring, research experiences, study centers, and mentor programs. Currently, SEP workshop enrollment is 734 students in 36 different workshops.  Houston Community College:  The focus of the Houston Community College H-LSAMP program is to provide an introduction to materials science to each of the AMP Scholars to broaden their perspective of science and engineering.   Over the course of each semester, the PI provides a non-credit seminar series to the AMP Scholars on the fundamental concepts of materials in conjunction with their university laboratory experiences.  San Jacinto College:  The San Jacinto College H-LSAMP program is a national model of what two-year colleges can do.  The PI and her team have created and sustained a dynamic and effective model that includes the best aspects of student recruitment, faculty involvement, and peer mentoring.  University of Houston-Downtown:  The University 0f Houston-Downtown program is built on two primary components: the Peer-Led Team Learning program and the Scholars Academy.  Both programs have been well-documented and well-sustained.  The Scholars Academy is an academically competitive program in the College of Sciences and Technology that promotes scholarship and student success for undergraduate students majoring in STEM disciplines.  Texas State University: Texas StateÆs H-LSAMP Student Leadership Board initiated a retention-based partnership with the first year students in the SPARK (S-STEM) Scholars Program. H-LSAMP scholars served as peer mentors, provided tutoring in STEM courses, organized group social activities, and encouraged SPARK students to apply to become H-LSAMP scholars.  Texas StateÆs Career Services Office (CSO) has increased support services and STEM-related opportunities for AMP students. CSO corporate development staff members routinely bring new companies and recruiters to campus, looking for STEM majors a...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
