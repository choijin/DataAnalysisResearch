<AbstractNarration>The ability to control systems operating in dynamic and stochastic environments is a critical bottleneck in many scientific (e.g., exploration robots), military (e.g., surveillance drones) and everyday civilian (e.g., air traffic) domains. For example, the autonomous control of a Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) would allow better search and rescue (e.g., in remote mountainous areas), disaster response (e.g., inside damaged buildings), ecological data gathering (e.g., on tree tops) and military intelligence (e.g., reconnaissance). Such technologically-promising and scientifically-challenging problems are challenging because they possess most of the difficulties of control systems simultaneously, notably that the system (i) has highly non-linear dynamics; (ii) operates in non-stationary environments; (iii) operates in stochastic environments; and (iv) has complex interactions with the environment that are difficult, if not impossible, to model accurately.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research under this award is pursuing an agent-based approach to (single-agent) control that relies on local actions, but local actions need to be carefully coordinated to ensure that the system receives a coherent control signal. There is currently a lack of algorithms that can combine multiple sensors and use distributed computation and actuation to control a complex system without carrying a model of the system or resorting to difficult to implement agent coordination routines. This research will contribute to theoretical foundations of multiagent control, and provide learning and coordination algorithms for controlling systems operating in dynamic and stochastic environments.</AbstractNarration>
