Pennsylvania State University (PSU), Tufts University (TU) and the University of California-Riverside (UCR) are collaborating to establish the proposed center, with PSU as the lead institution.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary goals of this planning project are to initiate formal partnership with various industry partners and national laboratories that have an interest in optical wireless applications designs, and to discuss fundamental issues and topics for research. The main objective of the envisioned research projects at the proposed Center is to develop a new generation of environment-friendly extremely wideband optical wireless technology applications.  The PIs' effort will involve work in relevant device designs, in optical wireless communication systems (physical layer), in networking, sensing, and in imaging.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed Center has the potential to improve the profitability of US manufacturing by developing new optical wireless devices that will improve communication systems, reduce energy consumption and pollution.  The proposed Center will offer a series of short courses to update the knowledge of the current workforce and will help universities to tailor new course offerings and to modify existing course offerings to better provide instruction for related areas and industry needs.  The Center plans to promote diversity, building on all three universities' high ranking in education of minorities.  In addition, the Center will work with existing university resources to recruit and build strong relationships with minority and women-owned companies and provide a collaborative community, within which these companies can contribute expertise, expand their networks and become more globally competitive.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Recent breakthroughs in solid-state lighting technology has opened the door to a myriad of applications using light-emitting diodes for both illumination and optical wireless networking.  This workshop provided a forum for leading industry professionals and researchers to discuss the potentials to establish an interdisciplinary research Center, providing leadership to develop a new generation of environment-friendly (GREEN), extremely wideband optical wireless technology applications, employing solid-state devices for communications, networking, imaging and remote sensing applications.  As LEDÆs increasingly displace incandescent lighting over the next few years, general applications of VLC technology are expected to include wireless Internet access, vehicle to vehicle communications, broadcast from LED signage, machine to machine communications etc. ?The VLC technology also has potential in a number of specialized application areas including the following:  *Hospital &amp; Healthcare &ndash; enabling mobility and data communications in hospitals.  *Hazardous Environments &ndash; enabling data communications in environments where RF is potentially dangerous (such as Oil &amp; Gas, Petrochemicals and Mining)  *Commercial Aviation &ndash; enabling wireless data communications such as in flight entertainment and personal communications  *Corporate and Organizational Security &ndash; enabling the use of Wireless Networks in applications where WiFi presents a security risk  * WiFi Spectrum Relief &ndash; providing additional bandwidth in environments where unlicensed communication bands are congested  * Green Computing &ndash; greater energy efficiency  * Defense &amp; Military Applications &ndash; enabling high data rate wireless communications within military vehicles and aircraft  * Underwater communications &ndash; between divers and/or remote operated vehicles.   Progress in semiconductor technology has facilitated production of efficient light sources including LEDs, lasers, white LEDs, etc. These can operate over wide visible light (VL), infrared (IR) and ultra-violet (UV) ranges. Replacement of conventional light bulbs with lighting VL-LEDs will result in great savings of energy, reaching 1.9&times;1020 Joules in 10 years. Light sources, can harness the potential of the LEDs by offering controllability that will enhance their functionality and performance in a wide range of applications; including imaging, communications, networking and navigation.
