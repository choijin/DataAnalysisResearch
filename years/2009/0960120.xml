<AbstractNarration>0960120&lt;br/&gt;Chandrasekhar&lt;br/&gt;Northwestern U.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Summary: &lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is for the development of a facility to enable low-temperature,  time-, frequency- and spatially-resolved radiofrequency and microwave measurements for a wide variety of experiments in condensed matter and materials physics at Northwestern University.  Four sets of experiments will be attempted during the project period:  investigation of cross-correlation noise in mesoscopic devices; magnetization dynamics of nanoscale ferromagnets; time-of-flight measurements in Luttinger liquids in semiconductor devices; and persistent currents in normal metals.  However, the usefulness of this new facility will extend far beyond these initial experiments, involving other groups at Northwestern, and enabling research groups at Northwestern to actively incorporate high-frequency techniques in their future experimental research plans.  It will also allow undergraduate and graduate students and post-docs at Northwestern to gain familiarity with radio and microwave frequency techniques, a skill that is becoming increasing important in both academia and industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-Technical Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The increasing miniaturization of electronic circuitry that allows the development of fast computers and slim cell phones is also accompanied by a desire to make these devices work even smaller and faster.  Reducing the size of device elements to the scale of nanometers--one billionth the size of a meter--presents new experimental challenges in trying to study their behavior at time scales of a nanosecond or shorter, time scales that are increasingly important for cutting-edge electronic devices.  This project is devoted to developing instrumentation to study the behavior of nanoscale materials at frequencies starting at a few gigahertz, the frequencies at which the current fastest desktop computers operate, to a few tens of gigahertz.  In addition to providing insight into better ways to make the next generation of nanoscale, high-frequency devices, the instrumentation that will be developed will enable experiments exploring fundamental quantum phenomena at high frequency, and in the process train the next generation of scientists and engineers in these essential techniques.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit  Modern electronic, computer and telecommunication equipment have signals that vary at a few billion times a second, or at microwave frequencies.  Hence it is important to understand how to control signals and test devices and new materials in this frequency range.  The focus of this project was to establish at Northwestern University the resources and expertise to be able to perform sophisticated high frequency measurements on a variety of different systems and materials.  These resources have been used by researchers in a number of different departments.     A major portion of the grant funds from the project enabled the purchase of five pieces of microwave frequency equipment that immediately enabled a series of experiments spanning both technologically important materials research as well as investigations into fundamental physical phenomena.  The applied research was focused on characterizing the high frequency response of optical modulators based on novel ferroelectric materials.  The more fundamental research was devoted to understanding the dynamic response of patterned magnetic media, which also might have implications for future computer storage applications.     The remainder of the grant funds was targeted towards development of the ability to make high frequency measurements at ultra-low temperatures, of the order of a few milli-degrees above absolute zero, in order to probe exotic quantum phenomena that occur only under such extreme conditions.  This work involves the synthesis of a wide variety of techniques, from computer simulations of the expected behavior, the machining and fabrication of custom components, and the fabrication of devices with dimensions down to a few tens of nanometers, or one-thousandth the thickness of a human hair.  This work is ongoing, but the expertise acquired during this development will inform the design and execution of future experiments.     As part of this project, a new high-frequency measurement facility was established at Northwestern that will act as a repository for both the physical equipment as well as the collective expertise that has been acquired (in the form of protocols and recipes), and will prove beneficial for ongoing research for many years to come.     Broader Merit  In addition to the technological importance of the research, a number of students and more senior researchers have become trained in high frequency measurement techniques.  These include graduate students at Northwestern, a number of undergraduates from both Northwestern and other institutions, including some from groups traditionally underrepresented in the sciences, and even local high school students.  The skills acquired by these students will prove useful in their future careers, whether they continue in an academic environment or work in industry.
