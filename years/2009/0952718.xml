<AbstractNarration>Magnetic microrobots that navigate the natural pathways of the body have the potential to revolutionize minimally invasive medicine and biomedical research. Current magnetic manipulation systems utilize massive magnets to produce a uniform magnetic field over a relatively small area. Uniform magnetic fields are used to simplify control, but this simplified control comes at a huge cost, and it is difficult to scale up most laboratory field-generation systems to the size required for clinical use. The use of nonuniform magnetic fields makes it possible to place magnets nearer to the patient, which permits the use of smaller, less-expensive magnets, while simultaneously improving actuatable degrees of freedom and force levels that systems can render. The hypothesis being tested is that using nonuniform magnetic fields to wirelessly control medical microrobots results in superior systems?in terms of size, cost, and performance?compared to using uniform fields. This research consists of two thrusts: control of magnetically tipped continuum microrobots, which provide distal dexterity in hard-to-reach locations, and control of fully untethered magnetic helical microrobots, which swim and crawl through fluids, lumens, and soft tissue using a method inspired by bacterial flagella. Understanding how to use nonuniform magnetic fields for wireless control may be the key to translating nearly every previously developed method for microrobot propulsion into clinical practice. Magnetic microrobots may be the ideal platform from which to deploy the numerous BioMEMS devices and magnetic sensors and actuators that have been designed in recent years.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project significantly advanced the state-of-the-art in the manipulation of small minimally invasive medical devices inside the human body, using controlled magnetic fields generated on the outside the body. The project comprised a number of related tasks. In the first task, the Principal Investigator (PI) developed a technique to make cochlear-implant surgery less traumatic to the delicate cochlea by embedding a small magnet in the tip of the implant and then magnetically guiding the tip as it is surgically inserted using a single large magnet on the outside of the patient's head. In the second task, the PI developed a method to determine where a magnetic capsule endoscope (camera pill) is located within the small intestines of a patient, and then propel the capsule through the intestines, all using a single large rotating permanent magnet on the outside of the body. In the third task, the PI developed a method to control a levitating magnetic capsule endoscope using a single permanent magnet, for use in inspection of a fluid-filled stomach. The ultimate goal of both capsule-endoscopy tasks is to improve early detection of cancer and other diseases. In the fourth task, the PI developed a new type of modular electromagnetic manipulation system called Omnimagnets. Omnimagnets are designed to be reconfigurable to surround a patient in an optimal configuration for a given manipulation task. Omnimagnets also have potential uses beyond medical applications, including in modular spacecraft. In the fifth and final task, the PI developed magnetic-control techniques for next-generation medical microrobots that have the potential to swim, crawl, and drill through bodily fluids and tissues to perform targeted therapies such as targeted drug delivery. In addition to the scientific research itself, this project also enabled the training of multiple graduate students who earned M.S. and Ph.D. degrees with the support of the award.
