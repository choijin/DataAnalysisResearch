<AbstractNarration>Objective&lt;br/&gt;We propose to design and build a suite of multichannel nonlinear-optical signal-processing devices (2R regenerator for phase-shift-keying transmission formats, switch/gate, and wavelength converter) based on nonlinear-optical loop mirror (NOLM), in which the key and novel component enabling the simultaneous processing of multiple wavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM) channels is a group-delay-managed (GDM) nonlinear medium. Such a GDM-medium differs from conventional dispersion-managed media in that its dispersion map is not only spatially, but also spectrally periodic, which eliminates nonlinear inter-channel interaction by ensuring large dispersive walk-off among different WDM channels, while preserving the integrity of each channel's pulses. &lt;br/&gt;The project consists of three key efforts: &lt;br/&gt;a) development and testing of multi-functional multichannel nonlinear-optical signal processor based on GDM-medium-enabled NOLM; &lt;br/&gt;b) design/fabrication of ultra-low-loss GDM-medium implementing novel multiport periodic-group-delay-device on a chip; &lt;br/&gt;c) theoretical modeling of GDM-based NOLM. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit&lt;br/&gt;The proposed first realization of devices that utilize large intra-channel optical nonlinearity while suppressing the inter-channel nonlinearity will overturn the accepted paradigms of all-optical processing, making transformative impact on optical communications, networking, and computing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact&lt;br/&gt;This project will dramatically reduce complexity and cost of nonlinear-optical signal processing systems, expediting the roll-out of all-optical networking and increasing the bandwidth availability. The reduced, compared to electronic processing, power consumption will contribute to better environment. The compatibility of this approach with silicon and chalcogenide-glass waveguides makes it potentially beneficial for board-to-board and chip-to-chip networking. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This funding will support three graduate students who will get synergetic experience in optical communications systems, device fabrication, and applied mathematics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This is the joint Project Outcomes report for awards ECCS-0925706 and ECCS-0925860.  All-optical regenerators, similar to electronic decision circuits, separate "ones" (signal above the threshold) from "zeros" (below the threshold) in the presence of noise and distortions. Upon the separation, a new stream of clean "ones" and "zeros" is made and sent over long distances, until the accumulated noise and distortions again require signal regeneration.  Future all-optical regenerators may replace electronic decision circuits because they can process the optical signal directly, without converting it first to electronic signal and then back to optical. This results in lower cost, size, complexity, and power consumption by all-optical regenerators. Moreover, they can operate at much higher data rates.  Recent migration of the optical communication industry from amplitude- to phase-encoded data has brought the need for optical regeneration of phase-encoded signals, such as differential phase-shift keying (DPSK). However, in order to be considered practical, such regenerators need to be able to operate simultaneously on multiple signal streams, called wavelength-division-multiplexed (WDM) channels. While the DPSK  regeneration and WDM regeneration have been separately demonstrated (the latter &ndash; by us in a prior NSF project), their potential combination in one device has never been considered and its investigation is this projectÆs goal.  We have improved the previously-known DPSK regenerator setup to amend its two shortcomings. First, our device can operate with pulses of practically important 33&ndash;50-picosecond durations (at 10 Gb/s data rate), whereas the previous setups required very short pulses (&lt;10 picoseconds), which are not used in real transmission systems.

We have shown that, under certain conditions, this combination realizes a large number of independent PGDDs seamlessly sharing the same grating elements.  The second method of PGDD fabrication uses cascaded microring resonators. To work with the typical WDM channel spacing, the microrings need to be small (100&ndash;500-micrometer radii), which rules out the standard glass-waveguide technology. Hence, we have pursued microring fabrication on emerging sil...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
