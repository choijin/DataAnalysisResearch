<AbstractNarration>ID: MPS/DMR/BMAT(7623) 0954919         PI:  Andreescu, Emanuela    ORG: Clarkson University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title:  CAREER: Inorganic Nanoparticles with Biological Properties: Preparation, Characterization and Sensing Applications&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTELLECTUAL MERIT:  The objective of this career development plan is to develop and study a new class of inorganic biomimetic materials, with focus on ceria based metal oxides. The plan is designed to advance understanding of the mechanism that governs their biological properties in relation to their physicochemical properties and to derive structure-activity relations for the purpose of rational design of novel sensing approaches based on these materials.  The proposed research will provide key experimental data in a new and unique area of biomaterials research, that of inorganic materials possessing interesting bio-mimetic properties and oxygen storage ability, and of their applications in sensing. Specifically, this will be the first investigation of the enzyme-like activity of ceria based metal oxides nanoparticles (NPs) in relation to their physicochemical and structural characteristics. Research will involve: (1) optimizing and controlling surface reactivity through tailored synthesis and systematic modifications of the NPs surface, (2) identifying key parameters that regulate NPs reactivity and using these properties to control their biological activity, (3) testing their ?enzyme-like? activity and (4) sensing applications that will take advantage of their special biomimetic properties, and their oxygen storage capacity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACTS:  This research introduces a unique concept in the biomaterials research arena, that of inorganic materials mimicking traditional biological catalysts and possessing oxygen storage/release capabilities for advanced biomedical and sensing applications. The fundamental knowledge gained from these studies will enable rational design of a new generation of bio-mimetic materials and devices with unprecedented performance in terms of stability, robustness, and low oxygen dependency. In addition to biomaterials and biosensors, this research will also impact a variety of other fields where these materials could find useful applications (e.g. biomedicine as therapeutic drugs to inactivate reactive oxygen species, biotechnology as catalysts that require operation at extreme conditions). The project will have a major impact on course development, student training, recruitment and mentoring. A new upper level undergraduate-graduate course and inquiry-based laboratory modules will be developed to provide interdisciplinary education of Clarkson students.  Learning modules and instructor support materials for  hands-on experiments will be created for introduction to local high schools through the planned outreach activities. Graduates and undergraduates will collaborate to prepare high school and general chemistry versions of the proposed experiments in consultation with faculty and high school teachers and students. A pilot program for enhancing retention rates of entering freshmen will be instituted. The project will contribute to the efforts of the Chemistry Department to strengthen the biomolecular science program and increase and retain the numbers of science majors at Clarkson. The proposed inquiry-based laboratory modules will enhance accessibility to modern scientific technologies and provide materials that are transferable to other institutions and to a larger number of students including local high schools and community colleges. Through this program, underrepresented minority students, recruited through on-going programs and established collaborations of the PI, will be provided with an opportunity to conduct independent research.</AbstractNarration>
