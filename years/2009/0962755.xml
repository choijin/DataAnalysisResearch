<AbstractNarration>Hybrid zones typically encompass a variety of taxonomically and genetically distinct individuals living under similar ecological and social conditions. Thus, hybrid zones represent unique opportunities to separate intrinsic and extrinsic causes of variation among animals. Furthermore, because a variety of animals are in direct competition, hybrid zones are also ideal locations for studies of competitive ability. This project focuses on two species of howler monkeys, Alouatta palliata and A. pigra, with different vocalizationsthat hybridize in a small region in southern Mexico. The research builds on previous morphological and genetic sampling of the hybrid zone and addresses two main questions: 1) what causes vocal variation among A. palliata, A. pigra, and hybrids? and, 2) how do different vocalizations impact competitive ability in the hybrid zone? To address these questions the project integrates molecular, morphological, behavioral, and acoustic data with playback experiments. Sources of vocal differences will be uncovered by comparing vocalizations among purebred and hybrid males to their genetic background, morphology, location, and social setting. The playback experiments involve both males and females and reveals the types of calls that males find intimidating or females find attractive (or both). The study examines the proximate and ultimate factors shaping primate vocalizations, how sexual selection structures admixture and gene flow, and how differences in vocalizations affect sexual selection. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is highly collaborative and will strengthen research ties at many levels; between departments at the University of Michigan, between the University of Michigan and Ohio State University, and internationally between US universities and the Universidad Veracruzana in Mexico. In addition to providing considerable training to Mexican and US students, the project will directly benefit conservation through an educational workshop directed to school-age children within the area of hybridization. Furthermore, the presence of a long-term study in the region and the inclusion of Mexican researchers and students will promote primate studies and conservation in Mexico, a country of high biogeographic importance for primates and other Neotropical taxa.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Our project addressed two basic questions in biology: why do animals differ in their behavior? How does this variation affect their ability to survive and reproduce? We focused on the social behavior and vocalizations of two species of howler monkeys (Alouatta palliata and A. pigra) living in Mexico for three reasons. 1) Primate vocalizations are particularly interesting given that humans have such an incredibly flexible communication system while non-human primate vocalizations appear quite limited and inflexible. 2) Howler monkeys are named for their loud vocalizations that are used in territorial disputes with rivals. Thus, if some loud call variants are &euml;better&iacute; than others, this is likely to have direct impact on reproductive success. 3) The two species of howler monkeys have distinct calls and social behavior, yet they hybridize in a narrow contact zone in Mexico. We can, consequently, study a range of pure and admixed individuals living in the same area to see how an animal&iacute;s genetic background relates to their vocalizations and behavior. Furthermore, in the contact zone different types of individuals are directly competing against each other allowing us to relate behavioral and vocal variation to success. Hybridization among mammals is interesting in its own right as it has not been studied extensively but is now known to occur much more frequently than once believed. In fact, hybridization has had an impact on the history of several primate species including humans.</p> <p>Our main findings are as follows. 1) The acoustic features of loud calls of howler monkeys appear inflexible, with the call that an animal produces mapping closely on to their genetic background regardless of where they live. For example, the hybrid individuals have calls that are intermediate between the calls of the two parental species. This bolsters evidence from old cross-fostering studies in macaques (no longer considered ethical) that showed limited vocal flexibility. This adds to the puzzle of human language and suggests that our own vocal flexibility is truly unique compared to other primates. 2) The social behavior of the howler monkeys also appears inflexible as their behavior follows their genetic background even for individuals living in the same forest fragment. This finding is more surprising and suggests that we need to rethink our assumptions about how adaptable primate behavior can be. 3) We found no evidence that the calls of either species (or the hybrids) are inherently superior. Rather, we found that hybrid and purebred individuals respond most strongly to calls that are similar to their own and largely ignore other calls (with the exception of A. palliate males). Because it is assumed that the calls are used to repel rival males (who are looking to steal mating opportunities from the caller), the lack of response to different calls could contribute to the hybridization because males might not attempt to exclude a heterospecific rival. This is a novel finding in a mammalian hybrid zone and has important implications for how we think about species recognition. 4) The monkeys pay more attention to the acoustic properties of the calls (e.g., the pitch of the call) than to temporal properties (e.g., the duration of the longest syllable).
