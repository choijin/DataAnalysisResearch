<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0904200&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Ilya Kapovich&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outer automorphism group of a free group is a more&lt;br/&gt;complicated and much less well understood cousin of the modular&lt;br/&gt;group of a Riemann surface.  The project aims to study the outer&lt;br/&gt;automorphism group of a free group via analyzing the interaction&lt;br/&gt;between the Culler-Vogtmann Outer space (the traditionally&lt;br/&gt;considered free group analog of the Teichmuller space) and the&lt;br/&gt;space of geodesic currents on a free group. A geodesic current is&lt;br/&gt;a measure-theoretic generalization of the notion of a closed&lt;br/&gt;curve or a conjugacy class. The space of geodesic currents turns&lt;br/&gt;out to be a natural companion of the Outer space and studying&lt;br/&gt;them together should produce substantial new information of the&lt;br/&gt;dynamics and geometry of the outer automorphism group of a free&lt;br/&gt;group. A key tool to be used for such study is the so-called&lt;br/&gt;``geometric intersection form'' introduced in the earlier work of&lt;br/&gt;the proposer. Specific questions to be studied include: studying&lt;br/&gt;the geometry of various free group analogs of the curve complex,&lt;br/&gt;constructing domains of discontinuity and developing a theory of&lt;br/&gt;convex co-compactness for subgroups of the outer automorphism&lt;br/&gt;group of a free group, developing a theory of generalized (or&lt;br/&gt;``non-commutative'') currents, and others.  In combinatorics and&lt;br/&gt;computer science there is an active search for theories of words&lt;br/&gt;based on domains other than an integer segment (e.g.  the integer&lt;br/&gt;lattice of the Cayley graph of a free group). The theory of&lt;br/&gt;generalized currents, introduced in the proposal, provides a good&lt;br/&gt;model of this kind that should be useful in the study of words&lt;br/&gt;based on non-linear domains. The proposal aims to develop this&lt;br/&gt;theory further and to investigate in more detail the interactions&lt;br/&gt;between geometric group theory and computer science that arise in&lt;br/&gt;this context.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the project is to study dynamics and geometry of the&lt;br/&gt;outer automorphism group of a free group, one of the most&lt;br/&gt;mysterious, interesting and least understood mathematical&lt;br/&gt;objects. Among the key ideas is the use of a new tool, called a&lt;br/&gt;``geodesic current'', which allows one to bring substantial new&lt;br/&gt;machinery and techniques from analysis and ergodic theory to the&lt;br/&gt;subject. The project will also explore, via the notion of&lt;br/&gt;generalized geodesic currents, interactions between geometric&lt;br/&gt;group theory and computer science, aimed at understanding new&lt;br/&gt;types of data structures - namely words that, unlike standard&lt;br/&gt;words, are not written on straight line segments.  A significant&lt;br/&gt;component of the project includes REU (``Research Experience for&lt;br/&gt;Undergraduates'') activities, that will involve&lt;br/&gt;U.S. undergraduate students in advanced mathematical research and&lt;br/&gt;help prepare them for future careers in science and technology.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research has served as a basis for a project, funded&lt;br/&gt;for two years, under the umbrella of the UIUC-CNRS institutional&lt;br/&gt;collaborative agreement, for collaborative research in geometric&lt;br/&gt;group theory between researchers from UIUC and Marseille. The NSF&lt;br/&gt;grant will be used to expand and enhance that project, to involve&lt;br/&gt;additional research groups and to further build up institutional&lt;br/&gt;international research ties between UIUC and CNRS.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
