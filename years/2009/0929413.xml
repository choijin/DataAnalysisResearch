<AbstractNarration>Principle Investigator: M. Kathryn Barton&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal number: IOS-0929413&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title:  Arabidopsis 2010: The ad/abaxial regulatory network of Arabidopsis&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In plants, the ad/abaxial regulatory network governs some of the most basic elements of plant growth and function.  In the simple experimental plant Arabidopsis, this includes the organization of the cells in the leaf necessary for efficient light capture and gas exchange.  This system also controls the formation of new branches.  To date a small set of transcription factors - proteins that regulate the activity of genes - have been found to control this regulatory network.  This project will identify the genes that these factors control and will discover how these genes act together in a network to result in the highly coordinated growth that occurs in the plant.  Understanding how the plant body is formed is fundamental to our understanding of plants that we grow for food, fiber or fuel as well as to our more general understanding of the natural environment.   This understanding can be used to improve our approaches to managing our agricultural and wild lands.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The plant body is constantly being added to - new leaves, stems and lateral roots are made over time as old ones are eaten by herbivores or lost to environmental damage.  Cells within leaves, roots and stems are organized to optimize the basic functions of the plant - light capture, water uptake, CO2 uptake, oxygen emission and the production of energetic substances such as sugars and starches.  Both of these processes - new growth and the organized development of cells within the plant require the action of key transcription factors, REVOLUTA and KANADI.  These proteins are regulators of the ad/abaxial network, and they determine which  mRNAs are made in distinct parts of the plant at distinct times.  This project investigated which mRNAs among tens of thousands are controlled by REVOLUTA and KANADI.  This in turn tells us which proteins are required to make a certain cell type or to regulate growth.  These proteins in turn regulate yet the production of yet other mRNAs.  This process can be viewed as a network of regulatory interactions.  Defining and describing this network of interactions is necessary if we wish to understand how plants grow in response to changes in their environments.     Using engineered forms of four master developmental regulators (REVOLUTA, KANADI, SHOOTMERISTEMLESS and ASYMMETRIC LEAVES2 transcription factors), genes targeted by these factors were identified in the small, fast growing Arabidopsis plant.  In many cases, the target genes were themselves part of regulatory networks such as hormone (e.g. auxin) control networks indicating that part of the effect of the master regulators is to control in which cells, and in what context, auxin works.  In other cases, the target genes are genes for which little is known about their function.  Additional experiments on these unknowns shows they have the capacity to regulate leaf development.  This expands our knowledge of the network and its components.     A surprising outcome of this project is that the REVOLUTA and KANADI transcription factors, factors known to control growth and development of the plant body, also control many genes related to abscisic acid (ABA) signaling. ABA has long been known as a "drought hormone". It causes the stomata &ndash; small holes in plant leaves &ndash; to close in response to dry conditions. It also mediates seed dormancy where it causes the developing seed to dry down and the embryo inside it to cease growth.  Experiments done in this project show that ABA inhibits growth of leaves and roots in the plant and that KANADI genes are required for the inhibition.  Understanding how ABA uses the KANADI transcription factor &ndash; as well as others found in this study &ndash; to slow or even stop growth in response to drought will be key to understanding how plants modulate their growth under dry conditions and to determining if these plant responses can be modified through breeding to make drought resistant plants.  In the course of the project, young scientists were mentored in the lab and learned many of the latest techniques in plant molecular biology.  These included high school students from a variety of backgrounds, undergraduates and recent college graduates as well as a postdoctoral associate in training to become an independent investigator.
