<AbstractNarration>This travel grant supports travel expenses for the PI and two graduate students to participate in the eleventh annual Transfer of Knowledge Conference of the European Social Cognition Network (ESCON) in Warsaw, Poland. The conference is to be held August 26-30, 2009. Approximately 120 participants will take part in the conference, and they will come from 15 European countries and the US. The conference will include 90 presentations in four parallel sessions, and also four plenary sessions with keynote speakers. This conference provides a forum where junior researchers can present their latest research related to social cognition and receive feedback, with the ultimate aim that the conference fulfill training and networking functions for the new generation of social cognition researchers. The PI, as one of the plenary speakers, will present her research to the international audience and discuss her work both in the session and more informally through other conference interaction contexts. The two graduate students to accompany the PI will also present their research and have the opportunity to benefit from feedback and interaction with junior and senior social cognition researchers. Overall, the conference will provide ample opportunity for networking, learning, and the stimulation of research related to social cognition in a context that enables knowledge sharing across nations.</AbstractNarration>
