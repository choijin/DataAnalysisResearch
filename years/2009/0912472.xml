<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop innovative water disinfection unit based on solid state UV LED lamps for compact point-of-use and point-of-entry water purification reactors. Accomplishment of the proposed research will result in compact semiconductor LED based UV water disinfection unit with reduced power consumption and extended reliability. Development of UV disinfection technology using semiconductor UV lamps utilizes unique characteristics, such as possibility of controlled UV spectral power distribution, fast switching time, lower power consumption, reliability, small size and ruggedness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this research are the developments of commercially viable and environmentally safe technology for UV water disinfection. The primary market segment addressed through the work that will be performed under this Phase I effort is the microbial disinfection of water for point-of-use and point-of-entry applications in remote and rural areas. Incorporation of innovative UV LED lamps in water purification modules will enable cost effective and environmentally friendly technology for water purification designed for a variety of water supplies including residential, remote, and emergency relief. Solid state UV LED lamps enable new mercury-free UV technology for variety of application technologies, which will provide better quality of life in US and worldwide. Use of environmentally friendly semiconductor UV sources will lead to reduction of toxic waste and cost associated with mercury lamp disposal. The purification, sterilization, and early warning detection systems designed with UV LED sources will also benefit quality of life for people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).</AbstractNarration>
