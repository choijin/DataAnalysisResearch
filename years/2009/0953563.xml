<AbstractNarration>High-throughput sequencing is transforming the field of population genomics. The cost of obtaining an individual's genome via sequencing has dropped several orders of magnitude during the past decade, and may reach the so-called $1,000 genome target within the next few years. Now much attention has shifted to sequencing on a population scale. Large amount of population sequencing data has already been generated. Therefore, there is an urgent need for the development of new computational methods that work with noisy, high-throughput sequencing data to provide efficient and accurate analysis for important population genomics problems.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merits of the work include the development of accurate computational methods that are capable of analyzing large-scale high-throughput sequencing data for several population genomics problems. Problems of interest include inferring genotypes, correcting sequencing errors and detecting meiotic recombination, as well as searching for disease-causing rare gene variants and other emerging applications of high-throughput sequencing. A key difference between the proposed research and many existing methods is that the proposed approaches are explicitly designed for processing large amount of high-throughput sequencing data.  One particular focus is on applying combinatorial optimization techniques such as integer linear programming, which is not well-known to biologists. Probabilistic models will also be used and integrated with optimization approaches to provide efficient and accurate solutions. The expected project outcome includes efficient algorithms for the above population genomics problems, related open-source software tools, and rigorous methodologies for both theoretical and empirical evaluation of the algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part of the contribution of this work to computer science is that the study of algorithms for handling short sequencing reads may contribute to the research of string matching algorithms, a problem of general interests in computer science. Noisy sequencing data motivates naturally approximate string matching and may lead to new string-based problem formulations.  Due to the need of efficiency, algorithmic string processing techniques may play an important role in the proposed research. Other aspects of the proposed work are related to phylogenetic problems, which have been actively studied in computer science. Theoretical study on these algorithmic problems will be conducted to obtain rigorous results that may be of interest to computer science research community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the project include interdisciplinary collaboration and training, as well as educational impacts. The developed software tools will be made available freely to the multi-disciplinary research community, and are expected to enable novel biological applications of high-throughput sequencing. The PI will develop an interdisciplinary undergraduate and graduate educational curriculum at University of Connecticut. The proposed educational and outreach activities include reaching out to students with various backgrounds, and training of future researchers with unique interdisciplinary skills.</AbstractNarration>

Now large amount of DNA  sequence data is available for many organisms. Processing sequence data of large size needs effective computational tools. The main objective of this project is developing efficient algorithms and practical software tools for analyzing large scale DNA sequence data in a population. The main outcomes of the project include the development of several computational methods and software tools for sequence data analysis. In the following, we focus on one aspect of the project: finding genomic deletions from sequence data.</p> <p>Deletion is a segment of DNA that is not carried (i.e. deleted) by some individuals of the population, while most other individuals have it. Therefore the reference genome (the consensus genome of the whole species) does not have the deletion. Genomic deletion is one important source of genetic variations. Genetic variations largely determine important phenotypic traits. In particular, deletions may be associated with complex diseases. Therefore, finding what deletions an individual carry is an important problem. With the fast development of sequencing technologies, we expect sequence data will be the main data source for mapping deletions in a population.</p> <p>We now consider the problem of finding the deletions, given the reference genome and sequence reads from some organisms with the deletion. Here, reads refer to short segments of DNA that are generated from the sequencing machines. Reads can usually be positioned (called mapped) on a given reference genome with some confidence. The main challenge of this problem is that the sequence reads are often noisy (e.g. contain errors or the reads are hard to be positioned). The key findings of our research is that different types of mapped reads provide some information about the deletion. For example, the so-called split reads are those reads overlapping with the deletion. Thus, when a split read is mapped on the reference, it shows as two segments (instead as a whole segment as many other reads would be mapped to). The presence of splits reads provide some evidence about the presence of the deletion. There are also other type of information contained in the sequence data about the deletion. The main idea of our work is calling the deletions by combining these different sources of information. Simulations show that our method (called SVseq) outperforms existing methods in the accuracy of the called deletions. This work is published in Bioinformatics in 2011.</p> <p>Since the development of SVseq, we have worked on several related problems. One problem is calling the genotypes of the deletions in a population. Recall that diploid organisms (such as human) have two slightly different copies for each chromosome. Consider one deletion. A diploid individual may have no deletions in either chromosome copies, have deletion on only one copy or both copies have deletions. This is called genotypes where we use 0, 1 and 2 to refer to the three possible genotypes. The problem here is determining the genotype of a deletion given the sequence data. The main challenge of this problem, is again the noise contained in the sequence data. In a paper we published in PLoS One (Chu, Zhang and Wu, 2014), we developed a method called GINDEL. The main idea of GINDEL is viewing the problem of determining the genotype as a classification problem in machine learning. Here, we first extract pieces of information (called features) from the sequence reads that are relevant to the deletion. We use features such as split reads. These features are then quantified. Then each genotype of an individual corresponds to a point in a multi-dimensional space, where there is an axis for each feature. As shown in the figure, a nice property of the genotypes (points) of multiple individuals in a population cluster to three visible parts, each corresponding to a genotype. We use machine learning to train a model and are able to call deletion genotypes accurately and efficiently.</p> <p>Regarding to the broader impacts, we have made all the research results (paper and software tools) publicly available. We have made presentations in conferences. This project supports two PhD students, who have finished their degree programs during the period of this project.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/12/2017<br>      Modified by: Yufeng&nbsp;Wu</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/0953563/0953563_10014270_1502762677831_DeletionCall--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/0953563/0953563_10014270_1502762677831_DeletionCall--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Finding deletions with sequence data"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/0953563/0953563_10014270_1502762677831_DeletionCall--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Finding deletions with sequence data"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Reference sequence: consensus genome of the population.
