<AbstractNarration>"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5)" &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objective: The objective of this research is to enable development of nanopatterned conformal oxides for device applications. The approach is to acquire a processing module comprised of complementary inductively-coupled plasma (ICP) etch and atomic-layer deposition (ALD) tools for the Brown Microelectronics Central User Facility. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This equipment cluster will enable the fabrication of nanopatterned conformal oxides for cutting-edge applications in electronic, fluidic, photonic, and implantable devices. Specifically, the proposed equipment will help researchers: (1) deposit high-?Û dielectrics for nanoelectronic devices; (2) control the dimensions and surface chemistry of nanofluidic channels; (3) pattern and protect optically active materials, including luminescent rare-earth oxides, for light emitters and detectors; and (4) encapsulate implants with bio-compatible coatings that prevent infection and promote tissue growth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: Located in a central user facility with ongoing technical and administrative support, this equipment will constitute a linchpin of the Brown University infrastructure for research training in nanoscale science and engineering for years to come. Housed in a publicly accessible cleanroom, this equipment will be made available to researchers from many university departments, including Engineering, Physics, Chemistry, Biology and Medicine, as well as outside users from local industry and academic institutions via the Materials Research Facilities Network. Furthermore, this program will be enriched by established connections with outreach through the NSF sponsored GK-12 ¡§Physical Processes in the Environment¡¨ program in the Providence Public School system and the collaborative REU program offered by the Brown Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) and the Leadership Alliance.</AbstractNarration>
