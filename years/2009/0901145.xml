<AbstractNarration>Hochster proposes to continue investigating several long standing questions in the theory of (primarily local) Noetherian rings and to explore the relationship of these questions with the explosively developing theory of tight closure, which was introduced by Hochster and Huneke. One main thrust is to explore several notions of closure in rings that do not contain a field, such as finitely generated algebras over the integers, with the hope of extending tight closure theory to such rings, thereby solving many open questions. Approaches to the problem of proving existence of big Cohen-Macaulay modules in mixed characteristic are also given.  A new theory of quasi-length and content related to certain local cohomology modules will be studied. This theory has raised some difficult, central problems, and is one of several methods proposed to attack the long standing and important question of whether regular rings are direct summands of their module-finite extensions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research deals with commutative rings, which are &lt;br/&gt;abstract systems in which one has what might be thought of as artificial numbers. One can add, subtract, and multiply these artificial numbers:  call them ring elements. The integers and real numbers are examples, but there are many other examples, including rings that contain only finitely many elements. In one example, one has only 0 and 1, and 1+1 = 0 (like the properties of even and odd integers:  odd + odd =even).  In studying systems of many equations in many unknowns, one can force the equations to hold in an abstract ring.  The study of the properties of this ring gives information about the solutions. One can also study instead a sort of graph of the solutions, that exists in a high dimensional space.  It is of great benefit to go back and forth between these algebraic and geometric points of view.  A third method, which will be used frequently in the proposed research, is to study solutions  that are somewhat like integers (but more general), but to do so while ignoring multiples of a prime number: elements are considered equivalent if they differ by a multiple of this prime.  Doing this  for many different prime numbers, possibly all prime numbers, can provide a huge amount of information about the solutions of the equations.  The proposed research deals with a systematic method, called tight closure, for using this idea, as well as its extensions into new contexts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ If one has a system of equations, one may study the solution set as a geometric object or create an abstract algebraic system called a commutative ring in which the equations are forced to have a solution.  The algebraic properties of this ring and the geometric properties of the solution set are intertwined.  Working in this generality, one can get information about solutions over the complex numbers by studying instead solutions in other rings, which can include finite rings.  This idea has been refined into a systematic technique called tight closure theory.  During the interval of the grant, in collaboration with graduate students, postdoctoral faculty, and others, the principal investigator developed a new version of this theory which can be studied locally and so extends to broader geometric contexts.  Methods of extending the theory to study problems over the integers and related rings were developed.    A conjecture about the behavior of polynomials was resolved in a large number of cases, and this led to the study of many new questions.  Unexpectedly, if one has a bound on the number of polynomials and their degrees, but no bound on the number of variables involved, one can still find a relatively small number of polynomials with very good behavior (called a regular sequence) such that the original polynomials are all expressible in terms of the regular sequence. Many other related problems were studied, including results comparing the solution of certain problems with analytic functions (roughy meaning that the graphs are very smooth) with the solution when the functions are only required to be continuous (the graphs have no breaks, but are not necessarily as smooth).  An innovative approach was developed that applies to several long standing conjectures.  It uses a new notion:  lim Cohen-Macaulay sequences.  When two sets defined by algebraic equations meet at a point, an intersection multiplicity can be assigned to that point.  Lim Cohen-Macaulay sequences give information about the behavior of these intersection multiplicities, and can also be used to study other long open questions  Broader impact: intellectual merit. A great deal of progress was made in modifying and extending tight closure theory, in comparing the behavior of analytic and continuous functions, on the behavior of small families of polynomials, on the existence and behavior of lim Cohen-Macaulay sequences, and on several related problems. The ideas introduced in this work will have a substantial effect on the field. The research of the eight Ph.D. students and six postdoctoral faculty mentored by the principal investigator is also of substantial importance.  Broader impact: education. Eight PhD students completed dissertations under the principal inverstigator's supervision during the interval of this grant, and there are three more current PhD students. Six postdoctoral researchers were mentored.  Three undergraduates wrote research papers in this area under the principal investogator's supervision, and all three are now in graduate school working towards PhD.
