<AbstractNarration>This award funds a graduate student mentoring program that is part of the Economics Pipeline Program, which works to broaden participation in the economics profession.  The mentoring program helps students from under represented groups navigate a number of critical stages in their development as scientists as they go from the early stages of graduate study through completing dissertation research and starting their first post doctoral position.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students meet regularly with their program mentors at a variety of professional conferences around the country.  An annual workshop brings all participants together for research presentations; this workshop is held in conjunction with a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site aimed at undergraduate students who are interested in careers in social and economic science.  The graduate students therefore both benefit from working with their own mentors and are able to serve as mentors in turn to younger students.</AbstractNarration>

For participants in their first year of graduate study, mentors provide advice on the academic process, suggest strategies to prepare for comprehensive and field exams, remind students of the "joys" of economics that await on the other side of the core examination, and help identify summer research opportunities. Once the comprehensive and field exams have been completed, a key role for mentors is to talk to the student about their research interests and to assist the student in developing relationships with faculty who might serve on a thesis committee.
