<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award is to study a new spectroscopic sensing technique. The planned approach takes advantage of the coherent laser radiation and combines the advantages of direct laser absorption spectroscopy with a precision and noise suppression capability that are characteristic to indirect, zero-baseline spectroscopic sensing methods. The research will include theoretical investigations of the molecular dispersion, spectroscopic modeling, studies of optimum detection techniques, and research on mid-IR lasers optimized for dispersion spectroscopy. To overcome the limitations of existing laser absorption spectroscopy techniques, a novel approach based on the measurement of dispersion will be investigated. Included in the investigation are fundamental physics and the solution of engineering problems in the construction of new EC-QC lasers. Sensitive and versatile chemical detection technology and new implementations in variety of field applications including distributed atmospheric sensor networks, and remote chemical detection are the expected outcome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research is expected to lead to development of highly sensitive gas and chemical sensors capable of pptv-level resolution. The application of the proposed technology to trace-gas detection will result in more sensitive, smaller and more versatile sensors. New applications including large area spectroscopic sensor networks for atmospheric monitoring, remote chemical sensing in defense and security, or hand-held/wearable gas exposure monitoring will benefit from the proposed research.  How the interdisciplinary nature of the project would provide a spectrum of education and training opportunities integrated with the research goals is presented.</AbstractNarration>
