<AbstractNarration>The major objective of this research effort is to develop a transformative approach to understand the degradation mechanism and assess the long-term durability of the FRP-to-concrete interface. This approach consists of a) quantitatively characterizing the kinetics of environment-assisted subcritical debond growth along the FRP-to-concrete interface, and b) development of a mechanism-based degradation model for the FRP-to-concrete interface in aggressive environments. The proposed subcritical debond testing closely simulates the failure occurring during the service-life of the FRP-to-concrete interface, allows interaction with environmental species during testing, and reduces ambiguity associated with fracture energy due to competitive effects of concrete curing, long-term concrete strength gaining, epoxy creep, and epoxy curing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will have immediate effects on research and applications of FRP materials in concrete infrastructure by providing a new avenue to study and account for the long-term durability of FRP strengthened structures. The PIs propose an aggressive educational plan designed to be complementary to the research activities with focus on recruiting a diverse group of traditionally underrepresented (female, rural, minority and/or socio-economically disadvantaged) students to participate in the proposed activities. A series of teaching modules will be developed based on the proposed research endeavor and blended into the curriculum of the PI's department. A workshop based on this study will be held for minority high school students from economically stagnant areas in Alabama through the Engineering Academy program. Underrepresented high school students and undergraduate students will have opportunities to participate in this project. Seminars based on this study will be given to science and engineering faculty from historically black colleges and universities. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ External bonding of fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) composites is has emerged as a viable technique to retrofit/repair deteriorated civil infrastructure. However,  its long-term durability as well as damage and failure mechanisms  in aggressive environments is still an unresolved issue and becomes a major barrier to its  wide-acceptance in civil infrastructure.  This study is designed to address the long-term durability issues of this important technique.  A new testing method, environment-assisted subcritical debonding testing, was adopted to understand and characterize the degradation mechanism and assess the long-term durability of the FRP-to-concrete interface. In this new testing method, the debonding between the epoxy and concrete is controlled to grow slowly so that the synergistic effect of mechanical and environmental loads can be quantitatively characterized.     This study confirms that environment-assisted subcritical debonding of the epoxy-concrete interface is not only existing, but also significant in aggressive environments. It also exhibits a different failure mode from that observed in commonly used critical failure testing methods. The current FRP research community seems unaware of the significant role of the environment-assisted subcritical debond growth along the epoxy-concrete interface, which could be a dominant mechanism for the failure of a FRP-to-concrete joint in service loads and aggressive environments. The current ACI design guideline also totally ignores the existence of the subcritical crack growth in FRP-to-concrete joints.  This study shows that environmental debonding testing provides a new tool to study the long-term durability of the FRP-to-concrete bonded interface under the synergistic effect of mechanical and environmental loading. Based on this testing, a service-life prediction model has been established to evaluate the service life of the epoxy-concrete interface in aggressive environment, which is unavailable up to now.  This study also raises the significant roles of the swelling of the epoxy and the surface chemistry of the concrete on the durability of the epoxy-concrete interface. Existing durability studies fails to consider these two factors. Understanding the roles of these two factors can help us to choose the right epoxy and treat the concrete surface to achieve optimal durability of the epoxy-concrete interface.
