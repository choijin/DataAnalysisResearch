<AbstractNarration>The READY, SET, TRANSFER (RST) project is a collaboration of three independently accredited colleges where the strengths of each college are leveraged to create Science and Mathematics Academies on each campus. The Academies serve students who are majoring in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). The Academy recruits and supports students who are just beginning their scientific academic careers and have tested into developmental mathematics. RST works to retain students throughout their transition into college-level courses by providing faculty mentors, developmental math and science integrated courses, peer mentors, study skills courses, and Academy workshops and events.&lt;br/&gt;As students progress through their core courses in mathematics or science disciplines,&lt;br/&gt;Academy interventions help students persist and achieve academic excellence in their STEM major classes. Strategies include the continuation of faculty mentoring, providing opportunities for students to serve as peer mentors, performance based rewards, research based experiences integrated throughout introductory science and mathematics sequences, and an introduction to research course.</AbstractNarration>
