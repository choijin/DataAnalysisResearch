<AbstractNarration>This award allows the Illinois Institute of Technology to continue a program of research undertaken with Argonne National Lab to identify natural or constructed photoemissive materials that can produce bright electron beams of lower intrinsic (thermal) emittance than is currently achievable. Lowering the emittance of bright electron beams is a goal in the field of accelerator physics for the realization of next generation light sources and linear colliders. Investigation of samples of varying materials and surface preparations will be carried out for the purpose of determining optimal photocathode characteristics for the production of low emittance beams. This research should also lead to an evaluation of potential surface preparation techniques, such as thin film or atomic layer deposition, for use in control of emission properties. Another goal of the research is to aid in design optimization of the Angle Resolved Photoemission Spectrometer (ARPES), which is being developed for intrinsic emission measurements at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL). This research has been designated by the Physics Division as Potentially Transformative Research. It is challenging in nature yet the results could have major worldwide effects on accelerator design. Broader impacts include education and impacts on other fields of research. The research proposed would also provide opportunities for students at Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) to become involved with a research effort at Argonne National Laboratory, while allowing them to work on contributions to the project in an IIT laboratory. The application oriented nature of this research can help cross the boundary between basic research and technological advance. Better light sources will advance research in medicine, geology, environmental science, and the biological, chemical and physical sciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Advanced Accelerator Physics Research on Electron Beam Sources    Particle accelerators are major tools for research and discovery.   Accelerator-based light sources, for example, advance research in medicine, geology, environmental science, biology, chemistry, physics, and the materials sciences.  The properties of the electron beams that generate the light are critical to the experiments using light from these beams.  The beam quality not only depends on the total number of particles, but also on the particle density.  Reducing the angular excursions of beam particles with respect to the direction of transport decreases the transverse beam emittance.  The number of electrons produced and their emittance are important properties of an electron source.  When it is desirable to have a beam of very short bursts of electrons, photocathodes are the type of electron source used.  The electrons are emitted via the photoelectric effect when a laser impinges on the surface of the cathode.  The number of electrons produced compared to the number of incident photons is called the quantum efficiency of the cathode.   The goal of this research project was to determine if the emittance of a photocathode beam could be reduced while maintaining the quantum efficiency by engineering the electronic properties of the photocathode material.  Special multilayer MgO/Ag/MgO photoemitting surfaces were fabricated using pulsed laser deposition. They were made to test a theoretical prediction that the properties of the emitted electrons depend on the thickness of the flanking MgO layers of the three layer structure.   The very thin MgO layers modify the momentum versus energy dependence of the electrons at the surface.  Several samples of differing layer thickness were made, going from about 1 to 4 atomic layers of MgO on 4 atomic layers of silver.  It was found that the quantum efficiency and work function of these samples had a systematic dependence on the thickness of MgO, consistent with the dependence predicted theoretically.  The surface energy band structure of one of the samples compared to bare silver was also measured, and also consistent with expectations.  These results are proof that photocathode performance may be improved through detailed material design and precision fabrication.  They  encourage continued research in this area.
