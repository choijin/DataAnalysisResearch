<AbstractNarration>Synapses are specialized cell junctions that link neurons into functional networks, thereby providing the basis of all integrative neural signaling.  Synaptic transmission involves release of neurotransmitter from presynaptic neuron terminals and capture by specific postsynaptic receptors that transit ions to alter the target cell's excitability.  Nicotinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptors (nAChRs) bind ACh to mediate excitatory synaptic transmission in autonomic ganglia controlling homeostasis and modulating the output of brain circuits that control coordinated movement and behaviors underlying pleasure and reward.  Despite their broad relevance, the molecular mechanisms regulating function and development of nicotinic synapses remain poorly understood.  This project will explore changes triggered by a neuropeptide (PACAP) released from the pituitary at nicotinic synapses on autonomic ciliary ganglion (CG) neurons. Recent findings indicate that PACAP rapidly regulates synapses on CG neurons in culture. Electrophysiological, imaging, and biochemical approaches will be used to identify altered synaptic properties and determine the protein-protein interactions that mediate this regulation.  Since PACAP levels are developmentally regulated, and exogenous PACAP enhances neuronal survival in an activity dependent fashion, the possibility that PACAP persistently influences synapse formation and function will also be explored.  It is expected that PACAP-triggered signaling will be critical both for building nicotinic synapses and controlling their function.  Lastly, outreach programs administered through the University of Toledo will be used to train visiting undergraduates, high school students, and high school teachers.  Thus, this project will further elucidate molecular mechanisms relevant to homeostatic regulation, behavior, and development while simultaneously fostering the scientific literacy and training of underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The vertebrate nervous system controls life processes ranging from simple behaviors to cognition.  To accomplish these tasks the nervous system relies on coordinated neuronal interactions at their sites of communication &ndash; chemical synapses.  Here, a neurotransmitter such as acetylcholine (ACh) is released by impulses in the presynaptic neuron and captured by ionotropic (nicotinic) ACh receptors (nAChRs) on the postsynaptic neuron.  The resulting flow of ions across the neuron membrane generates an excitatory postsynaptic response that, depending on its strength, can produce a postsynaptic impulse.  Synapses where transmission is mediated and modulated by nAChRs are termed nicotinic synapses and they control bodily homeostasis and behaviors associated with coordinated movement, pleasure and reward.  Despite their relevance, cellular mechanisms regulating the plasticity of nicotinic synapses remained poorly understood.  The role of activity has provided a major conceptual framework for understanding synaptic plasticity, while other factors such as the availability of neurotrophic agents and neuropeptides have been given much less consideration.  In previous studies we found that an endogenous neuropeptide, pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP) potently influences the function of nicotinic synapses.  In this project we successfully addressed scientific goals by showing how PACAP recruits high-affinity receptors, intracellular effectors, and subsequently alters gene expression to coordinately regulate the function and form of nicotinic synapses.  By virtue of this NSF supported research we published four full-length research papers, one book chapter, six international meeting abstracts, and gave five seminar presentations at universities across the country.  Two additional full-length manuscripts are in preparation.  One outcome of the work that points to its fundamental significance is that while PACAP exerts persistent plasticity at nicotinic synapses it does so in an activity-independent fashion.  Thus the dissemination of our work has had considerable scientific impact because it underscores the importance of neuropeptides in controlling synaptic plasticity.  Another major goal of the project was to train participants at multiple levels of expertise and background using innovative neuroscience techniques and provide skills in experimental design, data interpretation, and critical thinking.   As with the scientific goals, we were successful in addressing these broader impact goals by advancing the scientific education of underrepresented groups, including women and minorities, at undergraduate and graduate training levels.
