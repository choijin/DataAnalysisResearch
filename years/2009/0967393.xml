<AbstractNarration>This project has two primary goals.  The first is to solve the problem of the unitary dual: to describe the irreducible unitary representations of real reductive Lie groups. The primary tool is an algorithm to compute the unitary dual of any given group, which we are implementing inside the "atlas" software. We plan to use this information to prove results about the unitary dual, beginning with the unitarity of Arthur's unipotent representations. The second primary goal is to make information about representation theory of real groups accessible to non-specialists, via the software, a web site, public workshops, and other means. The atlas software is freely available on the atlas web site, and will continue to be maintained there indefinitely.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The idea of using symmetry to study problems in mathematics and science dates back to Fourier's work on heat nearly two hundred years ago. In the hands of Hermann Weyl, Eugene Wigner, and Andre Weil, symmetry has come to play a central role in quantum mechanics and in number theory. Lie groups, named after the Norwegian mathematician Sophus Lie, are the mathematical objects underlying symmetry.  Representation theory studies all of the ways a given symmetry, or Lie group, can manifest itself. The problem of understanding all "unitary" representations (in which the symmetry operations preserve lengths) is one of the most important unsolved problems in the subject, and has potential applications in many areas; for example, it is an abstract version of the question, "what quantum mechanical systems can admit a certain kind of symmetry?"</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project is a part of the larger "Atlas of Lie Groups" project, a large collaborative effort across multiple institutions to understand the representations of real and complex semisimple Lie groups. Roughly speaking, these are the basic building blocks of symmetries of infinite-dimensional smooth objects.  This particular subproject of the larger Atlas project  has been devoted to developing an understanding of W-graphs. These are finite, discrete structures that carry a great deal of basic information about the corresponding Lie group representations and how they are linked together.   One of our main goals has been to classify or construct all of the W-graphs that can occur for each semisimple Lie group. While this is now complete in many cases, a full solution is still lacking. One of the main accomplishments is that we now know that there can only be finitely many strongly connected W-graphs associated to any one Lie group, so to a large extent, the classification problem can now be seen as a finite (but still difficult) problem.  One of the benefits of these results is that we have demonstrated that combinatorial and computational methods can play a significant role in explaining the structure and classification of Lie group representations.  Along the way we were able to involve a graduate student in the research associated to this subproject; we expect him to complete his dissertation by next Spring.
