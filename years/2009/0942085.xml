<AbstractNarration>Interdisciplinary(99) WIKIed Biology provides a model of instruction utilizing Web 2.0 technologies to deepen and enhance teaching and learning in STEM disciplines, with the specific focus on learning biological concepts. The project supports the creation and implementation of two concurrent upper level undergraduate courses, one for computing students and one for biology students. Using the wave of momentum in Web 2.0 as a more dynamic, participatory and collaborative medium, computer science and information systems students research and identify the most feasible and sustainable of the current technologies for use in the courses. Computing students gain experience in practicing implementation and management of computing concepts, whereas biology students gain experience using Web 2.0 technologies to broaden and deepen their understanding of biological concepts. The model introduces new teaching strategies that incorporate ways students engage information and communication technologies and identifies best practices related to implementing Web 2.0 technologies into the teaching and learning process. The project also encourages interdisciplinary active learning experiences for students, which incorporate current information on how students acquire information and use web-based communication technologies. Information gained from the project expands knowledge in the field of student learning and pedagogical practices using technology.</AbstractNarration>

The intellectual merit of this project lies in the formulation of a model that introduces new teaching strategies through enhanced active learning experiences for students that incorporate current ways in which students acquire information and use web based communication technologies. This project addressed a significant gap in our understanding of how Web 2.0 can be used to support the teaching-learning process. Thus far, the model is used in an upper level elective for biology majors and in a mastersÆ course for pre-service and in-service science teachers. It has been disseminated through peer reviewed publications and presentations at local, regional, and national conferences.  The broader impacts of this project include introducing a form of instruction that improves studentsÆ ability to discriminate among sources of information, allows them to cover subject matter in depth, develop skills of self-monitoring and reflection, and become proficient in current advances in technology and communication.  This project presents a paradigm shift in education and moves students toward being producers of information that support the learning process, rather than passive consumers.
