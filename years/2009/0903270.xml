<AbstractNarration>In order to meet the increasing demand in Virginia for a workforce skilled in using geospatial technologies, three Virginia Community Colleges (Virginia Western Community College, Tidewater Community College, and John Tyler Community College), with the support of the Virginia Community College System (VCCS) in partnership with the Virginia Geospatial Extension Program (VGEP) and the Virginia Space Grant Consortium (VSGC), are creating model academic pathways at community colleges and providing faculty professional development to spread the use of geospatial technology across Virginia. The GTEVCC project team is building on a planning project that resulted in the formation of this partnership with each partner bringing resources and strengths to the project. The GTEVCC project is establishing sustainable academic pathways in geospatial technology at three VCCS colleges to provide Virginia employers with a larger pool of skilled geospatial technicians. These pathways serve as models for other community colleges. The GTEVCC project is taking an interdisciplinary approach to geospatial technology and applications of technology. Educational materials are being created and professional development and mentoring is being provided for faculty. The GTEVCC project team is partnering with the ATE National GeoTech Center (NGTC) to leverage exemplary geospatial educational materials and best practices in needs assessments, career awareness and professional development.</AbstractNarration>
