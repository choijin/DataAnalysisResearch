<AbstractNarration>The aerosol indirect radiative forcing (IRF), largely determined by the concentrations of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), is a major source of uncertainty in assessing climate change. Recent global aerosol modeling studies show that tropospheric CCN abundance and aerosol IRF are sensitive to the choice of nucleation mechanism, and emphasized the critical importance of further improvement of the representation of aerosol nucleation and growth processes in global models. This project seeks to advance the understanding and reduce uncertainties of atmospheric particle formation and growth processes via comprehensive data analyses, detailed case studies, sub-grid nucleation modeling and parameterizations, global aerosol modeling, and comparisons of model results with measurements. In order to achieve these project goals, the following objectives/research tasks have been identified:&lt;br/&gt;(1) In-depth case studies and analyses of nucleation observations to resolve controversies over the relative importance of ion-mediated nucleation (IMN) and neutral/homogeneous nucleation in boreal forests. An IMN model will be further assessed and improved through extended case studies. (2) Investigate the linear or square dependences of nucleation rates derived from field measurements on the sulfuric acid vapor concentrations, and ascertain whether such dependences imply new nucleation mechanisms. (3) Analyze extensive datasets of particle properties observed around the globe, and use them to assess global aerosol simulations, with the primary focus on the ability of different nucleation mechanisms to capture the spatial and temporal variations of tropospheric particle number concentrations. (4) Study particle formation and growth in sub-grid anthropogenic SO2 plumes, in order to improve the representation of the plume-scale processes in global aerosol models, and to reduce uncertainties in simulated CCN concentrations.(5) Apply an improved global aerosol model for investigating sources of CCN in different tropospheric regions and their seasonal variations. Predicted CCN concentrations will be compared with measurements and possible uncertainties will be assessed and addressed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide educational opportunities and research training for two graduate students and a short-term visiting student or scholar. Two post-graduate researchers will be given specialized experiences to broaden their knowledge and provide opportunities for the future employment. This project will also provide research experience and training for SUNY Albany undergraduate students who are interested in aerosol and atmospheric research. This project will contribute to on-going efforts to quantify the impacts of aerosols on the Earth's climate. It will provide support for updated nucleation rate look-up tables that have been made available to the scientific community and for the improvement of online nucleation rate calculators, which can be used for both research and educational purposes. Parameterizations of sub-grid sulfate particle formation derived within this project will be made available to other investigators working on regional and global aerosol modeling.</AbstractNarration>
