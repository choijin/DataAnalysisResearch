<AbstractNarration>This project is a joint experimental and theoretical research program addressing important questions in the areas of high-resolution molecular spectroscopy and collision dynamics. The spectroscopic studies involve measurements of the ro-vibrational energy levels of triplet states of NaCs, and other heteronuclear alkali molecules, and the investigation of fine and hyperfine structure of these levels. The goal is to map out potential energy curves, study spin-orbit and nonadiabatic coupling between states, and to use the pattern of energy levels, particularly the level-by-level changes in the fine and hyperfine structure, to infer fundamental molecular interactions. By comparing data with theoretical models, we have already identified many important dynamical effects. The NaK molecule, in particular, exhibits a fortunate combination of properties that make it an intriguing "laboratory" for the study of molecular hyperfine structure. For example, our recent observations have revealed that different electronic states (and even different ro-vibrational levels within the same state) exhibit several different angular momentum coupling schemes, including both pure and intermediate cases. These level-to-level variations in the fine and hyperfine structure contain information about subtle changes in the electronic wave functions as a function of internuclear separation. Experimental and theoretical techniques have been developed to extract this information. Further high-resolution studies will be done to probe vibrational levels closer to the dissociation limit; data in this range will provide information about long range interactions and will lead to a better understanding of the delicate changes in the electronic wave function as the system makes the transition from the separated atom to the molecular regime. We will also study NaCs, which is of interest for cooling and trapping and for proposed quantum computing schemes. The large spin-orbit interactions in this molecule, leading to strong perturbations and avoided crossings, provide interesting new challenges for both experiment and theory. Our program also studies a variety of collision processes including excitation transfer, transfer of molecular orientation, and velocity changes in collisions that change atomic hyperfine level or molecular rovibrational level. Such studies will provide stringent tests of atomic and molecular collision theory.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts are that spectroscopic studies of heteronuclear molecules such as NaK and NaCs are of wide interest. Ultracold heteronuclear alkali diatomics, which have permanent dipole moments, can in principle be oriented in an optical lattice, suggesting applications in quantum computing schemes. Na-Cs and Rb-Cs mixtures are being used in mixed species atom traps, and knowledge of the molecular electronic states is of particular interest for understanding photoassociation spectra. Improved understanding of atomic and molecular collision dynamics will lead to progress in modeling a wide range of environments, from high temperature plasmas to the ultracold regime. The work will contribute to the education of many students. Three or four graduate students will write Ph.D. dissertations based on the projects described in this proposal. At least six undergraduate students will work with the co-PIs during the summers through Lehigh University's REU program. Over the past 25 years, 60 undergraduate students have worked with the co-PIs on various research projects. More than half of these students are female and six belong to underrepresented minority groups; that pattern is likely to continue. The co-PIs will continue to send both graduate and undergraduate students to the APS DAMOP and other national meetings.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our  research involves the study of heteronuclear alkali diatomic molecules, particularly sodium-potassium (NaK) and sodium-cesium (NaCs).  Heteronuclear alkali molecules are of current interest because mixed species ultracold atom traps have now been developed, and experiments to cool and trap polar molecules are underway.  Researchers need accurate data on molecular potentials, permanent and transition dipole moment functions, hyperfine structure, collision cross sections and other properties.  Theorists also need accurate experimental data to test the validity of their models.  In the period funded by this grant, our research efforts at Lehigh University have focused on two main projects: spectroscopy of NaCs, and studies of the transfer of population and orientation in NaK caused by collisions with helium, argon, or potassium atoms.  We studied several excited electronic states of the NaCs molecule using two lasers in a pump/probe scheme.  Figure 1 shows fluorescence from one such excited electronic state (labeled 5 triplet Pi) to a dissociating lower triplet state.  The oscillations in the bound-free spectra are a direct reflection of the quantum mechanical radial wavefunction of the molecule and provide a striking demonstration of the wave nature of matter.  We have used such fluorescence to map out the upper and lower triplet states and to determine the transition dipole moment function.  We have also studied another excited state (labeled 7 singlet Sigma) that interacts with the 5 triplet Pi state; the coupling of these two states leads to interesting quantum inference effects.  Our second major project involved the study of collision-induced transitions among different molecular rotational levels J of the same vibrational state v.  We measured rate coefficients for transfer of population between these levels using fluorescence detection.  For collisions of argon with NaK, we observed a strong propensity for transitions with Delta J = even.  For collisions with helium we discovered that the Delta J = even propensity rule is even more severe than for argon, but we observed no such propensity for collisions with alkali atoms.  In other measurements for NaCs collisions with argon and helium, we did not observe a propensity for Delta J = even transitions with argon, but did for helium.  It is well known that transitions with Delta J = odd are forbidden in homonuclear molecules by a strict selection rule.  However, a simple argument based on the idea that NaK is "more homonuclear" than NaCs cannot explain our results, since different perturbers yield qualitatively different results for the same molecule.    We also observed collisional lines in double resonance polarization spectra.  Polarization signals require a net orientation (non-zero average value of the M quantum number), which is created in the state directly populated by a circularly polarized pump laser.  For a collisional line to appear in a polarization spectrum, the collision must not only transfer population to a nearby level, but must also preserve at least some of the initial orientation.  Our work has shown that potassium atom J-changing collisions tend to destroy almost all of the initial orientation, while argon atom collisions preserve 33 &ndash; 75% of the initial orientation.  We also carried out extensive theoretical calculations modeling rotationally inelastic collisions of helium with NaK.  We performed large scale electronic structure calculations of a potential energy surface, including the dependence on the NaK bond length.  Using this surface, we completed coupled channel scattering calculations with the Arthurs and Dalgarno formalism.  The calculations were performed on the high performance Stampede cluster at the Texas Advanced Computer Center (TACC) in Austin, which is supported by NSF XSEDE.  These calculations provided total cross sections for J to J' transitions.  Figure 2 shows that the results obtained agree very well with experiment.  ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
