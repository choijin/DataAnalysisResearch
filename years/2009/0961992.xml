<AbstractNarration>Project Summary&lt;br/&gt;How do changes in the economic environment such as reductions in international trade costs or reductions in firms' innovation costs impact aggregate productivity? More generally, how do changes in economic policies that affect market size, market structure, and the costs and benefits to firms of innovative activity impact aggregate productivity? There is a very large literature, following from the work of Zvi Griliches and many others, that uses detailed firm-level data to assess the impact of changes in economic policies and changes in other aspects of the economic environment on firms' decisions to exit, export, and engage in innovative activities. Here the PI's propose to develop models of heterogeneous innovating firms in general equilibrium that not only are consistent with the micro data on firms' behavior, but also can be used to aggregate-up from firm-level decisions to obtain a deeper understanding of how aggregate productivity should be expected to respond to changes in the economic environment or economic policy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt;The PI's develop a collection of models of heterogeneous firms' decisions to exit, export, and investment in both R&amp;D by incumbent firms (which the PI's term process innovation) and in the creation of new firms or products (which they term product innovation). The PI's show that in these models one can use a simple two-step algorithm to assess the impact of a change in the costs of process innovation or a change in the marginal costs of international trade on aggregate productivity in the long run. They show analytically that, when the real interest rate approaches zero, consideration of the endogeneity of firms' decisions to exit, export, and invest in process innovation have no impact, to a first-order approximation, on our models' implications for the long-run impact in general equilibrium of a change in the costs of process innovation or a change in international trade costs on aggregate productivity. This is not to say that there are no important changes in firm dynamics that result from a change in international trade or process innovation costs. In fact, for certain assumptions about the elasticity of incumbent firms' investments in process innovation with regard to changes in the costs or benefits of such innovation, the model predicts very large changes in these firms' innovative efforts and productivity growth rates. When the PI's aggregate, however, they find that, to the extent that changes in heterogeneous firms' exit, export, and process innovation decisions do result in a change in the steady-state level of productivity for the average firm, the impact of these changes in average firm productivity must be offset by a change in the number of firms relative to the number that would arise in steady-state were the average productivity of a firm to remain unchanged. One part of the proposed research is to investigate the extent to which the analytical results can be extended to a much wider array of changes in the economic environment and, more generally, to a much wider array of policies aimed at fostering innovation by firms. In a second part the PI's will explore specifications of the model that include various types of spillovers. In a third part the PI's solve quantitative versions of our model numerically to calculate both the long run response of aggregate productivity and the transition path of the economy from one steady-state to another in those circumstance in which the analytical results do not apply.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The work will shed light on the links between innovation policies, firms' innovative investments, and the corresponding movements in aggregate productivity.</AbstractNarration>

Many OECD countries use taxes and subsidies to encourage these investments in the hope of stimulating economic growth. But what impact should we expect changes in firmsÆ investments in innovation induced by changes in innovation policies to have on economic growth at various time horizons? And what are the welfare implications of policy induced changes in firmsÆ investments in innovation?     In this project, we conducted a systematic evaluation of the modeling frameworks used to measure the impact of firmsÆ investments in innovation on economic growth in the medium and long term. We have written up the results of that evaluation in a paper titled "On the Aggregate Implications of Innovation Policies" under review at the Journal of Political Economy. In that paper, we examine the quantitative impact of policy-induced changes in innovative investment by firms on growth in aggregate productivity and output in a fairly general specification of a model of growth through firmsÆ investments in innovation that nests several commonly used models in the literature.     What determines our modelÆs quantitative implications for the impact elasticity of aggregate productivity growth with respect to the innovation intensity of the economy? We show that the implicit assumption that one makes regarding the social depreciation of innovation expenditures plays a key role in restricting the magnitude of this impact elasticity. We define the social depreciation rate of innovation expenditures as the counter- factual growth rate of aggregate productivity that would obtain if all firms in the economy invested nothing in innovation. Under our set of baseline assumptions, the impact elasticity implied by our model is bounded by the gap between the baseline growth rate of aggregate productivity to which the model is calibrated less the social depreciation rate of innovation expenditures. Thus, if one builds in the implicit assumption that there is no social depreciation of innovation expenditures (a common assumption in Neo- Schumpeterian growth models) and applies the model to study advanced economies, then our modelÆs quantitative implications for the impact elasticity of aggregate productivity growth are tightly constrained by the low baseline growth rate of aggregate productivity typically observed in these advanced economies. Under our assumptions, the elasticity of aggregate productivity and output over the medium term horizon (i.e. 20 years) with respect to policy induced changes in the innovation intensity of the economy is not very large and is not very sensitive to changes in the intertemporal knowledge spillovers that determine the long-run implications of the model and the modelÆs implications for the potential welfare gains that might be achieved from a sustained increase in innovation subsidies.     We show that, in contrast, if one makes the alternative assumption that past innovations experience even moderate social depreciation (which is consistent with a plausibly calibrated Expanding Varieties growth model), then the model can produce significantly larger medium term elasticities of aggregate productivity with respect to policy-induced changes in the innovation intensity of the economy and that these medium term elasticities are much more sensitive to changes in the assumed degree of intertemporal knowledge spillovers.     We see our results as a useful guide to researchers looking to use these models to address quantitative questions regarding the impact of policy induced changes in firmsÆ investments in innovation on macroeconomic dynamics and welfare. We do not intend this illustration to stand as a definitive theory of the social depreciation of innovation expenditures. We speculate that social depreciation of innovation expenditures is likely derived from the fact that productive knowledge...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
