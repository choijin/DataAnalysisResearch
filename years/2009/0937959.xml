<AbstractNarration>The Wisconsin Hierarchically-Redundant, Decoupled storage project (HaRD)&lt;br/&gt;investigates the next generation of storage software for hybrid Flash/disk&lt;br/&gt;storage clusters. The main objective of the project is to improve the&lt;br/&gt;performance of storage in a variety of diverse scenarios, including new&lt;br/&gt;application environments such as photo storage as found in Facebook and&lt;br/&gt;Flickr, high-end scientific processing as found in government labs, and&lt;br/&gt;large-scale data processing such as that found in Google and Microsoft. The&lt;br/&gt;HaRD project focuses on three key issues in order to improve performance of&lt;br/&gt;these important applications: client-side Flash-based RAID and file-system&lt;br/&gt;integration, server-side memory reduction and multicore scheduling of&lt;br/&gt;file-system tasks, and scheduled network transfers. HaRD pulls together these&lt;br/&gt;technologies into a synthesized whole through three targeted storage systems:&lt;br/&gt;a scalable photo server, a high-performance checkpoint subsystem, and an&lt;br/&gt;improved file system for MapReduce workloads. The impact of this project is&lt;br/&gt;significant, as HaRD helps to shape the storage software architecture of the&lt;br/&gt;next generation of cloud computing services, which are of increasing relevance&lt;br/&gt;to both industry and society at large.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
