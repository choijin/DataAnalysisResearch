<AbstractNarration>"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5)"&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is integration of optical, electrical and mechanical systems at nano- and micro-meter scale, thus enabling novel biomedical, energy harvesting and structural health monitoring devices and systems, otherwise not possible. The approach is to use a wafer aligner and bonder system for precision alignment and bonding of a diverse set of substrates including semiconductor wafers, glass substrates, metals and polymers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit lies in combining top-down and bottom-up fabrication techniques to pioneer new interfaces between semiconductor-based devices and biomolecules that can be tailored for specific applications, both as sensors and actuators / controllers of biological phenomena. The interrogation of bio-molecules and understanding of real cellular interactions require 3-D biocompatible structures, chambers and interfaces. Ranging in length scales from a few nanometers to many microns, inter and intra-cellular mechano-transduction signals play important roles in many aspects of cellular functions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed Precision Wafer Aligner / Bonder will be part of NanoFab at UT Arlington, which is an interdisciplinary resource open to scientists within and outside of the University. The Dallas-Forth Worth metropolitan region is home to more than 400 high tech institutions. As a user facility, the NanoFab will make the wafer aligner / bonder available 24/7 to these researchers and provide them training for usage. An annual workshop as well as an online discussion forum dedicated to 3-D integration will be established.</AbstractNarration>

In order to accomplish this, a proposal was made for Acquisition of Precision Wafer Aligner / Bonder for 3-D Integrated NOEMS.  The following pieces of equipment were purchased with the granted award:  EVG 520IS Wafer Bonder :  4" wafer bonding equipment, capable of various bonding such as Anodic, Fusion, Adhesive, Glass frit, Eutectic with alignment accuracy of 3-5 microns. EVG 620 Top and Backside aligner used for standard photolithography align exposure as well as pre-align for wafer bonding. Wafer size:4", Mask Size: 5"X5", Loading: Manual. Tool could be used for flood UV exposure on photo resist for resist hardening.

The sensors include accelerometers, pressure sensors, temperature sensors, and acoustic sensors. These MEMS based embedded structural sensor strips support the realization of a reliable system, capable of sensing material changes that may affect aircraft structural integrity.

The oxygenator is a gas exchange system that serves to enrich the blood with O2 and to remove CO2. The wafer aligner-bonder is used to integrate the gas channels with the blood channels with a thin gas exchange membrane. Energy Harvesting with Nanorod Carpet: Energy harvesting is defined as the conversion of ambient energy into usable electrical energy. We are building a "carpet" of piezoelectric Zinc Oxide nanorods, precisely placed vertically on substrates to convert vibrational energy into electrical. The nanorods are actuated by a proof mass that is bonded to the substrate holding the nanorods, using the wafer aligner/bonder. Prosthetic Skin: Current prosthetic limbs either provide esthetic non-functioning substitutes for the lost limb or unattractive but functional devices that provide mechanical support, motion capability for a specific task, and limited sensory feedback for control.

The skin is achieved by fabricating tactile sensors sandwiched in between a flexible substrate and superstrate through wafer-bonding.   Broader Impacts:  The wafer bonder has been incorporated into the graduate curriculum through existing courses, namely Intro to MEMS, IC Fab, and Fundamentals of Bio-Nanotechnology.
