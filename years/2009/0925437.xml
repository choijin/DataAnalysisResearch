<AbstractNarration>Objective:&lt;br/&gt; The research objective of this proposal is to explore a new conceptual approach to a nonlinear microscopy system. The approach to the system's design is aimed towards portable and fully integrated instrument that relies on tunable, non-mode-locked, and high-repetition rate (&gt;1GHz) laser sources. The instrument utilizes a coherent vibrational spectroscopy technique to detect specific molecular groups/subgroups within a complex chemical or a biological media. The instrument's high detection sensitivity, compactness, and robustness promise wider applications that can range from chemical and biological research to weapons detection.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt; The proposed research will i) bring a specific knowledge on various aspects of generation of picosecond laser pulses that are longitudinal modes free and are generated at repetition rates of 1GHz and higher, ii) explore different ways of enhancing sensitivity in detecting important molecular sub-groups via their intrinsic spectroscopic markers using nonlinear vibrational spectroscopy and microscopy techniques.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt; The proposed program is based on an efficient integration of the applied and fundamental research, education and training for undergraduate and graduate students and extensive collaboration with different University schools and Departments. The proposed plan arranges for participation of graduate and undergraduate students with majors in science and engineering fields who are interested to be involved in interdisciplinary research. The students will have an opportunity to interact with professionals within academia and industry. The successful implementation of the project will attract interest of commercial photonics/biophotonics companies interested in further development of the approach towards a commercial product.</AbstractNarration>
