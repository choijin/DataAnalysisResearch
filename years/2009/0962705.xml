<AbstractNarration>The Dynamic Gateways for International Research (DyGIR) project will provide well-tested, production-ready solution for scheduling dynamic circuits on IRNC ProNet infrastructure. DyGIR will help IRNC ProNet projects meet the requirements of the IRNC solicitation to provide production hybrid network services including dynamic circuit services and to do so in a way that is interoperable with emerging production dynamic switching network services in the US (e.g. ESnet, Internet2) and in other countries (e.g. GÉANT3, JGN2).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DyGIR will advance the state of the art of dynamic circuit networking in support of international science and engineering by developing new functionality, particularly for international exchange points - critical pieces of the overall global R&amp;E network infrastructure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the DyGIR project for the international science and engineering research community will be significant. DyGIR will increase the opportunity for scientific collaboration between distributed research efforts by enabling the predictable network performance required to effectively share large data sets. DyGIR will also enable these collaborators to schedule their use of the network, permitting the sharing of costly network resources between institutions and scientific disciplines.</AbstractNarration>
