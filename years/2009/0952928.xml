<AbstractNarration>This award in the Chemistry of Life Processes (CLP) program supports work by Professor Jonathan Wilker at Purdue University to carry out fundamental studies on the adhesive of marine mussels.  The adhesives and cements of mussels, barnacles, starfish, and limpets are familiar to anyone who has ever explored a tide pool.  Current research efforts are focused upon uncovering the chemistry central to formation and function of these fascinating biological materials.  Experiments include work with live animals, extracted proteins, and synthetic peptide models.  This collection of studies will help to provide detailed insights on the chemistry of metal-induced protein cross-linking as well as the resulting influence of these reactions upon adhesive performance.  Design of new materials is a logical outgrowth of such marine biomaterial characterization efforts.  Understanding marine mussel adhesive may provide insights useful to developing surgical adhesives, dental cements, and rustproof coatings.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Peer into a tide pool and you will get a sense of the fascinating materials being created by marine biology.  Mussels, barnacles, and oysters are examples of the creatures sticking themselves to rocks with adhesives.  Man-made adhesives, by contrast, fail when tasked with setting in such wet environments.  If we had access to wet setting materials, the tissue damage caused by sutures, staples, and screws may become a thing of the past.  In order to develop the next generation of bone cements, soft tissue glues, and dental resins, we must first learn the tricks of marine biology.     Efforts during this grant period were focused on determining how mussels make their intriguing, protein-based adhesive. Results from our laboratory indicated that the shellfish use iron to cross-link the adhesive proteins for setting the glue.  Recent and ongoing efforts include using peptide models to represent the larger proteins in order to obtain detailed, atom-by-atom insights on the nature of the cross-links formed by these shellfish.  Although not the "real" material, these peptide models can remain soluble for detailed chemical characterization, quite unlike the intractable mussel glue.  We have found that iron can induce oxidation and coupling chemistry to generate covalently bonded peptide assemblies.  These cross-linked species are now providing insights on the nature of specific chemical bonds formed by mussels in their adhesive.      We have shown that when mussels use iron in their glue these ions are bound to the unusual amino acid 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA).  Recent experiments have gained perspective on the direct function of DOPA with regard to adhesion.  "Regular," non adhesive proteins can be reacted with an enzyme to generate DOPA residues.  Bulk adhesion measurements on these modified proteins showed that bonding increased when DOPA was present.  Further experiments included showing how the animals respond to waters containing differing levels of iron.  Influences of environmental iron upon adhesive production and bonding performance are providing interesting correlations, with a possible result of more iron yielding stronger bonding.      This grant also helped us to couple resources for gaining further insights on additional marine biological materials.  Work with oyster cement showed that this animal produces an adhesive quite different from the one made by mussels.  Collaborative efforts with chiton aided our understanding of how this animal uses iron to toughen its teeth for grazing on rocks.      In terms of personnel development, all work carried out during this award was performed by female undergraduate and graduate students.  One of these graduate students is an underrepresented minority.  In addition to several publications in the scientific literature, results were disseminated to the public through various media outlets.  Our work received coverage in newspapers, magazines, radio broadcasts, web sites, and television programs including the New York Times and National Public Radio.
