<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to address relationships between foreland basins and their tectonic settings by combining detrital zircon isotope characteristics and sedimentological data. To accomplish this goal the PIs will develop a detailed geochronology and analyze Hf- and O-isotopes of detrital zircons in sandstones of the Devonian Taylor Group and the Permian-Triassic Victoria Group. These data will allow them to better determine provenance and basin fill, and to understand the nature of the now ice covered source regions in East and West Antarctica. The PIs will document possible unexposed/unknown crustal terrains in West Antarctica, investigate sub-glacial terrains of East Antarctica that were exposed to erosion during Devonian to Triassic time, and determine the evolving provenance and tectonic history of the Devonian to Triassic Gondwana basins in the central Transantarctic Mountains. Detrital zircon data will be interpreted in the context of fluvial dispersal/drainage patterns, sandstone petrology, and sequence stratigraphy. This interpretation will identify source terrains and evolving sediment provenances. Paleocurrent analysis and sequence stratigraphy will determine the timing and nature of changing tectonic conditions associated with development of the depositional basins and document the tectonic history of the Antarctic sector of Gondwana. Results from this study will answer questions about the Panthalassan margin of Gondwana, the Antarctic craton, and the Beacon depositional basin and their respective roles in global tectonics and the geologic and biotic history of Antarctica. The Beacon basin and adjacent uplands played an important role in the development and demise of Gondwanan glaciation through modification of polar climates, development of peat-forming mires, colonization of the landscape by plants, and were a migration route for Mesozoic vertebrates into Antarctica. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: &lt;br/&gt;This proposal includes support for two graduate students who will participate in the fieldwork, and also support for other students to participate in laboratory studies. Results of the research will be incorporated in classroom teaching at the undergraduate and graduate levels and will help train the next generation of field geologists. Interactions with K-12 science classes will be achieved by video/computer conferencing and satellite phone connections from Antarctica. Another outreach effort is the developing cooperation between the Byrd Polar Research Center and the Center of Science and Industry in Columbus.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The mineral zircon is highly resistant to chemical and physical destruction in geologic settings, and therefore is an invaluable asset in determining ages and geologic relationships of rock bodies.  In this project zircons from sandstones, volcanic ash deposits and granites, from the Transantarctic Mountains and several parts of West Antarctica, have been analyzed.  The principal aim of the project was to understand the evolution and tectonic setting (broadly the paleoenvironment) of the Permo-Triassic sedimentary sequence (the Gondwana sequence) in the central Transantarctic Mountains, but in the course of the project the results warranted expanding the scope somewhat to include closely related rocks from other localities in West Antarctica.              Analysis of zircons from 19 sandstones yielded results indicating, for each sandstone, the ages of the source rocks from which the zircons were derived and in some cases the maximum ages for deposition.  The source rock ages demonstrate: 1) both local and distal sources under the East Antarctic ice sheet, which helps constrain the sub-glacial geology; 2) sources under the West Antarctic ice sheet that suggest a more complex paleoenvironment than previously thought, one that was dominated by old granitic rocks until the development of the Permian magmatic arc (comprising both granites and extrusive volcanic rocks) along the Gondwana Plate margin (located on the Pacific margin of West Antarctica); 3) more extensive Carboniferous and Triassic magmatic arcs than is recorded in the few granites exposed along the Gondwana Plate margin; and 4) on a large scale the interplay in the Permo-Triassic depositional system between sediment sources and basin evolution.   Analysis of two volcanic ash deposits (tuffs) in the Ellsworth Mountains, supported by two sandstones from the same rock sequence, confirm the age of the sequence and has allowed correlations and comparisons with similar age sequences in South Africa and the Falkland Islands, and a new interpretation of the Permian Gondwana Plate margin in the Weddell Sea sector.  Analysis of two tuffs and two sandstones from the Lower Jurassic sequence (a tuff-sandstone alternation), which directly overlies the Permo-Triassic Gondwana sequence, has provided numerical age data which supports paleontological ages proposed for vertebrates recovered from those Jurassic beds, and clarified the sources for the sandstones.  Geochemical analysis of those and other tuffs in the Lower Jurassic sequence has led to a new hypothesis for the tectonic setting immediately prior to the break-up of Gondwana.              In addition to providing age information, zircon crystals can be analyzed for oxygen and lutetium/hafnium isotopes.  The former provides information on the extent of hydrothermal activity and crustal interaction affecting the granite in which the zircon crystallized, whereas the latter yields information about how long the zircon resided in the crust.  Together, these isotope data provide further characterization of the zircon grains, which aids in discriminating between potential sources.  The zircon grains in the sandstones and tuffs can be compared with zircons from potential source granites along the West Antarctic margin, and thus the evolution of the linked source regions and sedimentary basin deposits developed.              This is the first project that has examined, on a regional scale, zircons from the Permo-Triassic Gondwana sequence and the granites along the proto-Pacific margin of Gondwana.  The results form an important baseline data set for future research.       Last Modified: 09/10/2015       Submitted by: David H Elliot]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
