<AbstractNarration>The objective of this award is to explore new composite nano-manufacturing methods to enhance mechanical integrity of biopolymers and to investigate a new micro porous structure which will assist in bioactive material delivery in surgical devices. The approach will be: 1. Conduct biomaterials and nano-diamond (ND) composite research to optimize the polymer/ND interface and mass production technique to manufacture ND reinforced biopolymers. 2. Identify suitable structural and bioactive materials for a strong fixation device body and efficient bone/tissue healing and growth. 3. Research on a new technique: gradient cellular structure to generate bio-reagent storage and passage micro pores to not only assure the device mechanical strength but also assist in bioactive materials delivery. 4. Conduct various mechanical and biological testing to find, control, optimize and integrate all required functionalities for the surgical device.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The benefits and broader impacts of this research will be: Provide an innovative way to increase the mechanical integrity of biomaterials and replace current passive orthopedic surgery devices with active devices; a strong relationship with Arthrex, Inc. will be built for the new technology development and transfer; three doctoral students and two senior design teams will be trained; engaging students with design projects in nanomanufacturing, bioactive fixation devices and bio-reagents delivery. The project will be used in outreach workshops for local high school and community college students, including many underrepresented minority students to showcase high-tech nanomanufacturing and surgical engineering applications.</AbstractNarration>
