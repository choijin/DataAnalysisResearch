<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities: Departmental Multi-User Instrumentation program (CRIF:MU), Professor Kevin P. Gable and colleagues from Oregon State University will acquire a multipurpose X-ray system with cross-beam optical technology that will be able to perform parallel and focusing beam experiments. The instrument will also have attachments for studying thin films, performing small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) experiments on nanomaterials, and examining properties as a function of temperature. The instrument will be used to support research activities such as: 1) solution deposition of inorganic thin films, patterns, and devices 2) synthesis and study of wide band-gap bipolar semiconductors; 3) use of main-group nanoclusters as solution precursors for thin films; 4) graphite intercalation chemistry; 5) development of small-scale analytical devices and microreactors; and 6) characterization of a variety of inorganic functional materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The X-ray system allows accurate and precise measurements of materials in powder, thin-film, and nano forms.  Full three-dimensional structures of a compound are refined to provide accurate bond distances and angles.  Film quality is assessed through quantitative analysis of scattering fringes and measurements of density and surface smoothness.  Evaluation of the structures and interdiffusion processes in nanolaminates provides fundamental information on reaction dynamics.  The sizes and shapes of nanomaterials and rods can be quickly assessed to evaluate reaction conditions for controlled growth. The studies described here will impact a number of areas, including solution-based molecular chemistry and solid-state materials chemistry.  This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research.</AbstractNarration>
