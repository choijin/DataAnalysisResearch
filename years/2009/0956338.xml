<AbstractNarration>The overall aim of this project is to advance the understanding of the neural and molecular mechanisms underlying seasonal changes in neuroplasticity (changes in brain structure and function), that influence learning and behavior in vertebrates. More specifically, this project will yield an understanding of the mechanisms of action of the hormone melatonin in a forebrain vocal control circuit of the songbird brain. This will be achieved by identifying the locations of specific melatonin receptor subtypes via molecular and histological techniques in the European starling. These experiments will also identify the neuroanatomical specificity of the regulation of melatonin receptor subtypes, and investigate the probability that different subtypes have different functions in the song circuit.  It is unclear how hormones interact with one another in the brain, and this project utilizes an integrative approach aimed at enhancing understanding of how hormones of different classes (melatonin, testosterone) can interact to exert direct and indirect effects on neural structure and function, and subsequently impact learning and behavioral output. All vertebrates studied possess melatonin receptors, and all vertebrates utilize steroid hormones in the development of their nervous systems. Thus, understanding the basic cellular mechanisms of the interactions of these hormones and melatonin receptors is universally beneficial. Not only will these experiments enhance our understanding of hormone action in the brain, but it will also provide unique training opportunities for undergraduates, graduate students and a postdoctoral fellow in laboratories in the USA and the UK.</AbstractNarration>
