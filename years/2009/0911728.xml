<AbstractNarration>"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009&lt;br/&gt;(Public Law 111-5)."&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: "Super-eruptions" - explosive eruptions that produce &gt;450 km3 of&lt;br/&gt;magma -arguably are the most catastrophic of all natural processes on Earth. They play&lt;br/&gt;a central role in ongoing debates about the nature of crustal magmatism. Study of&lt;br/&gt;super-eruptions may illuminate [1] the processes by which large quantities of magma&lt;br/&gt;accumulate in the upper crust, are stored and modified, and erupt; [2] the relations&lt;br/&gt;between intrusive and extrusive igneous rocks; and [3] the construction of plutons and&lt;br/&gt;batholiths. We propose a multi-faceted approach to investigate the generation and&lt;br/&gt;eruption of the &gt;600 km3 Peach Spring Tuff (PST: Miocene,&lt;br/&gt;Arizona-California-Nevada). Exposure of the extensive outflow sheet as well as a thick&lt;br/&gt;intracaldera tuff section and related granite makes this a particularly appealing target for&lt;br/&gt;study. The PST phenocryst assemblage comprises a diverse array of accessory&lt;br/&gt;minerals, notably including abundant sphene (titanite), which plays a vital role in both&lt;br/&gt;recording evolving conditions and driving trace element variation. Critical questions to&lt;br/&gt;be addressed include: [1] What environmental factors control occurrence of key&lt;br/&gt;accessory minerals - especially sphene? [2] How does growth of accessories influence&lt;br/&gt;geochemical signatures of magmas - and how can these signatures be used to&lt;br/&gt;characterize evolution of magmatic environments? [3] What are the conditions in giant&lt;br/&gt;chambers immediately prior to super-eruptions? [4] How much do conditions fluctuate,&lt;br/&gt;and are they a direct response to replenishment, eruption, or wholesale contamination?&lt;br/&gt;[5] How long do large systems last, and during how much of their lifetime is there a&lt;br/&gt;large chamber? [6] Are chambers containing super-volumes of eruptible magma&lt;br/&gt;inherently unstable, or is triggering suppressed for unusual lengths of time to permit&lt;br/&gt;accumulation of enormous quantities of magma? [7] How, and how efficiently, are large&lt;br/&gt;volumes of melt-rich magma extracted from crystal-rich residue? [8] How and where are&lt;br/&gt;highly-evolved, high-silica rhyolites generated? [9] What is the significance of similarities&lt;br/&gt;and differences between felsic intrusive and extrusive rocks? [10] Why are highly&lt;br/&gt;evolved plutonic rocks less voluminous than volcanic equivalents? [11] Do giant&lt;br/&gt;eruptions have a different relation to their residual plutonic equivalents than&lt;br/&gt;'normal'-sized eruptions? Are their chambers far larger, or do they more efficiently&lt;br/&gt;extract the eruptible material?&lt;br/&gt;This project will entail an integrated, multi-disciplinary approach involving PIs and&lt;br/&gt;collaborators with diverse expertise and perspectives. The project will combine&lt;br/&gt;extensive field work, elemental and isotopic analyses of rock, glass, mineral, and melt&lt;br/&gt;inclusion samples, dating using several complementary geochronological methods,&lt;br/&gt;quantitative textural investigations, and experimental studies aimed at elucidating the&lt;br/&gt;stability and saturation behavior of sphene. We will employ, among other methods,&lt;br/&gt;NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Proposal:0911726 PI Name:Miller, Calvin&lt;br/&gt;Printed from</AbstractNarration>
