<AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment  Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). The intellectual merit  of this proposal is connected to  the problem of recovering  a multivariate function from its assigned moments and the problem of density estimation for high-dimensional data. The problem of recovering a function from its moments is a special case of the classical moment problem, which concentrates mainly on the questions of the existence and uniqueness of a function with specified moments. The importance of the probabilistic moment problem (Hamburger, Stieltjes, and Hausdorff) can be explained by its application in many statistical inverse problems. For example, in tomography, the moments of an object (a function) are uniquely defined by  the x-rays (projections) of the object being imaged. Many inversion formulas are derived by inverting the moment generating function and the Laplace transform. However, there are only a few  approaches for recovering functions via moments. This can be explained by the unstable behavior of the current methods (e.g., the  Maximum Entropy method applied even in the one-dimensional case) when the higher order moments are involved. The investigator develops a new approach, which yields a stable procedure for recovering functions  within the context of the  multivariate Hausdorff moment problem. Apart from being an alternative to the traditional estimation technique, this approach is applicable in situations where other methods can not be applied. For example, one cannot use a traditional method, e.g., kernel smoothing, when the observed  data are the moments.  The results obtained within this project will have broad impacts  not only in the  multidimensional  Hausdorff moment problem, in the theory of non-parametric  estimation in indirect models (deconvolution and demixing), and in entropy estimation of high-dimensional macromolecules, but also in numerous applications in areas of critical importance, such as image analysis, computed tomography, molecular physics, and homeland security. In particular, in computed tomography, when only a few projections are available, the problem  of image reconstruction becomes ill-posed, and  hence, perfect reconstruction is impossible. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator shows that proposed approach provides a uniform approximation rate, which is an important issue in approximation theory. Besides, in many statistical inverse problems, e.g., those based on convolutions, mixtures, multiplicative censoring, and right-censoring, the moments of the unobserved distribution of actual interest can be easily estimated from the transformed moments of the observed distributions. In all such models,  one can recover a function analytically from its moments by means of proposed technique. In the area of homeland security, the iris classification problem represents another field, where moment-recovered constructions will have an impact.</AbstractNarration>
