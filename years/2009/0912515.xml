<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a vibratory gyroscope with electrostatic actuation and capacitive (or piezoelectric) detection at 0.1 - 1 MHz, a much higher frequency than the ones used by current commercial MEMS gyroscopes and with quality factors exceeding 1000. Because of the high frequencies, the thermal Johnson noise (which typically defines the noise floor for standard micromechanical gyroscopes) is reduced considerably by orders of magnitude. The proposed technology involves a two-mode approach in which the drive force is applied in one mode of the resonator. Under external rotation, this mode is coupled to a second mode, which is detected, either by electrostatic or piezoelectric technique. Using this approach, it is possible to achieve micron-sized chip-scale gyroscopes, manufactured on wafer scale, with performance parameters compared to high-end tactical grade gyroscopes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Micromechanical vibratory gyroscopes have increasing relevance in inertial navigation systems and automotive applications. Beyond these applications which require devices with better sensitivity and performance parameters, a host of new applications in consumer electronics have suddenly emerged. In particular, hand-held devices such as cellular devices and GPS systems, and gaming consoles such as the Nintendo Wii are now including miniature gyroscopes as low cost companion to existing micromachined accelerometers. These applications are in essence similar to the automotive applications in which the gyroscopes are used to detect angular rotation and provide ride stabilization, roll over detection and better traction control. Development of high sensitivity high stability micromechanical gyroscopes will also be of importance to a number of fundamental research questions, which include measuring gravitational red shift for validating the predictions of general relativity. As an inertial system, a highly sensitive gyroscope that can be cooled down to low temperatures can also be used to detect or put limits on new fundamental spin-dependent forces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5)."</AbstractNarration>
