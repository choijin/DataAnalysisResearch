<AbstractNarration>In the last half century the monarch butterfly, Danaus plexippus, has become an important model organism for research on mimicry, plant-herbivore interactions, chemical ecology, physiological ecology, and migration. In addition, the charismatic insect has proven to be an appealing entry point into the world of science for both children and adults. Much of the research that has made this a model organism has been conducted by Lincoln Brower, who will be supported to write a book targeted to scientists, graduate and undergraduate students, and science-curious general readers. The book will address the monarch butterflies' chemical defense against predators, the ecological chemistry of the butterflies' interactions with their milkweed hostplants, the physiology, ecology and behavior of the butterflies as they cope with the microclimate in their Mexican wintering sites, and the butterflies' unique migration and wintering biology that illustrate timely conservation issues. The intellectual merit of the book for scientists will be in its presentation of data, critical review of evidence, and extensive bibliography. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An important broader impact of the project will be the archiving of original datasets in a digital data registry. Explanations of the significance of these data and including unanswered questions in each chapter will help to spark new research. The book will enhance non-specialists' and students' understanding of diverse methodologies that can be used to address ecological questions, and their appreciation of the value of long-term studies and the collaborative nature of many discoveries. Copious illustrations will engage the reader and tell the story, so that the non-expert is prepared to understand data and how experiments in both the field and laboratory were actually conducted.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[          I was awarded an OPUS grant from the National Science Foundation to produce a book synthesizing more than 50 years of research on the monarch butterfly.  My first research on this butterfly in the 1950's asked basic questions about its population ecology, and whether it was, as had been posited, chemically distasteful.  This led me to questions about the chemicals in the monarch and its milkweed hostplants, and in the 1960's and 70's my colleagues and I developed quantitative methods to investigate cardiac glycosides in milkweeds and monarchs, and physiological and behavioral responses of birds to these chemicals.  When the Mexican overwintering sites of the eastern population of monarch butterflies were reported in National Geographic in 1976, I was excited to investigate how these chemicals operated in dense aggregations of hundreds of millions of butterflies.  My first trip to the butterfly colonies in Mexico's high mountains, in 1977, opened my eyes to multiple lines of new research -- but also to the urgent challenge of protecting these sites.  For 40 years, therefore, I have been juggling competing demands of ecological research and conservation activism, to protect what I call an endangered biological phenomenon.           When I wrote the OPUS proposal, my concern about the monarch butterfly's population status in the U.S. and Mexico was substantial but I was optimistic that I could focus for 18 months on writing the book. The monarch butterfly population is estimated by looking at the total area of forest it occupies in Mexico each December, and the population estimate from December 2005 through December 2008 was lower than the long-term average but seemed to be fairly stable (Figure1). Unfortunately the threats to the monarch's conservation, from habitat loss and pesticide use in the U.S. and from habitat degradation in Mexico, have increased rather than abated, and the winter population estimates from 2009 to 2014 were stark enough to gain worldwide attention.  In this period I therefore devoted the majority of my time to conservation, including coauthoring the 2015 petition to the US Fish and Wildlife Service to list the monarch as a threatened species.  My intention is to continue dedicating effort to conservation issues and also to finishing the book.        Last Modified: 05/31/2016       Submitted by: Lincoln P Brower]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
