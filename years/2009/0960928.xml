<AbstractNarration>This project will examine the physical processes associated with the evolution (formation, circulation, and destruction) of Eighteen Degree Water (EDW) within the subtropical gyre of the North Atlantic Ocean. EDW is the archetype for the anomalously thick and vertically homogenous mode waters that are typical of all subtropical western boundary current systems. EDW is associated with a shallow overturning circulation that carries heat northward and is an interannual reservoir of anomalous heat, nutrients and CO2. Understanding the annual cycle of EDW evolution, and in particular its associated circulation pathways and destruction mechanisms, is important because though EDW is isolated beneath the stratified upper-ocean at the end of each winter, it may reemerge in subsequent years to influence mixed layer properties and consequently air-sea interaction and primary productivity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pathways of EDW circulation, the processes of EDW destruction, and the role of EDW in modulating ocean-atmosphere heat exchange and nutrient supply to the euphotic zone will be investigated. The plan is to synthesize a broad spectrum of observations including a substantial in-situ dataset collected during the recently completed CLIVAR Mode Water Dynamics Experiment (CLIMODE). This coordinated field effort included a large array of profiling floats, a moored array, and several hydrographic surveys. To supplement this unique dataset the investigators will also examine contemporary and historical hydrography, Argo profiling floats, surface drifters, satellite altimetry and ocean color fields, and output from several eddy-resolving OGCM simulations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This project will test the long-hypothesized climatic importance of EDW as an element of the North Atlantic's shallow overturning circulation and as a short-term reservoir of heat, nutrients, and carbon. Significantly, this study will advance understanding of the various processes that destroy EDW. In addition, this study will, for the first time, compare and contrast the roles of the large-scale, low-frequency circulation and the mesoscale eddy field in EDW dispersal and destruction. Finally, the proposed work will provide a foundation for comparative studies since mode waters are found in every ocean basin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Clarifying the role of EDW in the exchange of heat between the atmosphere and ocean will support ongoing community efforts to improve interannual-to-decadal predictability. For example, EDW and its associated air-sea heat flux may have a direct impact on the year-to-year variability of surface storm amplitude in the North Atlantic storm track near the Gulf Stream. In addition, understanding the role of EDW in the storage and exchange of nutrients will advance our understanding of interannual variability in primary productivity. Rigorous model-data comparisons using the unique CLIMODE dataset will also aid the broader community by providing an objective assessment of the fidelity of eddy-resolving numerical models. Finally, the project will support the training of two postdoctoral investigators and a graduate student.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is a contribution to the U.S. CLIVAR (CLImate VARiability and predictability) program.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Gulf Stream?s Eighteen Degree Water seasonality and mixing, and implications for oxygen utilization.     [This text is derived from summaries in S. Billheimer?s (2016) PhD dissertation, which was supported in full by this grant.]     Introduction.  The Gulf Stream and Kuroshio Extension are the largest oceanic heat loss regions in the northern hemisphere.  This drives vigorous ocean convection that creates unusually deep winter mixed layers of nearly uniform temperature, salinity, and high oxygen in most years, which become what we call ?subtropical mode water?.  The strong currents precondition the ocean stratification for mode water production, which occurs only on the warm side of the current fronts.  During summer and fall, the thick mode water layer is isolated from the atmosphere by the warming surface layer, and begins to break down.  Due to its great thickness, part of the layer and its properties remains into the next winter, when it can be re-exposed to the atmosphere, thus providing a heat content memory (?re-emergence?).     ?Eighteen Degree Water? (EDW) is the subtropical mode water associated with the Gulf Stream Extension [Worthington, 1959].  The strength of EDW formation during winter is related to the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) [Talley, 1996; Joyce et al., 2000; Billheimer and Talley, 2016]. During strongly positive NAO winters, when the storm track shifts northwards, the subtropical EDW region is deprived of strong winter atmospheric forcing, resulting in weak to near cessation of EDW formation [Dickson et al., 1996].  The Gulf Stream also plays a role in EDW formation through cross-frontal mixing [Joyce et al., 2009, 2013; Thomas et al., 2013], but contributes only a fraction of the thick mode water layer. Interannual variability of EDW formation changes nutrient supply to the euphotic zone in the Sargasso Sea, modifying annual net productivity [Palter et al., 2005], and CO2 uptake variability [Bates, 2012].     Although the EDW layer acts as an interannually persistent subsurface reservoir of heat, nutrients, and CO2, nearly half of its volume is mixed away seasonally, diffusing its properties into the thermocline [Kwon and Riser, 2004]. The mechanisms that drive the seasonal dispersal and erosion of the layer have been poorly understood.     The CLIVAR Mode Water Dynamics Experiment (CLIMODE) (2004-2007) was designed to address EDW formation and destruction [Marshall et al., 2009]. My contribution included nine profiling Argo-type floats equipped with oxygen sensors, providing unprecedented temporal resolution and spatial coverage for observing seasonal oxygen cycles.     Our analysis addressed the following questions:     1. What is the relative influence of oceanic heat transport vs. atmospheric forcing in driving interannual variability of EDW renewal?     2. What is the annual cycle of EDW erosion, and what are the dominant mechanisms that drive the seasonal restratification of the layer?     3. How do physical processes, including the annual erosion of EDW, affect the seasonal cycle of oxygen in the Sargasso Sea, and what is the resulting influence on determination of regional remineralization rates?     Results.  1.              Warm winters, weak mode waters, and the North Atlantic Oscillation.    In Billheimer and Talley (JGRO 2013) we showed that the winter of 2011-2012 was an extraordinarily weak EDW formation season. Using observations from the Argo array of profiling floats, we evaluated the Sargasso Sea buoyancy budget from 2004-2012, and found that interannual changes in winter buoyancy removal, and thus EDW renewal, are more significantly associated with late winter surface forcing than changes in lateral oceanic heat transport.  That is, a weakening of the normally enormous winter cooling was the dominant factor in weakening the mode water.     Just three years later, in winter 2014-2015, the Sargasso Sea again was more stratified than usual (Billheimer and Talley, BAMS 2016).  This was the weakest EDW formation year during the Argo era and was associated with strongly positive NAO. Three of the past four winters have had below average EDW renewal, with the most recent being the most extreme.     2. Seasonality of EDW destruction (Billheimer and Talley, JGRO 2016). Immediately following EDW formation, as the warmer season begins, the EDW begins to weaken, and by the end of the next autumn, loses about half its strength. Using CLIMODE and Argo profiling float data, we determined the relative influence of vertical vs. along-isopycnal mixing in this seasonal restratification. We found that EDW destruction is dominated by 1-D vertical diffusion from above.  Mesoscale, along-isopycnal stirring is also significant, explaining approximately 1/3 of the total annual EDW destruction.     3. Seasonal oxygen structure of the upper ocean of the Sargasso Sea and rate of change (Billheimer, PhD thesis 2016).   We determined the structure and seasonality of oxygen evolution in the Sargasso Sea and evaluated the physical processes that modify the oxygen distribution. Applying estimates of vertical mixing estimated from the previous EDW destruction component of the analysis, we determined the seasonality and depth-dependence of net biological production and consumption and estimated the remineralization of organic carbon in the region.
