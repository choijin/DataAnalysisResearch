<AbstractNarration>This research program will develop a new tool which will allow the rapid processing of nanomaterials grown by chemical vapor deposition.  The proposed technique will use an array of micro-hotplates which can be independently controlled to simultaneously produce a wide range of processing environments, lowering the time for processing by nearly 100,000 times.  The tool will be applied to the synthesis of graphene which is under consideration for use in transparent flexible electronics, but can also be used for a wide range of nanomaterials.  The micro-hotplates will also allow for monitoring of the rate of growth during synthesis.  Additional methods will be used to characterize the electrical, optical, and structural properties after growth.&lt;br/&gt;The success of this tool will allow for the rapid optimization of processing environments for nanomaterial growth which will help speed the introduction of new nanomaterials into devices.  At present, such rapid screening tools do not exist for nanomaterial synthesis.   Furthermore, this platform will enable an understanding of how temperature variations affect the structure and growth of nanomaterials which is necessary for the scale-up to mass production systems. Results from this work will be used in the development of new nanotechnology tutorials presented at national conferences.  In addition, results will be used to help develop new courses focused on nanomaterial processing and characterization.  Finally, a focus on undergraduate and underrepresented student participation will be a primary goal of this effort in order to expose underserved groups to a broader area of engineering and science.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
