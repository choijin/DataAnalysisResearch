<AbstractNarration>0949962&lt;br/&gt;Ito&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This collaborative grant between the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities and Duluth (EAR-0949285) campuses supports renewed support of operations and laboratory improvements at LacCore, a national multi-user lacustrine core archival and analysis facility.  LacCore was previously supported under EAR-0652769.  The LacCore Facility supports the limnological community for studies that contribute to our understanding of past climates, ecological systems, and biogeochemical dynamics on the continents though detailed sedimentological analysis and archival services for lacustrine cores.  LacCore operates open laboratories to allow community access to specialized field and laboratory equipment and staff expertise for Initial Core Description (ICD) methods including: core splitting; non-destructive multi-sensor core logging; palynological preparation; grain size analysis; carbon coulometry; phase identification via x-ray diffraction; biogenic silica analysis; preparation of samples for subsequent stable isotopic analysis; digital core photography, and optical petrography/smear slide analysis.  LacCore also provides refrigerated and frozen core storage and archival services and field coring equipment and curatorial materials (D-tubes) support for lake coring expeditions.   LacCore staff are also responsible for curation of lake core ICD metadata and the routine transmission of all data to NOAA?s National Geophysical Data Center.   The Large Lake Observatory at Duluth will now be a node of LacCore and will provide x-ray fluorescence (XRF) core scanning services to the broader paleorecords research community for rapid down core elemental analysis.  LacCore will institute a user fee schedule beginning in 2011.  The Facility will continue as a training ground for hundreds of researchers, particularly graduate students, in coring and core analysis techniques.  LacCore staff are engaged in education and outreach including an ongoing collaborative project aimed at study of the paleoenvironments of wild rice lakes in northern Minnesota with tribal college students and teachers from the Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa and Fond du Lac Tribal and Community College. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The x-ray fluorescence core scanning facility at the Large Lakes Observatory of the University of Minnesota Duluth (LLOX Lab) provides the scientific community access to an ITRAX XRF Core Scanner.  This device has been a "game changer" in studies of sedimentary records of past environments.  It allows rapid and non-destructive analyses of major elements (such as iron, calcium, silicon, and titanium) in sediment cores at resolutions as fine as 0.2mm, and it also produces high quality x-radiographic images of sediment cores. Our philosophy is to make this technology widely available to the scientific community, and to keep costs down through efficient scheduling of instrument time.  During the 5-year initial period of this grant (June 2010-May 2015) LLOX Lab scanned close to 2800m of core, which required 9375 hours of analytical instrument time (this does not include time required for tuning, maintenance, calibration, etc).  Data produced during the grant period led to at least 78 publications and conference abstracts.  The LLOX Lab has has worked with researchers associated with 153 projects and welcomes visitors.  We have had 10 to 15 visitors each year, corresponding to 40 to 50 visitor-days.  Typically these are graduate students who come to learn about x-ray fluorescence, and to help develop analytical strategies that efficiently address their research questions.  Student training is an important component of our work.  In addition to external visitors, many U of MN students have taken advantage of the facility.  XRF data have been used in 12 MS theses and 3 PhD theses at the U of MN.  12 undergraduate students have had research experiences (including those at the NSF-REU Bahamas Site) and learning modules have been incorporated into upper division/graduate laboratory and field methods courses at U of MN.  By working in close collaboration with the National Lacustrine Core Repository (LacCore) we assure effective communcation with the scientific community about LLOX Lab capabilities.  In addition, we follow LacCore protocols for data management and archiving.  XRF core scanning datasets can be seamlessly linked with initial core description data and images, providing integrated data access for LacCore users.  Finally, we have partnered with certain LacCore-led outreach efforts, most notably the NSF-supported Manoomin Project, centered on involving Native American students in STEM fields through in studies of wild-rice lakes that are key components of Anishinaabe culture.  LLOX Lab has been supported by a combination of NSF grants, U of MN contributions and user fees.  In 2015 the University provided funds for an upgrade to the detector, making our 9-year old instrument the functional equivalent of the latest generation and improving its sensitivity and signal to noise ratio approximately five-fold.  This allows more rapid analyses and has led to increased sample throughput.       Last Modified: 08/29/2016       Submitted by: Erik T Brown]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
