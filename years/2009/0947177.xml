<AbstractNarration>Immunity to parasites has historically been understudied in evolutionary ecology. In recent years efforts to understand the causes and consequences of natural variation in immune function in wild animals, termed ecological immunology, has transformed multiple realms of biology.  To foster continued productivity and expansion of this new field, theoretical refinement and methodological consistency will be critical. This grant will help bring together 36 internationally recognized ecologists, evolutionary biologists, and immunologists to i) develop new techniques and concepts, ii) enhance breadth and depth of research questions, iii) establish new interdisciplinary collaborations, and iv) stimulate outreach and training opportunities for schoolteachers and the public (through a routinely updated website). This network will be open to all scientists.  The current network membership is highly diverse, with 50% female members and many individuals who identify themselves as belonging to minorities.  Such a diverse group, in conjunction with meetings held outside the USA (2 out of 5 over a five year period), will foster a sense of international community and expose early-career participants to a multitude of scientific and social cultures. Also, the direct engagement of high school teachers in this program will augment the inclusion of evolutionary thinking in American elementary, middle and high school classrooms. In sum, the network will provide novel perspective to evolutionary biology and immunology, both of which should be insightful for human health.  Pedagogically, this network will provide training for students from underrepresented backgrounds and expose high school teachers, their students, and the interested public to a field of truly integrative, modern science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The specific goals of our RCN were to:  Practical  1) Develop techniques amenable to understanding the immune systems of wild animals  2) Develop and communicate standards for novel and extant techniques  3) Establish new collaborations between ecologists, evolutionary biologists, and mainstream immunologists that otherwise may not interact  4) Provide training opportunities to junior researchers  5) Foster ecological and evolutionary thinking by mainstream immunologists  6) Communicate findings to scientists and the public broadly via a constantly-updated website, peer-reviewed literature, and curricula and training for high school teachers  Conceptual:  1) Develop new paradigms and identify generalizations about immunity across animal species  2) Establish links and surmount shortcomings between measures of immunity and capacity for disease resistance (e.g., immunocompetence)  3) Increase the utility of ecoimmunology to applied biology such as wildlife management and animal husbandry.     Our major achievements in terms of Intellectual Merit were:  1) Development of techniques amenable to understanding the immune systems of wild animals  Our website continues to be the ?go-to? location for ecoimmunology techniques, as new and returning scientists download protocols and pose questions to researchers. Because the grant has ended, we moved the website to a permanent home in the lab of PI Lynn Martin, housed on servers maintained by the University of South Florida. In addition, we funded many research exchanges over the life of the grant, helping young researchers gain valuable training in the lab of RCN members.  2) Development and communication of standards for novel and extant techniques  As mentioned above, our website www.ecoimmunology.org, allows for broad dissemination of techniques. In addition, our yearly RCN meetings were fertile ground for technique dissemination through both talks (about 33% of talks and posters at this year?s meeting focused directly on techniques) and informal discussions.     Our main achievement to advancing the discipline was through founding the newly established Division of Ecoimmunology and Disease Ecology within the Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology. This new division was officially started at the annual SICB meeting in January 2015. The Division will continue to host symposia and workshops, exert editorial influence on the society journal, and manage award competitions for trainees thus assuming many of the functions of the RCN. We are excited and proud of this new Division, which ensures the longevity of the RCN now that funding has ended.   3) Establish new collaborations between ecologists, evolutionary biologists, and mainstream immunologists that otherwise may not interact.  We held several RCN-supported workshops, in which participants gave a range of talks and posters. A number of talks reported on work that developed at prior RCN meetings.  4) Foster ecological and evolutionary thinking by mainstream immunologists  Co-PI Ardia attended two international meetings in Japan and South Africa to increase the reach of the network. In addition, a 2014 paper in Integrative and Comparative Biology written by the PIs highlighted the core tenets of the field.      Our major achievements in terms of Broader Impacts were:  1) Provide training opportunities to junior researchers   This RCN supported &gt;20 research exchanges for students and postdocs.  These individuals travelled across the globe to collaborate with senior scientists and learn or refine techniques applied to various hosyt-parasite systems.  2) Communicate findings to scientists and the public broadly via several mechanisms including:  a)    A teacher training workshop held in October 2014 in Lancaster PA for secondary school teachers focused on ecoimmunology lessons.   b)    Presentation of RCN-supported ecoimmunology curricula at the national meeting of the National Association of Biology Teachers in Cleveland OH in November 2014  c)    Preparation for publication of a subset of lessons for broad dissemination and posting of all lessons on the RCN website.
