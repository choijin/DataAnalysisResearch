<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this award is to apply mapping sciences from the disciplines of photogrammetry and remote sensing to realize a new dimensional measurement capability in manufacturing engineering that is inexpensive, non-contact, remote, and applicable to in situ measurements.  The approach is to use a laser beam or a beam pattern generated with a diffractive optical element and scatter this beam(s) either from the part being manufactured itself, or from engineered structures placed into the manufacturing environment.  Photogrammetry will be used to determine absolute coordinates of reflected spots in the environment and this information will be mapped back to the desired dimensional information.  Effectively, the part measurement is moved out away from the part by using photogrammetry to measure the optical scattering from the part.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this method will open a new field of metrology research. Success will mean demonstrating dimensional measurements with uncertainty of 1 part in 100,000 in two important manufacturing applications, representing a significant technical and economic advance:  (1) on machine metrology of free-form diamond machined surfaces and (2) in situ and dynamic metrology of large continuous polishing platens used for high precision optic polishing.  The research necessitates graduate education experience in optics, precision metrology, and mechanical engineering.  The visibly appealing features of the measurement will be exploited and learning tools developed for both students and the general public.  This will include modules for undergraduate and graduate advanced optics lab courses, a demo module for the general public for use by local student chapters in optics and engineering societies, and a module for use at advertisement and recruitment booths at professional society meetings.</AbstractNarration>
