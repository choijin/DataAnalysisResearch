<AbstractNarration>The ocean plays a critical role in sequestering CO2 by exporting fixed carbon to the deep ocean through the biological pump.  There is a pressing need to understand the systematics of carbon export in the Southern Ocean in the context of global warming because of the sensitivity of this region to climate change, already manifested as significant temperature increases.  Numerous studies have indicated that Fe supply is a primary control on phytoplankton biomass and productivity in the Southern Ocean. The results from previous cruises in Feb-Mar 2004 and Jul-Aug 2006 have revealed the major natural Fe fertilization from Fe-rich shelf waters to the Fe-limited high nutrient low chlorophyll (HNLC) Antarctic Circumpolar Current Surface Water (ASW) in the southern Drake Passage, producing a series of phytoplankton blooms. Remaining questions include:  How is natural Fe transported to the euphotic zone through small-meso-large scale horizontal-vertical transport and mixing in different HNLC ACC areas?  How does plankton community structure evolve in response to a natural Fe addition, how does Fe speciation respond to biogeochemical processes, and how is Fe recycled to determine the longevity of phytoplankton blooms?  How does the export of POC evolve as a function of upwelling-mixing, Fe addition-recycling and bacteria-plankton structure?  This synthesis proposal will address these fundamental questions using a unique dataset combining multiyear physical, Fe and biogeochemical data collected between 2004 and 2006 from 2 NSF-funded Fe fertilization experiment cruises and 3 Antarctic Marine Living Resource (AMLR) cruises in the southern Drake Passage and southwestern Scotia Sea through collaboration with scientists in the AMLR program and US Southern Ocean GLOBEC projects.  All investigators involved in this study are engaged in graduate and undergraduate instruction, and mentoring of postdoctoral researchers.  Each P.I. will incorporate key elements of the proposed syntheses in our lectures, problem sets and group projects.  The project includes support to convene a 4-5 day international workshop on natural Fe fertilization at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. The workshop will include scientists from United Kingdom, France and Germany who have conducted natural Fe fertilization experiments, and Korea and China who are planning to conduct natural Fe fertilization experiments. The participation of graduate students and postdoctoral scholars will be especially encouraged. The results will be published in a Deep-Sea Research II special issue.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ ??This project has synthesized results from field studies conducted in 2004 and 2006 on the nature iron fertilization processes in the southern Drake Passage with the goals:  providing insights into 1) physical      processes delivering dissolved iron (DFe) additions to the high nutrient      low chlorophyll (HNLC) surface waters in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current      (ACC) region, 2) biogeochemical processes controlling plankton community      responses to iron additions, and 3) biological processes determining      carbon export; and publishing the results from these      fieldwork and synthesis studies.    These fieldwork and synthesis results have been published in a total 37 peer-reviewed articles including a Deep-Sea Research II Special Issue.   This project has reached our objectives:  1)   Simulating the circulation fields between 2004 and 2006 using a 2-15 km regional hydrodynamic model developed from the eastern Bellingshausen Sea to Weddell Sea, and validating results using all available data collected from various cruises  2)  Quantitatively estimating  Fe distributions, transport and mixing fluxes from combining data synthesis and modeling in the southern Drake Passage, southern Scotia Sea, western Weddell Sea and Bransfield Strait  3)  Developing process models and quantitative relationships between iron-complexing ligands, iron recycling and plankton functional groups based on data synthesis and hypothesis testing  4)  Comparing differences in physical and biogeochemical processes in different Southern Ocean regions, and applicability of our findings to other areas in the Southern Ocean   The major findings from this study are:  1)  The offshelf transport in the northern shelf region of Elephant Island is an all-season permanent feature in the southern Drake Passage producing natural DFe fertilization at a scale of 103 km.  The coupled multiple meso- and large-scale physical processes in the southern Drake Passage are responsible for the all-seasons offshelf transport of DFe rich shelf waters in the northern shelf region of Elephant Island fertilizing DFe in the southern Scotia Sea on the scale of 103 km.  These physical processes include:  a branch of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) is      detoured southward due to the blockage of the Shackleton Transverse Ridge      (Fig. 1),  westerly wind storms lead to the onshelf intrusions of the HNLC Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) onto the shelves of the Southern Shetland and Elephant      Islands (Fig. 2), and  the horizontal mixing and potential vorticity      conservation lead to the northward offshelf transport of DFe rich shelf      waters (Fig. 3).   2)  Sediments on the shallow shelves around the Southern Shetland and Elephant Islands are a permanent major natural DFe source fertilizing the southern Scotia Sea  The iron and manganese distributions show the highest concentrations in the upper 200 m on the northern shelf of the South Shetland Islands.  Strong barotropic currents up to 50-60 cm s-1 were found on the shelf shallower than 300 m implying that resuspension of sediments and sediment pore water are of iron sources.  The current field at 100 m and 3-D distribution of DFe in Fig. 4 elucidates the transport process of high DFe waters on the shelf regions of the South Shetland and Elephant Islands into the southern Scotia Sea region.   3)  Offshelf transport of DFe rich shelf waters is the major DFe source for the southern Scotia Sea  The results from simulating benthic flux of DFe using the hydrodynamic model elucidate the spatially-evolving distribution of DFe due to advection and dispersion processes over a year which provides a clear view over the DFe source, locations of off-shelf transport, and contributions of DFe at different shelves.  In addition to the DFe from the shelves of the South Shetland and Elephant Islands, the Bransfield Current delivers significant amount of DFe from the Gerlache Strait and western Bransfield Strait.    4)  Mixe...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
