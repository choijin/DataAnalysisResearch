<AbstractNarration>This research project aims to explore and understand how geographic information systems (GIS) can be used to promote and teach spatial thinking and social science inquiry skills. It addresses the research question: What are effective teaching practices using GIS to teach spatial thinking and social science inquiry in middle-school and undergraduate classrooms? This program will study the effectiveness of teaching practices for social science instruction with GIS in urban public schools for specific learning objectives.&lt;br/&gt;The research plans to develop an empirically-grounded framework for studying the ways teaching practices with GIS interact with four other foci of research: (1) learning objectives for inquiry skills and spatial reasoning, articulated across grade levels; (2) learning processes with GIS; (3) GIS curriculum designs; and (4) the design of GIS tools for learning environments. The project plans to use the GIS tools within a culturally relevant curriculum unit for diverse students of African American and Latino backgrounds. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A range of research methods will be used to study teaching and learning, focused on a common topic: American Migrations of African American and Latino populations over time, using GIS-mapped census data. Research will be conducted in three phases: (1) design experiments iteratively developing a theoretical framework, curriculum, and instructional strategies; (2) case studies of effective instruction at two levels; and (3) curriculum evaluations. Findings on effective teaching and learning in middle school classrooms, with undergraduate college students, and pre-service elementary teachers via GIS based-curriculum, will be presented.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Teaching and Learning Social Science Inquiry and Spatial Reasoning with Geographic Information Systems (GIS)  Project Outcomes Report  NSF-CAREER Grant #DRL-0953448  PI: Dr. Josh Radinsky  This research project studied the ways middle school, high school and college teachers can use GIS maps of historical census data for social science inquiry projects. In collaboration with Chicago Public School teachers and UIC instructors, the grant has created innovative curriculum materials, and has studied classroom teaching and learning. Our classroom projects have focused on African American and Latino migrations that have shaped local and national history.  The research examines the kinds of spatial, temporal, quantitative and proportional reasoning that can be taught and learned with these maps, and a range of approaches to teaching and assessing these skills.  Our project was featured in an "NSF Highlight" in 2014 focusing on the Social Explorer project, a partner and contributor to this research project: http://www.nsf.gov/discoveries/disc_summ.jsp?cntn_id=130924&amp;org=NSF   We partnered with the Smithsonian National Museum of American History on their initiative called "Becoming U.S.: Teaching Migration History for the 21st Century"   Our work with middle school, high school and college instructors has been supported by our project website, http://americanmigrations.uic.edu, and our curriculum design website for teachers to create and share projects, http://ammig.gisforhistory.org. All projects focus on African American or Latino migrations.   We have been partners each year with Chicago Public SchoolsÆ Social Science Academy, conducting workshops and designing curriculum with social studies teachers on African American and Latino migrations.   The project has produced a library of 35 learning objectives to guide instruction, assessment, and curriculum design in six areas:    Data literacy Spatial reasoning Reasoning with representations Statistical / proportional reasoning STEM inquiry practices Sociological and historical inquiry     Our research projects have produced journal articles, book chapters, technical reports and conference papers examining how instructors teach with census data maps; how students at different grade levels learn with these tools; and ways to design curriculum and assessments for teaching about migration, particularly African American and Latino migrations in U. S. history.                Last Modified: 06/06/2016       Submitted by: Joshua Radinsky]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
