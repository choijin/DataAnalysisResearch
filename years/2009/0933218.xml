<AbstractNarration>Diptera, or true flies, are among Earth's most species-rich groups of organisms. Biting and nonbiting midges make up over 10% of the species, with a disproportionate number that are economically and medically important, including those that feed on blood, transmit disease agents, and facilitate aquatic nutrient cycling. Research will focus on net-winged midges, nonbiting midges, meniscus midges, sand/moth flies, black flies, and solitary midges; all are taxonomically challenging, understudied, and insufficiently staffed with expertise. The project will provide new information on biodiversity and ecology of these flies and a phylogenetic framework for natural classification and testing of biological hypotheses. New species will be described, identification keys prepared, and phylogenetic analyses conducted using morphological, molecular, and cytological data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The project team will educate the next generation of taxonomic experts through a synergistic process involving workshops and integrated methodologies and collaborations. The work will involve applications of modern technology, including internet-accessible electronic publications and identification keys, digital image galleries of specimens, digital reproductions of taxonomic literature, electronic species distribution maps, nomenclatural databases, and interactive databases of GIS-compatible specimen data. Museum collections will be augmented with material from fieldwork. Long-term benefits will include infusion of taxonomic and biodiversity expertise into the scientific community.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ MIDGEPEET was a collaborative multi-institutional research &amp; training grant whose primary goal was mentoring the next generation of taxonomic specialists for several families of lower Diptera. These new systematists received training in field- and laboratory-based morphological and molecular methods. Collectively, MIDGEPEET has thus far resulted in 2 books, 7 book chapters, and 41 research articles. Improvements were made to existing assets including LUCID keys for Chironomidae, the Taxonomic Inventory of Simuliidae, and several insect collections. This award trained 9 international visiting scholars, one technician, 3 postdoctoral researchers, 10 graduate students (7 Ph.D. &amp; 3 M.S.), 9 undergraduates, and one high schooler.   University of Tennessee (PD Moulton). Psychodidae. Several new species were discovered and described, the blood-meal host of Aposycorax was identified as a frog using molecular methods, and the first phylogeny of the family was inferred from DNA sequences. Dixidae. All described and several new Nearctic species have been distinguished using morphology coupled with nuclear markers. Important findings are cryptic species abound and recognition of Meringodixa is problematic. Thaumaleidae. The first phylogenies for the family, both well resolved and well supported, were reconstructed using sequences from two nuclear genes. Highlights include recognition of six new species groups within the western Androprosopa and new insights into how the worldÆs seven genera are related. Blephariceridae. The eastern Nearctic Blepharicera were revised, with six species described as new. Descriptions and keys to all life stages of all species, except B. caudata, were provided. Phylogenetic inferences supported monophyly of the B. tenuipes and B. micheneri species groups and subgroups therein. Simuliidae. Three nuclear genes each permitted identification of 13 of the 22 species in the pestiferous Simulium jenningsi group. Revisionary studies of the Australian Paracnephia confirmed the presence of several legitimate genera. One postdoc, one Ph.D. student, two M.S. students, and one undergraduate student received mentoring and at least partial financial support. A visiting Ph.D. student and Algerian scholar participated in a DNA workshop. Products to date include 6 journal articles: 4 on Psychodidae and one each on Blephariceridae and Simuliidae.  Iowa State University (co-PI Courtney). Courtney and students have conducted surveys and systematic revisions of various families of lower Diptera, particularly Axymyiidae (axymyiids), Blephariceridae, Ptychopteridae (phantom crane flies), Tanyderidae (primitive crane flies), and Tipuloidea (crane flies). Field work in the Nearctic, Neotropical, and Australasian regions provided specimens for ongoing revisions of these and other families, as well as morphological and molecular data for phylogenetic studies. The resultant historical data has provided a better understanding of the evolution of this megadiverse insect order. Outcomes included publications on various taxa, as follows (refereed journal articles/refereed book chapters): Axymyiidae (2/0), Blephariceridae (2/2), Deuterophlebiidae (1/1), Nymphomyiidae (1/0), Ptychopteridae (3/1), Tanyderidae (2/1), Tipuloidea (3/0), and aquatic Diptera in general (1/5). Furthermore, the project helped train 4 graduate students (all Ph.D., 3 completed), 8 undergraduate students, and 1 high school intern. Synergistic activities through the Iowa State University Insect Zoo (e.g., development of outreach programs focused on the role of aquatic Diptera in medical entomology and in the biomonitoring of aquatic ecosystems) and the Iowa State Insect Collection (e.g., collection-improvement projects, initiation of a database system, and digitization of slide- and fluid collections) enhance the impact of the MIDGEPEET project.
