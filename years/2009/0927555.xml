<AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an International Research Experience for Students (IRES) award to U.S. P.I. Paul Benkeser, Georgia Institute of Technology.  This award will enable 8 U.S. undergraduate students from the Biomedical Engineering Partnership Program to gain research experience at Peking University in this field. The Biomedical Engineering Partnership Program was formed by the Georgia Institute of Technology, Emory University, and Peking University to combine their expertise to solve difficult problems in biomedical engineering. This is a year-long program, with the students engaged in research in the U.S. laboratories during the spring and fall semester and in Peking University?s biomedical engineering laboratories during the summer term.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit.  The Georgia Institute of Technology, Emory University, and Peking University combine their expertise to solve difficult problems in biomedical engineering.  This proposed opportunity will allow a diverse group of undergraduate students to develop their research skills with scientists and engineers whose perspectives include global scientific and technological interactions.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact.  This program will provide the participating U.S. undergraduate students with an international research experience that will give them a global perspective on research challenges and opportunities in biomedical engineering.  The proposed activity has focused specific attention on recruitment and retention of under-represented minorities and women to ensure these groups are well represented in this program.</AbstractNarration>
