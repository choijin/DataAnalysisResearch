<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ESR and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopies, ESR imaging (ESRI) and computational methods will be applied in order to provide details on and formulate the mechanism of degradation and stabilization of ionomer membranes used in fuel cells. The major objectives for the next four years are to: 1. Make the transition from ?ESR in an in situ fuel cell? to ?ESR Imaging of an in situ fuel cell? by combining in situ experiments with the ESR Imaging methods developed in the previous grant period. This approach will make possible measurements of the diffusion rate of nitroxide spin probes and spin adducts between the anode and cathode sides of the fuel cell and thus visualize crossover processes. 2. Focus on membrane stabilization by assessing and comparing the effect of various neutralizing cations on the stability of ionomeric membranes. 3. Increase the lifetimes of unstable intermediates by encapsulation in the hydrophobic environment of cyclodextrins and cucurbiturils as hosts. 4. Initiate density functional theory calculations in order to understand the effect of conformations of radical fragments and adducts on their magnetic parameters (hyperfine splittings and g values). The collaboration with scientists and engineers from 3M, Ford Laboratories, and the General Motors Electrochemical Energy Research Lab, as well as the contributions of international participants, will contribute to the success of the proposed project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fuel cells are a promising source of clean energy for automotive and stationary applications. Polymer membranes are crucial for fuel cell operation, but their durability is a major problem that must be solved before the fuel cells are in use. This proposal describes the application of spectroscopic, imaging and computational methods that are expected to provide important details on the degradation and stabilization of membranes in fuel cells. The collaboration of the Detroit group with scientists and engineers from 3M, Ford Laboratories, and the General Motors Electrochemical Energy Research Lab is an example of Translational Research: Fundamental studies on the mechanism of membrane degradation will lead to the synthesis of more robust membranes. International collaborations will add talent to the local group. This investigator will co-teach a course entitled ?Fundamentals of Fuel Cells?; the course will be tailored for engineers and scientists who lost their jobs due to the current economic problems and need to be retrained so as to participate in ?green? ways to generate clean energy. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     Report for the General Public, NSF grant 0964827  1. Introduction. Scientists and engineers are involved in studying ways to replace the carbon economy, which produces greenhouse gases, by the hydrogen economy, which produces only water. To this end fuel cells are at the center, because they convert to electricity the chemical energy of the catalytic reaction between hydrogen and oxygen. Beside electricity, water is the only product. Fuel cells are considered for portable, stationary and transportation applications. Major components of a fuel cell are: the fuel (hydrogen), the catalyst (Platinum), and the polymeric membrane that separates the anode and cathode sections.   Ernest Moniz declared in 2004 that more investments in basic energy sciences are highly recommended: "gray matter and greenbacks". These investments led to results. Dramatic improvements in the components of a fuel cell included methods for the generation of the fuel, hydrogen; a significant reduction in the amount of Platinum catalyst needed, from 80 g in the fuel cell (FC) stack in 2007 to 30 g presently; thinner membranes to reduce cost; and increased durability of the membrane. These innovations in chemistry and materials science meant that clean, affordable hydrogen-powered cars are becoming a reality.    The new reality was clearly shown at the 2015 Detroit and Washington Auto Shows    The proton exchange membrane (PEM) is an essential part of a fuel cell and its role is crucial: To separate the cathode and anode compartments, allow efficient proton transport from the anode to the cathode, and block the flow of reduced oxygen species from the cathode to the anode. The most commonly used PEMs for hydrogen and direct methanol fuel cells are perfluorosulfonic acid ionomers (PFSA), which are based on a Teflon-like backbone with side chains containing sulfonic groups; examples include Nafion, Aquivion, and 3M membranes. These materials exhibit excellent mechanical, chemical, and thermal stability in both oxidative and reductive media, and their performance is close to current DOE requirements for automotive applications. However, their stability is reduced in the highly oxidative medium of a fuel cell.  Membrane durability is a critical issue in fuel cell systems. Our research supported by NSF was focused on membrane durability and membrane stabilization.  This report consists of the additional parts: 2. Determination of the degradation mechanism of the FC membrane. 3. Human resources, group highlights, and outreach; 4. Group members and collaborations.  2. Determination of the Degradation Mechanism and Other Results.    The beginning of the grant period (July 2010) coincided with the development of the in situ method for the study of fragmentation of perfluorosulfonic acid (PFSA) membranes used in fuel cells (FCs), by insertion of a FC in the resonator of the electron spin resonance (ESR) spectrometer.    Using these methods it was possible to add important mechanistic details on the degradation of both perfluorinated and hydrocarbon membranes. In these in situ experiments we have detected and identified, for the first time, the presence of hydrogen atoms, H&bull;, as spin adducts of DMPO, during FC operation. Hydrogen atoms are expected to abstract fluorine atoms from the tertiary carbons of the PFSA membrane; theoretical studies by other groups have predicted the generation of the H&bull; atoms. However, H&bull; are short-lived and were detected only by the spin trapping methods developed in our group.    Visualizing very early events in the fragmentation process of perfluorinated membranes became possible by encapsulation of the fragments in the hydrophobic environment of &beta;-cyclodextrins and cucurbiturils.     Of great importance to the present report was the determination of a mechanism that explained the mitigating effect of Ce(III) addition on membrane fragmentation.    3.
