<AbstractNarration>Over the past two decades there have been many examples of &lt;br/&gt;results and insights in the Theory of Algorithms and Complexity that are motivated by,&lt;br/&gt;and inform, important research fronts in other sciences:  Quantum Computing, &lt;br/&gt;Markov chain Monte Carlo, and Algorithmic Game Theory are &lt;br/&gt;examples.  This project is about computational research&lt;br/&gt;whose purpose is to shed light to a broad front of central problems in &lt;br/&gt;Game Theory and Economics, Networking, and Biology. &lt;br/&gt;Aspects of this work involve devising algorithms for approximating &lt;br/&gt;Nash equilibria, or identifying computational impediments to the task;&lt;br/&gt;understanding better the power and limitations of learning and&lt;br/&gt;distributed algorithms for computing equilibria; exploring from the&lt;br/&gt;algorithmic standpoint the refinements of the Nash equilibrium concept, as&lt;br/&gt;well as of equilibrium selection processes, which have been&lt;br/&gt;developed by researchers in Game Theory over the past fifty years;&lt;br/&gt;coming up new, compelling, and computationally motivated solution concepts; &lt;br/&gt;identifying complexity-theoretic impediments to the central problem of characterizing &lt;br/&gt;the optimal multi-object auction, as well as developing algorithms and lower&lt;br/&gt;bounds for the problem of computing price equilibria in both the&lt;br/&gt;most general setting and in novel special cases of markets.  &lt;br/&gt;Further goals of this project in the realm of Networking include &lt;br/&gt;studying a recently  identified class of models known as ``networks of games;'' &lt;br/&gt;determining the extent to which sophisticated pricing schemes &lt;br/&gt;can improve the efficiency of selfish routing; and the analyzing two new &lt;br/&gt;genres of network models:  One for social&lt;br/&gt;networks, and one for financial markets. In Biology, a recent result &lt;br/&gt;established that natural selection under recombination optimizes not fitness, &lt;br/&gt;as it had been assumed for  decades, but a novel metric which we call ``mixability;'' &lt;br/&gt;this project shall follow on this work by devising techniques for proving mathematically &lt;br/&gt;this effect, as well as gauging rigorously its impact on Evolution, and and by exploring &lt;br/&gt;the relationship between recombination, mixability, and genetic modularity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is likely to produce new insights into both Computation&lt;br/&gt;and the target disciplines (Game Theory, Networking, Theory of Evolution), &lt;br/&gt;as well as new mathematical techniques.  In Algorithmic Game Theory, &lt;br/&gt;it seeks to make progress on some of the deepest and most looked at problems, but also to&lt;br/&gt;identify new exciting research fronts and directions in this field.&lt;br/&gt;In the Theory of Evolution, the effort is to shed light on some of&lt;br/&gt;the most fundamental and old questions of this important discipline.&lt;br/&gt;The insights from this work will be used in the development of graduate and&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate courses.  A substantial part of this project aims at&lt;br/&gt;understanding and improving the global information environment (the&lt;br/&gt;Internet, the worldwide web, and the digital social networks they&lt;br/&gt;enable), which is one of Humankind's most valuable resources.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Much of our work under this project aims at using computational ideas and tools to make progress in problems not just coming from computer science and technology, but also from other sciences, and in particular Economics and the Theory of Evolution.  There have been many points of contact between the fields of Economics and Computer Science, and this project was about research  in this exciting and productive interface.  Much of economic thinking revolves around predictions known as solution concepts, and by far the most well known and useful such concept is the Nash equilibrium, a situation (choice of probabilistic play by all players in a game) in which no player has an incentive to change his or her play.  In 1950, John Nash famously showed that all games have a Nash equilibrium, and this universality result has been an important factor contributing to the concept's prestige and wide use as a device of economic reasoning.    A decade ago, the PI's group (supported by a previous NSF grant) showed that the celebrated universality of the Nash equilibrium is suspect, indeed false in practice, by establishing that the problem of finding a Nash equilibrium is intractable (specifically, PPAD-complete, a conception of difficulty invented by the PI in the last 1980s at a first attempt to resolving this question).  The implication is that Nash's celebrated universality is suspect, indeed false in practice.  During this grant, the PI's group engaged in resolving several important questions posed by that result:  There is a progression of positive and negative results on the question of approximating the Nash equilibrium in reasonable time, inspiring hope that a resolution may not be far.   We also developed efficient algorithms for computing equilibria in a class of large games called anonymous games (as in traffic-related games: the identity of your playmates is not important, just their number).  And we have shown intractability results for the kind of game used in business schools, among others, for allocating fairly to students seats in classes.  Mechanism design is the field of economics calling for the creation of games in which selfish players of unknown types end up behaving according to the designer's specifications; auctions are a prime example, of major importance for the online industry.  One celebrated (and Nobel-lauded) result in this area is Myerson's characterization of the optimum auction for one item when the bidder's value of the item is independently distributed.  We explored whether this classic can be extended to the case of correlated bidders, and again we discovered a complexity obstacle:  It is intractable (this time NP-complete) to find the optimum deterministic auction in this context, and therefore there is no elegant, Myerson-like characterization that had been escaping us; surprisingly, when there are two bidders, there is a way of finding the optimum deterministic auction, and an elegant characterization through flows.  In another front, we point out that there are grave complexity impediments in the area of dynamic mechanism design, by showing that an extremely simple such mechanism is NP-complete to implement optimally.  In another strand of our work -- perhaps the most exciting -- we applied concepts from computation and game theory to help shed light in certain important questions in the Theory of Evolution.  In a PNAS paper in 2014 we pointed out that the evolution of a species, in its standard mathematical formulation through population genetics, is tantamount to a repeated game played between genes.  The repetitions correspond to generations.  The strategies of each gene/player are its alleles (variants), and the probability of play of each allele/strategy is its frequency in the current generation.  The utility of each gene coincides with the organism's fitness (that is, this is a game of coordination, not conflict).  Finally, and remarkably, the genes update their frequencies from generation to...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
