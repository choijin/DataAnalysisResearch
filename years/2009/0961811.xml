<AbstractNarration>Funds are provided for field work and subsequent lab study of the tectonic and magmatic evolution of an intraoceanic arc as characterized by the SE Marina Arc rifts  (SEMFR) and southernmost Marina Trough spreading center. A combined deep-tow sidescan sonar and dredging/wax-coring cruise is planned to the region. The recent discovery of volcanism in the SEMFR suggests that mantle wedge asthenosphere has been drawn into the rifts  and thus the PIs hope that their volcanic products may  more directly reflect variations in slab fluxes and mantle melting associated with varying P-T conditions and breakdown of hydrous minerals in the underlying slab. The regional bathymetric and geophysical data synthesis will allow the PIs to kinematically model rift evolution.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[             Water content strongly affects fundamental properties of oceanic mantle including its strength and melting behavior. The goals of the project were to examine effects of water on tectonic deformation of the lithosphere and mantle melting. The southern Mariana margin is a subduction zone where the upper plate is extending nearly parallel to the trench and the lower plate is subducting at a high angle to the trench (Fig. 1).  In this setting the subducting slab continually adds water to the overlying mantle wedge and upper plate so that effects of hydration on tectonics and volcanism can be examined.              The field program was conducted on R/V Thomas G. Thompson and the survey areas consist of two main focus areas: the southern end of the backarc spreading center, the Malaguana-Gadao Ridge (MGR), and the South East Mariana Forearc Rifts (SEMFR) (Fig.2). The areas were mapped with the shipÃ†s multibeam sonar and with deep-towed sidescan sonar imaging using the IMI-30 vehicle. Gravity and magnetic measurements were also made. Sampling was conducted in the survey sites by dredging and wax coring.               Unlike the axial valley structure that characterizes most of the Mariana Trough spreading center, the MGR at the southern end of the backarc basin forms a magmatically robust axial high.  Increasing spreading center magmatism with proximity to the arc volcanic front is a characteristic of backarc spreading and can be explained by several effects: (1) Increasing mantle water content lowers mantle solidus temperatures and promotes greater melting. (2) Direct capture of arc melts by the spreading center. (3) By lowering mantle viscosity, high mantle water content may promote additional melting through active buoyant mantle upwelling.  All of these effects may contribute to the fast-spreading axial high and magmatically robust morphology of the MGR despite actual slow spreading rates (Fig. 3).  Ship multibeam and deep-towed sidescan sonar data reveal an additional transformation along the MGR.  At its southwestern end the well-organized spreading center abruptly transitions to a diffuse zone of pervasive deformation and volcanism. This is indicated by the finely lineated tectonic structure of the seafloor superimposed with numerous small volcanic cones. Our working hypothesis for this transformation is that increasing mantle water content from the subducting slab eventually leads to a threshold weakening of the lithosphere so that a narrow plate boundary zone can no longer be maintained.  This effect contrasts with mid-oceanic spreading centers where mantle dehydration by melt extraction is proposed to strengthen residual mantle lithosphere and help focus melt to a narrow plate boundary zone.  In the supra-subduction zone setting of the MGR continual addition of slab-derived water may inhibit lithospheric dehydration and promote lithospheric weakening with diffuse tectonic deformation and distributed volcanism.              The survey of the SEMFR also showed distributed tectonic deformation and volcanism, with no apparent central source or axis (Fig. 4).  Volcanism there does not appear to be active at present. however, Rock samples are dated as 3.7 to 2.7 million years old. The recovered rocks have high water contents of about 2%, in contrast to typical mid-ocean ridge basalts with 0.5 % or less water. We hypothesize that volcanism was active at an earlier stage when the rifting area of the southern Mariana margin was narrower.  As the rifting region widened, mantle advection rates would decrease as would mantle temperature eventually suppressing melting. The SEMFR area is distinct from other forearc rifts where subduction is very slow or absent and narrow plate boundary zones develop.  We think that this contrast is determined by a high hydration rate and weak lithosphere leading to broad rifts at the southern Mariana margin whereas low hydration rates and stronger lithosphere lead to narrow spreading center...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
