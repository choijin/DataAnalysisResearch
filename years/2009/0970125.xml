<AbstractNarration>This award is for continuing support of a program pursuing fundamental investigations of physical phenomena relevant to interactions between light and matter. The program's focus is on understanding how geometrical and dynamical effects influence interactions between small molecules and light in the x-ray range of the electromagnetic spectrum. Studies of how x-rays ionize electrons from matter, previously performed by this program, have demonstrated quantitatively large breakdowns of a simple, yet fundamental, approximation used in such studies. These surprising results led to a minor paradigm shift within the scientific community regarding the general validity of this approximation. In separate studies of x-ray scattering from molecules, the program demonstrated the importance of ultra-fast atomic motion in such measurements. In the future, the program will enhance its focus on geometrical and dynamical effects in interactions between x-rays and matter by expanding to studies of chiral molecules (i.e., species that have mirror-image counterparts with the same chemical make-up) and C60, a novel soccer-ball-shaped form of pure carbon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One broader impact of this work will be to further fundamental understanding of x-ray interactions with matter. For example, x-ray interactions with atoms and molecules play an important role in a number of astrophysical phenomena. Understanding their fundamental behavior also is important to applications of x-ray absorption, x-ray photoemission, x-ray fluorescence, and x-ray scattering in many fields. Examples already exist in materials science, where the importance of certain molecular-scale effects went unnoticed until results from this program became known. This academic-based research program also impacts the training of young scientists. Since its inception in 1994, 14 post-doctoral researchers, 9 graduate students, and over 35 undergraduates have taken part in NSF-sponsored research. Many continued on to graduate school, academia, or industrial positions in science, and six of them continue to do research in the same field. Finally, to broaden the local impact, the research team will participate in a new outreach program at UNLV, designed to create partnerships with local high-school students and teachers.</AbstractNarration>

In recent years it focused on forming a basic understanding of how molecular geometry and dynamics influences interactions between photons and molecules. Evolution of the scientific program, among other, led to a focus on probing the limits of the dipole approximation in photoemission. For several years it was the only program in the world studying nondipole processes with soft x-rays, and it continues to be the most active.  One method of investigating dipole and nondipole effects used by our group involves measuring the angular distribution of photoelectrons using electron time-of-flight spectroscopy. Nondipole effects demonstrate themselves as an asymmetry in the angular distribution of photoelectrons as described within the dipole approximation.  The group has been successful in demonstrating significant nondipole effects in atomic and molecular systems, including the unique case of chiral molecules. A molecule is considered chiral if it has two possible arrangements of atoms (enantiomers) which are mirror images and non-superimposable. It has been predicted within theory that chirality influences the angular distribution of photoelectrons in a manner unique to their class, and our group has potentially determined that this may be a new form of linear dichroism, as the two enantiomers do not give the same angular distribution of photoelectrons.  A new capability in Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering (RIXS) was developed to become a second major focal area. This change was facilitated by construction of a new UNLV instrument capable of high-resolution RIXS from gaseous targets, with the unique ability to measure the polarization of the emitted x-rays. This evolution coincided with a tighter focus on the effects of geometry and dynamics in fundamental interactions between x-rays and matter.  This work at the ALS has demonstrated polarization-dependent Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering on isolated chlorine containing molecules as a new probe of molecular-field effects on the electronic structure.  Measurements performed at various angles between the polarizations of the incident and scattered photons allowed for sensitive determinations of the atomic-orbital populations within molecular spin-orbit states.  With the relative populations differing by molecule, indicating the make-up of each spin-orbit state depends upon the chemical environment. Thus, this linear dichroism measured via polarized RIXS offers a unique way to determine spin-orbit-component populations, providing a new experimental probe of molecular-field effects on electronic structure. This result is completely general, as it has been observed in a variety of molecules.     Building upon this discovery, we realized the determination of the 2pz atomic-orbital population could be used as a measure of electronegativity (&chi;) of the species bound to the chlorine atom.  In introducing this fundamental concept, Linus Pauling defined electronegativity as "the power of an atom in a molecule to attract electrons to itself." Unfortunately, there is no direct method to determine numerical values for electronegativity; they must be calculated, or derived from other chemical or physical properties. While numerous methods have been proposed, they all have their respective drawbacks, including PaulingÆs original method. In principle, one might expect the most direct correlations would be to electronic-structure parameters, because electronegativity, after all, r...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
