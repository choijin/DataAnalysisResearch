<AbstractNarration>With the support of the Chemical Catalysis Program in the Chemistry Division, Professor Matthew J. Allen of the Chemistry Department at Wayne State University will focus on the testing of hypotheses regarding the influence of anion dissociation and water coordination on catalysis and the synthesis of a new series of precatalysts modeled after lanthanide-based contrast agents for MRI. Additionally, the methods available to study dynamic structure-activity relationships of lanthanide-based precatalysts in aqueous systems will be greatly expanded through adaptation of luminescence-decay measurements and Oxygen-17 NMR spectroscopy. Furthermore, the data obtained using these techniques will be used to aid in the testing of hypotheses regarding the mechanistic influence of water coordination on asymmetric bond formation in the Mukaiyama aldol reaction using a series of new chiral precatalysts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a broader impact of the proposed research, Professor Allen will study the Mukaiyama aldol reaction because it is one of the most significant carbon-carbon bond-forming reactions, which are of paramount importance to synthetic chemistry. In addition to probing important problems in lanthanide-based catalysis, this proposal describes plans to improve education by mentoring early scientists and incorporating communication skills into scientific curricula. Specifically, year-round research experiences directly related to the scientific portion of this proposal will be provided for high school students from diverse educational and socioeconomic backgrounds, which are expected to have great impact on the propensity of students to pursue careers in science. Additionally, because communication skills are critical to a successful scientific career but are often underemphasized in science education, plans are outlined describing the integration of communication instruction into mentoring experiences and formal science courses at the university and high school levels. These programs will greatly enhance the otherwise standard science education of those who participate by more thoroughly preparing students for careers in science.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project studied catalysis in aqueous systems. Specifically it explored new methods of looking at metals that are involved in catalysis in water and new ligands that bind to metals that cause high levels of selectivity in catalysis. The metals that were studied included all of the lanthanides except radioactive promethium, and a great deal of focus was placed on the metal europium because of its luminescence properties. The catalytic reaction that was studied for the majority of the proposal was the Mukaiyama aldol reaction that forms a new bond between two carbon atoms. A thorough understanding of this reaction is important because it is used to make many important molecules including pharmaceuticals. With respect to Intellectual Merit, the studies that were part of this work used light to look at how much water is bound to metals involved in catalysis. The results demonstrated that factors including the identity and amount of co-solvents influence the binding of water. The results also demonstrated that changes in the binding of water directly influence catalytic activity. Furthermore, the new ligands synthesized as part of this work were used to perform some of the most selective catalysis in the presence of water reported for the carbon&ndash;carbon bond-forming reactions that were tested. With respect to Broader Impacts, the ability to study catalysis in water is a challenging and important area of research and our contributions are applicable to others who work under similar conditions.
