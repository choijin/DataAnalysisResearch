<AbstractNarration>This project will critically examine the convergence of these two recent trends in philosophical and scientific debates about the nature of the mind and its place in the natural world, the resurgence of metaphysics (the study of the fundamental nature and structure of the world) and the return of naturalism (the view that the methods and results of philosophy should be consonant with and informed by those of the empirical sciences).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall goal of the project is to break the stalemate in the debate between two types of physicalistic accounts of the mind, reductive and non-reductive physicalism. It will do so by situating the debate within the larger context of naturalistic methodology. Historically, this debate has assumed that one of two diametrically opposed positions is correct: Either psychology is reducible to biochemistry or psychology is completely autonomous. Contemporary, interdisciplinary research suggests that there is a more complicated reciprocal relation between psychology and biochemistry. Biochemical hypotheses are tested using data from psychology, which in turn prompts new biochemical studies that can be used to test and refine the psychological models. The PI will formulate and defend a naturalistic approach to philosophy of mind called inclusive physicalism that is designed to elucidate and exploit this reciprocal relation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One major component of inclusive physicalism is a general metaphysical framework that is intended to accomplish to goals. One goal is to delineate the space of possible outcomes in individual disputes about the metaphysics of mind (e.g., what the irreducibility of mental properties amounts to and the various relations that support it). The other is to offer a means of responding to abstract, general arguments which seek to show that such irreducibility is incompatible with physicalism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will also incorporate several case studies, including recent research on the biochemical and psychological mechanisms of placebo analgesia, in order to illustrate both the benefits of this framework and the reciprocal methodological process outlined above. These case studies will also demonstrate the practical importance of debates about reduction, which is often overlooked in the philosophical literature. Further, the project as a whole has the potential to improve the general public?s understanding of the relation between mental and physical properties, which could possibly lead to better treatment outcomes for widespread mental disorders.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project focuses on philosophical debates about the nature of the mind and its place in the natural world. The PI argues that these debates can be clarified and resolved by situating them within broader discussions about philosophical methodology and the relation between philosophy and the natural sciences. In particular, the PI argues that reflection on contemporary interdisciplinary work in neuroscience, cognitive, social and developmental psychology, epidemiology, behavioral genetics, and psychiatry (among other considerations) supports a naturalistic research program that the PI calls "natural born naturalism." Natural born naturalism overlaps with other naturalistic approaches to philosophy, which all endorse the claim that philosophy is continuous with the natural sciences, rather than serving as some prior "first philosophy" that grounds science. Natural born naturalism is distinctive in focusing on the reciprocal or "bootstrapping" process that obtains between disciplines and applying this process to naturalistic philosophy of mind itself.  When the philosophy of mind itself participates in this kind of feedback process between disciplines, the PI argues that natural born naturalism supports a metaphysical view of the mind called "inclusive physicalism." Like other physicalist views, inclusive physicalism holds that mental properties are determined, or fixed, by physical properties.
