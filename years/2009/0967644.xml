<AbstractNarration>Presently optical-lattice systems holding ultracold-temperature atoms may already be tuned experimentally so that they may behave either classically or quantum mechanically. In this work such systems are studied theoretically. For instance, it will be shown that the very act of monitoring the atoms may cause them to behave classically. The goal is to turn such observations into quantitative methods to analyze and engineer nanoscale devices that operate at the crossover between quantum mechanics and classical mechanics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research topics from this work are incorporated into both graduate and undergraduate courses and specialist scientists are trained, so that the project will contribute to the development of high-technology workforce. Scientifically, the project should help to build the basis for future nanotechnology.</AbstractNarration>
