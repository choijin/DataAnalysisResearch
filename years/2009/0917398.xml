<AbstractNarration>Computers are commonly used to perform numerical computation, but they can also compute symbolically.  Symbolic computation is required, for example, when instead of numerically simulating a system, the goal is to design or exhaustively verify a system.  Tarski's seminal result on decidability of the theory of reals showed that nonlinear constraints can be symbolically solved.  However, the currently available solvers are not designed for the features--scalability, expressiveness, and extensibility--that are required in practice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project develops a symbolic reasoning engine that is simultaneously efficient and expressive, and that includes nonlinear reasoning over the theory of reals.  The approach is based on integrating the theory of real  closed fields with existing theories supported by Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT) solvers.  SMT solvers are general-purpose, widely used, symbolic solvers, but they currently lack support for reasoning over nonlinear arithmetic.  Motivated by the application to verification of hybrid dynamical systems, this project explores an approach for reasoning in the theory of reals that can trade completeness for efficiency and can be integrated within existing SMT solvers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The availability of nonlinear reasoning in SMT solvers will make it easier, especially for users not skilled in symbolic methods, to routinely build applications that use symbolic reasoning.  It will enable several new applications spanning a wide spectrum of science and engineering, such as robotics, safety-critical control systems, embedded systems, and systems biology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ There exist efficient algorithms for reasoning about linear or convex constraints. Software tools that support such reasoning, such as linear or convex programming packages, are widely used.  When constraints are nonlinear and nonconvex, the situation is much different.  There is a new class of constraint solvers, called satisfiability modulo theory (SMT) solvers, that can reason about combinations of convex and certain nonconvex theories.  They are built over Boolean Satisfiability solvers and have been very efficient and useful in practice.  However, until a few years back, SMT solvers were unable to reason about nonlinear arithmetic constraints.  This project contributed to improving the techniques for reasoning about nonlinear arithmetic formulas.  It showed that by combining symbolic, algebraic, and numerical techniques, efficient reasoning engines can be developed.  Now, support for nonlinear arithmetic is available in several SMT solvers, and new and improved approaches for nonlinear arithmetic, based on combinations of interval-based methods and algebraic methods, are being developed and implemented by the larger community.  The availability of high-performance nonlinear reasoning engines is bound to have a profound impact across science and engineering.  As one particular application of nonlinear reasoning engines, this project developed formal verification techniques for cyber-physical systems that rely on linear and nonlinear reasoning engines.  The project also generated benchmark problems for nonlinear solvers.  This project contributed to the development of new software tools, including the HybridSal relational abstractor and the stand-alone nonlinear solver nlyices.  It also contributed to the development of the widely-used SMT-solver Yices 2 and to adding a new nonlinear solving capability in open-source computer algebra system Reduce/Redlog.  Publications, software tools, and other artifacts produced by the work are publicly available from the project website (http://www.csl.sri.com/users/tiwari/html/nsf0917398.html).
