<AbstractNarration>This award provides financial support for sixteen travel grants directed at scientists from less developed countries to attend the next IAPSO General Assembly that will be held in Montreal, Canada on July 19-29, 2009. The last 15 years have seen an explosion in information technology and a revolution in global communications. In oceanography there have also been exponential advances in measurement technology and in modeling, the advent of a new era regarding operational oceanography and newly established importance of interdisciplinary research. The general scientific program, and the specific IAPSO one, reflect these changes and can be found at: http://www.moca-09.org.  Priority will be given to young scientists, and scientists from developing countries and the former eastern blocks (USSR,Yugoslavia) to attend the Assembly. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scientific program encompasses the most recent advances in Oceanography, Cryospheric and Atmospheric Sciences. Below is listed just a sample of the IAPSO-only symposia to be held:&lt;br/&gt;in Montreal in 2009 :&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;P01 Mesoscale Ocean Eddies&lt;br/&gt;P02 Effects of Climate Variability on Nearshore Coastal Environments: Physical, Geomorphologic and Biological Interactions&lt;br/&gt;P03 Argo and Operational Oceanography&lt;br/&gt;P04 Overflows and Abyssal Currents&lt;br/&gt;P05 Physics and Chemistry of the Oceans : General Topics P06 Ocean Mixing Processes and Consequences &lt;br/&gt;P07 The Southern Ocean : its Physics, Chemistry, Biology and Links To the Global Climate System&lt;br/&gt;P08 Coastal Currents and Large Marine Ecosystems&lt;br/&gt;P09 Deep Ocean Exchange with the Shelf&lt;br/&gt;P10 The Variable Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation: Characteristics, Causes and Consequences for Climate&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is also a considerable number of IAPSO Symposia jointly with the other Associations, as it can be seen in the web site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The funding is important to allow students and young scientists to have direct interchanges with senior scientists and provides a forum for interchanges between the supported scientists with those from developed countries. Furthermore, the informal discussions outside the formal sessions have significant values, allowing for interactions one-to-one and for the establishment of scientific collaborations.</AbstractNarration>
