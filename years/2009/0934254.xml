<AbstractNarration>The University of Maryland is awarded a grant to upgrade the seawater filtration system at the Center for Environmental Science Chesapeake Biological Laboratory (CBL).  CBL is a center within the Chesapeake Bay for controlled aquatic experiments at mesocosm scales (&gt;1 m3) with emphasis in fisheries, restoration ecology, oceanography, and ecotoxicology.  The new filtration system will be sited in the new Fisheries Research Complex, which houses CBL's primary seawater system of 1400 sq. ft. net assignable space.   A principal requirement of the seawater system is highly filtered seawater to avoid the inadvertent influence of microbes, contaminants, and plankton that enters the seawater supply. During spring and summer ambient seawater contains extremely high concentrations of plankton, which exceeds the current filtration capacity and restricts seawater flow during these important research seasons. The award supports a variable flow, large capacity (300 gallons per minute) seawater filtration system to curtail introduction of plankton and other suspended materials down to 5 Âµm.  A dual-bank set up will save energy while demand is low, increase capacity during plankton blooms, and assure excess capacity for future upgrades to the seawater facility. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This facilities enhancement will increase educational opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students and support CBL's "K through gray" outreach and teacher training programs.  Through CBL's Visitors Center, thousands of students, policy makers, and members of the public have toured CBL's seawater facility, which engages visitors in displays on sturgeon conservation, sea grass restoration, Chesapeake Bay acidification, and other ongoing research.   The enhancement will also support critical research that continues to permit CBL faculty to provide environmental and living resource managers with scientifically sound advisory service. Past advisory service has resulted in more protective water quality standards (i.e., dissolved oxygen) for Chesapeake Bay living resources; improved fisheries management of blue crab, striped bass, menhaden, and sturgeons; evaluation of restoration potential for eel grass and oysters; and improved understanding of the benthic-pelagic coupling of nutrients and contaminants.</AbstractNarration>
