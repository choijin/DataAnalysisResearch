<AbstractNarration>PROJECT ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of Innuluataarneq research project is to develop, implement, evaluate, and disseminate a public health intervention in Greenland that focuses on Greenlandic ways of understanding and knowing about healthy behavior and sexually transmitted infections (STI). The target population for Innuluataarneq is 15 to 19 year old adolescents and their parents. Innuluataarneq will be conducted as an interdisciplinary international, collaborative community based participatory research (CBPR) study involving researchers and students from the United States, Canada, Denmark and Greenland. Innuluataarneq will be implemented in three communities in Greenland: Nuuk, Sisimut, and Tasiilaq. There are two components to Innulataarneq: 1) Component 1 will build capacity within Greenland to conduct CBPR projects that enhance community ownership in reducing STIs and empower communities in Greenland to partner with academic institutions to conduct research that resonates with Greenlandic knowledge and social and cultural practices; and 2) Component 2 will provide a socially and culturally relevant health education intervention to adolescents 15 to 19 years old and their parents in order to enhance awareness of STIs and their long term consequences &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are several elements to the intellectual merit of Innulataarneq. First, little is known about how cultural practices affect the transmission of STIs in the Arctic. Innulataarneq builds on our current STI research in Greenland, The Greenland Sexual Health Study, which is gathering information on the individual behaviors, social determinants, and cultural, historical, and political factors influencing the country?s high STI rates.  Second, CBPR has not been practiced in Greenland to address any social science or health question. Innulataarneq?s CBPR approach advances our knowledge and understanding of the practical application of CBPR methodologies in a socially and culturally diverse Arctic community such as Greenland. Third, the reproductive future of Greenland is in jeopardy due to the countries high STI rates and low birth rates. Innulataarneq will explore Greenlandic ways of promoting educational efforts to prevent STI?s  in order to secure Greenland?s reproductive future. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The relevance and importance of Innulataarneq to broader impacts in the field of social sciences and health related fields include the following: 1) Provide experience and training for students from indigenous populations in the United States, Canada and Greenland in the skills, techniques and knowledge needed to carry out community based participatory research on sexual health in Arctic communities; 2) Create a dialogue and build connections between institutions in the United States, Canada, and Greenland to foster a greater understanding of the importance of this health research in the Arctic; 3) Raise awareness about CBPR methods in Greenland, STIs, and culturally relevant ways of addressing this problem in an Arctic country; 4) Promote social science research that addresses health issues in Arctic communities; and 5) Documents and shares Greenlandic traditional knowledge and how it influences  sexual behavior in an Arctic community.</AbstractNarration>

They are concerned about pregnancy and they would like to see more collaborative partnerships in their communities to increase sexual health education for youth.   The extent to which InnulluataarneqÆs goals, objectives and activities response to the National Science Foundations broader impacts is outlined below.  Advance Discovery and Understanding While Promoting Teaching, Training and Learning. Inuulluataarneq provided experience and training for students from indigenous populations in the United States, Canada and Greenland in the skills, techniques and knowledge needed to carry out community based participatory research on sexual health in Arctic communities. It was our intention that by involving students in all phases of the research project they learned CBPR strategies and effective methods of implementing sexual health CBPR projects that they could adopt for their own future work either in Greenland or in their home communities.     Broaden Participation of Underrepresented Groups. Inuulluataarneq created a dialogue and built connections between institutions in the United States, Canada, Denmark and Greenland that fostered a greater understanding of the importance of sexual health research in the Arctic.   Broad Dissemination to Enhance Scientific and Technological Understanding. We presented our research findings at international and national conferences each year of the project. In total eight presentations at academic conferences were presented. In addition numerous local meetings with held in Greenland with community members, community leaders and key stakeholders to discuss with them the progress of Inuulluataarneq and get feedback from them on the projectÆs research results and strategies. In addition six publications have appeared in peer review journals regarding the projectÆs research results. In addition educational materials on sexual health were created for the Greenlandic people and educational vignettes were designed, produced and aired on Greenlandic national television.      Benefits to Society. Inuulluataarneq clearly demonstrated that among a young Inuit population living in remote sparsely populated Arctic communities increasing their ability to speak with a parent/guardian about sex can reduce sexual risk taking behaviors and STDs. Future areas of research in Greenland may consider further examination of family and kinship networks to promote sexually healthy decision making, consistent with traditional Greenlandic cultural practices in which a child is guided and taught by a collective of family members in a community.  The use of qualitative methods more in keeping with traditional forms of communication and information sharing in Inuit populations may provide a more accurate description of the issues influencing health. These findings are consistent with an emerging concern that classic western health research methods, ev...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
