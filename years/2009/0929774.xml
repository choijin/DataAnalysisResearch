<AbstractNarration>On its 125th Anniversary, science magazine published a list of unanswered science questions that scientists are actively exploring.  The High Adventure Science project tests whether using three fascinating and accessible Earth science topics from contemporary research is a replicable and sustainable strategy for increasing student interest in science and science careers and results in students learning important science concepts.  Students reflect on how science proceeds by being connected with aspects of unanswered questions using computer-based learning activities that rely on inquiry and connect them to frontier research for periods of about one week two or three times per year.  The structure and assessments used in the activities are designed to measure students' ability to reason using standards-based concepts.  Teachers are introduced to the materials using an online course that addresses the acquisition of pedagogical and content knowledge.  The combination of technology and inquiry is able to reach diverse students in under-resourced classrooms.  The evaluation uses a delayed implementation design to measure changes in student attitudes about science and science careers and their acquisition of science knowledge.</AbstractNarration>

The curriculum, therefore, helped students learn to make and defend claims, plus express their levels and sources of certainty with the claims.   The HAS research explored how studentsÃ† argumentation performances changed as a result of using the curriculum, to what extent students who learned with High-Adventure Science investigations made progress on scientific argumentation skills between the beginning and end of the school year, and in what specific ways studentsÃ† scientific argumentation skills progressed throughout the year.
