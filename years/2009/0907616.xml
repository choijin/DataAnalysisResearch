<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL: This project advances fundamental understanding of diffusion bonding in iron- and nickel-based alloys. Diffusion bonding could play a critical role in the development of the next generation of metal alloys used in power plants and turbines, as higher working temperatures will require careful control over metal alloy composition and microstructure. In this research results of experimental testing are integrated with the Ther-moCalc/DICTRA software packages and user-created MATLAB algorithms to create modeling tools capable of estimating the performance of diffusion-bonded joints. Increased demand for energy conversion efficiency means that components like heat exchangers and turbines must run hotter and last longer without a shutdown. A variety of nickel- and iron-based alloys can meet these demands using carefully controlled chemistry and processing. Fabrication and repair using these alloys demand development of robust joining methods that preserve properties in the region of the joint. Diffusion bonding is an excellent candidate for this purpose. The research employs a combination of microstructural analysis, mechanical testing, and numerical calculation to create tools that predict the properties of diffusion-bonded joints.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL: The educational structure of the program incorporates the current best practices of engineering education including hands-on activities, peer mentoring and practical applications of engineering theories. Undergraduate and graduate researchers collaborate in the research activities. The integrated research and educational objectives broaden access to engineering for students that might not have otherwise considered it while also improving the skills and expertise of those already enrolled. Educational activities including peer mentoring, collaborative high school/undergraduate design projects, a summer academy, and activities for underrepresented minorities. Native American students participate in educational activities as part of a larger program designed to attract and retain them in math, science and engineering. High school students that his-torically have not pursued engineering in college are targeted by a collaborative design project and summer academy. The program?s experimental tests and results will be integrated into at least four upper-division or graduate courses.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The primary goal of this work was to link processing parameters for the process of diffusion bonding to the resulting mechanical properties of the joints for use by designers of high temperature components.  This requires both experimental testing (room and high temperature) as well as numerical simulations for predictions of joint properties.  Ultimately, it was determined that the proposed scope of the project was not attainable due to the current state of thermodynamic and kinetic data available for numerical simulation of diffusion.  As a result, the focus of the project became primarily one of experimental joint fabrication and characterization with a limited amount of predictive numerical modeling.  Joints were fabricated using commercially pure titanium (with a copper interlayer) and commercially pure iron (with either a copper or Au-12Ge interlayer) that possessed room temperature strengths on the order of the base metal.  The bondline microstructures of these joints ranged from retained interlayer material, to a eutectic structure, to a continuous single phase.  Despite showing a desirable microstructure, very little strength was able to be achieved with joints fabricated from commercially pure nickel.  However, modeling simulations using commercially available software (ThermoCalc and DICTRA) were able to accurately simulate the diffusion process in nickel joints with copper interlayers.  When commercial alloys 321 stainless steel and Inconel 718 were diffusion bonded, the presence of the additional alloying elements significantly increased the complexity of the process, particularly during cooling.  The rate of cooling was found to have a significant effect on the room temperature strength of the joints.  The strongest joints were only able to achieve strengths on the order of 1/2 of the base metals.  High temperature creep testing of the stainless steel joints resulted in fracture of the bonded specimens during the initial high temperature soak and very little deformation prior to fracture.  No numerical simulations of the bonding of these joints was possible due to the complexities of the data required to account for the presence of all alloying elements.  Two graduate students (one PhD and one MS) very fully supported during the course of the project.  Two undergraduate researchers were supported. Three archival journal papers and five proceedings papers were produced.  In addition, results from the project were integrated into one graduate-level course and one undergraduate course.  Two weeklong summer engineering institutes were supported as well as a portion of three additional day camps.
