<AbstractNarration>Dr. Daniel King has been awarded an NSF Earth Sciences Postdoctoral Fellowship to develop an integrated program of research and education at Penn State University. The goal of this project is to develop our understanding of the micro-scale physical mechanisms and the geological implications of frictional healing. Specifically, this project will involve experimental investigation of the role of thermally-activated processes on the mechanical evolution of quasi-stationary synthetic fault gouge. Mechanical data and microstructural observations will be analyzed within the context of theory for both frictional sliding and intragranular plastic deformation. The proposed research will contribute to developing a more complete understanding of the relationship between seismicity and viscous flow at scales ranging from individual grains to plate boundaries. The results of this study are expected to increase our understanding of fault zone processes and the mechanics of earthquakes. Results from experiments on olivine fault gouge, a material for which little data on frictional properties exists, are especially important for developing a mechanistic understanding of earthquake processes in the oceanic crust. The proposed research also includes plans to directly involve undergraduate students in the proposed research by completing discrete portions of the project as senior research projects. These projects are designed so that students can gain general research skills and specific technical skills.  This educational component will also further the professional development of Dr. King by providing an opportunity to develop skills in advising and directing research projects.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[In this project we conducted a set of innovative experiments designed to better understand why some faults slide in a slow, stable fashion and some fail suddenly in a way that produces earthquakes.  This information is critical for understanding risks associated with natural fault systems, and it is also critical for predicting how subsurface environments will respond to engineering activities designed to alter the subsurface for hydrocarbon extraction, geothermal heat mining, carbon storage, mining and excavation, disposal of high level waste, or other subsurface activities.   We made a fine powder from high purity, natural olivine crystals to start with a natural, but relatively simple, material to use as a laboratory analogue for fault gouge.  New procedures were designed to load the sample material between two angled pistons in a unique apparatus designed to take the sample to high pressure and temperature conditions that simulate a fault at the depth where a earthquakes occur.  Tests in which the sliding velocity of the pistons was varied stepwise were conducted at different temperatures and pressures, which allowed us to identify at what conditions the material  would remain stable and at what conditions the material would become unstable (i.e., host a small "earthquake").  The results allowed us to identify two changes in stability as a function of temperature.  When the results are extrapolated to observed seismicity along a transform fault associated with the mid-Atlantic ridge, the experiments are consistent with the observed cutoff depth for seismicity.  We interpret that a change in deformation mechanisms at the small high-stress asperities between individual grains is responsible for this shift in sliding stability.   This work supported the career development of an early career postdoctoral researcher and an undergraduate student who completed an independent research project on a portion of the work conducted in this project.
