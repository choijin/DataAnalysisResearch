<AbstractNarration>The project addresses the relatively poor mathematics achievement of students who are not proficient in English. It includes research on how English Language Learners in beginning algebra classes solve math word problems with different text characteristics.  The results of this research inform the development of technology-based resources to support English Language Learners? ability to learn mathematics through instruction in English, including tutorials in math vocabulary and interactive assistance with forming equations from word problem text.  RAND-Education serves as the evaluator for formative and summative activities, guided by an advisory board of experts in mathematics education and English Learner education.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The nationÆs population is becoming more diverse and schools are increasingly serving large proportions of students who are English Learners (ELs).  Prior research indicates that English Learners have lower overall academic achievement than students who are native English speakers (English Primary) and that this achievement gap is found in mathematics as well as in reading.  The goal of this project was to explore the impact of instruction in a non-primary language on the mathematics problem solving of English Learners, add features designed to support English Learners to an existing online math tutoring program "AnimalWatch" (created with prior NSF support) and assess the effects on learning outcomes.      Project outcomes.  The results of several studies consistently indicated that solving math problems in a non-primary language had a negative impact on studentsÆ problem solving, independent of the demands of the mathematics processing needed to arrive at the solution.  Students performed better when math problems were constructed or selected to be "language-light" including comparable problems with simplified English, or problems translated into Spanish, or problems presented with more visual contextualized information. Results were used to guide the addition of new features (e.g., visual vocabulary; integrated glossary; math term drills) to the AnimalWatch tutoring software, and an evaluation study showed that the new features were associated with significantly improved learning for English Learners. Feedback from classroom teachers about the updated software was positive.     Intellectual merit. Although considerable prior work had documented the achievement gap for English Learners in math, the role of language was not entirely clear. Our results indicate that the additional cognitive demands involved by a non-primary language are independent of other factors such as math proficiency and effort.      Broad impact.  With the increase in schools in the proportion of students who are learning English, it is important to understand the factors that impede their progress and to develop new methods that can provide the additional support needed for these students to ensure that they are prepared to complete school and to be ready to join the workforce.
