DES scientists will use this map to determine the relationship between distant galaxies and the larger concentrations of dark matter in which they form and evolve and to extract the signature of dark energy that regulates how this large-scale distribution of galaxies and dark matter changes over cosmic time.

Over a five-year campaign from 2020 to 2025, DESI will create a three-dimensional map of the locations of tens of millions of galaxies and quasars throughout the Universe.

Under this award, NOAO initiated several major software projects to support astronomy research by a broad and inclusive community in the Big Data era. The NOAO Data Lab was created to enable efficient exploration, visualization, and discovery within large survey data sets through a software platform that lets astronomers bring their analysis to the data. In collaboration with the University of Arizona Department of Computer Science, NOAO also began work on a software system called ANTARES to enable discovery within real-time data streams for astronomical objects that move, explode, or vary in brightness from night to night.
