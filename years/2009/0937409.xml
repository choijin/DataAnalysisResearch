<AbstractNarration>Lavas covering about 2/3 of Earth's surface are erupted at submarine mid-ocean ridges, making it the most volcanically productive environment on the planet. This volcanism provides a major outlet for heat and matter in Earth's interior and plays a significant role in ocean chemistry and the ecology of deep sea marine life.  This project is focused on the timescales and rates of very recent magmatic and volcanic processes at mid-ocean ridges, with a focus on interdisciplinary integrated study sites of the Ridge2000 program and other sites of opportunity where seafloor eruptions can be detected and quickly sampled.  Radio isotopes 210Po and 210Pb are used and comprise the most important and reliable means to date young eruptions.  The half-life of 210Po is only 138 days, as such, samples for 210Po-210Pb analysis require immediate processing. The broader impacts of the work are enhancing infrastructure for science by upgrading laboratory facilities to accommodate more dates, making methodological improvements in the dating technique, and keeping the lab ready to conduct short-fuse lava dating for current and future time critical studies of submarine volcanism.</AbstractNarration>
