<AbstractNarration>This research is aimed at advancing the field of solar building design and simulation through the introduction of physical Building Information Modeling (BIM) and the study of its applications in solar buildings.  The project includes research on a novel physical BIM method for integrated solar building design and simulation, and the development and introduction of a new course using the physical BIM prototype tool for designing solar buildings.  The major objectives are to: (1) research the new method integrated physical BIM for holistic building energy simulation; (2) build a prototype of the method for solar building and simulation integrating photovoltaic, passive solar thermal, and daylighting systems; (3) test the BIM simulation results using benchmark simulations; (4) evaluate the usability of the method in architecture design classrooms; and (5) provide guidelines for software developers to create new tools for solar building and whole building simulations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Bruce K.
