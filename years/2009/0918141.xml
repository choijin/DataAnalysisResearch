<AbstractNarration>The project focuses on revealing and assessing the capacities (knowledge, abilities, ways of understanding and acting) needed by elementary teachers for productive use of mathematics curriculum materials. The project is guided by the assumption that well designed curriculum programs have the potential to contribute to improvement in mathematics learning opportunities in K-12 classrooms. Minimal research has examined the kind of knowledge and capacities necessary for teachers to use these resources productively. The project team will undertake research to examine and identify these capacities (referred to as pedagogical design capacity or PDC) and develop tools to assess them. A key resource to be developed is a tool to assess elementary teachers' knowledge of mathematics embedded in the representations and tasks in curriculum materials (Curriculum Embedded Mathematics Assessment [CEMA].&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The project includes interrelated development and research activities. The development activities include developing the CEMA and developing and refining tools for gathering data on teachers' use of curriculum materials. The research activities involve employing these tools to gather and analyze data on teachers' curriculum use and the capacities critical to it for the purposes of both refining the tools and developing a conceptual model of PDC. These activities are organized into 3 stages of work. The Instrument Design stage involves designing and testing the CEMA and developing and adapting other tools to collect data on teachers' curriculum use. The Instrument Pilot stage consists of a pilot study of 10 teachers' use of 5 different curriculum programs using all project instruments in order to refine them and develop an initial model of PDC. The Instrument Implementation stage involves employing the refined instruments to study 15 teachers' curriculum use in order to develop a conceptual model of PDC, which will guide future research and professional development. In order to consider the role that particular curriculum features and resources play in influencing teachers' use of the materials, each of the 5 programs will be analyzed during first stage.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ PROJECT GOALS     The goals of the Improving Curriculum Use for Better Teaching (ICUBiT) project (2009-2015) were to uncover the specialized knowledge and skills required for elementary teachers to use curriculum materials productively and to design methods of measuring it.     We use the term Pedagogical Design Capacity (PDC), taken from Matthew Brown (2009) to encapsulate skillful curriculum use.  Brown defined PDC as an individual teacherÆs ability to perceive and mobilize curricular resources in order to design instruction. Like Brown, we believe an individualÆs PDC depends on features of the particular resource being used. Curriculum materials provide teachers tools to guide instruction. Making sense of and using these tools places demands on teacher capacity; curriculum resources can also support teachers in this work.     The project included both research and development activities on teachersÆ use of mathematics curriculum materials. The development activities included designing and refining tools that allow researchers to gather data on and measure teachers' capacities and practices required for productive use of mathematics curriculum materials. The research activities involved employing these tools to gather and analyze data on teachers' curriculum use, and the capacities and supports critical to it. The tools developed, the conceptual model of PDC, and related research findings comprise the intellectual merit of the project.     RESEARCH TOOLS DEVELOPED       1.     Curriculum Embedded Mathematics Assessment (CEMA): assessment to measure individual teachers' capacity to identify the mathematical concepts and connections embedded in resources in curriculum materials.         2.     Voice of Curriculum Coding Scheme: a coding scheme to analyze the content of mathematics teacherÆs guides and the ways curriculum authors communicate with teachers.         3.     Suite of Analytical Tools for Studying TeachersÆ Curriculum Use.       RESEARCH FINDINGS    1.     Conceptual Model for PDC     Our model of PDC considers when and how teachers perceive and mobilize resources built into designed curriculum artifacts.  We observed this work occurring in two phases: preparation and enactment. When preparing instruction, teachers perceive curriculum resources by a) reading, b) interpreting, and c) evaluating the contents of curriculum resources in order to decide what to use and how to use it. Teachers interpret and evaluate what they read, using a variety of lenses and knowledge. A kind of knowledge that is important in this process, but has not been previously conceptualized is Knowledge of Curriculum Embedded Mathematics (KCEM), or the mathematics knowledge employed by teachers when reading, interpreting, and using mathematical tasks, instructional designs, and representations in mathematics curriculum materials.      Also, in the preparation phase, teachers mobilize what they read into plans for instruction. Teachers with high capacity a) identify the mathematical points of the lesson and design or orient instructional activities around these points, b) structure instruction within sequences that build on one another in mathematical and developmentally appropriate ways, and c) leverage key features and relevant guidance in the resource to shape their plans.     During enactment of instruction, teachers perceive and mobilize the activities of the lesson with respect to their instructional plans. They a) read students and the class as a whole, b) interpret studentsÆ actions, and c) evaluate their work with respect to their mathematical goals; they mobilize curriculum resources and their own repertoires to shape the instructional episodes in the lesson. During enactment, teachers also make in-the-moment design decisions based on their perceptions and mobilization skills.       2.     Findings on Curriculum Use    Our research on teachersÆ curriculum use identified the following key findings: a) Teachers are much more likely to r...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
