<AbstractNarration>Chemistry (12)&lt;br/&gt;SUNY College at Purchase is partnering with six local community colleges, Dutchess Community College, Nassau Community College, Orange County Community College, Rockland Community College, Sullivan County Community College, and Westchester Community College, to develop hands-on and virtual biochemistry laboratory experiences to prepare undergraduate students for further study or employment in STEM fields. With the acquisition of spectrophotometers at the community colleges and at Purchase College, and the additional acquisition of a fluorimeter and a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) instrument at Purchase College, faculty at these institutions are integrating state-of-the-art instrumentation into coursework, with the aim of providing students with direct experience in the techniques and applications of instrumentation commonly used in biochemical and pharmaceutical industries. Purchase College faculty are adapting two kinetics experiments for biochemistry students to utilize these instruments and also use greener processes, and they are developing a laboratory experiment for students in organic chemistry to study E2 elimination via UV-vis spectroscopy. The experiments are being used in laboratory courses at Purchase College and also at the community college partners. The three experiments developed through this project are being disseminated through presentations at conferences and publication in peer-reviewed chemical education journals. Faculty at Purchase College and Dutchess Community College are also working with the Teaching, Learning and Technology Center at Purchase College to develop interactive multi-media teaching modules to introduce this instrumentation to students at the six partner community colleges, in order to increase their exposure to biochemical instrumentation methods. Twelve faculty from the partner community colleges are receiving training on all of the instruments through a summer workshop, and the project team is setting up instrumentation with them on their campuses and providing follow-up support to the community college faculty during the academic year in using the instruments in their courses. Students from the six community colleges are also engaging in summer research experiences at Purchase College. The project evaluation is monitoring how many students are impacted, and is examining the extent to which the new laboratory exercises promote student understanding of the use of modern biochemistry instrumentation and the analytical methods they make possible, the extent to which the investigative curriculum promotes student engagement with and understanding of core biochemistry concepts, and the extent to which new curriculum modifications promote improved outcomes for independent student research projects. The evaluation is also studying the impact of the summer training on the community college faculty, the impact of the summer research experiences on the community college students, and the effectiveness of the multimedia simulations in promoting student engagement and learning outcomes and providing an investigative experience for students when they do not have direct access to the instruments.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This ambitious project partnered Purchase College with six surrounding Community Colleges and had two major goals.  The first goal was to aquire UV/Vis spectrometers, a UPLC, and handheld spectrometers.  The second goal was to train interested faculty on the use of these instruments in order to use them in new experiments in updated biochemistry and chemistry curricula.     The project has achieved its goals.  The requested instrumentation was purchased and installed at the earliest opportunity.  This was then followed by two workshops at which involved faculty were trained on the use of the instruments.  Faculty then included the instrumentation in new experiments in courses such as General Chemistry, Analytical Chemistry, Physical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Biochemistry and Senior Thesis.  The most significant outcome is that hundreds of students have gained access to state of the art equipment in the chemical sciences which has in turn impacted their own career goals.      The novel collaborative model for the project was particularly successful at allowing and encouraging students who started their academic careers at 2 years colleges to complete their degrees at a 4 year institution.  An important component of this process has been our annual "Bridges to Baccaluareate" summer program which encourages students from community colleges to perform a research activity at Purchase College.
