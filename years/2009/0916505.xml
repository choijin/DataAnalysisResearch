<AbstractNarration>Future communication networks are envisioned be dynamic reconfigurable at the physical,  label and routing layers forming a multiple layer communication  infrastructure. In the resulting  hierarchical structure each layer is a network on its own, having the flexibility to change the formation dynamically. There are also structural dependencies due to the multilayer infrastructure. For example, a link failure at a lower layer can impact multiple links at an upper layer. With dynamic changes in traffic demand, reconfigurability, and structural dependencies, future multilayer networks present new design challenges.  In this project, future multilayer network design is addressed by considering routing properties of different layer networks, layer dependencies, virtualization, topological reconfigurability, and resiliency. For this, new optimization models are developed. As the problems can be large due to interdependencies, new design algorithms are developed that exploit the special structure of the problems.  The exploration of multilayer networks with emerging technological possibilities leads to key insights that would benefit future networks in terms of efficient and robust network design, deployment, and operations.  Expected results include new design models and algorithms. Studies conducted will provide deeper understanding of the overall system dynamics in terms of interdependencies in layers and trade-offs on functionalities to be invoked in different layers. All research results will be made available to the scientific community.</AbstractNarration>
