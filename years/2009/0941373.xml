<AbstractNarration>Two central questions facing numerous fields will be addressed by this award:  "How does one reach rigorous quantitative conclusions when the science involves complicated numerical models and large scale data sets?" and "How can one use computational methods to point out new insights into what are the most important features, parameters and data?". To this end, a generalized statistical and visualization structure will be developed for the purpose of comparing and analyzing large-scale computational models to large heterogenous data sets. The codes, techniques, algorithms and methodologies applied to this project will be applied to critical problems in four different fields:  high-energy nuclear physics, astrophysics, meteorology and biology. By devising a flexible open-source framework, the products of this award will be extendable to numerous other problems in the natural or social sciences involving sophisticated simulations and complicated data structures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The way in which simulations and data are analyzed will be revolutionized by the capabilities developed by this work. Fundamental model parameters related to each of the four problems, such as the percentage of the dark matter in the universe or the viscosity of the quark-gluon plasma, will be stated with rigorous uncertainties. Methods will be developed and implemented for quantitatively stating which data were most important for constraining parameters or validating model assumptions. Furthermore, these same methodologies will be applied to assess the value of additional data, making it possible to quantitatively assess the potential of experimental upgrades or additional statistics. Students and postdocs will be trained in an emerging science centered around the analysis of complex systems. In addition to their own scientific discipline, they will be exposed to 21st century tools in statistics, computation and visualization.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes From Models and Data to Knowledge and Understanding The MADAI Collaboration, with members from Michigan State University, Duke University and the University of North Carolina,  was generously funded by the NSF to overcome a fundamental roadblock that hinders numerous fields of science. With collaborators from the fields of theoretical nuclear physics, theoretical astrophysics, atmospheric science, statistical science and vizualization, MADAI built generic toolsets for comparing large scale heterogenous data to complex multi-parameter numerically intensive models. The common goal, shared amongst these fields, is to determine model parameters from comparison with data given the infeasibility of exploring the high-dimension parameter by brute force of running the model at millions of points in parameter space.    The MADAI toolset addressed the problem through the technique of model emulators, which enables the model to be run at hundreds of points rather than millions, then using the observables from the full model runs performs a rigorous interpolation to determine observables at arbitrary points in parameter space. The toolset also provides tools that assist with the distillation of large-scale data sets to a tractable number of observables, or principal components.    The tools were applied across three distinct fields. First, the emulator was used as a surrogate for a model that simulates atmospheric effects model of wild fires. Secondly, numerically intensive models of galactic evolution were analyzed over a range of parameters and compared to astronomical observations to extract fundamental cosmological parameters. Finally, models of ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions were compared to data from the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider at Brookhaven National Laboratory and from the Large Hadron Collider at CERN.   As an example of the power of these methods, the Fig. 1 displays the equation of state of the hot vacuum as a function of temperature, or in this case the speed of sound as a function of temperature. The temperature range corresponds to that where matter transitions to the quark gluon plasma, and by considering the simultaneous variation of 14 model parameters, represents what is by far the field's most rigorous determination of the equation of state from experimental data.    Figure 2 provides an example of how MADAI's statistical tools reduced the parameter space of cosmological models by comparing mean stellar composition observations within galaxies, and halos in particular, to numerically intensive models of galactic evolution. Of particular interest in Fig. 2 is the parameter fbary, which describes the density of baryons in the universe.   These two examples represent only a small fraction of the possible applications of the MADAI toolset. The progress represented by these two analyses, both of which represent significant milestones in their fields, can be repeated in numerous other fields.
