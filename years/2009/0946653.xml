<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities: Departmental Multi-User Instrumentation program (CRIF:MU), Professor Robert K. Boeckman Jr. and Joseph P. Dinnocenzo of the University of Rochester will acquire a high sensitivity, ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with a modern liquid chromatograph (LC-MS), as well as electrospray (ES) and atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) ion sources.  It will be employed in a variety of research projects including the study of: a) the chemistry of group 14 cation radical intermediates; b) the design and development of novel chemo-enzymatic and chemo-biosynthetic methods; c) the chemistry and properties of complexes of the heavier platinum and coinage group elements; d) the discovery of new reactions for the synthesis of natural products; e) the properties of unsaturated, reactive complexes of iron that are catalytically active; and,  f) the activation of C-H, C-S, C-CN, and C-F bonds using isotopically labeled transition metal complexes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mass spectrometry (MS) is used to identify the chemical composition of a sample and determine its purity by measuring the mass of the molecular constituents in the sample after they are ionized and detected by the mass spectrometer.  Chromatography is an isolation technique that precedes the mass spectrometry analysis. It separates a mixture into its several constituent chemicals which are then analyzed by the mass spectrometer. These are widely used analytical techniques to identify and quantify the chemical composition of a sample. The acquisition will benefit undergraduate and graduate students through research programs in the Department and through utilization of the mass spectrometer in the undergraduate chemistry laboratories.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: x-small;">This NSF grant supported the acquisition of a state-of-the-art tandem liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC-MS) instrument. The new LC-MS instrumentation has represented a key resource for seventeen principal investigators and over 75 researchers, comprising postdoctoral scientists, and graduate and undergraduate students from the Department of Chemistry and other departments within the College of Arts and Sciences and the nearby School of Medicine and Dentistry, such as the Departments of Biology, Chemical Engineering, Biomedical Engineering, Biochemistry and Biophysics, and Dermatology. In particular, the instrument has provided an invaluable tool for the separation, isolation, and mass determination of a broad range of compounds, ranging from synthetic and natural organic molecules, synthetic and recombinant peptides, proteins, engineered enzymes, metalloproteins, and oligonucleotides, in the context of a variety of different projects in the user groups' laboratories. In line with the different research areas in which these groups are engaged, this NSF-supported project is having an impact on a wide range of disciplines, from bioorganic and bioinorganic chemistry, to synthetic methodology development, natural product chemistry, material science, biomedical engineering, and drug discovery research. The LC-MS instrument is maintained as an open access instrumentation which is used directly by the graduate, undergraduate, and postdoctoral researchers, after receiving appropriate training from specialized personnel. Because LC-MS is a key analytical technique in both academic and industrial settings, this project has contributed to creating invaluable opportunities for professional training of these students on the use of a sophisticated analytical instrumentation of central value in modern chemical, biochemical, and engineering sciences. This NSF project has also worked synergistically with other educational and outreach activities of the Department.
