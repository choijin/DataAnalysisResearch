<AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009&lt;br/&gt;(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the California Polytechnic University, Pomona (Cal Poly Pomona or CPP) Phase II Noyce project is to increase the number of highly qualified elementary, middle, and secondary mathematics and science teachers in two partner districts (Pomona Unified School District and Hacienda-La Puente School District) by providing Noyce scholarships to 20 STEM majors supported for up to two years, including the postbaccaluareate credentialing year. Given the urban, high-need, and highly diverse nature of these districts, the overall recruiting strategy focuses on finding candidates from underrepresented groups who exhibit a passion for teaching and a commitment to working in high need schools. This project expands the pool of Noyce Scholarship recipients to recruit STEM majors into elementary teaching as well as secondary teaching and to recruit engineering majors into teaching.  Freshmen and sophomores receive internships to participate in summer enrichment programs including migrant programs focused on robotics, the Biotrek experiences, Project Lead the Way Institutes, and the San Gabriel Valley Math Project.  The freshmen and sophomore mathematics, science, or engineering majors work with faculty on collaborative projects targeted at school-age students. The intent is to provide them with a glimpse into the teaching of science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) content in an informal setting.  In addition, the proposed program leverages the Phase I program scholar support activities by creating a range of enhanced collaborative support mechanisms for Noyce Scholars. There is coordinated support for intern teachers prior to their receipt of the full credential and increased emphasis is placed on the coordination of partner district and CPP support during the induction period. Project activities include building a professional learning community with scholarship awardees to support their success in content preparation and in the professional education program. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
