<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plants initiate interactions with soil microbiota through root exudation.  Thus, manipulating root exudation of plants presents a unique opportunity to influence soil microbial communities in a manner that will ultimately benefit plant/crop health. This project will provide such tools by characterizing a mutant (Atpdr2) of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana coding for an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter in which the ratio of sugars to secondary metabolites in the root exudates is altered compared to the wild-type (wt).  We found that when Atpdr2 is grown in native Arabidopsis soils, a complete overhaul of the microbial community compared with wild-type Arabidopsis roots is seen. The Atpdr2 mutant promotes the growth of beneficial bacteria, such as plant growth and promoting rhizobacteria (PGPRs), nitrogen fixers and bacteria involved in heavy metal remediation.  First, the project will address the influence of root-secreted chemical compounds and families from Atpdr2 and wt plants on the growth of beneficial soil microbes within the native microbial community. The second objective of the project is to characterize the Atpdr2 mutant to determine mechanisms used by the mutant to alter the ratio of sugars and secondary metabolites exuded by roots. These studies are transformative because they will provide mechanistic knowledge to develop new approaches by which crops can be genetically manipulated to culture soil microbes for beneficial purposes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide training for undergraduate and graduate students, and a post-doctoral trainee in research activities.  These activities will be complemented with career development and mentoring workshops particularly targeted to graduate students and postdocs.  In addition, the project will provide summer research and training activities for minority undergraduate students from the John Jay College of Criminal Justice of the City University of New York and educational activities for elementary students in Fort Collins.  In the third year of the project, a colloquium will be conducted to discuss science, energy issues, third-world country involvement in energy topics, intellectual property, and international treaties related to microbial diversity.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project has made significant findings related to the interaction between plants and their root-associated microbiome (community of microbes).  For instance, we found that plants secrete blends of compounds in the root exudates that are differentially produced at distinct stages of development to help orchestrate the composition of the root-associated microbiome.  It appears that this microbiome is providing specific benefits to the plant. These benefits range from defense against pathogens to acquisition of nutrients from the air and soil.  In this project, we additionally discovered that the root-associated microbiome could modify the chemical composition of the leaves to make them less appealing to insects.  Natural products and synthetic chemicals have traditionally been used as biocides to deter the growth of harmful microorganisms. While the purpose of a microbial biocide is to kill harmful organisms it is usually not target-specific and could be harmful to the beneficial flora of a particular biome. Thus, there is a need to develop pipelines that will allow the screening and identification of chemicals as inducers of beneficial microbes as compared to biocides. Accordingly, this project found that compounds derived from the root exudates when applied to the soil in the absence of a plant could modify the microbiome in predictable manners.
