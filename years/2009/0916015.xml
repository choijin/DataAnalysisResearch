<AbstractNarration>People rely on two types of trust when making everyday decisions:&lt;br/&gt;vertical and horizontal trust. Vertical trust captures trust&lt;br/&gt;relationships between individuals and institutions, while horizontal&lt;br/&gt;trust represents the trust inferred from the observations and opinions&lt;br/&gt;of other peers. Although significant benefit could be realized by&lt;br/&gt;combining horizontal and vertical trust mechanisms, they have evolved&lt;br/&gt;independently in computing systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on developing a composable trust model capable of&lt;br/&gt;tightly coupling vertical and horizontal trust in a manner that is&lt;br/&gt;both amenable to formal analysis and efficiently deployable.  This&lt;br/&gt;research advances the state of the art in trust management through a&lt;br/&gt;series of innovative results, including the design of a unified&lt;br/&gt;framework for specifying composite trust policies and the design and&lt;br/&gt;analysis of efficient algorithms for policy evaluation. The composite&lt;br/&gt;trust management approach championed by this project also enables&lt;br/&gt;policy authors to move beyond simple proof of compliance to identify&lt;br/&gt;the "top-k" preferred users satisfying security policies including&lt;br/&gt;subjective assessments.  The beneficiaries of this research range from&lt;br/&gt;administrators of traditional computing systems who can better&lt;br/&gt;incorporate previous history into their decision-making processes, to&lt;br/&gt;users in social networks who can more carefully manage the exposure of&lt;br/&gt;their personal data.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ People typically rely on two types of trust when making everydaydecisions: vertical and horizontal trust. Vertical trust capturestrust relationships between individuals and institutions, whilehorizontal trust represents the trust inferred from the observationsand opinions of other peers. Although significant benefit could berealized by combining horizontal and vertical trust mechanisms, theyhave evolved independently in computing systems. This project focusedon developing a composable trust model capable of tightly couplingvertical and horizontal trust in a manner that is both amenable toformal analysis and efficiently deployable.  In conducting thisresearch, advances have been made in a number of important areas:  Policy Language Development: CTM is a flexible language for   specifying composite trust management policies that enables the   arbitrary composition of vertical and horizontal trust assessments.   In addition, efficient techniques have been developed for   evaluating CTM policies in distributed systems.  These techniques   are based on novel combinations of logical and relational reasoning. Reputation Sampling in Distributed Systems: Much work has been done   on designing reputation-based trust functions for decentralized   systems. Although such trust functions have been proven to be   useful for trust establishment between peers with prior knowledge   of each other, many of them require the collection of all feedback   reports before trust evaluation. Access to complete feedback   information may not always be possible, however, due to either   prohibitive communication cost or prevention from domain specific   policies. This project has initiated investigation into how to   evaluate one's reputation when only a limited amount of information   can be collected, and has developed strategies for robustly and   efficiently bounding the uncertainty introduced during the   reputation sampling process.   Query Privacy: To date, most work on query optimization has  revolved around generating highly efficient plans for executing   user queries.  However, when dealing with distributed and   decentralized databases---such as those used to store the attribute   and reputation assertions upon which trust management systems are   based---controlling the ways in which (potentially sensitive)   information flows during the query evaluation process also becomes   quite important.  This project began with an initial investigation   of the means by which private information can flow from the user   issuing a query to operators of the distributed knowledge bases   being queried.  This led to the development of a new definition for   querier privacy, called (I,A)-privacy, that is applicable to   general distributed database systems.  (I,A)-privacy constraints   are both amenable to formal analysis and precise enforcement by   users without requiring server-side support.  (I,A)-privacy   protections have since been implemented within distributed query   optimizer for use with the PostgreSQL database system.   This work made inroads to a number of technical challenges associatedwith specifying and managing composite trust management policies.Furthermore, the results regarding robust reputation sampling andquery privacy have applications that extend beyond trust management tobroader classes of distributed data management applications.
