<AbstractNarration>Pay-as-you-Go investigates security and privacy for Integrated Transportation Payment Systems (ITPS).  The research addresses integrated payments for trains, subways, buses, ferries, and recharging of electric cars, as well as toll collection for roads, bridges, and tunnels.   Multi-disciplinary aspects include novel cryptographic protocols and lightweight implementations of privacy-preserving payment systems.  Challenges include providing security and privacy in a low-cost, usable, and reliable manner.  Payments for transportation differ significantly from general-purpose e-commerce in terms of both security and engineering constraints. For instance, transportation operators wish to observe user behavior to improve the overall performance of the system---seemingly contradicting privacy.  Moreover, payment devices must be extremely cheap, mass produced, and tolerant of a wide range of passenger demands.&lt;br/&gt;The expected results and activities include: (1) design of novel cryptographic algorithms achieving privacy at low cost while retaining the benefits of meaningful data collection for ITPS; (2) implementation of hardware and software to perform modern cryptographic operations on low-cost devices; and (3) testing of human factors and performance under realistic conditions that must balance security and privacy with cost and usability. The broader impacts are extensive as transportation systems are a critical part of most aspects of society, from the economy, to defense, to public safety. Moreover, information gathered from ITPS applications can facilitate advanced traffic management, travel time estimation, emergency management, congestion pricing, carbon emissions control, and environmental justice assessments. A substantial outreach plan builds on the research team?s significant experience working with transportation professionals in industry and government.</AbstractNarration>

ITPS includes payments for trains, subways, buses, and ferries as well as toll collection for roads, bridges, tunnels and payments for parking and recharging of electric cars.

Although there is a wealth of cryptographic literature proposing secure and anonymous payment schemes, the application to the transportation domain differs significantly from general-purpose e-commerce in terms of both security requirements and engineering constraints.  For instance, payment devices for transportation systems must be extremely cheap: they need to be produced in massive quantities (often millions of tokens per year) and are often only used for a short time (in extreme cases, one-time use). As a result, many sophisticated cryptographic techniques are much too computationally intensive to be used in such devices. Until recently, the desire for user privacy has seemed to be at odds with the cost constraints. Additionally, transportation operators want to be able to observe certain aspects of user behavior in order to improve the overall performance of the system, and this also seemingly contradicts privacy.  Our Pay-as-you-Go approach has demonstrated that it is possible to get privacy at a low cost while retaining the benefits of useful data collection.    This is a multi-institution project, and this brief report only covers the highlights of the activities carried out at Brown University. Our focus here at Brown was on the cryptographic protocols thrust of the project.  Namely, we developed novel cryptographic algorithms for ITPS applications whose efficiency is suitable, and that allow for collecting useful data and yet guarantee privacy at the same time.  Specifically, our team looked at adapting electronic cash (ecash) to the Pay-As-You-Go application scenario. In an ecash system, a user can withdraw coins from the bank, and then spend each coin anonymously and unlinkably. At first, we considered adapting existing schemes to our needs.   In the literature, there were two main approaches.  One was to use ecash that was based on anonymous credentials (the PIÆs past work).  The benefit of this approach was that it had a proof of security.  The main drawback, however, was that the underlying algorithms are not efficient enough for extremely low-weight and low-power devices that one would typically be able to carry in oneÆs wallet and use in transportation.  We still looked at how these schemes could help us, and our work resulted in expanded feature sets for anonymous credentials (based on controlled-malleable signatures, appeared in CSF 2014) as well as a breakthrough result in delegatable ecash (appeared in PKC 2015).  The other ecash approach is to use the scheme called UProve, due to Brands.  UProve is very efficient, but does not have a proof of security.  Our first order of business was to see if any security guarantees could be given for UProve.  Unfortunately, our result was negative.  Although we could not find an attack on UProve, we also discovered that it could not have a proof of security using conventional techniques: if one could prove UProve secure, one would have to do it using a revolutionary approach.   This work appeared in Asiacrypt 2013.  Thus we decided that UProve was unusable for our purposes.  So we ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
