<AbstractNarration>With the support from the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry Program, Professor Christer Aakeröy of the Department of Chemistry at Kansas State University, will establish versatile supramolecular design strategies based on site-specific intermolecular interactions, by determining how relatively small molecules prefer to bind to each other.  In particular, the team will (i) design and synthesize ditopic molecules that utilize tunable halogen-bond interactions for constructing supermolecules and co-crystals with pre-determined motifs and stoichiometries; (ii) determine how hydrogen bonds and halogen bonds can be made to operate side-by-side in a hierarchical fashion in the assembly of binary and ternary co-crystals; and (iii) establish whether hydrogen-bond/halogen-bond based synthetic methodologies can be informed by a systematic analysis that integrates experimental thermodynamic data with calculated binding energies.&lt;br/&gt;Chemistry is the science of communication and change, and these interrelated processes are primarily initiated and controlled by reversible interactions between molecules.  A better understanding of these inter-molecular forces can be refined into versatile pathways for improving processing, performance and shelf-life of a wide range of specialty chemicals such as pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, agrochemicals, semiconductors, dyes, and energetic materials.  Students who participate in this research will obtain an interdisciplinary foundation that will prepare them particularly well for scientific challenges that arise at intersections of biology, chemistry, and materials science.  The research team contains a high proportion of women and minority students, and all group members are expected to attend and present their work at scientific meetings as frequently as possible, and results from this research will therefore be disseminated quickly via conferences and peer-reviewed publications. To further broaden outreach efforts, the PI will participate in campus-based programs that specifically offer research opportunities for female high school students and undergraduate minority students, respectively.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The overriding theme of this project is geared towards improving our understanding of how molecules recognize and bind to each other, and how they exchange information with a view to making functional materials that are faster, cheaper, or more effective than current alternatives.  As part of this project we have developed a facile synthetic path to a family of chemical compounds known as oximes, some of which are used as nerve-agent antidotes or in the polymer industry.  Our oxime synthesis is environmentally-friendly with high yields, short reaction times, and almost solvent-free, and the work-up can be carried out effectively using a simple aqueous-based procedure.  We have also prepared a series of molecular "hosts", essentially shaped as cups or vases, that can either be combined into molecular capsules or used as transport vehicles for up to four æguestsÆ.  The capsules can, in principle, protect and transport a variety of guests and they can be made to upon up and release their "cargo" in response to external stimuli.  We have identified key characteristics (related to the electrostatic charge) within a variety of molecules that make them more or less likely to bind to a specific target.  The strength and frequency of occurrence of binding can also be dialed up or down using relatively simple modifications to each molecule.   Eight students supported by this project have graduated (five Ph. DÆs, one M.S. and two B.Sc.Æs) and to-date we have disseminated our results through two dozen peer-reviewed publications and over twenty-five presentations at national and international conferences.  As a direct result of the work produced during this project we have signed collaborative research agreements with two of the largest producers of agrochemicals in the world, where we will seek to develop new technologies for more efficient and environmentally-benign delivery of pesticides/ herbicides and fertilizers.   We are also expanding our interest in green chemistry with additional efforts towards facile and solvent-free synthesis.
