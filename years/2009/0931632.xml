<AbstractNarration>This NSF award provides support for a CPS Virtual Organization.  The National Science Foundation established the Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) program with the vision of developing a scientific and engineering foundation for routinely building cyber-enabled engineered systems in which cyber capability is deeply embedded at all scales, yet which remain safe, secure, and dependable -- "systems you can bet your life on."  The CPS challenge spans essentially every engineering domain.  It requires the integration of knowledge and engineering principles across many computational and engineering research disciplines (computing, networking, control, human interaction, learning theory, as well as mechanical, chemical, biomedical, and other engineering disciplines) to develop a "new CPS system science."  Achieving such an ambitious goal is challenging.  The objective of the CPS "virtual organization" (CPS-VO) project is to actively build and support the multidisciplinary community needed to underpin this new research discipline and enable international and interagency collaboration on CPS.  In support of the CPS-VO, Vanderbilt University  will work with the community to develop strategies and mechanisms to: (i) facilitate and foster interaction and exchange among CPS researchers across a broad range of institutions, programs and disciplines, (ii) enable sharing of knowledge generated by CPS research with the broader engineering and scientific communities, sharing and integrating experimental tools, platforms and simulators among researchers and stakeholders, (iii) facilitate and foster collaboration and information exchange between CPS researchers and industry and (iv) facilitate international collaboration on CPS research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ After an initial concept formation period between 2006 and 2009, NSF/CISE launched the CPS Program with an entirely new scientific and technological agenda that offers revolutionary solutions to major problems of society including energy, health, environment, climate, and economic development. The core challenge has been the formation of a new system science for engineering heterogeneous networks of physical and computational processes. Solution to this challenge creates convergence across engineering and computing disciplines, and requires new approaches in education. Recent industrial initiatives, such as the international Industrial Internet Consortium (IIC) in the US, the Industrie 4.0 in Germany and the emerging Internet of Things (IoT) technologies across industrial sectors provide evidence that CPS has a disruptive effect on markets as well.  The Cyber-Physical Systems Virtual Organization (http://cps-vo.org) was founded by NSF in 2010 to:  facilitate and foster interaction and exchanges among CPS PIs and their teams; enable sharing of artifacts and knowledge generated by these research projects with the broader engineering and scientific communities; and facilitate and foster collaboration and information exchange between CPS researchers and industry.   Since its inception, the CPS-VO has become the focal point of the CPS community in the US, and it has played a significant role in catalyzing CPS research world-wide. The CPS-VO Portal serves as a central information repository and as a collaboration platform for this rapidly growing research community. The VO provides a home for +200 special interest groups, has almost 12,000 registered members, serves approximately 24,000 individual web pages and hosts about 30,000 files that capture and document the CPS community?s history.      While this original grant has now expired, recently a follow-on grant was awarded by NSF (award #1521617) to continue development and growth of the VO.  Future goals of the VO are concentrated on the following.    Despite the original success of creating a CPS research and education community, significant gaps still remain in enabling cross-disciplinary work, tight interaction between academic and industry research and transformation in education. The critical missing link is integration platforms that allow experts to develop models, methods and tools that can be integrated into design flows together with other open/commercial tools, and to enable designers to immediately use them. The central objective of future research in this initiative is to transform the CPS-VO from a collaboration platform and a passive repository of information into an active resource that provides access to tools and methods emerging from the CPS research community.  As the VO continues to evolve and grow, we expect to transform the portal from a place where one goes to "find things" into a platform where one goes to "do &amp; build things".
