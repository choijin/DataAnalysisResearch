<AbstractNarration>0944307/Conway&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a project to use the Roosevelt Island ice core as a glaciological dipstick for the eastern Ross Sea.  Recent attention has focused on the eastern Ross Embayment, where there are no geological constraints on ice thickness changes, due to the lack of protruding rock "dipsticks" where the ice sheet can leave datable records of high stands. Recent work has shown how dated ice cores can be used as dipsticks to derive ice-thickness histories. Partners from New Zealand and Denmark will extract an ice core from Roosevelt Island during the 2010-2011 and 2011-12 austral summers. Their science objective is to contribute to understanding of climate variability over the past 40kyr. The science goal of this project is not the climate record, but rather the history of deglaciation in the Ross Sea. The new history from the eastern Ross Sea will be combined with the glacial histories from the central Ross Sea (Siple Dome and Byrd) and existing and emerging histories from geologic and marine records along the western Ross Sea margin and will allow investigators to establish an updated, self-consistent model of the configuration and thickness of ice in the Ross Embayment during the LGM, and the timing of deglaciation. Results from this work will provide ground truth for new-generation ice-sheet models that incorporate ice streams and fast-flow dynamics. Realistic ice-sheet models are needed not only for predicting the response to future possible environments, but also for investigating past behaviors of ice sheets. This research contributes to the primary goals of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet Initiative as well as the IPY focus on ice-sheet history and dynamics. It also contributes to understanding spatial and temporal patterns of climate change and climate dynamics over the past 40kyr, one of the primary goals of the International Partnerships in Ice Core Sciences (IPICS).  The project will help to develop the next generation of scientists and will contribute to the education and training of two Ph.D. students. All participants will benefit from the international collaboration, which will expose them to different field and laboratory techniques and benefit future collaborative work.  All participants are involved in scientific outreach and undergraduate education, and are committed to fostering diversity. Outreach will be accomplished through regularly scheduled community and K-12 outreach events, talks and popular writing by the PIs, as well as through University press offices.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project was to use measurements of gases trapped in the Roosevelt Island ice core to create an age scale (that is, age vs. depth) for the core.  The Roosevelt Island ice core is part of the Roosevelt Island Climate Evolution (RICE) project, and international effort lead by a group in New Zealand.  Roosevelt Island is a small island in the Ross Sea, Antarctica, covered by an ice cap.  The ice deposited at Roosevelt Island records the history of the Ross Sea region, including the impact of lowered sea levels during the last ice age on the grounding and thickening of ice in the Ross Sea.  The demise of this ice at the end of the last ice age may have been important for changes in sea level globally, and possibly impacts of freshwater input to the ocean on climate.  The climate variations recorded in the Roosevelt Island core also will contribute to our understanding of how climate varied across the entire Antarctic Continent over the last 40,000 years, a major international goal.  The age scale was created by matching the variations in gas concentrations and ratios of isotopes of gases, to other ice cores where the age vs. depth scale is well known. A highly detailed data set of methane concentrations and the 18O/16O ratio of atmospheric oxygen was created and use for this purpose, matched to data from the recently analyzed WAIS Divide ice core in Antarctica.  The age scale extends to approximately 67,000 years and also shows that older ice is preserved at the base of the ice cap.   The initial results have been reported at the American Geophysical Union meeting in Dec. 2015 (Lee et al., Abstract PP51B-2285: The Roosevelt Island Climate Evolution (RICE) ice core: climate and ice dynamics of the Ross Sea, West Antarctica).  A paper describing the results is in the final stages of preparation.   This funding contributed to the training of graduate student James Lee and to international research collaboration.  The results provide an age scale that would otherwise not be obtainable for this ice core and will underpin a large number of other studies.
