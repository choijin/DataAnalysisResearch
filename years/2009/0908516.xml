<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for a three year continuing award to support a Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) in Engineering Site program at Stanford University, entitled, "Stanford Engineering Research Experience for Teachers (SERET)", under the direction of Dr. Sheri D. Sheppard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SERET program, an integrated center of excellence at Stanford University, will focus on the multi-disciplinary nature of engineering by placing a total of 25 STEM teachers in grades 6-14 in one of nine engineering departments and 49 independent labs, centers and institutes on campus for an 8 week summer hands-on research experience.  This summer program will be followed up by development of engineering-based lessons to help students bridge to real-world experiences by showing how concrete and applicable engineering concepts connect what is learned in school to what goes on in the outside world.</AbstractNarration>
