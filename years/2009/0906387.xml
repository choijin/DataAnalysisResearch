<AbstractNarration>The focus of this project is the analysis of limit laws for certain stochastic growth models.  The main growth model considered is the interacting particle system called the asymmetric simple exclusion process.  This model is a widely studied model in probability theory and theoretical physics since it is one of the simplest models of nonequilibrium behavior that exhibits nonclassical fluctuations.  In this project the asymmetric simple exclusion process will be studied for a variety of different initial conditions.  The methods use ideas from Bethe Ansatz, Yang-Baxter equations as well as techniques from operator theory and combinatorics.  Generalizations of the model to more than one species will also be part of the project.  It is expected that these limit laws will have a "universal" behavior; and will, in fact, describe the fluctuations in a much larger class of growth models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project involves the study of current fluctuations in the asymmetric simple exclusion process for a variety of initial configurations.  This is a model of interacting particles on a one-dimensional lattice.  The model has attracted wide attention from both mathematicians and physicists since it is one of the simplest models to incorporate far from equilibrium behavior with nonclassical fluctuations.  These fluctuations are expected to have a new universal behavior similar in their applicability to the famous bell-shaped curve (the Gaussian distribution) of classical probability.  A long-term goal of research in this area is the establishment of new limit laws similar in nature to the classical central limit theorem.  Already these new universal distributions are being applied to various problems in growth processes, population genetics, and finance.  This project will extend our knowledge of fluctuations to a much wider class of growth models.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The main emphasis of the PI's research has been in the area of stochastic integrable models and their closely related versions as interacting particle systems.  In particular the PI has analyzed the continuous time Markov process called the asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP).  ASEP is one of the simplest, nontrivial stochastic models in which to study transport phenomena and stochastic growth processes.  Another central reason to study ASEP is that it is closely related, in a certain scaling limit, to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation.  The KPZ equation is a nonlinear stochastic partial differential equation for the (random) height function of a randomly growing surface.  The KPZ equation is expected to describe a large class of stochastically growing interfaces.  Two main questions involve the limiting shape of the growing interface and the fluctuations about the limiting shape.  The limiting shape can be viewed as a strong law of large numbers and the fluctuations a central limit theorem.  The classical central limit theorem---the famous bell-shaped curve---describes situations where the underlying process consists of independent (or very weakly dependent) random variables.   For many stochastically growing interfaces the underlying random processes are highly dependent and we no longer expect a classical central limit theorem.  Much recent theoretical and (some) experimental work lead one to conjecture that the Tracy-Widom (TW) distributions and their generalization to the Airy processes are the new universal distributions.  Many explicit calculations for a class of integrable models have shown this to be the case.  Work of the PI together with Harold Widom on ASEP has produced exact formulas for height function distributions for two classes of initial conditions.  Other groups have used these exact results of TW to prove that the TW distributions are the limiting distributions (large time) described by the KPZ equation.  Experimental work of Takeuhi and Sano has confirmed the appearance of TW distributions in a laboratory setting.  In this project various aspects of ASEP were examined for a variety of initial conditions.  Generalizations to different particles (multiple species) as well ASEP on the half-line were analyzed.  These projects involved several graduate students---some since graduated with postdoctoral positions and others still working towards their PhD.  The broader impact of the analysis and occurence of the TW distributions and their generalizations is considerable.  TW distributions are now routinely used in multivariate statistical analysis of data arising in population genetics, financial mathematics and medicine.  Here is a quote from a web-based article from the McGovern Institute for Brain Research at MIT:  "In our recent work we show that the modularity of random networks follows a transformed version of the Tracy-Widom distribution, providing for the first time a link between module detection and random matrix theory."
