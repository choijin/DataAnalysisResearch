<AbstractNarration>0954991&lt;br/&gt;Lenhart &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Natural organic matter (NOM), the product of natural biological and chemical processes, is a heterogeneous mixture of organic molecules of varying size and reactivity that is ubiquitous in nature. NOM controls the environmental fate of contaminants and particles and this career development plan will elucidate specific details of how NOM acids of environmental significance influence the fate of lead and nanoparticulate iron oxides in soil and ground water systems. The specific research objectives are to: (a) characterize the coordination structures of NOM acids at iron oxide/water interfaces and determine how the acids influence lead coordination at the same interfaces, and (b) relate the coordination modes and structures of NOM acids at iron oxide/water interfaces to the resultant transport of nano-sized iron oxide particles through porous media. The research will combine atomic-, molecular-, microscopic-, and macroscopic-level techniques with hydrodynamically-active experiments in order to provide direct information of unprecedented detail on lead speciation and nanoparticle transport as influenced by NOM. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will elucidate specific detailed information of NOM coordination at mineral interfaces. Current reactive transport and chemical speciation models do not appropriately account for these interactions and produce erroneous predictions. The role that different components of NOM, namely acids of known structure and those of heterogeneous structure, have on determining heavy metal behavior will be determined. Research on the transport of nano-sized hematite through porous media in the presence of NOM will contribute to the emerging fields of environmental nanoscience and nanotechnology and will provide information needed to assess the risk of nanoparticles in the environment. The novel combination of macroscopic-, microscopic-, molecular-, and atomic-level techniques for NOM and lead adsorption will provide information of unsurpassed resolution.  In addition to the direct benefits to contaminated site management and particle transport, the detailed information collected from this work will also benefit research on in situ contaminant remediation and water treatment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Solving the critical environmental problems our society faces will require a concerted effort by scientists, engineers, and policy makers with widely varying backgrounds. Preparing these individuals for such a task requires an educational system that places emphasis on providing all students with a sound foundation in the natural and physical sciences as they apply to the environment. The goal of this educational plan is to establish a framework to impart sound environmental science and engineering concepts to multiple components of the STEM pipeline, from middle school through graduate school and to students across a spectrum of ethnic, social, and gender groups. To meet this educational goal the PI will perform outreach to K-12 teachers and students through professional development and electronic videoconferencing initiatives, integrate undergraduate and graduate students into multi-disciplinary teams, and enhance learning outcomes in graduate and undergraduate courses by incorporating real-world examples, team-based assignments, and professional practice topics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The integrated research and education efforts will reach a wide audience, and through outreach and recruitment activities, will increase the participation of diverse groups in science and engineering. Outreach initiatives will reach out to K-12 students and teachers in the local community and across the country.  Dissemination of the scientific results will be wide and will contribute to the fields of environmental engineering, environmental chemistry, surface chemistry, and aqueous geochemistry.  New course components will incorporate critical skills such as team-work, leadership and problem-solving thereby better preparing students for professional success upon graduation.  The improved mechanistic and structural information of heavy metal speciation in heterogeneous systems will benefit society by improving site remediation and management practices.  The details on the transport of the nano-sized hematite will also provide specific information needed to develop a regulatory system to manage the discharge of anthropogenic nanomaterials.  Finally, it is expected that closely coordinating the research, educational and outreach activities will foster a greater awareness among all participants of the importance and application of research and engineering in society.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The outcome of this project advanced understanding of natural organic matter interactions with mineral interfaces and education in environmental science and engineering.  The project emphasized how the coordination of naturally occurring organic ligands influenced the subsequent physical and chemical properties of the underlying mineral surface, with an emphasis on the common iron-oxide mineral, hematite.  Studies with this mineral as a nano-sized particle or macro-sized crystal were conducted using a combination of bench-scale experiments, advanced spectroscopy, chemical modeling and flow-through transport experiments.  These studies provided details into how different naturally occurring organic ligands modified the properties of hematite thereby changing (1) its ability to interact with contaminants and (2) its mobility in soil and solution when present as nano-sized particles.   The contaminant examined in this research was lead.  This reflects that its historic and nearly ubiquitous use in leaded fuel and paint and widespread presence in industrial sites resulted in it being a very common pollutant in the soils of urban environments.  Thus, this research enhanced our understanding of the fate of lead in urban soils and the subsequent risk it poses to human health by explicitly evaluating how the coordination of different categories of organic ligands to hematite subsequently alters the coordination of lead to the same surface.  From our results we observed in the presence of a variety of organic ligands that lead uptake by hematite was enhanced at pH values below approximately 5, while above this pH value lead adsorption was reduced by certain acids (e.g., citric acids) but not others (e.g., humic acid).  Evaluation of the coordination environment of lead in these systems using synchrotron-based x-ray techniques indicated that regardless of the organic acid in the system that the binding of the lead to hematite reflected the detailed structure of the hematite surface being evaluated and not the properties of the organic acid.  Interestingly, this was counter to our results showing that slight differences in organic ligand structure produced different adsorbed structures at the hematite surface.  What this suggests is in models used to simulate the fate of lead in soils that the influence of naturally occurring organic acids can be described with a relatively simple set of parameters that are independent of the nature of the specific organic acids present in the system as opposed to an extended parameter set tailored to the properties of each organic ligand.  The influence of natural organic ligand adsorption on particle mobility and aggregation reflected a strong dependence upon system pH and the properties of the organic acid.  For example, the aggregation of hematite in the presence of humic acid across a broad range of system conditions was hindered much more than it was in the presence of citric acid.  This likely reflects the heterogeneous nature of humic acid as well as its larger molecular size when compared to citric acid. This difference in size and reactivity is manifest in different coordination modes of the organic ligand at the hematite surface that in turn alters the properties of the hematite to a different extent.  Similar results were observed for particle transport where the modified properties of the hematite particles in the presence of organic acids resulted in more rapid transport through porous media than in the absence of organic acids.  This result has implications for improved understanding of particle transport and aggregation in the environment as particle surfaces in natural systems are known to be coated with organic matter.  Using collaborations established with researchers utilizing state-of-the art x-ray techniques, the project improved research capabilities in environmental science and engineering by extending research techniques employing single-crystal x-ray reflectivity to study interfacial reactions under more environmentally relevant conditions that included iron oxide surfaces and natural organic ligands.  This technique was also coupled, for the first time, with particle-based x-ray absorption spectroscopy and the combined techniques provided much more detail of the coordination environment of lead to hematite than previously known.  This has important implications for not only improving our understanding of the fate of lead in the environment but also better understanding the fundamental properties of environmentally important minerals like hematite.   The outreach and education efforts of the project reached a diverse audience of students and teachers and enhanced the participation of underrepresented groups in science and engineering.  Educational efforts enhanced student learning in environmental engineering through the development and integration of course materials in undergraduate courses in water chemistry, introduction to environmental engineering, and fundamentals of environmental engineering and graduate courses in environmental surface and colloid chemistry.  Outreach efforts leveraged partnerships established with individuals at COSI, Ohio State University?s College of Engineering and the City of Columbus to extend environmental engineering concepts to a diverse audience of K &ndash; 12 students, parents and teachers through video broadcasts, hands-on activities and lectures.
