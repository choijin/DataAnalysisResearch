<AbstractNarration>This project is designed to provide scholarships to students enrolled in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) majors over a five-year period. Students receiving these scholarships are majoring in biology, chemistry, mathematics, physics, engineering, or computer science.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The objectives are to recruit more students into the STEM disciplines, to provide elevated levels of support and opportunities for these students, to guide them towards graduation with an associate degree and into transfer programs allowing them the opportunity to receive their baccalaureate degrees, and to expand the support structures and enrichment activities developed by this project to be accessible to all STEM students. While the scholarship recipients are being selected by a committee from candidates identified from a state-wide recruitment plan, the primary focus is on applicants from the local region who have demonstrated academic potential and financial need. Recipients of the scholarships are each paired with a faculty mentor who works closely with them. Students are placed in cohort groups, taking as many classes as possible together. Enrichment opportunities include research experiences, department seminars, field trips, assisting in K-12 science/math classrooms, and social activities with departmental faculty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact are threefold: 1) additional STEM professionals are graduating and accepting positions in the scientific community, 2) the enrichment programs developed by the project are being made available to other students, and 3) faculty collaborations across departments, institutions, government, and industrial/scientific partners are increasing.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In June 2010, Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College (ABAC), a two-year institution, received notification from the National Science Foundation (NSF) that it had been awarded an S-STEM grant for approximately 5 years.  This award provided two-year scholarships and support activities for students majoring in STEM fields with a desire to pursue a career in research leading to a Ph.D. in a STEM discipline. NSF provides these grants in an effort to increase the number of students pursuing research fields in order to replace the rapidly retiring U.S. STEM workforce.  The title of the grant was 'Achievement through Student Support and Experiential Training in Science (ASSETS) Scholars Program'. The two major student components were support activities and an opportunity to engage in undergraduate research.  ABAC?s NSF proposal included the following support activities and research exposure to enhance the student success rate and guide them toward a research career.  1) Faculty Mentor - mentoring of scholars, where each scholar was assigned a science or math faculty mentor to help them focus on goals and provide guidance. 2) Seminar Program - speakers on various STEM topics made presentations during fall and spring semesters. 3) STEM Affiliates - a club for both ASSETS and non-ASSETS STEM majors with leadership provided by ASSETS scholars. Club members worked on projects and provided support for recruitment activities for future STEM majors. 4) Community of Student Learners - ASSETS scholars were grouped together in courses to facilitate bonding and improve understanding/success in classes and labs. 5) Travel Program - travel opportunities were provided for educational field trips, recreational field trips, and discipline meetings/conferences.  6) Undergraduate Research Program - scholars were matched up with researchers, and worked on research projects under the guidance of the researcher.  The first year, 2010-11, was difficult because the late notification of project award made it difficult to find qualified scholars who had not already accepted other scholarships. In retrospect, it would have probably been best to delay a year and have all program components completely worked out before selecting the first scholars.  In all years, the selection of scholars occurred through an orderly process of review of application materials, rank ordering of applicants based on academic performance and career goals, and interviews of top applicants by the selection committee.  Because of financial aid issues, it was difficult to select a full slate of scholars each year. As a result, the program continued for a total of seven years rather than five with the last two years being unfunded and operating from unused grant funds.  A total of 82 students participated in the program, 14 graduated, 13 transferred to other institutions, and 88 percent maintained program requirements.  The success rate was affected by two major events that occurred during the grant period.  First, the S-STEM grant received was for two-year college programs and in 2011 ABAC transitioned from a two-year to a four-year institution. Second, a new BS in biology degree was implemented and many ASSETS students selected to participate in this program which prolonged their time.  The original award allowed for scholars to participate two years.  Modifications had to be made, with NSF approval, to adjust to the four-year time frame and BS programs that were now in place.  As a result, not as many students graduated as might have been expected in a two-year environment and the percent success based purely on graduation rates or transfer to other institutions was not as high.  All this change in the middle of an award with specific requirements was difficult, but strong support and guidance from NSF allowed program modifications to be implemented which resulted in a some very positive outcomes.  As students remained longer it seemed appropriate to continue support beyond two years for outstanding scholars.  One-year scholarships were implemented in year four of the program with a modified but thorough selection process and from that point forward, juniors and seniors could apply for one of these scholarships.  Having more mature juniors and seniors in the program and their desire for more research experience proved to be a positive influence on the freshman and sophomore scholars.  Through out the seven years, faculty support was outstanding.  Almost every faculty member served as a mentor to one or more scholars, faculty chaired and all served on committees that planned and implemented the support activities, and most faculty members participated in the fall scholars' reception and in the end of the year social.  The S-STEM award combined with the institutional transitions resulted in a very positive change for ABAC Science/Math and the college as a whole.  A new lab science complex was built and occupied, exceptional scholars have gone on to graduate programs, and faculty are more student-oriented and are including more students in research.  The ASSETS scholarship program is over but it's impact continues.          Last Modified: 09/09/2017       Submitted by: Ray N Barber]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
