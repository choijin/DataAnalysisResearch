<AbstractNarration>Pettit/0948247&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a project to study of the relationship between fabric and climate for the ice near the EPICA Dome C ice core site, East Antarctica. The work builds on an ongoing study at Siple Dome, West Antarctica and takes advantage of collaborations with European scientists and access to the Dome C borehole to make measurements of sonic velocity.  The intellectual merit of the project is that a better understanding of how fabric preserves past climate information can improve models of the ice flow near ice core sites and the interpreta-tion of ice core data (particularly paleo-accumulation), and it may allow us to extract climate information directly from fabric data.  In addition, because ice deformation is sensitive to the orientation of crystals, ice flow patterns are sensitive to the fabric. Thus, variations in the fabric between glacial and interglacial ice can affect how ice deforms and how fabric in the ice sheet develops.  The Dome C site is particularly important for answering these questions, because the ice core shows evidence of eight glacial cycles, not just one as found at Siple Dome or the Greenland sites.  The research will improve the understanding of the proxy relationship between sonic-velocity data and fabric; will help to model the pattern of ice flow caused by the fabric variation between glacial and interglacial time periods using these data, existing ice core chemistry and existing and new thin section data, improved surface strain data, and borehole deformation data; and will help to better understand the positive feedback mechanism that enhances fabric (and corresponding rheological) variability through a focused study of several climate transitions and the associated fabric changes.  Borehole compressional-wave sonic-velocity will be measured which will complement the sonic-velocity data that already exist for boreholes in Greenland and West Antarctica.  These will be the first sonic-velocity measurements in East Antarctica and the first measurements that extend for more than a single glacial/interglacial transition.   The project will ultimately contribute to better interpretation of ice core records for both paleoclimate studies and for ice flow history, both of which connect to the broader questions of the role of ice in the climate system. This project will also strengthen the international collaborations within the paleoclimate and ice sheet modeling communities. This project will partially support a graduate student at the University of Alaska Fairbanks who is currently working on modeling ice including anisotropy and it will support the growth of a young scientist through a Post-Doc position. This Post Doc will gain important experience collaborating with the EPICA scientists in studying the climate-fabric relationship. Erin Pettit is active in field-science education for high school students, under-graduates, teachers, and adults. This project will help support the continued development and enhancement of Girls on Ice a program that encourages young women to explore science and the natural world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Introduction  Dome C (75oS and 123oW) is the site of an ice core that was drilled by the European Project for Ice Coring in Antarctica (EPICA). This core records over 800,000 years of climate history &ndash; the longest record we have yet recovered. Our work contributes to the interpretation of deformation history and accumulation-rate history of the surrounding ice. Of particular interest, the core contains eight glacial-interglacial cycles. These layers of ice from different ice ages and interglacials behave differently, with "softer" ice sandwiched between "stiffer" ice. This sandwiching of layers of different properties means that whole ice sheet will flow differently depending on the layers, perhaps even causing folding and disturbance of layers downstream. The goal of our project is to understand the link between the climate history and this layered softness or stiffness of the ice. We can do this through measuring the speed of sound in the ice.  The value of sonic logging and fabric studies  The specific goal of our project was to measure the velocity of sound through ice, which tells us about the effective viscosity of the ice (the viscosity is the measure of the softness, or fluidity). Each ice crystal has a layered structure &ndash; similar to a deck of cards. And it is much easier to shear an ice crystal along the molecular layers than to deform it any other way. Because of the 'slipperiness' of shearing along the layers within the ice crystal, the orientation of ice crystals matters.  The orientation of a single crystal is defined by its c-axis, the vector that points perpendicular to the molecular layers. Crystal fabric, then, is the statistical distribution of c-axes directions. Deep in an ice sheet, the deformation tends to rotate the crystals until most of the crystals have their layers oriented horizontally and c-axes oriented vertically. In this deep ice, the viscosity is different depending on whether you are shearing or squeezing the ice. As the ice in an ice sheet continues to deform, ice fabric continues to evolve. Fabric thus serves both as a record of ice sheet dynamics, and it influences modern deformation. Understanding the deformation and dynamic history at an ice core site is critical to interpreting ice core records &ndash; in particular the accumulation rate history.  We measure crystal fabric by measuring the velocity of sound through the ice because ice crystals transmit sound waves at different speeds depending on the orientation of the molecular layers. We can then compare this measurement to thin slices ("thin sections") of the ice observed through crossed polarizing lenses to further understand the fabric that are measured every 10-50m.   We have also modeled the evolution of crystals undergoing change due to stress in the ice sheet. This model is currently being embedded into a full ice sheet model, which will help predict future changes in the ice sheet.  Intellectual merit and broader impacts  This study is the first sonic-log based crystal fabric study of ice in an ice core that goes back 800,000 years. The interplay between climate, crystal fabric, and ice rheological behavior is a mostly uninvestigated area that may prove critical for characterizing and modeling ice sheet dynamics. Spatial variations in fabric may influence folding and disturbance of annual layering. This analysis and modeling of the role of viscosity in ice deformation on the microscale has contributed to better inputs and parameterization for the physics of ice flow for full ice-sheet models.  This project provided training for a postdoctoral researcher and two graduate students. One graduate student completed his Ph.D. in computational physics related to this project and is now a computational physicist for Oak Ridge National Laboratories.  In addition to providing research training, all researchers on this project gained teaching experience and provided inspiration for young students. Through different collaborat...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
