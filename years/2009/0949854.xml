<AbstractNarration>Nutrient Co-limitation in Young and Mature Northern Hardwood Forests&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Temperate forests have long been thought to be nitrogen (N) limited, but chronic N deposition from air pollution should reduce N limitation over time, and theory suggests that ecosystem productivity should be co-limited by multiple nutrients. Experimental tests of N vs. phosphorus (P) limitation in temperate forest systems are lacking.  This study will combine modeling and field studies to explore processes mediating nutrient colimitation in relation to successional change in managed hardwood forest ecosystems.  An improved understanding of ecosystem optimization of resource use, including the maintenance of co-limitation, is important to forest management, environmental protection, and basic scientific knowledge. Balanced nutrient cycling is essential to maintaining forest sustainability, and scientists and managers at the White Mountain National Forest will evaluate silvicultural practices in light of results from the proposed research.  For example, their forest management plans require justifying intensive harvest removals in terms of the ability of forests to acquire nutrients for regrowth.  Feedbacks such as the biological enhancement of mineral weathering when nutrients are limiting are clearly relevant to this appraisal.&lt;br/&gt;The Multi-Element Limitation (MEL) model represents co-limitation from the perspective of resource optimization theory and ecosystem biogeochemistry. We have extended the model to include P as well as N, carbon, light, and water, and applied it to simulate primary and secondary succession in northern hardwood forests. Using nutrient additions of N alone in some forest stands, P alone in some forest stands, N+P in some forest stands,  in replicated stands of three ages (~20, 30, and &gt; 100 years) at the Bartlett Experimental Forest in New Hampshire, we will test the patterns of resource limitation predicted by the model and multiple mechanisms of allocation of effort to acquire N and P.  Specifically, the model predicts a greater response of aboveground productivity to N+P than N or P alone. In older stands, it predicts a greater response to N than to P addition, but in younger stands, the model suggests that the supply of N from detritus should be sufficient to create P limitation.</AbstractNarration>

That is, increasing availability of N is expected to increase tree growth, presumably by increasing leaf-level photosynthesis. However, growth of some forests, especially in early succession, may be limited by availability of phosphorus (P) rather than N. Moreover, the mechanism of aboveground growth response to increased availability of either nutrient could be partly driven by shifts in tree allocation of photosynthate to aboveground growth rather than belowground to roots and to microbes involved in nutrient acquisition. These shifts in belowground carbon (C) allocation should subsequently slow decomposition and lead to accumulation of soil organic matter.</p> <p>This portion of this collaborative project examined how availability or scarcity of macronutrients N and P affect plant allocation to root production and other belowground processes, and whether these changes affect accumulation of soil C. Nutrient addition experiments were initiated in 2011 in 13 stands in the White Mountains of New Hampshire, spanning three sites expected to vary in background nutrient availability: Bartlett Experimental Forest, Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, and Jeffers Brook. All three sites contained stands of contrasting successional stages: &ldquo;mature&rdquo; (81-127 years in 2011) and &ldquo;mid-aged&rdquo; (32-42 years); Bartlett Forest also had &ldquo;young&rdquo; (20-25 years) stands. Four large plots were established in each stand and assigned a fertilization treatment: 30 kg N per hectare per year, 10 kg P per hectare per year, both N and P, or unfertilized control. Measurements during a pre-treatment year (2010) characterized root biomass, total soil respiration (TSR; CO<sub>2</sub> released by roots, mycorrhizae, and decomposers), belowground C allocation, and soil C and N stocks to 50 cm depth.</p> <p>Before fertilization, fine root biomass was higher in mature than in early successional stands, but did not vary consistently across the natural fertility gradient. In contrast, TSR was highest in stands with the lowest N availability, and it decreased as N availability increased. Similarly, belowground C allocation decreased strongly with increasing soil N availability. Thus, plant allocation belowground clearly depended on background site fertility. Neither forest floor nor total soil C stocks varied consistently with soil N or P availability, but both increased as soil pH decreased. &nbsp;</p> <p>After 2-3 years of fertilization, TSR decreased significantly in response to N and NP addition in 6 of the 13 stands; TSR increased in some other stands, though not significantly. Site N availability pre-fertilization explained much of the cross-stand variation in TSR responses to fertilization: TSR decreased in the stands with low N availability and tended to increase in stands with high N availability. After six years of fertilization, N additions decreased TSR across all 13 stands, although the responses in individual stands varied.</p> <p>After 5-6 years of fertilization, forest floors were larger in N- and NP-addition plots than in P-addition or control plots across eight re-sampled stands, although responses varied by stand. These results are consistent with the observed N-induced decrease in belowground allocation, with apparent reductions in allocations to organisms that acquire N through decomposition of litter and soil organic matter.
