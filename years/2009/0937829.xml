<AbstractNarration>This research project aims to understand and develop systems for&lt;br/&gt;maintaining superlinear indexes for streaming data.  A superlinear&lt;br/&gt;index provides search capability over an abstract space that cannot&lt;br/&gt;easily be linearized (totally ordered). In contrast, a linear index,&lt;br/&gt;typified by a B-tree, supports point and range queries on totally&lt;br/&gt;ordered data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Examples of superlinear indexes include multidimensional indexes,&lt;br/&gt;which can be over a geometric domain, such as geographic data, or&lt;br/&gt;which can be over multiple linear indexes; and full text queries,&lt;br/&gt;which can include searching for a particular word or substring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The superlinear indexes found in today's databases cannot support high&lt;br/&gt;rates of insertion.  On traditional mechanical disk drives, the&lt;br/&gt;existing superlinear indexes can only support about one hundred&lt;br/&gt;insertions per second in the worst case.  For many important&lt;br/&gt;applications, that is too slow, and so database users often avoid&lt;br/&gt;superlinear indexing.  Even traditional linear indexes based on&lt;br/&gt;B-trees cannot support the high insertion rates demanded by many&lt;br/&gt;databases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research investigates streaming superlinear indexes, that is,&lt;br/&gt;indexes that efficiently support full text or multidimensional&lt;br/&gt;queries, and can be updated at speeds that are related to disk&lt;br/&gt;bandwidth rather than seeks per second.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Among the significant research issues are the following: (1) design&lt;br/&gt;efficient files structures for streaming superlinear indexes; (2)&lt;br/&gt;investigate how streaming superlinear indexes might pave the way to&lt;br/&gt;improved file systems; (3) determine whether cache-oblivious&lt;br/&gt;algorithms technology can enhance streaming superlinear indexes; and&lt;br/&gt;(4) program complex data structures for transactions and recovery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this research will show how to build filesystems that&lt;br/&gt;achieve dramatically better performance than today's B-tree-based&lt;br/&gt;filesystems, how to maintain rich geometrical data and&lt;br/&gt;multidimensional nongeographical databases in real time, and how to&lt;br/&gt;maintain full-text searchable databases in real time.  For example,&lt;br/&gt;some of today's file systems try to maintain an full-text index to&lt;br/&gt;find strings in files quickly, but these systems often fall behind at&lt;br/&gt;high data write rates.  A streaming superlinear index would allow such&lt;br/&gt;a file system to keep up, and would improve the usability of both&lt;br/&gt;high-end storage systems and relatively small consumer storage systems&lt;br/&gt;that are nonetheless too large to index with today's indexes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers are developing course materials on streaming indexing&lt;br/&gt;technology which will be made freely available under the MIT&lt;br/&gt;OpenCourseWare initiative (http://ocw.mit.edu).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Further information on this project may be found at the project&lt;br/&gt;web page:   http://supertech.csail.mit.edu/superlinear-indexes</AbstractNarration>
