<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to enable accurate heart signal extraction using Doppler radar.  The approach is to develop high-precision hardware and data-driven solutions for extracting and interpreting physiological data obtained using Doppler radar.  The primary motivation for this work is a growing need for non-invasive monitoring of health parameters, as well as military and national security applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With respect to intellectual merit, this collaborative research involving engineering and medical faculty at the University of Hawaii at Manoa seeks to achieve a high level of robustness and reliability in non-contact Doppler radar physiological sensing.  The project builds on the investigators' past work on Doppler heart sensing and non-invasive cardiology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With respect to broader impact, this project has the potential to result in valuable tools that can benefit society in the areas of health care, emergency response, military, and security operations.  This project presents a motivating educational opportunity for a diverse population of minority students that have been historically underserved by local educational and industrial opportunities.  An important aspect of this project is the interaction of engineering students with the medical co-advisor.  The partnership established in this project allows engineering students and faculty to complement College of Engineering resources by leveraging medical school expertise and facilities.  Students involved in this project also have an opportunity to participate in K-12 outreach activities.</AbstractNarration>
