<AbstractNarration>The objective of the proposed research is to develop a simulation test-bed to analyze the security and resilience of the microgrid under diverse operating conditions. This test-bed will allow a detailed performance evaluation of different types and sizes of distributed generation and storage units, together with various generation and load control mechanisms. This research applies concepts from the fields of power systems, agent-based technologies, IP-based network and game theory to address the modeling and simulation of an intelligent microgrid at the distribution level.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: The intellectual merit of this research is the development of a simulation test bed that comprises detailed device models and multi-agent technologies for microgrid operation. The test bed is expected to assist with the analysis and evaluation of electric power microgrid designs. It will assist researchers, system planners, and policy makers in quantifying and analyzing the impact of various distributed generation devices, as well as various load and generation control algorithms, on the security and resiliency of the electric power microgrid.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: The microgrid simulation test bed is expected to broaden the student experience beyond the academic environment through real-world examples and case studies. In addition, it will provide a platform for collaborative research opportunities with colleagues in academia and industry who are active in similar research areas.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
