<AbstractNarration>****NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****&lt;br/&gt;This Faculty Early Career Award supports an integrated research and education project to study the fundamental electronic properties of carbon based nanostructures using scanning probe microscopy.  The research will focus on two carbon nanostructures: graphene, which is a two-dimensional sheet of carbon atoms and carbon nanotubes, which are one-dimensional, wire-like structures.  These carbon nanostructures are candidates to replace silicon in future semiconductor technologies.  Beyond their potential technological applications, these carbon materials exhibit many unique electronic properties due to their one and two-dimensional nature.  By using scanning probe microscopy, this project will directly visualize, probe and control their unique electronic properties with nanometer scale resolution.  The education portion of the project will bring the results of the research to local students through collaboration with the Physics Factory, which is a local non-profit organization.  Undergraduate students will serve as mentors for high school students in order to build demonstrations of the research as well as other nanoscience topics.  The demonstrations will be used by the Physics Factory during trips to K-12 schools.  This collaboration will allow high school students through graduate students to be involved in the cutting-edge research.  The results of the research will also be used in a new course for undergraduates focusing on experimental aspects of nanoscience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;**** TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****&lt;br/&gt;This Faculty Early Career Award funds an integrated research and education project to study the fundamental electronic properties of carbon based nanostructures using scanning probe microscopy.  The research will focus on single-walled carbon nanotubes and graphene which both exhibit unique electronic properties.  In carbon nanotubes, the project will study aspects related to their one-dimensional nature such as spin-charge separation, reduced screening and inelastic scattering.  In graphene, the project will look for ways to enable new functionality through the use of strain and electric fields.  By combining scanning probe microscopy with electrical transport measurements, these electronic properties can be studied on the nanometer length scale.  The research will be integrated with an outreach program to local K-12 schools.  This will be accomplished through collaboration with a local non-profit organization, the Physics Factory.  This project will enable the creation of a set of demonstrations about the research as well as broader areas of nanoscience to be used by the Physics Factory during visits to K-12 schools.  The results of the research will also be used in a new course for undergraduates focusing on experimental aspects of nanoscience.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[This CAREER award examined ways to image the electronic properties of carbon based nanostructures.  Most of the work focussed on graphene based devices and ways to modify and improve their quality.  Graphene is a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice of carbon atoms and is therefore very sensitive to its environment.  We have found that the substrate is crucial for the quality of graphene devices.  This has led us to develop better graphene devices by controlling the substrate and also modify graphene?s properties through interactions with the substrate.   In order to improve the mobility of graphene devices a different choice of substrate from the standard silicon oxide was necessary.  We have used hexagonal boron nitride as a substrate for graphene devices.  It has the same crystal structure as graphene but with alternating boron and nitrogen atoms and a slightly longer lattice constant.  We have found that this substrate provides at least an order of magnitude improvement in the electronic properties of graphene.   We also developed fabrication and imaging techniques to study the modification of graphene?s electronic properties.  This is done through the creation of vertical heterostructures.  For example, when graphene is placed on hexagonal boron nitride, its electronic properties are modified by the presence of a periodic potential.  The wavelength of this potential depends on the rotation angle between the two crystals.  Therefore, we have developed a fabrication technique to produce heterostructures with a controlled rotation angle between the two layers.  We have found that there is a new Dirac point created in the graphene by the periodic potential and its energy depends on the wavelength.  This new Dirac point modifies the conductivity of graphene.  We have also shown that pressure can modify the spacing between the two layers leading to in-plane strain and changes in the electronic properties.   The final area of results in this project was looking at other two-dimensional materials that are similar to graphene.  This was primarily focussed on transition metal dichalcogenides which have a similar honeycomb structure to graphene but have one metal atom and two chalcogen atoms in a unit cell.  We developed novel imaging mechanisms to study the electronic properties of these materials as well as looking at their spin dependent properties.  We have also studied their use as substrates from graphene devices but determined that they are not as high quality as boron nitride.   The broader impacts of the research include the development of new electronic materials and devices that may be used in future applications.  The grant also provided education and training for graduate and undergraduate students.  There have been many undergraduate students working on the project and most of them have decided to continue their education in graduate school in related scientific fields.  The grant also enabled a collaboration with the Physics Factory which is a local group that takes science demonstrations to K-12 schools.  New demonstrations related to some of the research in the grant will be used in these visits.  Lastly, the research supported by the grant has been showcased in several lab open houses associated with the Tucson Festival of Books where the public has had the opportunity to visit the lab and get hands-on experience with some of the techniques that we have developed.
