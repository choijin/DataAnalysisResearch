<AbstractNarration>This award funds a workshop for principal investigators (PIs) supported by NetSE-FIND grants to meet, present their work, and facilitate future collaboration by providing a workshop environment in which to identify important open problems for future research. The NetSE-FIND programmatic area is distinctive from many other NSF activities, both in its technical emphasis and its approach to research. NetSE-FIND seeks to involve the research community in a collective exploration of what the Internet of 15 years from now should be. This effort requires a long-range perspective, the invention of new concepts not fettered by the constraints of today?s networks, an understanding of the larger social, economic and legal issues that arise from the interplay between the Internet and society, and a willingness to collaborate on larger visions that build on the ideas developed in individual research grants. Because of the value that NetSE-FIND places on integration and collaboration, it is important that PIs working on the parts of the program have opportunities to meet and discuss objectives, approaches and opportunities. NetSE-FIND has held five prior meetings for NetSE-FIND PIs, as well as others associated with this effort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit&lt;br/&gt;The agenda of this workshop has been centered on exploring the work that has been done in the NetSE-FIND programmatic area and the identification and discussion of open questions?aspects of a future network that are not yet being explored elsewhere. Investigators will present their work, and a set of invited external observers will provide their impressions of the NetSE-FIND activities to NSF. Through this process the research agenda can be sharpened and focused on important issues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will further the objectives of the NetSE-FIND activities, which is an important part of the NSF networking agenda. The workshop will also allow investigators to discover opportunities for collaboration and the incorporation of research results across different grants. The slides from the presentations will be posted to the public FIND web site www.nets-find.net, where present and potential NetSE-FIND participants can use them to further their understanding of the NetSE-FIND effort.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
