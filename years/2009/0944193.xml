<AbstractNarration>MacAyeal/0944193&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This award supports a project to examine and test a 3-step process model for explosive ice-shelf disintegration that emerged in the wake of the recent 2008 and 2009 events of the Wilkins Ice Shelf. The model is conditioned on Summer melt-driven increase in free-surface water coupled with surface and basal crevasse density growth necessary to satisfy an "enabling condition". Once met, the collapse proceeds through three steps: (Step 1),  calving of a "leading phalanx" of tabular icebergs from the seaward ice front of the ice shelf which creates in its wake a region, called a "mosh pit" (located between the phalanx and the edge of the intact ice shelf), where ocean surface-gravity waves are trapped by reflection  (a fast mechanically enabled process), (Step 2), and a rapid, runaway conversion of gravitational potential energy into ocean-wave energy by iceberg capsize and fragmentation within the "mosh pit" which leads to further wave-induced calving, capsize and fragmentation (Step 3).  The project will be conducted by a multidisciplinary team and will focus on theoretical model development, numerical method development and application and new observations.  The project will participate in both the Research Experience for Undergraduates program in the Physics Department and the Summer Research Early Identification Program (SR-EIP) that fosters participation in research by underrepresented minorities.  The PIs, postdoctoral scholar, graduate students and unfunded participants will develop a graduate-level seminar/tutorial to introduce advanced computational methods to glaciology.  A postdoctoral scholar and graduate student will be trained in new research techniques during the project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The research project explored a phenomena  that was not previously well understood, but which has a potential  important impact on global sea level: explosive ice-shelf  disintegration.  In 2002, the Larsen B Ice Shelf literally exploded into  1000's of small pieces over the period of a few days. This  disintegration caused glaciers that fed the ice shelf to speed up,  thereby moving ice from land into the ocean and causing a minute amount  of sea level rise. By figuring out the physics of the explosive  disintegration, we can help to assess whether the process is possible in  other ice shelves of the Antarctic.  The work we conducted showed that the energy source for the explosive  break up of the Larsen B was the capsize of icebergs. When an iceberg  capsizes, it releases gravitational potential energy, because ice moves  up and water moves down, on average. This energy tends to be rather  large, in the kilotonnes of TNT equivalent. Our work was conducted using  a variety of techiques; however, one novel technique which we found  extremely useful was to re-create iceberg capsize in at a laboratory  scale using plastic for the ice.  Additional contributions of our research include examining conditions  under which ocean waves can penetrate ice shelves and thereby break  them up into sufficiently small pieces so as to stimulate the iceberg  capsize mechanism of energy release.
