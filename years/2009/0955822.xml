<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This CAREER award supports theoretical research on the interplay between superconductivity, quantum liquid crystals, and topological phases. The PI aims to understand the interplay among multiple instabilities, seeing it as a key challenge to unlock the mysteries of strongly correlated quantum materials. The research is motivated by and based on experiments. It will involve computational and analytical approaches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To address the interplay between superconductivity and quantum liquid crystal order, the PI will develop and use new theoretical measures for quantifying different broken spatial symmetry in nanoscale electronic patterns observed in disordered correlated systems. Experimental resolution is increasing and experiments reveal more patterns of this sort in many correlated materials. The PI's theoretical framework will provide a way to interpret new experiments. With the new measure, the PI will address the significance of local quantum liquid crystal physics in high Tc superconductors. She will develop tools to test signatures of quantum criticality inside the superconducting phase. To address the interplay between topological phases and the other two orders, the PI will develop new measures to distinguish different topological phases, that are applicable at finite temperatures. In parallel, the PI will continue the effort to identify signatures of abelian and nonabelian fractional statistics which are the best presently known indicators of toplogical phases. Finally, the PI will investigate two cases of the interplay among all three kinds of order: the ruthenate family and even-denominator-filling quantum Hall devices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The educational component of this award will impact three relevant groups: undergraduate and graduate students in Physics and Applied Physics Departments at Cornell University, K-12 students nation-wide, and middle school girls in New York state. For Cornell students, the PI will develop "Scientific Science Communication" module to equip students with scientific writing and presentation skills. The module will become a permanent component of a traditional laboratory course for undergraduate and graduate students. With assistance from the Cornell Center for Materials Research, the PI will develop an educational kit "amazing liquid crystals", in order to demonstrate the diversity of emergent phenomena underlying everyday technology to K-12 students. The PI will partner with the Cornell chapter of the "Expand Your Horizons" program and introduce a cyber community aspect to the program to encourage interest in science among female students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This CAREER award supports theoretical research on materials with emergent states of matter that arise from electrons that interact strongly with each other. Electrons are governed by the rules of quantum mechanics. Materials composed of many strongly interacting electrons display new states of matter, such as superconductivity. At sufficiently low temperature, electrons can collectively join together in the same quantum mechanical state, a superconducting state that can conduct electricity without dissipation. Other states of matter are possible. It is possible that a material is close to exhibiting more than one state of matter. These states may compete with each other leading to unusual properties in materials that lie outside the textbooks. This research project will use theory and computation to explore the interplay among three states of matter, superconductivity, quantum liquid crystal order in which electrons organize themselves in such a way that they have properties that have both liquid-like and crystal-like attributes, and topological order. Topological order is an emerging concept that connects the structure of a quantum mechanical state of many particles to more familiar concepts of the distinct ways particles organize themselves into states of matter. The interplay among these states may be carried out in materials like the high temperature superconductors and electrons in a high magnetic field that are confined to a plane in artificial structures made of semiconductor materials. The PI will seek to discover principles and concepts to describe the interplay among these states based on experimental findings. The goal is to develop a comprehensive theoretical framework combining analytical and computational approaches. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The educational component of this award will impact three relevant groups: undergraduate and graduate students in Physics and Applied Physics Departments at Cornell University, K-12 students nation-wide, and middle school girls in New York state.

Through collaboration with J.C. Davis, also at Cornell, the PI worked on extracting local order parameter fields from STM data on Cu-based and Fe-based superconductors.  Our works on the electronic structure of the pseudogap states of cuprate superconductors established quantum mechanical analogue of liquid crystalline order in those states. Back in 2010, we developed data analysis scheme for extracting "Intra-Unit Cell Nematicity" from STM data. With the support of the grant we used this new tool to extract quantum liquid crystalline order parameter fields, which enabled us to constrain theory and map out the phase diagram exhibiting quantum phase transitions (see Figure 1).  Quantum liquid crystallinity in three band models: In order to explain local ordering tendencies reported at sub-atomic scales around the beginning of the funding period a postdoc Mark Fischer and the PI obtained mean-field phase diagram of different "intra-unit-cell" ordering possibilities in the relevant three-band model (see Figure 2). Results of this work became springboards for more sophisticated numerical treatments of the intra-unit-cell nematicity and for studies including charge density wave instabilities.  Topological phases and topological superconductivity: Seeking new realizations of topological edge states, a postdoc Abolhassan Vaezi and the PI collaborated with an ab-initio group to predict topologically protected edge states in an AB-BA tilt boundary of bilayer grapheme (see Figure 3).  To our delight, our theoretical predictions were recently confirmed experimentally.  For 3D TIÆs, identifying the effects of the surface-bulk coupling is a major challenge against exploiting the surface states. With a graduate student Y. Hsu, a postdoc Dr. M. Fischer and collaborators the PI explored the effects of such coupling for thin slabs of Bi2Se3 by combining the effective "Fano" model with ab-initio calculations. The PI and her group then built on the insights from this work to investigate two experimentally relevant issues involving films of Bi2Se3: spin transfer torque and superconducting proximity effect. In particular, the PI and collaborators established experimentally and theoretically that topological insulator-ferromagnetic metal bilayers can be efficient spin torque transfer devices due to the spin-momentum locking of the TI surface state.

The result opened many questions and warrants further numerical and analytical study of entanglement properties of this state as well as other non-Fermi liquid states. Summary of Results with Broader Impact  Scientific Science Communication: The PI developed the scientific science communication modules for two settings: a compact three-hour long program and a three-week long mini course. Postdocs and graduate students supported by the grant participated in the course module developments through providing feedback.
