<AbstractNarration>Sibum Sung&lt;br/&gt;IOS-0950785&lt;br/&gt;Flowering time control under short days by the regulatory network of VIN3 and FLC gene families&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flowering is one of the major developmental commitments in the plant life cycle. Plants have evolved intricate regulatory networks to control flowering time in response to changing environmental conditions. Two major environment cues that plants use to sense seasonal changes are temperature (i.e. winter) and day length (i.e. photoperiod). In the model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana, the VERNALIZATION INSENSITIVE 3 (VIN3) gene family mediates environmental cues to regulate flowering time through a group of floral repressors including the FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) gene family. This project will use biochemical and genetic approaches to dissect the molecular mechanisms that control flowering time through these two gene families.  Proteins in the VIN3 gene family mediate histone modifications on target chromatin. Chromatin-based gene regulation is a major regulatory theme in eukaryotic gene regulation. Thus, the results of this project will be of interest to a broad scientific community. Furthermore, the environmentally regulated nature of the VIN3 gene family regulatory network will provide a unique opportunity to study the effect of environmental inputs on the epigenetic regulation of gene expression. Flowering time control also has a potential to be used in agricultural applications, as many crops flower in response to environmental changes. This work may provide new methods to improve crop productivity. Proposed research will provide an ample opportunity to train a postdoctoral fellow and a graduate student. This proposal will also provide undergraduate students and K-12 students with hands-on experience in the research laboratory.</AbstractNarration>
