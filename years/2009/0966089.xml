<AbstractNarration>This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Training (IGERT) award supports the development of a multidisciplinary graduate training program focused on distributed renewable energy sources available from the sun. Research will be focused in the areas of inexpensive and environmentally benign photovoltaic materials, efficient sunlight capture using nanotechnology and advanced optical design, hydrogen generation using artificial photosynthesis, and improved fuel cells using hydrogen-based fuels. Research will also explore the changes in economic and business models necessitated by distributed energy sources and what motivates the adoption of renewable energy to facilitate its adoption in the marketplace. The education and training plans include teaching and fieldwork at partner African universities, internships in U.S. or European institutions, and a new curriculum that includes entrepreneurship and social sciences, and makes students effective communicators. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program will produce scientific leaders and entrepreneurs trained in the field of renewable energy who are ready to initiate major advances leading to sustainable development and global prosperity, while protecting the environment. Significant activities include teaching and fieldwork in African universities and involvement of inner city high schools and the local community. The societal impact of the proposed effort will be used to foster the recruitment of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics students from under-represented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to meet the challenges of educating U.S. Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the interdisciplinary background, deep knowledge in a chosen discipline, and the technical, professional, and personal skills needed for the career demands of the future. The program is intended to catalyze a cultural change in graduate education by establishing innovative new models for graduate education and training in a fertile environment for collaborative research that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries.</AbstractNarration>

The students came from a variety of science and engineering departments where they were carrying out basic research that could be applied to renewable energy.  After the IGERT program, they completed their PhD work in their home department through the traditional faculty mentor relationship.  During the two year long IGERT program, students were required to get outside of their home department for a variety of activities including coursework, internships, conferences, and outreach.  A set of required courses were developed that cover the broader issues enabling implementation of renewable energy technology, such as effective technical communication, economics, entrepreneurship, and public policy.  The courses impacted a large number of students outside the IGERT program and continue to be offered each year.  The IGERT students were required to find a technical internship during the first year.  Professional networking was encouraged to enable the students to find paid internships and to apply for independent funding to support travel to internships.  In the second year of the IGERT program, teams of students were required to travel to Africa to teach and present research results.  The students developed a self-contained set of classroom demonstrations to illustrate a variety of energy topics, including solar, chemical, batteries, and fuel cells, to grade school students.  The students also developed a short course on the fabrication of solar panel from individual cells.  The solar panels were constructed using locally sourced materials as much as possible.  The solar panel workshop was targeted to high school and postsecondary students.  Over the grant period, the IGERT fellows reached thousands of students through the classroom demonstrations and workshops.  The breadth of PhD education offered through the IGERT program resulted in better training in technical communication to diverse audiences, working in teams, and non-technical issues that surround the adoption of renewable energy.
