<AbstractNarration>This award in the Chemical Synthesis (SYN) program supports work by Professor Karl Christe at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles to carry out fundamental studies on challenging problems in synthetic chemistry.  Experimental efforts will be carried out in the following areas: (i) fluorine chemistry at the limits of oxidation and coordination; (ii) synthesis of novel cyano compounds for use as electrophilic cyanating agents and energetic fuels; and (iii) synthesis of new energetic fluorine substituted nitramines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed activities will have a major impact on science and technology and result in important contributions to fields such as more efficient and greener energetic materials and synthesis at the limits of oxidation and coordination.</AbstractNarration>
