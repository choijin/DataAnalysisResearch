<AbstractNarration>The  "Enhancing Global Research and Education in STEM at Spelman College" (G-STEM) project seeks to prepare African American women in the STEM disciplines to be globally engaged. This is to be accomplished by the establishment of a G-STEM office which will work synergistically with other offices and departments on campus to establish formal international research collaborations, and develop a structured mentoring program for STEM students seeking global research experiences. This integrative proposal will increase the quality and quantity of international research opportunities available to Spelman College students, as well as enhance the mentoring process between STEM students and faculty. A greater number of African American women in STEM will engage in international research experiences, and thus graduate as globally-engaged scholars.&lt;br/&gt;G-STEM will integrate and centralize study abroad efforts across campus, develop global research collaborations, implement a formal mentoring program for participants, and evaluate and disseminate the program. G-STEM seeks to become a model for how other institutions can develop research international experiences for their students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  "Enhancing Global Research and Education in STEM at Spelman College" (G-STEM) sought to prepare African American women in the STEM disciplines to engage in an increasingly globalized scientific community.  The objectives of the G-STEM proposal were to 1) establish 15 new partnerships between Spelman College and research institutions outside the U.S., 2) increase the number of undergraduate STEM students who participate in international research experiences to 35%, 3) develop an integrated long-term mentoring program for G-STEM scholars, and 4) disseminate the global experiences of our students to broader audiences.  The G-STEM office was created in 2010, and over the funding cycle, has developed a total of 16 new international research partnerships.  These partnerships provide students the opportunity to select from 35 research sites in 21 countries. In addition, Spelman College faculty members have established direct collaborations with researchers in India, France and Barbados.  Students and faculty members will continue to take advantage of the partnerships developed though G-STEM.  We provided 104 students with international research experiences, representing 32% of Spelman?s last class of STEM.  (72% of Spelman STEM students participated in some type of international travel experience).  G-STEM students traveled to 17 different countries. Of the 104 G-STEM scholars, 60% have graduated, while 38% are still attending Spelman.  Of our graduates, 32% are currently in STEM graduate programs, and 10% are pursuing degrees in health-related fields (medicine, nursing, and dentistry).  Not only did G-STEM program increase the number of STEM students who engaged in international research experiences, 98% of them graduated, or are on track to graduate, and 42% remain in STEM related fields upon graduation.  We have established a consolidated mentoring program to support GSTEM students.  A protocol was developed which involved pairing each G-STEM scholar with a Spelman faculty member who has expertise in the area of the students? research project.  These mentors work directly with the student and international mentor before, during and after the students? departure. The G-STEM office also hosted meetings for each of the cohorts, helping create a sense of community among the scholars and mentors.  Several of the G-STEM scholars have continued work on their research question with their Spelman mentor, or have pursued additional STEM-related research experiences.  Over the six years, 29 Spelman faculty members have served as G-STEM mentors, and 13 of these traveled to the research site of their student to oversee the students? progress and offer support.  Finally, the research experiences of our students have been disseminated both internally and externally to broader audiences.  All G-STEM scholars gave either an oral or poster presentation during Spelman?s Annual Research Day.  In addition, 32 students (30%) presented their work at national or international conferences, with five of these students winning awards for their presentations.  Two students are co-authors on peer-reviewed research articles based on their G-STEM research experience.  The G-STEM model and successes have also been disseminated to broader audiences.  To date, G-STEM personnel have delivered six presentations at national and international venues.  A description of the program?s impact and the partnership developed with Arcadia University has been published in its 2015 edition of IMPACT magazine. We also anticipate the publication of a book chapter in 2017, which details the accomplishments of the program.  Information about the program and the G-STEM research experiences are also available through a variety of online channels.  Abstracts of all projects are made available through the Digital Commons system of the Robert W. Woodruff library of the Atlanta University Center.  The research experiences of each of our scholars are updated weekly through the Spelman College G-STEM blog.  General updates regarding the program and the scholars are provided regularly via social media sites, and full details of the program can be found at the Spelman College G-STEM webpage.  In conclusion, the G-STEM program has had a substantial impact on the number of STEM students who pursue international research opportunities, the number of research opportunities that are now available to our STEM students, and the dissemination of the research experiences and the G-STEM program as a model for other institutions.  The infrastructure of the College has been impacted as a result of the G-STEM program; the G-STEM office has been fully integrated into the Gordon Zeto Center for Global Education, and continues to offer quality international research experiences to Spelman College STEM students.
