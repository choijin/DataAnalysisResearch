<AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will renovate laboratory space in the Moody Science Building, which was built in 1968.  While Moody was remodeled in 2001, the space in question was not upgraded. The request is for new research benches with overhead storage and built-in desks, two hood replacements, modular ventilation above the benches, eye-wash stations, and dedicated instrumentation space. In addition, infrastructure such as Ethernet, vacuum and nitrogen gas lines and electrical will be upgraded or installed.  Chemical storage will be moved to a small dedicated space with restricted access. These upgrades will not only enhance research infrastructure, but also ensure that safe laboratory practices for handling and storing of chemicals can be established.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The three members of this research all have industry background and conduct research in the areas of organic, analytical and materials chemistry. The renovation will improve research space for faculty and undergraduate students, and expand the number of undergraduate students who can conduct research at any given time. Schreiner University draws from a rural population in Texas with a large proportion of Hispanics. Over 50% of the students involved in undergraduate science research are female.</AbstractNarration>
