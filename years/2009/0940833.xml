    <AbstractNarration>This project will produce 90-second science news stories for commercial local newscasts and science center exhibits, and determine how they change engagement with and interest in science by general audiences. Each video news story will reach approximately 2.1 million viewers that tune in to a local ABC or NBC affiliate newscast. The evaluation will study the cumulative impact of repeated exposure to these broadcast news segments. In addition ScienCentral will partner with the Maryland Science Center to investigate the use of the videos in exhibits using hand-held devices and showing them on large screens. The project deliverables include two hundred and twenty 90-second video news stories over 3 years aired by ABC and NBC affiliates; complimentary web stories with links to additional resources; evaluations of both the broadcast videos and their use in a science center. The project will also evaluate the partnership between ScienCentral and the Maryland Science Center to guide future expansion of video programming.</AbstractNarration>
