<AbstractNarration>Prion diseases are fatal brain wasting diseases of mammals and include Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans, 'mad cow' disease in cattle, scrapie in sheep and goats, and chronic wasting disease (CWD) in North American deer, elk, and moose. Chronic wasting disease is the only prion disease affecting wild animal populations. First recognized in Colorado in the late 1960s, CWD has since been detected in wild and farmed deer and elk across large areas of North America. The infectious agent persists in the environment for years, and this reservoir contributes to the spread of the disease among animals. To date, the relative importance of direct animal-to-animal vs. indirect animal-environment-animal transmission has not been determined for wild animals. This issue has important implications for management of CWD in wild deer and elk populations. A prerequisite for the study of direct vs. indirect transmission of CWD is a method to reliably and efficiently measure the infectious agent in environmental samples. Such a method does not exist at present. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As an initial step toward the goal of determining the importance of direct vs. indirect CWD transmission, this project will develop a sensitive, rapid, and reliable method for measuring infectious prion protein in soil and other environmental samples. The approach taken is to adapt a novel, recently developed biochemical method for environmental samples. This work requires careful examination of how soil properties and environmental factors affect the ability to recover and measure prion protein from soil samples. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;Potential losses to the economy, hunting, wildlife viewing, and farmed deer and elk from CWD are significant. Increased frequency and geographic distribution of CWD in North America, environmental reservoirs of infectivity, resistance to environmental degradation, and potential for disease transmission between species raise concerns about risks to humans and other species. Development of these new methods will facilitate scientific understanding of environmental contamination, identify routes of disease transmission, improve disease management, and determine long-term risks to humans and ecological systems. The development of a method to measure the disease-associated prion protein in the environment will enable future, critical research on the transmission and spread of CWD.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In recent decades prion diseases have transitioned from a novel, but relatively obscure, group of diseaes to one that presents substantial ecological, agricultural, and economic problems, with potential threates to human health.  Prion diseases, or transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), are invariably fatal neurodegenerative diseases caused by unique transmissible protein pathogens.  Prion diseaes first gained public notoriety as "mad cow" disease (bovine spongiform encephalopathy, BSE) emerged in the United Kingdom, and was linked to the emergence of variant Creutzfeld-Jacob (VCJD) disease in humans.  In contrast, scrapie which affects sheep and goats and is not transmissible to humans has been known for centuries.  More recently, chronic wasting disease (CWD), the only known TSE in wildlife, was discovered in North American members of the deer family and has caused great concern for captive and wild populations.  Unlike other TSEs, scrapie and CWD can be transmitted either directly (between animals) or indirectly (through an environmental reservoir).  Becasue prions are highly resistant to destruction, an environmental reservoir may plan an important role in disease transmisiso and potential management.  Our study extends the utility of the recently developed prion measurement method called protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) to CWD prions  We optimized the method for detection of CWD prions by including Teflon beads (PMCAb) and the glycoside saponin to produce an assay substantially more sensitive than conventional animal bioassay.  The higher sensitivity and increased robustness of PMCAb is expected to facilitate detection of early stages of disease compared to conventional diagnostic methods, evalaution of decontamination methods, and detection of CWD agent in naturally contaminated environmental samples.  Enabling the identification of environmental reservoirs of infectivity will lead to better understanding of CWD epizootics, long-term environmental affects, and development of effective mitigation strategies.
