<AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to study novel aqueous-core embedded microfluidic valves to eliminate serious clogging problems caused by evaporation of many bioink materials. The approach is to investigate and utilize various aqueous-core materials having good bioink compatibility. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: This proposal addresses historical and traditional clogging problems of nozzle-based microfluidic systems. It is very important to eliminate drying-out problems during operations of the microfluidic systems. The proposed device is a clog free ejector with a thin liquid-film valve using immiscible and inert material to the system fluid. A thin liquid-film with negligible evaporation speed provides a separation and protection layer at the liquid-air interface of the system fluid. Well-controlled movement of the liquid-film can be significantly enhanced on superhydrophobic surfaces by employing nanotechnology. Aqueous-core-embedded microfluidic valve will provide effective control of evaporation rate by the complete separation of the microfluids from the air exposure. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The proposed research will overcome historical challenges being faced in contactless microfluidic delivery systems. The results of the proposed research will also forge new frontiers in the area of reliable microfluidic delivery systems. The transformative nature of the proposed research will be a valuable resource for many other research communities and will serve as a keystone for tying classical problems to high reliable novel solutions.  The education program of the research will focus on increasing participation of underrepresented minorities, providing early exposure of micro/nanotechnology to high school students and providing academic career development opportunities in micro/nanotechnology.</AbstractNarration>
