<AbstractNarration>0933734&lt;br/&gt;John&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research is directed towards the design of multifunctional particles that are effective in the remediation of chlorinated hydrocarbons such as trichloroethylene (TCE). These hydrocarbons form a class of dense non-aqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) contaminants in groundwater and soil that are difficult to remediate. They have a density greater than water and settle deep into the sediment from which they gradually leach out into aquifers causing long term environmental pollution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research will be conducted to understand the fundamental science and technology behind the development of composite particles based on attaching zerovalent iron nanoparticles (NZVI) to highly uniform carbon microspheres. The carbon serves as an adsorbent to sequester TCE and bring the contaminant to the site of reaction, while the NZVI is the reactive site. Colloidal stability is enhanced by adsorbing a corona of a biodegradable polyelectrolyte, carboxymethyl cellulose. The novelty of the research is the coupling of reaction, adsorption, transport and stability through the use of a simple and inexpensive system that is potentially environmentally benign. The work is distinct from earlier work in that all aspects of remediation are concurrently considered through the use of these systems. If successful, it would lead to a fundamental understanding of chlorinated hydrocarbon remediation, and would transform the field since the materials used can be tuned for optimal reactivity and transport. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt; From a scientific and technical perspective, the broader impacts of the research clearly lie in the application to an environmental problem of significant importance. Chlorinated hydrocarbons are pervasive pollutants in groundwater and sediments and the fact that they migrate downwards in aquifers makes them extremely difficult to remediate through traditional pump and treat or sediment excavation techniques. The problem is intrinsic to the global grand challenge problem of providing adequate safe drinking water to the worlds population.  The research has the potential to be truly transformative as it addresses a unique methodology to develop multifunctional nanoscale materials for environmental remediation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From an educational and outreach perspective, the project will tie in to providing research opportunities for undergraduates from underrepresented minorities, through the Louisiana Alliance for Minority Participation in Research program. Additionally, we will tie in to a unique program connecting Tulane, Xavier and Nunez College whereby educational enhancement in the chemical sciences is brought about through collaboration, with the objective of addressing the recruitment and retention of a skilled workforce in the region.</AbstractNarration>
