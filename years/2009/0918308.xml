<AbstractNarration>The social, demographic and cognitive features of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops sp.) show remarkable parallels with primates, offering a powerful method for examining how large brains, extensive maternal care, behavioral flexibility and prolonged developmental periods evolved. In this project the investigators examine the social and ecological factors related to dolphin female reproduction and development using innovative techniques in both computer modeling and biological sampling. The investigators will examine what factors contribute to female calving success, why dolphins have such a long juvenile period, and what patterns of information (cultural) transmission in the population favor such behavioral plasticity. They have also initiated a study that involves collecting blow samples (fluid exhaled from the blowhole) and have already extracted DNA from blow.  These samples will also be used for hormone and fatty acid assays, opening up exciting new avenues for the non-invasive study of reproduction, stress, maturation and diet. The attributes of the project include: (1) the size and unprecedented detail of the 25-year longitudinal dataset; (2) the creation of an extensive integrated relational database with a web platform; (3) the computational modeling for analyzing complex multi-dimensional associations in the context of a large social network; (4) the natural variation in social, ecological, and reproductive parameters; (5) the new direction in developing non-invasive biological sampling techniques; and (6) the scientific value of studying a species on par with primates.  The inter-disciplinary nature of this collaboration will foster innovation and intellectual exchange across multiple disciplines, advancing our understanding of complex animal societies. The project supports five graduate and approximately 22 undergraduate students from Biology and Computer Science.  The database will be broadly accessible through our website and will serve as an educational tool and as a foundation for design of similar long-term data warehouses.  Thus, the next generation biologists will be better equipped to integrate computer science approaches and database technology.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The Shark Bay Bottlenose Dolphin Research Project (SBDRP) is a unique 30-year longitudinal study focusing on the behavioral ecology, reproduction, social structure, life history and genetics of ~1800 Indian Ocean bottlenose dolphins residing in Shark Bay, Australia, a World Heritage UNESCO site. SBDRP is the second-longest running study of dolphins worldwide and the database is among the most comprehensive for any marine mammal. The grant supported a collaboration between computational and biological scientists with the aim of understanding dolphins' slow life histories,socio-ecological complexity, and factors impacting survival and reproduction. Dolphins first calve in their teens and live until their 40s. Like humans, they have a dynamic network of hundreds of associates that can change throughout the day, but they have strong long-term bonds with kin and non-kin alike. Shark Bay, a relatively pristine site, enables us to examine human impacts on a manageable and measurable scale. Our results inform marine mammal environmental policies and management domestically as well as internationally. The work from this grant focused on factors affecting calf survival, female reproduction, social networks, and tool-use. A small subset of Shark Bay dolphins exhibit a rare behavior involving tool-use with marine sponges. This is the best-documented case of tool-use for any wild dolphin or whale. The dolphins use sponges to ferret prey from the sea floor in deep channels where the substrate is cluttered and it is difficult to use echolocation to locate bottom-dwelling prey. We made a number of significant discoveries with respect to why the Shark Bay dolphins use sponge tools from the ecological and ontogenetic to the cultural. One of our key findings was that sponging dolphins are targeting fish without swim bladders, particularly the barred sandperch, and in the murky substrate, these fish would be invisible and inaudible to echolocation (due to the lack of swimbladder). The sponge assists the dolphin in finding these fish while protecting their beak. Additionally, female dolphins (the primary tool users) improve in their tool-use well into their 20s, around mid-life. The development of expertise has rarely been documented outside of humans. Finally, we showed that the female 'spongers' prefer to spend time with each other and cluster together more than non-spongers, even when controlling for other factors (kinship, space use, etc.). We suggest that this is evidence of a culture in that the spongers appear to define themselves as a distinct 'social group' imbedded in the larger network, and this is the only case outside of humans where individuals preferentially group based on use of a tool. This work has implications for understanding cultural transmission in animals. We have also identified a number of factors related to calf and juvenile survival, and female reproduction. Social factors, such as who a dolphin associates with and their importance in the network predict calf survival, juvenile survival and female reproductive success. The work from this grant resulted in publication of 29 peer-reviewed journal articles (plus 6 in preparation), 8 book chapters and 75 conference presentations with 17 graduate students (co)authors and 17 undergraduate (co)authors. It also resulted in the development of an open-source tool for visualizing dynamic networks, called INVENIO. Our publications were in high impact journals (<em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Nature Communications, Proceedings of the Royal Society, Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society</em>) as well as society journals (<em>Animal Behavior</em> and <em>Marine Mammal Science</em>).
