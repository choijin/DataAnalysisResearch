<AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Major Research Instrumentation-Recovery and Reinvestment (MRI-R2) award funds the acquisition of a RT-PCR system, luminometer, chemiluminescence detection system, and phosphor imaging system to enhance research and teaching capabilities at Agnes Scott College undergraduate program in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. Currently many techniques are performed on outdated instrumentation using non-quantitative techniques that hinder the progress of the scientific research conducted in these fields and diminish the quality of undergraduate training in modern quantitative analysis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As an undergraduate institution for women, Agnes Scott College possesses a highly diverse student body. The projects benefiting from this MRI-R2 award will provide an opportunity for a historically underrepresented population of students to participate in meaningful quantitative biomedical  research that will act in a synergistic manner with traditional classroom and laboratory  experiences to advance their scientific education.  All of the research proposed in this grant will be performed in collaboration with Agnes Scott undergraduates, and the instrumentation will greatly enhance the environment in which these collaborations occur.  Data and findings from research enabled by these instruments will be published in peer-reviewed journals, and presented by students and faculty at regional and national meetings.</AbstractNarration>
