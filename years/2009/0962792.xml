<AbstractNarration>Pennsylvania State University and several school districts in Pennsylvania, including three rural districts - Bald Eagle, Bellefonte and Penns Valley - and three urban districts - Harrisburg, Reading and York, have formed a partnership around Earth and Space Science (ESS). Several schools in the Philadelphia City school district are also committed to participating in the partnership. The Middle Grades Earth and Space Science Education partnership involves faculty members from Geosciences, Astronomy and Education at three Penn State campuses, University Park, Brandywine and Harrisburg, and targets ESS in grades 4 through 9. Teacher professional development activities concentrate on building deep conceptual understanding of big ideas in ESS in four topic areas: energy production, climate change, plate tectonics, and solar system astronomy. The goals of the partnership are to: 1) contribute to the understanding of conceptual development in ESS through the middle grades, 2) develop and support current teachers across Pennsylvania to engage students with the significant and complex questions of ESS fields, 3) strengthen the science content preparation of pre-service teachers to deepen their understanding of ESS, and 4) institutionalize improved communication and collaboration in teaching and learning among colleges and campuses of Penn State, in underserved urban and rural school districts, and across the partnership. The partnership is employing four main strategies to accomplish these goals. First, professional development for in-service teachers includes a suite of week-long residential workshops that integrate content with pedagogical best practices in the four  thematic target areas. During these workshops and in follow-up meetings throughout the year, teachers and STEM and education faculty work on developing learning progressions and performance standards aligned with them in the four areas. Second, initiatives for middle grades students involve teachers and guidance counselors in implementing the performance standards, curricula and pedagogy studied during the workshops, while collecting data to inform the learning progressions. Third, initiatives for pre-service teachers are focusing on curriculum development aligned with the learning progressions, capacity building for urban teaching, and authentic research experiences. Fourth, university faculty and graduate students are involved in professional development workshops and structured observations of middle school ESS classes in order to foster reciprocity of expertise, with ESS experts gaining pedagogical knowledge and ESS teachers receiving rich content-specific feedback. The research is examining the question of how an understanding of big ideas in ESS can be characterized as learning progressions, and how these learning progressions can inform the development of curriculum, assessment and instruction in these grades. The evaluation is focusing on collaborative planning to articulate a theory of change, and to provide formative and summative evaluation.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Earth and space science (ESS) holds the keys to addressing the significant challenges facing modern society. Questions about climate change, energy production, sustainable water and mineral resources, and natural disaster mitigation drive the actions of individuals, societies and governments around the globe. Responding to these challenges and opportunities requires informed decision-making based on an understanding of large-scale and deep time dynamic processes. Unfortunately, most high school curricula omit ESS for college-bound students, leaving it to middle school or for students whose perceived academic abilities are below average. Further complicating the issue, ESS teaching and learning itself poses significant challenges. The traditional educational model is profoundly outdated, relying on instruction focused on descriptive classification of rocks, minerals and time periods rather than investigations using authentic data and engaging students in scientific practices. Students and teachers alike have difficulty imagining the magnitude of space and time intrinsic to ESS processes. In addition, the interactions among chemical, physical and biological processes that characterize Earth and space science phenomena require integrative, systems-level thinking that is difficult to develop in a pre-college classroom.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The Earth and Space Science Partnership (ESSP) built a community of scientists and educators to improve the teaching, learning and status of Earth and Space Science by working with teachers and learners in public underserved school districts in Pennsylvania. ESSP employed three primary approaches: professional development workshops for in-service teachers, a state-wide teachers&rsquo; organization, and research into student learning that has important implications for instructional policy and design. This work is aligned with state and national content standards and our resources are freely available to educators.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Week-long professional development workshops on Astronomy, Plate Tectonics, Water, Energy, Climate, and Hurricanes enrolled some 120 teachers, many of whom participated in multiple sessions over several years. The workshops were designed and facilitated collaboratively by teams of science and science education faculty members, graduate students and teacher leaders, and integrated disciplinary content and pedagogy with a focus on using authentic natural data to develop and articulate understandings of process-level phenomena. One of our enduring legacies is the extent to which we developed and nurtured a community of practice among the teachers who participated in summer workshops. The collegial culture and climate of the workshops helped teams of teachers from partner districts lay the foundation for new multi-grade curricula, and enabled teachers to collaborate with peers from different grade levels, schools and districts.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>ESSP established PAESTA, the Pennsylvania chapter of the National Earth Science Teachers Association, as a virtual and physical community for sharing information, curricular resources and professional development opportunities (www.paesta.org). PAESTA now has over 800 members and provides open access to carefully-vetted classroom resources that include all workshop activities, position statements on ESS and STEM advocacy, non-fiction readings with study questions, and a range of relevant videos, images and podcasts. PAESTA partners with state and national organizations for teachers and Earth and space science professionals to offer annual professional development conferences, and serves as a community resource for ideas and expertise that connects college and pre-college educators.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Our ambitious research efforts built new understanding about how children and young adults develop their knowledge of big ideas in science around astronomy and plate tectonics. We used conceptual interviews with over 400 students to develop learning progressions around these two foundational ESS paradigms. Learning progressions are empirical descriptions of the overall landscape of conceptual sophistication held by students in the aggregate, and go beyond cataloguing their misconceptions and knowledge gaps to explore how their ideas develop in depth and sophistication over time and with instruction. Our findings provide insight into the sequences of conceptual development that can be leveraged to plan curriculum design and classroom instruction. Interestingly, our work in developing a learning progression for plate tectonics suggests the instructional approaches favored in the pre-college teaching of this topic may, in fact, be impinging on students&rsquo; ability to understand the paradigm.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Case studies (by external evaluator WestEd) of ESS teaching and learning and the landscape of STEM instruction at Penn State, and in public schools in both large urban and small suburban settings revealed widespread adoption of pedagogic approaches emphasized during teacher professional development workshops: Claims-Evidence-Reasoning, phenomenon-based instruction, coherent content story line, and contextualized teaching of abstract concepts. The success of this effort rests on the commitment of individual middle-grades teachers and university faculty members who implemented their learning and shared it with colleagues, as well as the support of their administrators. ESSP investigators are disseminating our findings through PAESTA and the scientific and educational literature. Together, we are working to educate next generation of teachers and learners to think critically about important global questions. These questions can be answered only through the informed scientific lens of ESS education, and our nation has a long road ahead to make that education a reality.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/06/2017<br>      Modified by: Tanya&nbsp;Furman</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/0962792/0962792_10044987_1509978311207_Picture6--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/0962792/0962792_10044987_1509978311207_Picture6--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Tectonics Workshop"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/0962792/0962792_10044987_1509978311207_Picture6--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Tectonics Workshop"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">ESSP partner teachers examine maps of ocean floor topography and sea floor age to develop claims about the origin and evolution of oceanic plate material.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Earth and Space Science Partnership</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Tanya&nbsp;Furman</div> <div class="imageTitle">Tectonics Workshop</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/0962792/0962792_10044987_1509977756625_Picture2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/0962792/0962792_10044987_1509977756625_Picture2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Climate Workshop 2"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/0962792/0962792_10044987_1509977756625_Picture2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Climate Workshop 2"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Teachers from ESSP partner districts evaluate their experimental data on soil and water heating rates in order to form scientific arguments about Earth's seasonal climate patterns.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Earth and Space Science Partnership</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Tanya&nbsp;Furman</div> <div class="imageTitle">Climate Workshop 2</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/0962792/0962792_10044987_1509977882647_Picture3--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/0962792/0962792_10044987_1509977882647_Picture3--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Ice core investigation"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/0962792/0962792_10044987_1509977882647_Picture3--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Ice core investigation"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">ESSP partner teachers examine an Antarctic ice core.
