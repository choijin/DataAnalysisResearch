<AbstractNarration>The p Laplacian  for most values of p is a nonlinear  divergence form degenerate elliptic PDE.  Solutions to this   PDE   (called p  harmonic functions) are  relatively nice in that they are invariant under rotations,  translations,  dilations, and also remain  solutions under multiplication by constants.  Still the nonlinearity  of  this  PDE makes even basic  questions difficult to answer. Recently the  principal investigator and coauthor Nystrom  have  proved a  boundary  Harnack  inequality (including  Holder continuity)  for  the ratio of two positive p harmonic functions vanishing on a portion of  a  Lipschitz domain.  This  project  proposal  is concerned with applications of this   boundary Harnack inequality  to problems  concerning the p Martin boundary,  the dimension of p harmonic measure, and to certain two phase free boundary problems.   &lt;br/&gt;              &lt;br/&gt;Most physical models involve  linear PDE  (in their principal part).  Laplace`s equation is one of the best known linear PDE and is often  used in  mathematical models,  as  well as to describe physical  phenomena. This  proposal is concerned with extending  some  classical results for Laplace's equation to its cousin  the nonlinear p Laplace equation. Recent  technology developed by the proposer and coauthors make this extension now possible.   It is hoped that  our work will eventually lead to greater use of the  p Laplace equation in  mathematical modeling  and in general in the sciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual  Merit:and Broad Impact   Laplace's  equation  was  used widely throughout the  nineteenth and twentieth centuries to explain such  physical processes  as   gravity,  electricity, and steady state heat flow.

Summary of  Results    During  this grant   coauthors and  myself   published  papers  on   boundary Harnack inequalities and the p  Martin boundary boundary problem in Lipschitz and  vanishing  Reifenberg flat domains.  We also published papers on     (a)   Regularity  of p harmonic functions near  the boundary  of  Lipschitz  and  Reifenberg  flat domains, (b) Free boundary regularity for  p harmonic functions in certain  two phase   free boundary problems (c)  The   dimension of p harmonic  measure.

My  work  on   p  harmonic  measure  began  in  the early  90' s  when  I  generalized  a  theorem of Bourgain,  concerning the  dimension of  harmonic measure in  Euclidean n space to the p harmonic setting.     During this grant, after many years of  trying,  coauthors and myself  were able to obtain  for  p  harmonic measure,  a complete  analogue of  Makarov's  theorem  in  simply connected domains  and also the natural  generalization of  Jones - Wolff   to   p  harmonic measure  in  Euclidean n space !   Finally   the   techniques   used in  solving the above  problems involve a nice mixture of  harmonic analysis,  complex function theory, and partial differential equations, so should be attractive to researchers and  graduate students in these areas.   Hopefully  our  efforts will  eventually  lead  to the long sought after   ` line  in the mathematical textbooks  of  future generations. '           Last Mo...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
