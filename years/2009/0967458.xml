<AbstractNarration>0967458&lt;br/&gt;Maginn&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this proposal is to elucidate the fundamental aspects of self assembly and pattern formation of well defined sheet forming peptides confined at interfaces. Our approach involves three steps. (1) It is proposed to design and synthesize simple periodic peptide sequences, yielding surface active Ã¢ strands that self organize into aggregates to form patterns as a function of the peptide sequence. Rational peptide design allows us to systematically explore the role of hydrophobicity, electrostatics and molecular size on pattern formation. (2) ) It is proposed to directly address the assembly phenomena using a set of interfacial characterization tools. Multiple length scales can be examined, including molecular length scales, using CD and ATR-FTIR, and at supramolecular length scales, using brewster angle microscopy, fluorescence microscopy and ellipsometry. (3) It is proposed to use two dimensional equations of state that define both the phase behavior and the critical surface concentrations of nascent aggregates at the interface. Subsequently, we can apply these parameters to predict the dimensions of pattern formation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rationally designed peptides and polypeptides are rapidly becoming useful components in nanostructured materials for applications ranging from drug delivery to energy storage. If successful, the PIs believe that the proposed research will yield fundamental understanding of  biomolecular assembly under confinement, and these ideas can be directly applied in hybrid materials design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CCNY's mission is to provide quality undergraduate and graduate education in a broad range of fields to a highly diverse student body, which is 34% Hispanic, 24% black, 17% Asian and 11% white, classifying our college as a Minority Serving Institution. The PI is dedicated to this mandate that asks for a multiplicity of subject matters to be taught to students of varying backgrounds without sacrificing quality of research or education. In addition to graduate training, undergraduate and high school research support for this work will be coordinated through two mechanisms. (1) NSF has funded NUE, REU and PREM programs at CCNY to provide research experiences for both undergraduate and high school students. (2) The PI has led the CCNY-HSMSE Peer-Learning Program for the last three years. This program provides an opportunity for undergraduates and high school students to engage in engineering and science in the classroom and lab. The PIs have successfully developed this mechanism that allows undergraduate and high school students to explore fundamental engineering and science questions in an engaging setting where peer learning results in common ground to enhance the learning experience.</AbstractNarration>
