<AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of&lt;br/&gt;2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Major Research Instrumentation-Recovery and Reinvestment (MRI-R2) award funds the acquisition of Data Intensive Supercomputer (DISC) at the University of Buffalo. The supercomputer provides transformative computing and data processing capability to approximately 250 immediate users involved in a wide range of innovative research and education activities.  The substantial compute power, large memory, and fast storage is utilized to advance the immediate scientific goals of over 45 research groups throughout the Nation. The spectrum of research enabled by DISC can be classified into three broad themes: (i) data intensive computing, clustering, and datamining; (ii) simulation analytics, and (iii) the novel real-time simulation by data analytics. A vibrant multidisciplinary community is built around the new supercomputing infrastructure.  Classes, tutorials, and workshops utilizing the new system are designed to engage undergraduates, graduates, postdoctoral fellows, scientists, and faculty within the local western New York area and nationally. The project team has a long history of successfully administering educational and outreach programs centered around high-performance computing. Many existing educational programs are impacted by this acquisition including: the Buffalo-area Engineering Awareness for Minorities (BEAM) enrichment program, the Eric Pitman Annual Summer Workshop in Computational Science, and Buffalo's "Mayor's Next Generation Scientists Program."  Results from the studies enabled by the new equipment are disseminated by student and faculty presentations at regional and national meetings, and through publication in peer-reviewed journals.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Under this program, the project team, comprising both computer scientists and disciplinary scientists at University at Buffalo (UB) acquired Data Intensive Super computers (DISC) that provided transformative computing and data processing capability to a wide range of innovative research and educational activities.  The goals for this project include:  1.  Operate DISC as a specialized research infrastructure for fast computation and analysis for the UB research community and its collaborators.     2.  Use DISC to achieve paradigm changing scientific advances in numerous projects.    3.  Build a vibrant multidisciplinary community around data intensive computing.    4.  Expand our extensive outreach program by adding the DISC infrastructure.  The DISC infrastructure is an enabler for leading-edge research.  The substantial compute power, large memory, and fast storage was utilized to advance the immediate scientific goals of several research groups at UB and numerous other groups of its collaborators.  The spectrum of research enabled by DISC can be classified into three broad themes: (i) data intensive computing, clustering, and datamining; (ii) simulation analytics, and (iii) the novel real-time simulation by data analytics.   This project led to the creation of a vibrant multidisciplinary community around data intensive computing. First, the Data Intensive Discovery Initiative (DI2) was formed that focused on applying data intensive computing paradigms to pharmaceutical sciences and financial engineering. And most recently, a Center for Computational and Data-Enabled Science and Engineering has been formed at Buffalo with significant funding from the University along with a new Ph.D. program. Nine new faculty positions in four colleges are added to this center along with existing faculty.   Significant and sustained outreach activities were done under the umbrella of Center for Computational Research at UB.
