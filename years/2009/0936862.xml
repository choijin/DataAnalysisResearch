    <AbstractNarration>This project is focused on the study of two classes of large aromatic molecules. The first class deals with new polyphenyl, macrocyclic, polyarylene nanostructures. These molecules are large and have high surface areas. They have strong intermolecular interactions and have the potential to form thermally stable porous solid. The second class is configurationally stable, chiral, twisted aromatic molecules. The enantiomers of these molecules are expected to show very high optical rotations and strong circularly polarized luminescence. The crystals of the pure enantiomers of these molecules will contain chiral cavity, which is rare in existing materials. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Professor Robert A. Pascal of the Department of Chemistry at Princeton University. Professor Pascal and his students will investigate two classes of large, unusual aromatic compounds. These novel aromatic compounds and their porous crystals may have application in catalysis, separation technologies, and medical diagnostics. They are also candidates for organic electronic materials used in display technologies</AbstractNarration>
