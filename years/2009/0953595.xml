<AbstractNarration>A complex (dusty) plasma is a four-component plasma system consisting of ions, electrons, neutral particles and charged microparticles.  The microparticle component interacts with the other plasma components, acquires a net charge and self-consistently modifies the surrounding plasma medium.  The resulting system is notably more complex than the traditional plasma, supporting a wide range of physical phenomena and having connections to nanoscience, fluid mechanics and material science.  As a result, this field has, over the past twenty years, rapidly evolved into a scientifically interesting and technically challenging subfield of plasma physics.  The objective of this research is to make detailed measurements of the distribution of thermal energy and the evolutions of the thermal and transport properties of a dusty plasma to address a number of open questions in the field of dusty plasmas.  This will be accomplished through the use of the next generation particle image velocimetry (PIV) diagnostic, tomographic PIV, and high-speed imaging techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this project will provide new and fundamental insight into the thermal and transport properties of the dusty plasma system at the kinetic level.  In particular, this project will provide detailed measurements of the distribution of the dust thermal energy, how this energy is redistributed within the dusty plasma system and will contribute to the development of an equation of state for these systems.  This project will provide new insight into the three-dimensional morphological features of these systems, such as the structure of the dust acoustic wave, and address open phenomenological questions involving the strength of the neutral drag force.  Further, this project will serve as a springboard to involve undergraduates at small, liberal arts undergraduate institution in cutting-edge plasma science research through direct involvement in ongoing research efforts, through student attendance at regional and national professional meetings and through the development of level-appropriate curricular material at all levels of the undergraduate curriculum.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Plasmas, an ionized gas consisting of free electrons, ions, and neutral atoms, are the fourth, and most abundant, naturally-occuring state of matter in the visible universe.  This fourth state of matter is ubiquitous in nature and is commonly used in industrial plasma processing devices.  Often, these plasmas contain small pieces of solid particulate matter, such as ice or dust grains, which are typically much smaller than the width of a human hair.  These dust grains become charged and interact with the background plasma.  The result of this interaction is a new type of plasma system known as dusty plasma.  In space, examples of dusty plasmas include the clouds from which stars and planets form, comet tails, planetary rings and noctilucent clouds in the Earth's ionosphere. Dusty plasmas are also formed in the chemically active plasmas that are used in industrial plasma processing devices to create computer chips, contaminating the end product and reducing overall yield, and the manufacturing of solar photovoltaic cells, where the dust can increase the overall efficiency of the resulting solar cells.  For the last 25 years, researchers have studies these dusty plasmas systems in the laboratory to better understand their many properties and to gain insight into fundamental question such as how do star and planets form or how matter transitions from a solid to a liquid state.     In this research project, our work focused on the thermodynamic properties of dusty plasmas and the properties of a wave mode that is observed to propagate through the dust.  Using a volumetric imaging technique known as tomographic particle image velocimetry and high-speed imaging, the motion of the dust component was measured.  From these measurements, it is possible to understand how the energy is distributed throughout the system, to make time-resolved measurements of the how the dust wave moved through the dust and to see how the dust wave interacted with an external drive (push).  By applying a number of different analysis techniques to these measurements, we were able to demonstrate that the temperature of the dust component was much larger than the temperature of the background plasma particles, to gain insight into the properties of the dust wave and to gain insight into a process known as synchronization, where the dust wave adjusted to match an external push (much like person being pushed on a swing will begin to swing at the same rate as they are being pushed).  These results confirm earlier investigations by other groups (including our own earlier measurements), but with greater precision and accuracy than any earlier measurements.  They also motivate our next research project, which will focus on better understanding some of the wave features that this project revealed and understanding the physical mechanism that is responsible for heating the dust to the high temperatures that are observed.     The scientific output of this project is measured in terms of publications and presentations. This project resulted in 10 peer-reviewed journal articles, 2 conference proceedings, 32 invited or contributed presentations at national and international conferences and 5 workshops on using plasma physics in teaching labs beyond the first year.     This project also contributed to the broader public understanding of plasmas and plasma science through its participation in large public outreach events, such as the American Physical Society &ndash; Division of Plasma Physics? Teacher?s Day and Plasma Expo events, and several smaller events, such as lab tours to community, meeting with individual science classes and a yearly outreach event to young women known as Girl Scout Science Night hosted by Wittenberg University.  It also contributed the development of the workforce by providing substantive training opportunities to 23 undergraduate students.
