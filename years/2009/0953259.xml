<AbstractNarration>With this CAREER Award, the Chemical Synthesis program is supporting the research of Professor Tristan Lambert of the Department of Chemistry at Columbia University. Professor Lambert will be developing several new catalytic methods for cyclopropanation and for achieving novel oxidative carbonylations.  The first cyclopropanation strategy concerns Lewis acid catalyzed methylene transfer from epoxides or related functionality, and the second concerns direct oxidative cyclopropanation of 1,3-dienes with activated methylene compounds.  For carbonylations, novel oxidative carbonylation methods will be developed which provide access to reactive carbonyl functionalities, including acid chlorides and aldehydes.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;Professor Lambert's research could lead to efficient methods for the preparation of complex organic molecules.  These molecules are highly sought after in the development of new pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals.  In addition, these compounds are important in any area of activities in which organic chemicals are involved, such as the study of molecular biology.    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Lambert will also be developing new laboratory experiments aimed at the high school level and designed to increase exposure to and excitement for organic chemistry.  These simple yet visually dramatic laboratory experiments will be focused generally on the accessible and fascinating phenomenon of aromaticity and will be accompanied by explanatory literature prepared by Professor Lambert.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ With this NSF grant, the Lambert group invented three new catalyst platforms that enable the construction of valuable chemicals more rapidly, more efficiently, and more economically.   The first platform involved a new class of strong base called a cyclopropenimine, which was found to have powerful catalytic capabilities especially for chemical reactions that generate amino acid derivatives.   The second platform involved a strong acid catalyst with extremely high catalytic efficiency, but which was 2-3 orders of magnitude cheaper to prepare than existing catalysts. This catalyst is potentially useful for a very broad range of transformations that generate molecular complexity rapidly, with minimal waste and effort.  The third platform enabled the ability to catalyze a "metathesis" reaction (a process in which the components swap substituents) of olefins and carbonyls for the first time.  This project also introduced a fundamentally new paradigm for double bond metathesis reactions that may inspire other new approaches to this useful area of chemistry.   The reactions enabled by these three new catalyst systems are potentially useful for all scientific areas that utilize small organic molecules, but are of particular interest to the biomedical and pharmaceutical sectors for the creation of medicinal substances.  Another discovery that arose from the research conducted under this grant was the invention of a new class of cationic (positively charged) polymers that incorporate small rings called cyclopropenium ions.  These polymers are being investigated for a wide range of applications, including drug delivery, antimicrobial coatings, and electronics.
