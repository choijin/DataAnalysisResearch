<AbstractNarration>The vision for the Smart Grid is to support new ways of producing, transmitting, distributing, and consuming energy to change and improve the sustainability of future energy environments. This represents a unique opportunity for synergy between research in social-computational systems and the Smart Grid application domain. This project will demonstrate that on the one hand, for the Smart Grid effort to live up to its vision and expectations, technological developments are necessary but not sufficient: fostering and supporting changes in human behavior are equally important. On the other hand, social-computational systems face interesting, specific, and unique research questions to cope with the challenges associated with Smart Grids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will design and develop: (a) components of an initial theoretical framework for social-computational systems based on cultures of participation and (b) initial architecture and interaction mechanisms for HYDRA, an open, collaborative, living knowledge environment to foster and support ecologies of different levels of participation. Evaluation in naturalistic settings will provide requirements and guidelines for future developments as a major outcome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will transcend existing technological research by creating prototypes of new socio-technical systems to empower human beings and provide opportunities, incentives, and rewards for changing their behaviors. Collaborations with local technology companies, local governments, and international researchers will ensure the broad impact of our research. Beyond the lessons learned from our specific developments, the theoretical grounding of our research will make our methodologies, components, architectures, requirements, and guidelines applicable to a large number of social-computational systems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The primary impact of this one-year research project has been to contribute to new approaches to sustainable energy use. To this end, this project has:  1) Investigated social/motivational factors and requirements for design      Factors   Identified     Requirements   Derived      Effects   of feedback type    Daily/weekly   feedback and real-time detailed feedback generate the highest savings per household (compared to a monthly bill).      Feedback-induced   savings and household participation (at different levels: national, state,   city, utility, community)    The   total amount of energy saved depends on three factors: (1) average   household-level energy savings; (2) likely level of household participation;   and (3) higher participation rates with opt-out designs (as opposed to   opt-in).      Feedback   gadgets alone are unlikely to maximize household energy savings    Most   effective forms of feedback include both products (meters, displays,   and other devices) and services (compilation of data, targeting and   tailoring recommendations, tailoring and contextualizing to consumers).      Motivational   elements and program effectiveness    Participation   is enhanced with motivational elements, such as goal setting, commitments,   competitions, social norms, and non-economic incentives.      Changes   in habits, lifestyles, and choices    Most   of the energy savings achieved through feedback programs results from changes   in behaviors, not investments.         2) Refined the underlying theoretical frameworks  including  further developing the concept of cultures of      participation providing  insights on ways to foster and support      individual and collective participation understanding and rethinking      energy use; a focus on lifelong learning, specifically on      self-directed learning, learning on demand, and the integration of living      and learning to address issues of energy illiteracy; and how to employ social production and mass      collaboration in peer-support communities to share information and      strategies for sustainable practices.   3) Prototyped systems and architectures including the design of symbiotic, knowledge-based systems to empower (rather than replace) humans utilizing the following themes:      Social-Computational   Theme    Smart   Grids Developments      Balancing   between "informate" and automate: designing technology to interact   with human behavior, actions, and decision making rather than a sole focus on   bypassing them    Smart   Grid that includes  human involvement when appropriate; fostering smart   communities      Interaction:   New models of social and participatory computing    Smart   meters for effective visualizations, simulations, and contextualizations      Infrastructure:   Human-computer partnerships (single person, small groups, mass interactions)    Advanced   metering infrastructure      Supporting   consumers to become active decision makers: Meta-design and cultures of   participation    OpenEI   and Epire: new forms of knowledge creation involving all participants      Assessment:   Measurement, variety of user studies    Eco-arts   for intelligible and engaging representations      Beyond   technology alone: moving from a focus on usability and sociability to one   that uses persuasive techniques to encourage sustainable choices    Foster   responsible and informed energy behavior; insights from behavioral economics      Policy:   privacy, legal aspects    Social   trust; New models for distributing costs, different business models, laws and   policies that better support social goals      Education:   mindsets focused on social and computational thinking    Energy   literacy fostering new mindsets and new forms of interest and engagement         As this research progresses, we will utilize the Empire (Empowering People in Reducing Energy Consumption) architecture shown in Figure 1.
