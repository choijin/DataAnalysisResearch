<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project is to develop a new maskless optical nano-fabrication technology with highly desirable process scalability and flexibility. The underlying process physics and chemistry will be studied by a combination of multiphysics-based modeling and experimental characterizations. A range of novel nano-devices for high efficiency energy harvesting and scalable bio-sensor array will be explored. The education objective of this CAREER award is to create education pipeline that prepares young researchers with strong fundamentals, cutting edge technological skills, and most importantly, innovative ideas to meet the demand for advancing nanoscale science and engineering. The approaches include 1) establishing a new education curriculum in Nanomanufacturing through the infusion of research discoveries; 2) inseminating knowledge of the advancements in nanotechnology to the under-represented population at Chicago Public School District; and 3) through close interaction with industrial partners, preparing the students with full prospective of nano-manufacturing and nano-metrology in industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the Maskless Plasmonic Nanolithography technology will pave the way for future development of a variety of nano-scale devices and system with ultimate performance, such as high speed computation and signal process, broadband communication, disease diagnostics for health care, and detection and identification of biological and chemical weapons for homeland security. This work will also create integrated research and education program of graduate, undergraduate, and high-school students at Northwestern University with emphasis in reaching out to the underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>
