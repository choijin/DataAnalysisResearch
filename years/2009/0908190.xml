<AbstractNarration>This project focuses on the propagation of nonlinear waves in the inviscid Euler equations, which describe conservation of mass, momentum and energy in a continuous medium.  The dominant feature of solutions is the presence of shock waves, which present both physical and mathematical difficulties.  Two fundamental problems are considered: first is the extension of the Glimm-Lax existence and decay theory to solutions having large amplitude.  This problem necessitates an analysis of multiple wave interactions up to and including the vacuum, where the system is singular.  The second problem concerns the existence of shock-free periodic solutions which do not dissipate energy.  These arise from multiple reflections of nonlinear waves together with a nonlinear superposition principle, and lead to problems of small divisors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shock waves are characterized by an abrupt, nearly discontinuous change in the characteristics of the medium. Across a shock moving, for example in the air there is always an extremely rapid rise in pressure, temperature and of the flow. Shock waves occur naturally in many physical systems, and are closely associated with the decay of solutions and dissipation of energy; a well-known manifestation of a decaying shock wave is a sonic boom. The celebrated Glimm-Lax theory precisely describes this decay for small amplitude solutions of two equations, neglecting higher order effects such as viscosity and heat loss; the theory is routinely assumed to hold in much wider contexts.  The first part of this project extends and confirms the Glimm-Lax theory for waves of arbitrary strength described by systems of two equations.  The second part of the project reveals the surprising conclusion that there are solutions which do not form shock waves and thus do not decay.  In particular, this research indicates that in larger systems multiple wave reflection effects slow down the formation of shocks and the subsequent dissipation of energy. Controllability of these effects would have many consequences, including applications to long-range signaling and airplane design.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ During the life of the award, the P.I. made substantial progress towards a proof of the existence of time- and space-periodic solutions of the Euler equations governing fluid flows in one space dimension.  Such solutions have the surprising feature that they do not lose energy over time, in contrast to generic solutions of these equations, which attenuate due to the presence of shocks.  In addition to providing an entirely new class of solutions, solutions such as these represent the large-time limits of all decaying solutions.  The progress that has been consists of:  1) formulation of the problem, including the structure of solutions and the physical mechanism which prevents shock formation;  2) establishing a Nash-Moser iteration procedure for solving the problem, which reduces the problem to that of finding certain specific estimates on nearby linearized operators;  3) understanding of the way in which such estimates can be obtained via a perturbation of the amplitude, a small parameter.     The P.I. also made progress on his investigation into waves of arbitrary amplitude and their interaction, including the subtle effects that occur due to the presence and proximity of the vacuum state.  This includes the proposal of a new approximation method which is designed to capture the expansion and compression of waves, as well as vacuum states, exactly, as these cannot be treated by approximation in this context.  The P.I. has also developed examples of nonuniqueness of solutions, which were previously not known.  The results of this project have the potential to cross-fertilize research in engineering and the sciences, being the result of basic nonlinear effects which should be applicable to a large range of phenomena of this type.  There are potential consequences for signalling and communication, if the phenomena described here can be engineered in real applications, allowing signals to be propagated over large distances without degradation.  The project also provides impacts on graduate and undergraduate learning, as it provides several examples which can be accessed without too many prerequisites, and can be readily incorporated into the curriculum.  This includes examples that would be of ineterest in classes on Differential Equations and well as Scientific Computing.
