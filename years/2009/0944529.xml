<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project seeks to further reduce the economic and environmental costs associated with sterilization of precursor materials for the Mycobond platform.  Mycobond is a revolutionary material that is grown from agricultural byproducts and a vegetative growth of a filamentous fungus (basidiomycete mycelium).  To ensure adequate growth all raw materials are either sterilized or pasteurized, which represents up to 24 hours of process time and 50% of the material cost. This research intends to use an emulsion comprised of phenolic compounds from plant essential oils (PEOs) to inactivate competitive organisms on all feedstocks while reducing manufacturing costs. Preliminary trails have yielded favorable results, indicating a potential reduction of the disinfection costs by 88%.  Furthermore, this procedure can significantly reduce both the capital expense associated with production and the environmental footprint by removing high entropy processes.  Achieving successful disinfection with PEOs, and later inoculation with the desired mycelium, will allow the Mycobond? technology to retail at prices below those of expanded polystyrene (EPS), granting a competitive advantage that would aid in gaining rapid market adoption.  The technology benchmarks well against EPS, and has interested early adopters in the protective packaging and rigid board insulation industries. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the development of sustainable, high-performance composite materials for the packaging and insulation industries.  10% of the petroleum imported into the United States is allocated to the production of inherently unsustainable materials. The Mycobond platform is a direct replacement for many these materials, applicable for products from protective packaging to structural cores. The use of a PEO emulsion seeks to further reduce the energy consumption of material production by closely emulating nature. The biological composites and related processes can reduce energy consumption fivefold and greenhouse gas emissions by tenfold when compared to an identical volume of EPS.  Furthermore, since the raw materials used are byproducts from American industries, a new revenue stream will result, bolstering local economies. The plants and related compounds utilized in the procedure are rapidly renewable and the proposed disinfection platform is an open system which reduces dependence on a solitary feedstock. The use of PEO emulsions to disinfect materials has value beyond composites production, and will find applications in agriculture industry and commercial cultivation of mushrooms.  The effective replacement of high-embodied energy processes will support local manufacturing by increasing the feasibility of low-cost, regional production.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

Eight PEOs were tested under this study and three have been selected for further research and process scaling.  The three oils (Cinnamon, Oregano, and Thyme) were comparable or superior to sterilization (autoclaving) when analyzing the inactivation of microbial contaminates. These contaminates include lower level fungi, ascomycetes and zygomycetes, and bacteria.  In order to quantify the disinfection efficacy of each PEO emulsion, substrate that was immersed and agitated in each fluid for a 30-180 minute exposure interval.  Substrate was then extracted from the emulsion and incubated on growth media (tryptic soy agar, potato dextrose agar) for 14 days.  The number of fungal and bacterial colonies were counted daily during the incubation phase to complete a comparative disinfection analysis against an autoclaved control (sterilized, 15 psi, 240 F, one hour).  The three aforementioned oils surpass the inactivation window that is presently granted by a pasteurization process during a 30-minute exposure.  These PEO emulsions inactivated potential contaminates in excess of 14 days, and pasteurization disinfected the raw materials for 5 to 7 days.  The process time is equivalent to the steam state of the art; thus efficiency is not compromised and significant capital equipment associated with steam generation and material cooling could be removed. Furthermore, each emulsion can be used upwards of three times without loss of disinfection efficacy.  The first phase of this research also conducted a preliminary process scaling analysis that involved 1.5-gallon batch reactions that were later inoculated with basidiomycete mycelium. The basidiomycete species that were selected represent a range of otrgansims that are either commercially cultivated for food (Pluerotus ostreatus) or used in industrial material applications (Ganoderma brownii).  The substrate was rinsed post disinfection with water, lime solution (CaO), or vegetable oil in order to devolatilize the residual PEOs found on the substrate.  The control specimens, which were steam pasteurized, exhibited full colonization of the substrate on an average of 10 days.  The materials that were disinfected with a thyme or oregano emulsion, cinnamon and lemongrass oils were also included in this study, offered full colonization in 14 and 12 days respectively.  Although the emulsion methods required additional incubation time the product yields were much higher since the pasteurized control had a 75% contamination rate (observable mold colonies) while the thyme and oregano emulsions resulted in 0% and 11% contamination.   In order to accelerate the colonization rate of the white rot basidiomycetes on the PEO disinfected substrate, the second stage of this research (Phase 1B) focused on the development of a fungal strain that is resistant to the phenols and aldehydes present in the emulsion.  The fungi of interest produce a suite of enzymes, particularly laccases and peroxidases, which splice or depolymerize other naturally derive...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
