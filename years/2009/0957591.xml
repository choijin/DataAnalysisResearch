<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Adam Matzger of The University of Michigan will study the structural and energetic factors driving two dimensional crystal formation on surfaces.  The approach is to prepare a series of molecules varying systematically in structure and/or functionalized through chemical synthesis and then to study their adsorption and two dimensional crystallization on surfaces.  Structural information will be gained from STM, X-ray diffraction, and sum-frequency generation vibrational spectroscopy, while thermodynamic information will be gained from flow microcalorimetry.  The broader impacts involve training undergraduate and graduate students, dissemination of results through publications and presentations, broadening participation through the PI's involvement as the director of the University of Michigan Sloan Foundation Minority Ph.D. Program, and continuation of work on the Two-Dimensional Structural Database.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will enhance our fundamental understanding on how molecules assemble on surfaces and in crystals.  Such work could impact a variety of areas in which surfaces are important, including environmental remediation, surface lubrication, and catalysis.  The research will also provide useful insights into crystal growth, which would impact industries such as pharmaceuticals, pigments, and energetic materials.</AbstractNarration>
