<AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will renovate the regional research and education network facilities operated by the Three Rivers Optical Exchange (3ROX), a small regional network serving research institutions in Pennsylvania and West Virginia.    3ROX connects the campus networks of the major universities in the region, as well as educational organizations such as local colleges, school districts and museums.  Current 3ROX participants include Carnegie Mellon University, the Pennsylvania State University, the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center, the University of Pittsburgh, Waynesburg University and West Virginia University, as well as intermediate units serving a total of 188 school districts in western and central Pennsylvania, including the Pittsburgh Public School District.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3ROX will expand the existing optical network to support up to 40 separate waves and will incorporate an additional node into the existing three-node ring.  The renovation will enable 3ROX to support the use of 100 Gigabit Ethernet circuits and make waves and virtual circuits available on request to research projects that have a temporary need for them. The renovation includes the enhancement of the existing management control plane and installation of a router capable of supporting 100 Gigabit Ethernet connections to the wider R&amp;E network.  These enhancements will enable users that connect to 3ROX to take advantage of the more advanced services being provided by the national backbone research and education networks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some examples of research activities that are likely to benefit from the network connection are: high-energy physics research, including detector development for the Large Hadron Collider, the development of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope project, molecular and materials simulation, seismology and earthquake engineering, and numerous projects that use the storage and computation capabilities of the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center.  Also benefiting will be those computer scientists in the universities served by 3ROX who use national and international virtual network research test beds such as PlanetLab, OpenFlow and Emulab.   New activities that will benefit from these upgrades include faster and more reliable access to large scientific datasets, major computer science research initiatives such as GENI and research on new network protocols and control technologies.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional impacts of the 3ROX regional network include: the provision of local, regional and national research and education connectivity to over 188 school districts in western and central Pennsylvania, containing  over 800 individual schools with almost 400,000 students and 28,000 teachers; the distribution over the network, to K-12 schools, of software modules authored at the National Resource for Biomedical Supercomputing that dynamically illustrate commonly taught concepts and images from static textbooks and include computer simulations that address these concepts on a quantitative level; the provision of network access to external science, engineering and technology resources for the Pittsburgh Science and Technology Academy, a recently-opened, special focus school within the Pittsburgh Public School System that is dedicated to students who are interested in science, technology, engineering and mathematics; and a program entitled Computation and Science for Teachers for high school science teachers in western Pennsylvania to prepare them to become leaders in the effective use of modeling and simulation tools in the classroom.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes Report for NSF Award 0963459  Project Title: Regional Network Renovation: Upgrading the 3ROX Virtual Research Environment  Project Summary  The Three Rivers Optical Exchange (3ROX) has provided a network based virtual research environment for the research and education community in western Pennsylvania and West Virginia since 1995. This virtual environment fosters regional research and collaboration by connecting the campus networks of the major universities in the region, as well as many smaller organizations such as local colleges, school districts and museums.  The overall goal of  NSF 0963459, "Regional Network Renovation: Upgrading the 3ROX Virtual Research Environment" was to renovate the research and education network facilities operated by 3ROX. The upgrades allow 3ROX to support higher speed transfers of large data sets, provide no to low cost network resources to researchers, enable new technologies like Software Defined Networking (SDN) and the ability to provide data about the operational network to researchers.  Major Project Activities  1)  Upgraded the metro Dense Wave Division Multiplexing (DWDM) network by adding a fourth node to the DWDM ring and increasing the circuit capacity.  Maximum circuit speed was increased from 10 Gbs to 100Gbs which allows the transport of 40 and 100 GigE circuits. The DWDM network now provides over 16 circuits and over 260 Gbs of bandwidth. This is increased from 4 circuits of 40 Gbs before the project started.  2) Upgraded the router that connects 3ROX to the Internet2 AL2S backbone with one that can support 100GigE connection speeds. This allows researchers to build Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs) across Internet2 which gives researchers the ability to create purpose-built private circuits using infrastructure that is already in place. This router also supports the OpenFlow protocol which allows 3ROX to support an integrated approach to Software Defined Networking by deploying controllers that speak to the switches and effect changes. As research and progress is made in multi-domain software defined networking, this positions 3ROX to be able to offer this functionality to researchers at its member institutions.  3) Established a Research Resource Pool (RRP), a collection of network resources available to researchers at 3ROX member institutions for little to no cost.

The second is the DANCES project at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center (NSF Award #1341005)which integrates OpenFlow with QoS into applications so that bandwidth and a data set transfer can be scheduled as part of a job run at a supercomputer site.  4) Upgrading the 3ROX Management Control Plane to unify the network across all 4 of the 3ROX PoPs. This provides for simpler network management and allows for the collection of network flow and operational data. This data is used by 3ROX engineers and can also be made available to researchers upon request for use in their project. The data has been used by 3ROX personnel to detect and mitigate a Denial of Service Attack on a school that was disrupting classes.  Broader Impacts  The capabilities of the 3ROX network were significantly upgraded through this project.  Researchers and staff at 3ROX member sites can now connect to a state of the art regional network that supports fast data transfers and new and emerging technologies. This asset can be used to recruit faculty and researchers and presents opportunities for growth.  The upgrades performed as part of this project allow 3ROX member institutions to participate in data intensive research areas, such as genomics that require fast, reliable access to large shared data repositories and data bases.  In addition, K-12 institutions have used the upgraded infrastructure to participate in videoc...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
