<AbstractNarration>"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5)."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will fund the acquisition of a 5 meter Armfield Laboratory Research and Teaching Flume with sediment recirculation and wave making features. The flume will be used to estimate the critical shear stresses of sediment in the variety of biomediated benthic habitats in the Caloosahatchee R. and surrounding waterways. The flume will also be used to measure macroalgal attachment forces and their drag force in a current. This information will help develop a numerical model of transport and dispersal of macroalgae. The dynamics of macroalgae are currently of great interest because of the need to understand the mechanisms and processes that are creating large macroalgal blooms on the beaches in Florida. Further applications will be to investigate the effects of freshwater inflows and sediment flow over and around oyster reefs, coral reefs and seagrass canopies, biomechanics of marine organisms and taphonomic (study of decaying organisms over time) experiments.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Acquisition of a Laboratory Research and Teaching Flume for Estuarine  Sediment Bed and Ecological Research and Education: Award ID 0959339  A Project Outcomes Report to National Science Foundation Major Research Instrumentation Program  April 24, 2012  David Fugate  Michael L. Parsons     Introduction:  This award provided funds to purchase a 5 meter Armfield Laboratory Research and Teaching Flume with sediment recirculation and wave making features.  The acquisition has greatly expanded the scope of current and future hydrodynamic, sediment transport, and marine ecological research conducted at Florida Gulf Coast University (FGCU).  The flume will be applied to estimate the critical shear stresses of sediment in the variety of biomediated benthic habitats in the Caloosahatchee R. and surrounding waterways.  Further applications will be to investigate the effects of freshwater inflows and sediment flow over and around oyster reefs, coral reefs and seagrass canopies, biomechanics of marine organisms and taphonomic experiments.  These projects directly address research issues of subtropical estuarine environments, many of which are already being investigated by FGCU.  This flume will greatly enhance those projects that are already underway, and improve the chances of further funding of sediment transport studies in the Caloosahatchee R., where there is a sharp spatial gradient in benthic biota, sediment grain size, and salinity.   In addition to research projects, the flume will be used in a variety of classroom laboratory exercises.  Some examples of these exercises include measurement of drag forces on different morphological forms of sea creatures, studies of ripple development under mean and oscillating currents, studies of critical shear stresses of different sediment bed types, and studies of turbulent dispersion in the water column, among many others.  Finally, the flume will be available for independent graduate student studies and experiments.  The flume provides an excellent tool for collaboration between physical oceanographers, coastal geologists, and marine ecologists, biologists and chemists.  The availability of the flume will greatly improve the PIs' ability to obtain external research funding, improve interdisciplinary collaboration, provide research opportunities to graduate and undergraduate students, and improve the appeal of FGCU's Marine and Ecological Department to prospective graduate students.        Flume Use     The PI has already submitted one proposal to measure biological mediation of critical shear stress of sediments in different environments in southwest Florida.  The flume is an important part of the methods of this proposal.  Other proposals using the flume are in preparation.     In the Spring of 2012, the flume was used in various class laboratories for the PIÆs sediment dynamics class.  These labs included measurements of critical shear stress of different grain size sands and natural sediments and experiments on ripple generation by waves (Fig. 1).  Further labs for Introduction to Physical Oceanography class and the Sediment Dynamics class are being designed for the future.     The flume provided training for an engineering student who helped with flume accessory design and development. Additionally, The PI and co-PI are supervising another marine science major studentÆs senior research project that involves calibration of clay clods in the flume.  The clays clods will then be used in field deployments.  The loss of calcium carbonate from the clods will be calibrated to current speeds in the flume, and used to measure the hydrodynamic energy in seagrass fields in the bed.
