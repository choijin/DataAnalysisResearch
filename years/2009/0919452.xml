<AbstractNarration>Recent studies clearly show that evolution can be very rapid, with substantial genetic change in traits occurring in as little as five to 10 generations.  Rapid evolution occurs in response to major environmental changes, both natural and human-mediated. However, the genetic mechanisms underlying the rapid evolution of traits are unknown. Wild radish flowers represent an excellent model system to investigate these genetic mechanisms.  Previous NSF-supported projects on this species have produced both abundant genome sequence data and demonstrated rapid evolution of floral traits that are essential to plant reproduction. This project will determine the genetic mechanisms underlying the extremely rapid evolution of adaptive floral traits in wild radish by combining traditional approaches from plant breeding with cutting-edge molecular genetic and genomic techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to improving our overall understanding of adaptive evolution, the proposed project will provide new insights into the mechanisms of successful reproduction in wild radish, one of the world's most damaging agricultural weeds.  It will also produce fundamental genetic knowledge.  Most genetic studies use highly inbred laboratory strains, but most animals (including humans) and many plants occur naturally in highly outbred populations.  To fully understand the genetics of any trait, including a genetic disease, the effects of the genes need to be studied in their naturally outbred state; this project will develop and test new methods for this purpose.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Adaptive evolution is fundamental to all life on earth, because species that aren?t well adapted to the challenges they face from the environment go extinct.  Most people think of this adaptive evolution as being a very slow process, occurring over millions of years, but research over the past two decades has shown quite clearly that evolution in nature can be very rapid, occurring over a few years or even within one season in organisms with very short generation times.  Evolution is rapid when there is a large environmental change, which means the organisms are no longer well-adapted to their environment.  Many of our examples of rapid evolution are in response to large environmental changes caused by humans, including global climate change.  While rapid evolution is now well-established, what is less well understood are the underlying genetic mechanisms of that evolution.  Theory suggests that the most rapid evolution occurs when the adaptive traits are affected by genes that have a very large effect on the trait, and more slowly when the trait is affected only by many genes, each of small effect.   In research funded by a previous NSF grant, we performed artificial selection on floral traits in weedy wild radish plants.  Artificial selection is analogous to natural selection, but instead of the natural world imposing the selection, humans do.  This process has produced all our domesticated plants and animals, including our crops, livestock, and pets.  We imposed this selection in a direction that should have produced the slowest possible evolutionary response, but the result was very rapid evolution by any measure.  The goal of this grant was to determine the genetic mechanisms that enabled this surprisingly rapid evolution. To accomplish this goal, we interbred individuals from our divergent artificial selection lines, and then interbred the offspring to produce a second generation in which the genes from the divergent selection lines were intermingled in different combinations in each individual plant.  We measured the rapidly-evolving floral traits on all three generations, including almost 5000 plants in the last generation.  The genomes of the 1000 plants with the most extreme phenotypic traits were then sequenced, with the goal of finding the genes underlying the trait by statistically associating variability in the traits with gene sequence differences.   While the analysis of this very large dataset is still ongoing, preliminary results strongly suggest that there were not one or two genes with major phenotypic effects as predicted by theory, but rather more genes, each with smaller effects.  In addition to the scientific papers that have been and will be published based on this work, we deposited the trait measurement data in a public database, and will do the same with the sequence data when analyses are complete; this will allow other scientists to confirm our findings and conduct different analyses on the data.  This project included participation by high school students, K12 teachers, and undergraduates, including underrepresented minority students.  They worked together in collaborative teams with technicians, graduate students, and faculty, and presented their work at symposia, included it in their classrooms, and some are coauthors on scientific papers.  This participation by a broad spectrum of students and teachers helps increase public understanding of science, and contributes to the training of future scientists.
