The chip-based microfluidic systems work has concentrated on developing biomimetic systems for sensing biological toxins. The basic idea is to coat silica beads with lipid bilayers that are attacked by adsorption of the toxins just as biological cells are attacked. Once the lipid layers have been exposed to a volume of suspected toxins, the lipid bilayers are separated from the silica beads and the transport of the resulting species is studied by fluorescence techniques in microchannels downstream from the beads. This method does not require prior knowledge of the toxin, but works by sensing the attachment of foreign moieties to the lipid bilayers. Future plans include the development of multi-channel microfluidic systems for the analysis of multiple protease toxins and controls.       Last Modified: 12/08/2011       Submitted by: Steven R. J.
