<AbstractNarration>This project will investigate the taxonomy of species from the charismatic tropical plant genus Columnea. Members of this genus are pollinated by hummingbirds, and are a conspicuous component of most cloud forests in Central and South America. Identification of most species is difficult to impossible even for the species that are already named since there is no unified treatment. This project will create a unified taxonomic treatment that brings together illustrations, descriptions, tools for identifying species, photographs, and distribution maps - provided both in print and via on-line access to all. A revised classification for the entire genus will be generated using DNA sequences as a means of uncovering traits that define taxonomic groups.&lt;br/&gt;  Training will be provided to numerous undergraduates and one graduate student. Students will learn all aspects of systematics research from formulating hypotheses and fieldwork to presenting results at meetings. Their training and education will be an integral part of this proposal and contribute toward training the next generation of plant systematists.  The results will be presented to both the scientific community and to the general public by publishing papers and developing web-based resources for the genus.</AbstractNarration>
