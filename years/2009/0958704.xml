<AbstractNarration>Collaborative Research: Late Cenozoic Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoenvironments of the Tibetan Plateau (China) (EAR 0958704 and EAR 0958602)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PIs: Xiaoming Wang (LACM) and Yang Wang (FSU)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a multidisciplinary, international collaborative project to study Cenozoic vertebrate fossils and paleoenvironments of the Tibetan Plateau.  The uplift and growth of the Tibetan Plateau have been linked to regional and global climatic and environmental changes during the past 20 million years.  Progressively cooler and drier conditions, possibly linked to the development of East Asian winter monsoon, seem to be a long-term trend and left deep marks on biological communities.  Our preliminary explorations in Zanda, Kunlun Pass, and Qaidam basins in Tibet, funded by a prior NSF grant, have resulted in a tantalizing collection of fossil vertebrates including mammals, fishes, and turtles.  Pliocene fishes from the Qaidam Basin are highly sensitive to the drying of Tibet and fossil mammals from the Zanda Basin suggest the origin of Ice Age megafauna elements from high plateau.  Collectively these fossil assemblages hint at the emergence of an endemic fauna sometime in the late Miocene to Pliocene (12-2.6 million years ago).&lt;br/&gt;This new grant will allow us to greatly expand our research program that strives to gain a detailed understanding of zoogeographic barriers and environmental volatility resulting from the growth of the high plateau and how these profound changes have affected mammals in that region.  An international team of paleontologists, structural and sedimentary geologists, stable isotope geochemists, and paleomagnetists, all experienced in fieldwork in Tibet, will attempt to achieve several objectives: (1) systematic collections of fossil mammals and fishes in these basins; (2) establishment of a regional chronologic framework based on the integration of biostratigraphy and magnetostratigraphy; (3) reconstruction of depositional environments and basin history and their relationships to the uplift of surrounding mountains and biologic events; (4) studies of the plateau drainage systems based on genealogical relationships of fossil fishes; (5) analyses of stable isotopes to explore changes in the diets of mammalian herbivores, plant communities, and regional climate and hydrological cycle; and (6) explorations of environmental implications related to the rising of the Tibet based on information of faunal successions, sedimentation, and stable isotopes.&lt;br/&gt;Results of our paleontological exploration are likely transformative because the poorly explored Tibetan Plateau yields unique fossils that are instructive about environmental changes and adaptations, zoogeographic barriers, and Ice Age megafauna origins.  Fossil vertebrates fill a crucial missing piece of the puzzle in the current debate on past biological world and paleoenvironments in the region as the Plateau elevated to a critical height to form a formidable barrier for animal migration, to forge new drainage systems, and to fundamentally affect the climate of the northern hemisphere during the late Cenozoic.  These new data are expected to afford testing of several hypotheses regarding systematic relationships of several unique mammals restricted to the plateau, timing and rate of growth of the plateau, environmental implications of the tectonic upheaval, and biogeographic consequences for mammals, fish and plants&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant supports an extensive paleontologic exploration in the Tibetan Plateau.  With the highest elevation in the world, as known as the "third pole," the Tibetan Plateau is unique in its cold, harsh environments during the late Cenozoic (the last 20-30 million years).  It is also one of the major factors that caused the Asian monsoon climates.  How did ancient mammals evolved in response to these unique environmental and climatic change is the main question of this study.  An international team of US and Chinese paleontologists, geochemists, sedimentologists, and structural geologists conducted an extensive survey in several important basins known to produce vertebrate fossils.  Intensive efforts were concentrated in obtaining maximum number of fossil vertebrates in as wide of a range of geography and time as possible.  Toward that end, we have surveyed basins from late Eocene (about 40 million years ago) to more recent time (2-3 million years ago).  As a result, our discovery includes the largest collection of fossil vertebrates to ever have been collected from the high plateau, forming a valuable database for further analysis.  Important breakthrough discoveries include fossil cyprinid fishes with massively thickened bones throughout the body indicating a drying, high salinity environment in northern Tibetan Plateau; ancestral woolly rhinoceros that were adapted to high altitude, cold environments and later giving rise to the Ice Age descendants in northern Eurasia; extinct foxes that are linked to the living arctic foxes, and others.  The latter two discoveries form the basis of a new "out of Tibet" hypothesis, which postulates that cold and harsh environments in high Tibet is the cradle of evolution for cold-adapted mammals from about 11 to 3 million years ago.  These animals were pre-adapted to the Ice Age (2.6 million to 10,000 years ago) climate and were able to expand their range when climate were favorable to their adaptations, i.e., the Tibetan ancestors gave rise to the Ice Age megafauna.  If this is true, then harsh environments are likely the primary drivers of evolution.  Collaborations with colleagues also help to address the question of vegetation, paleoenvironment, and paleoclimates, in which the above Tibetan animals lived.  Stable isotopes, such as oxygen 18 and carbon 13, are especially useful in investigating the plants consumed by the extinct animals.  Such an approach helps to delineate the plant distributions, which is in turned influenced by climates.  For example, detailed isotope analyses of mid-Pliocene fauna from the Zanda Basin reveal that ancient mammals, like modern herbivores in the area, fed primarily on C3 vegetation (low bushes, not grasses) and lived in an environment dominated by C3 plants.  Our integrative approach to the paleontologic research has produced 35 scientific publications and conference abstracts, plus one popular science book, one popular magazine article, and one edited book.  Because of the general popularity of Ice Age giants, our discoveries linking to the Tibetan ancestors of the Pleistocene megafauna are widely disseminated by popular media, main stream newspapers, and a wide range of international online media.  More than 20 persons from US and China have contributed to various aspect of this project, which helped to support undergraduate and graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and newly hired faculties.
