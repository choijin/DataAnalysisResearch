<AbstractNarration>Model theory is a branch of mathematical logic, which itself is a fairly new subject that originated in the late 19th century with philosophical investigations into the foundations of mathematics. However, in recent decades it has found many applications in other parts of mathematics, in computer science, and even in engineering (quantifier elimination as it relates to robotics). Algebra, on the other hand, is one of the oldest and most mature disciplines of mathematics. Aschenbrenner proposes to continue his research in the intersection of these two disciplines, where a fruitful exchange has been going for the better part of the last half-century.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is organized around several themes, including a continuation of Aschenbrenner?s collaborative efforts to develop a model-theoretic treatment of asymptotic analysis, and investigations into some model-theoretic questions with the means of combinatorial geometry. These topics have relationships not only to other fields within mathematics but also to applications of differential equations in engineering, and to computational learning theory. Another aspect of the proposal concerns finding algorithms for algebraic problems and studying their complexity, a topic which is of central importance for applications of computer algebra in science and engineering.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this project the PI and his collaborators made great progress in establishing a new part of mathematics, which they call "asymptotic differential algebra." The goal of this subject is to understand the long-term behavior of solutions to differential equations from an algebraic point of view.    A differential equation is a mathematical equation that relates a function (which, for example, may represent a physical quantity) with its rates of change. Such relations are very common in many disciplines, like engineering, physics, economics, and biology, to name a few, and thus differential equations play a prominent role in many subjects besides mathematics. Understanding the long-term behavior of functions that satisfy such an equation&mdash; called "solutions"&mdash; is important. Unfortunately, often concrete formulas for solutions are hard (or even provably impossible) to come by, in which case one may want to study ways to approximate solutions using "simpler" types of functions. Here a new way of approximation&mdash; called "transseries"&mdash; has emerged in the last thirty years, not only in the study of differential equations but also in theoretical physics and even in mathematical logic. The formal nature of these approximations makes them suitable for machine computations in computer algebra systems.  During the tenure of this grant, the PI completed a long-term project whose aim was to establish a complete elimination theory for systems of algebraic differential equations with asymptotic side conditions. In the course of doing so he showed that such an elimination could&mdash; in principle&mdash; be done by computer. This means that determining the existence of approximations of a certain kind (transseries) for the solutions to a large class of differential equations could be carried out mechanically (though how to do this in practice is another matter).  The methods used in this project combined model theory and algebra. This is another witness for the fruitful exchange between these two disciplines, which has been going on for the better part of the last half-century. Model theory is a branch of mathematical logic, which itself is a fairly new subject that originated in the late 19th century with philosophical investigations into the foundations of mathematics. However, in recent decades it has found many applications in other parts of mathematics, in computer science, and even in engineering (robotics). Algebra, on the other hand, is one of the oldest and most mature disciplines of mathematics.

Other work done during this grant includes other work on the relationship between model theory and two other fields of mathematics&mdash;combinatorics and geometry&mdash;as well as investigations into the properties of three-dimensional spaces, again viewed through the lens of algebra.

He mentored both undergraduate and graduate students and introduced them to his subject specialty, and he advised and collaborated with postdoctoral associates at his university and other research institutes that he visited.
