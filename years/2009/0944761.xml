<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The  Antarctic Circumpolar Current  is the strongest wind-driven ocean current on the planet with transports estimated to between 95 - 184 x 10^6 m3s-1.  [For comparison the Earth's entire river flow is estimated to be ~ 1^6 m3s-1] . Encircling the Antarctic continent, it has a natural 'chokepoint' in the form of the Drake Passage. This project is a renewal of a long term monitoring time series effort measuring the underway surface partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) in several annual transects across the Drake Passage on the R/V-IB LM Gould. In all some 100 plus transects over the past 8 years have now been accumulated of pCO2, along with discrete samples of other parameters of interest to studying the carbon system such as total CO2 (TCO2) values, isotopic (13C/12C and 14C/12C) ratios in surface TCO2. Additionally, measurements of oxygen, nutrients and such physical hydrography as may be determined from ship launched XBTs and XCTDs along the cruise tracks will be continued.  The measurement set provides an opportunity to describe seasonal cycles on CO2 and biogeochemical nutrients in the Drake Passage, to compare temporal trends and inter-annual variability in the carbonate system for an important part of the Southern Ocean, and to further understand regional and hemispheric atmospheric-ocean exchanges associated with the biogeochemical controls on Southern Ocean air-sea CO2 fluxes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will also consider collocated measurement of atmospheric oxygen along with a more rigorous determination of atmospheric CO2 to better anchor the surface pCO2 determinations with the atmospheric record.</AbstractNarration>

The "cruises of opportunity" provided by the more than 18 crossings per year by the ARSV Laurence M. Gould provide an ideal opportunity to monitor changes in the surface water of the Southern Ocean. This study was successful in many ways:  1.

During this grant period a new atmospheric O2/CO2 measurement system has been added to enhance our understanding of large-scale processes controlling surface fluxes of CO2 in the Southern Ocean. At the end of this grant period two full seasonal cycles of atmospheric O2/CO2 had been captured (Fig. 6).  2. Representativeness: An analysis of the Drake Passage suggests that measurements made there do provide a representative picture of a large fraction of the Southern Ocean and are therefore critical for monitoring trends that may represent the broader Southern Ocean. Although the narrowness of the Drake Passage may cause anomalously high vertical mixing, the rapid current speeds of the ACC result in a physical and biological footprint that extends both west into the Pacific sector and east into the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean.

This study suggests that the in situ measured NCP falls in the middle of the satellite-based estimates in terms of actual magnitude and is slightly more variable from year to year. It is important to note that while satellite imagery suggests a slow progression of carbon uptake by phytoplankton over the course of the growing season, the in situ measurements indicate that most of the phytoplankton-mediated uptake of carbon happens early in the growing season (November and December) (Fig. 5). The timing of the biological CO2 uptake is a critical component in accurate modelling of the seasonal cycle of pCO2surf in the Southern Ocean because a slight phase shift in surface temperature, CO2 supply, and/or CO2 uptake/loss will dramatically change the amplitude of the seasonal cycle.  5.
