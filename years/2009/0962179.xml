<AbstractNarration>As internet retailing increases in popularity, so does the use of pull contracts; a group of contracts used in any setting where the supplier holds the inventory and ships product directly to the retailer?s end customers.  Retailers adopting this method of satisfying demand are frequently presented with the problem of constructing these contracts with their suppliers in a way that maximizes profit.  In this Doctoral Dissertation research, the co-PI examines the issue of how pull contracts should be designed so as to allow retailers and suppliers to make more informed decisions when choosing and structuring such contracts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will address the issue theoretically and experimentally, placing emphasis on one subset of pull contracts called service-level agreements (SLAs).  SLAs are a type of supply chain contract where a retailer pays a bonus to its supplier when its supplier satisfies a certain fraction of the retailer?s demand.  Though SLAs are very common in industry, their theoretical properties and actual performance characteristics have not been extensively studied.  This work will determine if certain variations of SLAs seen in practice result in the highest profit for the retailer and/or supplier compared to other pull contracts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this research is lies in its potential to improve  supply chain efficiency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this study we investigate contracting in a two-tier supply chain, consisting of a single supplier and a single retailer, where the retailer faces uncertain demand.  We evaluate how the profits of the total supply chain, and both participating parties, are impacted when human participants, playing the roles of suppliers and retailers, set contract prices and make inventory stocking decisions in various contract scenarios.  Ultimately, we attempt to identify which type of contract structure can generate the most profits for the supply chain and the two participating companies.  In the first half of our study, we experimentally investigate how altering the inventory risk affects both the total supply chain profits and the distribution of profits between the two parties.  In particular we evaluate three contract structures, each differing in which party incurs the risk associated with unsold inventory; a Push contract where the retailer incurs the risk (such as at a grocery store), a Pull contract where the supplier incurs the risk (such as in online shopping), and an Advance-Purchase Discount (APD) contract where both parties share the risk.  We find that, contrary to standard theory, the APD contract maintains or exceeds the Push contract in terms of both retailer and supplier profits, suggesting that a Push contract should never be considered when an APD contract is a possibility.  In the second half of our study, we narrow the focus of the investigation and consider only Pull contracts.  We consider three Pull contracts in a controlled laboratory environment: a wholesale price contract, where a retailer pays a fixed wholesale price to a supplier for each unit sold, and two more complex contracts that, in theory, should outperform the simple wholesale price contract for the retailer and the total supply chain.  The primary result we find in this part is that the theoretical benefit of the two complex contracts over the wholesale price contract does not translate into practice.  Instead, human participants, in the complex contracts, have difficulty in identifying the contract prices that maximize their profits, however, in the wholesale price contract, participants have little trouble in finding the prices that optimize their profits.  As a result, when considering different Pull contract types, a simple wholesale price contract may be the preferred alternative.
