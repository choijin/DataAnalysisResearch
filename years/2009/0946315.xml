<AbstractNarration>This project is an evolution of the Principal Investigator's longstanding research on radiative transfer properties of ice, and turns attention to the absorption and scattering of light as altered by contamination of ice particles and snow grains by black carbon (soot) and dust particles of various sizes, shapes and composition.  A combination of laboratory experimentation, numerical simulations and theoretical approaches will be applied to this investigation, which will in-part hinge on a geometric photon tracing method to better determine radiative scattering properties of contaminated ice at both visible and infrared wavelengths.  A systematic analysis will be undertaken to improve physical understanding and insight into computationally efficient methodologies deriving snow albedo (i.e. energy reflectance) from a radiative transfer model representing both  single and multiple snow layers that include a variety of combinations of snow grain size and shape, black carbon/dust-snow mixtures, and realistic variations of the incident angle of solar radiation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this work relates to providing a firm theoretical and model-based foundation for reducing uncertainties in climate system forcing associated with changing atmospheric and snowpack conditions.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts will derive from improved ability to anticipate rapid changes in snowcover via improved model predictions and associated improvements in water resource management in sensitive areas, including but not limited to glaciated mountains and polar regions, as well as through student education at both graduate and undergraduate levels.</AbstractNarration>

We have made two fundamental contributions within the purview of this grant: (1) innovation of the geometric-optics and surface-waves approach for light absorption and scattering by atmospheric ice crystals of all sizes ranging from a few to thousand of micrometers, and shapes covering plate/column, bullet rosette, aggregate, hollow column, to snowflakes. (2) development of a stochastic process for &ldquo;dirty&rdquo; snow grains contaminated by multiple internally mixed black carbon and dust particles.

Thus, these research endeavors will have important wide-reaching impacts on atmospheric and climate sciences in the context of providing interactive snow albedo datasets, including the mixing states of black carbon and dust particles, based on fundamental physical principles. The objectives are to understand physical processes involving black and dust contaminations over snow fields and regional air pollution, and at the same time, to reduce uncertainties in the projection and prediction of snow albedo darkening, surface temperature increase, seasonal snowmelt, and water resources over mountains/snow areas, such as Sierra Nevada and the Tibetan Plateau, by means of weather and climate models in a regional context.</p> <p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>In addition to the research accomplishments above,<strong> </strong>the NSF grant also provided excellent opportunities to integrate research and education in atmospheric and climate sciences.
