<AbstractNarration>Inhibition of neuronal signals is an essential component of the normal processing of information that takes place in the nervous system.   Lateral inhibition is a key type of inhibition that is believed to play an especially important role in enabling the neuronal computations that mediate visual, tactile, auditory, and olfactory sensation.  The experiments in this project are designed to clarify the molecular mechanisms of lateral inhibition in the vertebrate retina.  The focus of the work is specifically on the role that hydrogen ions (H+) might play in the outermost synaptic connections of the retina and the potential involvement of H+ in lateral inhibition.   H+-selective self-referencing sensors and fluorescence imaging studies will be used to examine the molecular mechanisms governing the efflux and influx of H+ from cells in the outer retina, and the effects of neurotransmitters and neuromodulators on H+ efflux and influx will be investigated.  This project is structured as a collaborative endeavor between a faculty member and undergraduate students at a strictly undergraduate institution (Indiana Wesleyan University) with two faculty and their undergraduate and graduate students at a Ph.D. granting institution (the University of Illinois at Chicago).  It is designed to be one in which undergraduate students truly participate in the research endeavor and become actively engaged in addressing important questions in neurobiology.  Undergraduate involvement will be incorporated at both campuses and will include joint video-conference lab meetings and seminar sessions to integrate the undergraduates tightly into the research program.  The PI at IWU and several undergraduate students will also travel to spend one month working jointly in the laboratories at UIC.  These collaborative studies will serve to better elucidate the role of H+ in synaptic processing in the retina and central nervous system, while catalyzing undergraduate student understanding of and involvement in neuroscience research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Modulation of synaptic transmission and regulation of cellular excitability play essential roles in sensory system function.  An especially potent and underappreciated modulator of synaptic transmission and cellular excitability involves small alterations of extracellular levels of H+. There has been an accumulation of evidence suggesting that changes in extracellular H+ in the outer retina may play an important role in shaping the response properties of retinal neurons.  Neuronal activity in many areas of the nervous system has been associated with changes in extracellular pH.  Viewed by many in past years as an epiphenomenon of little consequence, many researchers now contend that such changes in extracellular H+ might be of fundamental importance to shaping responses of neurons throughout the brain.     The evidence in support of signal modulation in the retina mediated by small changes in extracellular H+ is strong. Much of the work to date has suggested that H+ is released from horizontal cells when they are depolarized by glutamate released by photoreceptors and by extension this messenger may be fundamental inhibitory agent that enhances perceived visual contrast in the retina. The work funded by this award tested the hypothesis that H+ emanating from horizontal cells mediates lateral inhibition in the outer retina.  Our self-referencing recordings from isolated horizontal cells provided strong and consistent evidence that this was not the case.  Our first publication examined H+ flux from catfish horizontal cells using both self-referencing measurements and the fluorescent pH indicator HAF, which other investigators had used to claim a H+ efflux from depolarized goldfish horizontal cells.  We found that depolarization of catfish horizontal cells promoted an extracellular alkalinization, and discovered that HAF staining was primarily inside the cells and was thus reporting changes in intracellular, not extracellular, pH.  Our second paper examined H+ fluxes from goldfish horizontal cells &ndash; the cells other investigators had used to claim an extracellular acidification &ndash; and found using self-referencing recordings that these cells also showed an extracellular alkalinization upon activation due to a Ca2+/H+ ATPase extruding calcium while taking in H+ from the extracellular fluid. In a third paper, we showed that under appropriate conditions, loading of the fluorescent indicator dye HAF in horizontal cells could be manipulated such that the majority of staining was restricted to the exterior face of the plasma membrane, and that measurements from such HAF-treated cells revealed an extracellular alkalinization, consistent with that found using self-referencing sensors. Our fourth paper described the unique collaborative research program we conducted to create a productive environment that facilitates deep-level understanding of neurophysiological concepts at the undergraduate level and promotes intellectual development while cultivating an excitement for scientific inquiry.      Broader impacts:  This funding significantly improved the research infrastructure of the PUI institution, IWU, enabling the acquisition of self-referencing equipment for these studies, and the engagement of undergraduates in direct, hands on research related to the project (3 IWU students were co-authors on publications and several more will also be co-authors on the work examining Na/bicarbonate transport in M&uuml;ller cells).  Overall, nearly 40 students have participated in this collaborative research experience. This award, coupled with support also from IWU, enabled 12 summer undergraduate fellowships over 6 summers.  All participants have gone on to additional education or occupation in STEM fields or health sciences. The quantitative results from student surveys suggest students perceived the program as a unique undergraduate research opportunity with significant educational impact that leads to both critical thinking developmen...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
