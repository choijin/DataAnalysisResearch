<AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program Professor James MacKay and colleague Jeffrey A. Rood from the Department of Chemistry at Elizabethtown College will acquire a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer to support a number of research projects at this primarily undergraduate institution. Faculty and students from nearby colleges (Lebanon Valley College and Franklin and Marshall College) will also use this instrument to support their research. The instrument will be used to support a large number of research activities, including: 1) the development of new synthetic routes to beta-lactams and allenolates; 2) the investigation of Group1/Group2 organometallic compounds and catalysts ; 3) the synthesis of metal phosphinate/phosphonate framework materials; 4) the synthesis and characterization of Group 14 organometallic compounds; 5) the development of luminescence-based sensors; and 6) the investigation of reactions of chiral, non-racemic trifluoromethyl-containing compounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry and materials chemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research for a diverse group of young scientists.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The funded proposal "MRI-R2: Acquisition of a 400 MHz NMR Spectrometer For Undergraduate Research and Training at Elizabethtown College" has led to a wide variety of outcomes and results.  Through the addition of a new Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectrometer at Elizabethtown College, research and training of undergraduates has been significantly enhanced.  In addition, the instrument has supported the research of 6 faculty members and multiple collaborative researchers from other institutions.  Research efforts supported by this grant have led to significant scientific outcomes:  4 publications in peer-reviewed journals (all including undergraduate co-authors) Undergraduate students have given over 60 presentations at local, regional, and national meetings   23 graduates from 2010-present (another 11 will graduate this May).  All had an undergraduate research experience enhanced by the use of this instrument.  Four graduated with honors in the discipline. Regular use of the instrument by Franklin and Marshal College faculty and staff when their instrument went down in 2012.   In addition, since the funding of this proposal, we have established a new integrated research course into the chemistry curriculum.  Chemistry 355: Integrated Laboratory is a senior capstone research course designed to integrate knowledge gained across the sub-disciplines.  In this course, laboratory exercises are framed in the context of a novel research question. Studies include original projects or are related to ongoing research being carried out in the department. The course allows students to experience how chemists from each of the sub-disciplines can contribute to a common project in differing ways. Ultimately, a richer understanding of chemistry results by integrating various perspectives.
