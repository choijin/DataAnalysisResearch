<AbstractNarration>Under the supervision of Dr. Marc Bermann, Roberto Campbell will explore residential variability within and among settlements and how this variability relates to processes of political leadership and community integration on Isla Mocha, Chile. Isla Mocha, an island located 30 kms from the Chilean coast, was during most of its prehistory a part of native Araucania, with a significant occupation dating to after 1000 AD. In 1550 AD, Araucania experienced European arrival but, contrary to most native societies of Latin America, the Spaniard's advance had been successfully repelled by the Araucanians by 1602, and a "free-Indian" nation persisted there and on the adjacent mainland until 1882. Yet while indigenous sociopolitical structures persisted until that late date, remarkably little is known about late prehispanic and early historical native sociopolitical organization. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To date, the main sources to reconstruct the native sociopolitical organization and dynamics have been European chronicles and limited archaeological research.  Each of these has tended to focus on chiefs and their activities. Therefore, they have failed to provide a fuller picture of the social variability that existed within the wider society. This research will investigate by means of intensive surface collection and limited excavation a 6 square km area. Mr. Campbell will attempt to reconstruct residential density, economic practices, wealth accumulation, patterns of consumption, status, and ceremonial practices. The fieldwork will provide data for: (1) understanding how communities were integrated economically and socially in both vertical and horizontal terms; and (2) identifying processes underlying social authority and regional social integration. The surface collections and excavations will recover ceramics, lithics, bones and shells (food remains and artifacts) and macrobotanical remains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will also have broader impacts. First, it is expected that the project will stimulate further projects and help to develop a patrimony consciousness in the local community. The project will impact current and planned development plans by underscoring the relevance of the Isla Mocha's archaeological record. It will further training of archaeology students in basic fieldwork techniques and more advanced material analysis training, encouraging them to approach archaeological research from a anthropologically and problem-oriented perspective.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ SocioeconomicDifferentiation, Leadership, and Residential Patterning at an Araucanian Chiefly Center (Isla Mocha, AD 1000-1700)     This research was designed to investigate household and suprahousehold-level differences in residential density, economic emphases, wealth accumulation, social status, and ceremonial practices in a prehispanic/early historic population on the Isla Mocha (Araucania, Chile). This population belonged to the El Vergel archaeological complex (AD 1000-1550) and subsequent ethnohistorical "reche-Mapuche" (AD 1550- 1750) periods on Isla Mocha (Araucania, Chile).   The work centered in and around P31-1, a site tentatively identified as a chiefly center in ethnohistoric accounts.  This research was designed to identify the activities and social interactions important in Araucanian social integration and chiefly leadership and therefore, provide a valuable "case-study" for scholarly study of middle-range or prestate societies at large.  An initial survey in a 6 km2 zone surrounding P31-1 led to the delimitation of three discrete sites (population clusters) of about 10 ha each, separated from one another by areas without archaeological remains, and the identification of 2 mounds in a likely public-ritual area.  The research also included a hyper-intensive surface collection of each one of sites and test pit excavations in the sites and in the mounds area. Radiocarbon dating made it possible to determine that the sites and the mounds were occupied from the 9th through the 17th century. The research did not reveal sharp residential or assemblage differences between the three residential clusters. There is a predominance of domestic coarse ceramics types during the entire sequence. The lithic assemblages reveal the predominance of local medium-to-low quality stone in tool-making. Faunal remains indicate the consumption of camelid, fish, rodent, bird, and marine mammal. Macrobotanical remains suggest a diversified subsistence pattern based both on domesticated and wild resources, although quinoa was the main staple during the entire sequence. The mound chosen for excavation revealed two distinct construction events: the construction of a large terraplain and a first mound reaching 1.35 m high, and then the addition of another 2.25 m to the top of the mound. Surprisingly, the mound fill was devoid of any archaeological remains.   Preliminary analysis suggests the existence of fairly undifferentiated residential groupings, without marked or sharp residential variability within or among the sites. Given this, it is most probable that leadership was rooted in "social" rather than in economic integration or processes.  In these cases, chiefly leaders do not amass significant wealth, and do not greatly materially differentiate themselves from the commoners.  On the contrary, chiefly authority rests in their ascribed ceremonial or managerial position, and may be based on their charisma, oratory, and ability to motivate individuals around them. Support for this interpretation can also be drawn from the mounds. They are located in an empty plain lying between the P29-1 and P31-1 sites, bracketed by an arm of the central range and an ancient landslide, facing the ocean and the mainland. These features are consistent with the ethnographic mound complexes described for mainland Araucania, which were (and are) used for a variety of political and religious rituals to integrate several different communities.   This project involved the participation of nine junior and three senior Chilean students of anthropology/archaeology. Two of these senior students were also trained in paleobotanical and ceramic analyses as part of this project. Once all the analysis is concluded, the materials will be transported to, and permanently curated at, the Museo de Historia Natural de Concepci&oacute;n. A catalogue of the material, the reports, and dissertation of the CO-PI will be also deposited at this institution, and along with the material...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
