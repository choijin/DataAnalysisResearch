    <AbstractNarration>Proposal ID: CCF - 0939976 &lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title: Design Automation Summer School 2009&lt;br/&gt;PI Name: Shang Li &lt;br/&gt;Title: University of Colorado at Boulder &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A group of active researchers in the field of Electronic Design Automation is organizing a summer school in the form of a workshop for young researchers in the field. The summer school will be co-located with the annual Design Automation Conference (DAC) to be held in San Francisco in July 2009. DAC is the main annual event and a major conference in the field that is to be expected to be attended by most active researchers in the field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop speakers will be mostly established and prominent researchers in the field of microelectronic design automation. The fact that the summer school is co-located will be an added advantage in that the most speakers at the workshop will not need to spend additional effort for their travel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the past similar groups have organized very similar events that have been very successful in bringing young generation of researchers up to speed with state of the art tools and techniques in modern electronic design automation. &lt;br/&gt;This workshop is expected to have a similar impact.</AbstractNarration>
