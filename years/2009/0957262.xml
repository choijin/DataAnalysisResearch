<AbstractNarration>Fishery managers around the world use marine conservation technology (i.e. a device that protects organisms and/or habitat) to address high levels of bycatch (i.e. non-target species caught or harmed in the course of fishing). Recent U.S. legislation requires that countries with bycatch of certain protected species adopt conservation technology or else risk embargos. The United States is a leader in the development of conservation technologies and is currently exporting them to other countries and contexts. The results, however, have been mixed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will explore the key factors related to successful cross-cultural promotion of marine conservation technologies by investigating two technologies: turtle excluder devices (TEDs) and circle hooks. Both techniques are used to reduce bycatch of sea turtles. The research will pursue the following research objectives: (1) Describe the types of technology promotion programs used by U.S. agencies and organizations to encourage the adoption of TEDs and circle hooks by fishers outside the U.S. and by fishers of distinct cultural communities within the U.S.; (2) Determine which aspects of these promotional transfer efforts helped or hindered the promotion and adoption processes, especially in regards to differences in language, culture, or levels of country development.; (3) Describe and codify specific methods used by individuals acclaimed for their abilities to successfully promote adoption of conservation technologies cross-culturally. To meet these objectives, the project uses a multi-method approach that includes participant observation, in-depth interviews, surveys, document analysis, and imitation games.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research findings will be used to create a best practices framework and to make policy recommendations for the transfer of marine conservation technologies to other countries and contexts. This study will yield insights into the applicability of the theories of technology transfer, diffusion of innovations, cross-cultural communication, and interactional expertise to marine conservation technology as well as develop a theory specific for the international use of conservation technologies. Such a theory will provide a deeper understanding of technology transfer in cross-national situations, for example, the exportation and use of alternative fuels and energy efficient technologies to address climate change.</AbstractNarration>

We were able to provide the preliminary results from this research to the U.S. managers responsible for this decision to help guide their path forward. This resear...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
