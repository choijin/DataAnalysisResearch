<AbstractNarration>This research project will build a framework for the design and manufacture of metal microstructures containing fewer damage-sensitive features, with subsequent improved ductility and formability. An enabling technology, Defect Detection Microscopy (DDM), will be developed in order to detect large numbers of defect sites in deformed polycrystalline materials in reasonable experimental times. Structure parameters (recovered via DDM) in the regions of critical defects will be correlated with defect type to determine robust Failure Initiation Parameters (FIPs). Once these correlations are known, an inverse approach, already developed for microstructure sensitive design of defect insensitive elastic and plastic properties, will be applied to the framework to improve defect-sensitive properties. This work will be undertaken in collaboration with General Motors Research Laboratory, and will focus on improved ductility and formability of magnesium for the manufacture of lightweight automotive structures. &lt;br/&gt;The introduction of lightweight materials into the US auto industry is a key national objective that will benefit significantly from this work. Current production methods for fabricating magnesium autobody panels require high temperature processing, preventing the use of magnesium as a viable lightweight alloy for high-volume automobile production. If the aims of this project are met, DDM will not only open the way for cost effective, low temperature, application of magnesium to improve vehicle fuel efficiency in the auto industry, but will also serve as an enabling technology in the study and development of a much broader range of damage-sensitive material applications (such as toughness and fatigue) critical to US industry in general. The proposed interdisciplinary activity also brings together expertise from several traditional fields including mechanical engineering, manufacturing science, engineering design, materials science, and applied mathematics. This will have a significant impact on the development of skilled human resources in emerging science and advanced technology fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

The ability to study the formation and evolution of such defects is fundamental to understanding failure mechanisms in such materials.

The potential long-term energy savings would be tremendous. By working closely with General Motors, a key collaborator on the project, the innovations arising from the project not only targeted issues at the heart of US industry, but could be directly applied to rapid progress in consumer products.  Several critical advances in microscopy were achieved during the project:  1. Dislocation detection using EBSD-methods was significantly enhanced. By extracting greater detail from the patterns formed in the microscope by the atomic lattice, both the quantity and type of the dislocations in the material were more accurately assessed.  2. The ability to determine surface topography and cracks directly from EBSD was developed, increasing the available information from a single microscopy method. This potentially removes the need for other methods (such as an atomic force microscope) to determine surface features, with the associated difficulties with overlaying the information from different sources.  3. Machine learning techniques were applied to the microscopy data in order to determine which structure features had the highest impact on defect formation and growth.  Utilizing these new capabilities, key relationships between microstructure features (such as grain boundary types), dislocation formation and twin nucleation and growth were observed. In-situ tests in the microscope were able to confirm a previously hypothesized theory that twins form predominantly at grain boundaries in magnesium. Furthermore, forming-limit diagrams, that capture the ductility of the metal under different deformation modes, were produced at various temperatures. These demonstrated a surprising change in formability at relatively low temperatures (75C), and a remarkable change in defect mechanisms with compression twins almost disappearing at these temperatures.  The resultant insights provide a strong framework for design of improved lightweight magnesium alloys for structures requiring combinations of improved ductility and strength.  Of comparable importance, this project directly affected six graduate students and four undergraduate students. Several extended visits to our partner, General Motors, provided invaluable opportunities for students to practice research in an industrial environment. Undergraduate students were also given the chance to intern at national laboratories in related areas of study. All students were able to contribute to over twenty peer reviewed academic products and more than thirty conference presentations. Two of the female undergraduate students involved in the project are now undertaking study leading to PhDs at MIT and CMU. A graduate class in the area of computational methods, based upon the work arising from this grant, was developed.  In summary, the project has had a notable impact on the quest for improved structural lightweight metals, and on the human resources required to engineer our future.
