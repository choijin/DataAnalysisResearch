<AbstractNarration>0932656&lt;br/&gt;Gubbins&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a GOALI project involving university-industry collaboration between researchers at North Carolina State University (NCSU) and at Quantachrome Instruments, a leading maker of instruments for characterizing nano-structured materials.  The aim of this project is to develop and apply atomistic simulation methods to obtain realistic atomic models for several new classes of synthetic nanoporous materials, and to use these to investigate confined phases within these materials and to assist in optimization of the materials for specific applications.  The materials to be studied are carbide-derived carbons, mesoporous carbons and silicas, and hierarchical carbons and silicas.  These materials hold promise for energy-related applications in hydrogen storage, catalysis, microelectronics (mesoporous silicas), and as electrodes in fuel cells, batteries and supercapacitors (carbide-derived carbons, mesoporous and hierarchical carbons).  Accurate and realistic atomic models of these materials are essential to the development of optimal material designs for these applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Preparation of these materials and experimental studies of structure and adsorption on them will be performed by researchers at Quantachrome Instruments, and this data will be provided to the NCSU researchers.  Quantachrome scientists will also offer advice on directions for the modeling work carried out at NCSU.  The NCSU researchers will develop and test a new simulation methodology, Hybrid Reverse Molecular Dynamics, for building realistic atomistic models of these materials.  Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations will be carried out to study adsorption in these materials, and of diffusion in the carbide-derived carbons and hierarchical carbons and silicas.  In the case of the carbon materials, molecular simulations will be carried out to determine their performance as supercapacitors, including studies of capacitance, power density and diffusion in the pore structures, with the aim of understanding the influence of pore design on performance.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit.  Because these novel materials are not crystalline, a combination of atomistic simulation and experiment provides the best route to developing realistic atomic models of them.  Existing models of such materials assume over-simplified pore geometries (slit or cylinder shaped) and are inadequate for predicting the behavior of adsorbed phases.  The realistic models that are being developed will make possible fundamental investigations of the influence of confinement and nature of the material on adsorption, phase changes, diffusion, reactions and electrode performance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact.  Improved understanding of the behavior of nano-phases confined within these novel nano-porous materials will impact a broad range of technologies, and is essential to the design of new biological and chemical sensors, nano-reactors, hydrogen storage media, electrodes for fuel cells and batteries, and nano-structured catalysts.  Graduate and undergraduate students working on this project will learn modern multi-scale modeling methods, and will gain experience of international cooperative research through our active collaborations in this area with researchers in Japan, Poland, China and Hong Kong. Graduate students from under-represented groups will be recruited through a bridging program and an existing AGEP program with nearby HBCUs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Porous materials, such as activated carbons, silica glasses and molecular sieves, possess very high surface area and as a result find many applications, including purification of air and water, as catalyst supports for chemical reactions, controlled drug release, energy storage and the separation of gas and liquid mixtures through selective adsorption.  These applications rely on the fact that a gas or liquid adsorbed into the small pores has properties that are different from those of the bulk fluid, because of the confinement and strong forces exerted by the pore walls.  Experimental studies alone are limited by the difficulty of measuring the properties of the adsorbed fluid, so that molecular modeling plays an important role in investigating these phenomena.     This research project was aimed at the development and application of molecular modeling and simulation methods for the study of such adsorbed phases.  The work involved collaboration with our industrial partner, Quantachrome Instruments, a leading manufacturer of scientific instruments for the study of porous materials. By combining the methods of molecular simulation (in which the equations describing molecular interactions and motions are solved on a fast supercomputer) with available experimental data we have been able to determine realistic atomic structures of disordered porous carbons and to then use these virtual structures to simulate and calculate properties of the adsorbed phase.  Our studies of diffusion of molecules within porous carbon and silica materials shows a change of mechanism from relatively fast, bulk-like diffusion in larger pores to a much slower single file (molecules cannot pass each other) mechanism in small pores.  Such slow diffusion is a serious limitation in some chemical reactions carried out using porous materials, and can limit the power output of fuel cells and batteries.  Our studies suggest pore designs that would alleviate the slow diffusion problem.  We have also studied the role of adsorption and diffusion in porous carbon supercapacitors, in which the pores are filled with an electrolyte solution and can store electrical energy.  The ions that make up the electrolyte are hydrated usually (that is there are water molecules surrounding the ion) which limits the amount of electrical energy that can be stored.  However, we find that for carbon pores of width 0.6 to 1.0 nanometers (0.6 to 1.0 billionths of a meter) the ions lose their hydration shell, leading to a marked improvement in the electrical capacity.    This research project has supported the training of four Ph.D. students and one undergraduate researcher, who have learned advanced molecular modeling and simulation methods and how to apply them to research problems of interest within chemical engineering and materials science.
