<AbstractNarration>0545987&lt;br/&gt;Smolke&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this research is to develop platforms for the design and construction of tailor-made molecular sensors that will be used for programming dynamic cellular behavior. In particular, these sensors will be used to construct signal integration schemes for programming logical cellular response. In addition, this research includes an integrative educational and research plan that will build new strategies for educating scientists and engineers and lay the foundation necessary for them to push the boundaries of scientific development and technology forward. Specifically, this plan proposes to: (1) develop a high-throughput strategy for the generation of trans-acting, ligand-responsive RNA switches, (2) develop platforms for the design of cis-acting, ligand-responsive RNA switches, (3) integrate these sensor elements into the design of logical processing schemes that program different cellular functions depending on combinations of input signals received, and (4) solidify a strong base in biomolecular and cellular engineering and encourage its advancement by training and educating scientists through cutting-edge, integrated research and educational plans.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
