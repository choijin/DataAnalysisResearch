<AbstractNarration>This project develops, from the ground up, a new theoretical framework for analyzing and designing algorithms for dynamic ad-hoc wireless networks. This proposal embraces network dynamics as an opportunity to be exploited, not an adversity to be overcome. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The approach is based on four inter-related thrusts:&lt;br/&gt;1. Incremental Topology Learning: Tracking changes in the network much more efficiently than re-learning entire topology, using sparse "error graph" representations.&lt;br/&gt;2. Topology and Traffic Shaping: Controlling the "effective" wireless network topology so that (i) at any instant of time it appears to be highly disconnected to scheduling algorithms, but retains global connectivity over time; and (ii) modifying traffic statistics to ensure statistical spatial correlation decay.&lt;br/&gt;3. Warm-starting Distributed Algorithms: Message-passing algorithms that can warm-start the optimization based on local knowledge of past solutions.&lt;br/&gt;4. Proteus - A Mobile Robot Testbed: This project validates its approach via implementation on a mobile robot testbed called Proteus, which is used to optimize algorithms in a practical setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: Industry is involved in this research from the start, via the WNCG Affiliates program at UT.  The research will be disseminated via publications in top-tier venues, industry interactions, and specially organized workshops. Both graduate students and undergraduate students, via a REU program at UT (with emphasis on recruiting women and minorities), get exposure to both real-world wireless networks (via the testbed), and  cutting edge theory.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project aims to fundamentally rethink wireless algorithms for dynamic networks; this means that traffic, connectivity and interference patterns change on a short to medium time scale in a way that cannot easily be estimated and planned for a-priori.   Major new advances include  (a) Allocating wireless resources using ideas from statistical physics (namely, belief propagation - BP). In particular, we developed a new technique to stop the execution of BP in a local distributed way, allowing for its use in fast-changing networks,  (b) Leveraging, instead of combating, mobility for broadcast and multicast dissemination. Specifically, rapid enough mobility means connectivity in the future can be used to save resources in the present.  (c) estimating demand and usage in the high-dimensional statistical regime, where there are very few samples, and (d) routing with very limited state information.  Besides these, the project also includes several other notable advances. Taken together, they provide a way to re-architect the wireless stack (i.e. the sequence of procedures required for reliable communication) in a way that makes it more efficient in settings where network state changes on the same time scale as individual communication epochs.  This project has resulted in several publications in leading journals, and supported the research of several PhD graduates from ECE at UT Austin.
