<AbstractNarration>Developed around the research theme of computer innovation in modeling and simulation of complex human and physical systems, co-PIs and their students will work with local classroom teachers with the goal of taking cutting-edge modeling and simulation from the fields of computer science, physics and astronomy and translate them into tools that can teach grade-level appropriate science content.  Each graduate fellow will be partnered with a local classroom teacher and will engage in a training, development, and implementation process over the entire year.  External evaluators will help us assess progress towards the goals and benchmarks of the program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More broadly, this work will build the graduate fellow?s teaching, analytical and communication skills.  The fellows will gain a deeper understanding of the foundations of their research in deconstructing and isolating the basic concepts of computer science, physics, and astronomy from their work to teach them to the classroom students.  Classroom teachers will be exposed to cutting-edge scientific research and the research process as well as forming lasting partnerships with university researchers and scientists.  Classroom students, many from traditionally underrepresented populations, will gain an improved understanding of science content and the research process, enabling them to be more informed consumers of science content presented in the media. Classroom students will also be encouraged to pursue careers in science, technology, mathematics and engineering from interactions with the fellows as role models and mentors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

This NSF Graduate Students in K-12 Education (GK12) program places science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) graduate student fellows in 6<sup>th</sup> &ndash; 12<sup>th</sup> grade math and science classrooms for the academic year with the goal of enriching their education and strengthening their development as researchers by advancing their communication and teaching skills. The fellows work in partnership with a collaborating teacher to bring more inquiry-based teaching methods into the classroom and to further expose middle and high school teachers and students to the research process. From June 2010 through May 2016, <em>Reach for the Stars</em> worked with 34 different graduate students, 31 classroom teachers at 16 different schools. During this time lesson plans were developed and introduced to over 4,000 middle and high school students. These lessons are still utilized in the classrooms today, introducing computational thinking and modeling to more and more students each year. The lessons are freely available and can be found at <a href="http://gk12.ciera.northwestern.edu/classroom/lessonplans.html">http://gk12.ciera.northwestern.edu/classroom/lessonplans.html</a>.<br /><br />Teachers selected for the program have come from schools in Evanston, Chicago, Skokie, and other communities close to the Northwestern campus.

Reach for the Stars does just this.

John Kretsos, Science Instructor Niles North High School Reach for the Stars Teacher Fellow, 2013-2014 "GK-12 is invaluable to me, post-graduation. I often find myself remembering lessons from the program. Much of my job now is communication and education with my users: scientists from diverse backgrounds.
