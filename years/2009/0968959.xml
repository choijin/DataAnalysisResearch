<AbstractNarration>0968959 Ball State University (BSU); Wayne Zage &lt;br/&gt;0968939 Iowa State University (ISU); Doug Jacobson&lt;br/&gt;   &lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this proposal is to start a new I/UCRC "Security and Software Engineering Research Center (S2ERC)" with a focus on improving the management of the software engineering process, the productivity of software engineers, and the security, quality and timeliness of software engineering products.  The lead of the proposed Center will be Ball State University (BSU) with a site location at Iowa State University (ISU).&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The proposed Center (S2ERC) plans to investigate integrated methods of engineering practical software systems that are able to meet emerging security requirements in addition to encompassing traditional software engineering objectives.  This goal is of great importance to both industry and government in order for them to be able to confidently deploy real-world software systems that meet their mission goals even in the face of a broad range of security attacks.  The proposal introduces a high-level framework to capture and guide the research focus of the Center on issues germane to effective software engineering techniques as well as high security assurance. The S2ERC researchers include national prize winners, NSF Career Award winners, conference best paper winners, IEEE Fellows, journal editors and distinguished professors.  The collaborations with various prospective company members have suggested many promising research initiatives for the proposed Center. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed Center will be an intellectually nurturing environment where discovery and understanding is advanced to its faculty, students and prospective members. The proposed Center will provide faculty and students the unique opportunity to work on research teams in real world security and software engineering applications.  The proposed semi-annual S2ERC showcases will provide an excellent opportunity for all the students to interact with industrial partners and get a first-hand understanding of emerging challenges and opportunities in their careers.  The faculty and students will be a programmatically diverse group from departments such as CS, EE, Industrial Engineering, Management, and Systems Engineering.  The diversity of the researchers is enhanced further by women faculty.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Security and Software Engineering Research Center (S2ERC), established in 2010 as a National Science Foundation (NSF) Industry/University Cooperative Research Center, is a testament that NSF believes that security and software engineering are key research areas for our country.  Software developers as well as end-users desire software that costs less, matches usersÆ needs, is secure, has credible defenses and fewer bugs, executes faster, is easier to update, and is completed on time. However, each of these goals is difficult individually and virtually impossible to achieve jointly.   New challenges related to the development, security, diffusion and effective application of advanced information technologies require a major investment.  Together, S2ERC university researchers and practitioners fostered a collaborative research environment in which they shared ideas and formed novel directions to meet individual project goals.  Addressing those goals, S2ERC funded 64 individual research and development projects and technology applications.  Thirty software engineering projects addressed the creation and application of methods for systematically developing, operating and maintaining complex, high-quality software. Twelve projects, labeled as a combination of software engineering and security, searched for engineering techniques to develop secure systems or assess the security of existing software.  Twenty-two projects focused on specific aspects of cyber security including intrusion detection, wireless security, network security, security-in-cloud computing, malware detection and mitigation.  The S2ERC did not directly create the software or its services; it helped make them better. As depicted in the figure, S2ERC assisted in making software that is reliable, safe, crafted with integrity, green, efficient, correct and secure, and also software that protects our physical infrastructure, finances and the Internet of Things.  Not only did the 64 projects undertaken by the Center affect the producers and commercial users of software, but also they potentially impact the services and their performance for every US resident.  Related to security, S2ERC projects have influenced the direction of cellular and telephone networks, authentication methods, protection in the cloud, grid defense, identification of and protection from malware, privacy protection in social networks, participation and encouragement of cyber information sharing, enhanced intrusion detection, and secure online operations.  In the realm of software engineering, S2ERC projects improved the software development process, made legacy systems more understandable and modifiable, created software design metrics that identify during design potential problems in code not yet written, developed efficient software testing strategies that targeted where to place testing effort, and helped deliver reliable, high-quality software.  All of these advancements were accomplished through fundamental, user-directed Center research which will continue to provide enormous dividends for industry and society for the foreseeable future.  It is important to recognize that the Center, while focused on conducting high-quality and nationally important research, also focused on students.  Each student who directly participated in the S2ERC received an immersive research learning experience. The S2ERC engaged graduate and undergraduate students as they worked on research teams in real world security and software engineering applications with excellent research faculty and skilled practitioners from the member organizations.  Not only did students work with an industrial or government client on a project with practical meaning, but also they learned how to be professional, responsible, and creative. Every project extends the boundaries of current knowledge, and this knowledge is transferred to the research students working with their faculty mentors.  Faculty continuously supervise graduate an...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
