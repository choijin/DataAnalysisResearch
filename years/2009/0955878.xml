<AbstractNarration>In this Career award, funded by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging program of the Division of Chemistry and the EPSCoR office, Professor Miao from the University of Southern Mississippi and his students will conduct research on biosensors based on electrogenerated chemiluminescence (ECL). The focus will be on simultaneous multiplexing ECL detection and quantification of biomolecules in a sample matrix with nanomaterials. The proposed detection scheme may allow for simultaneous measurements of 3-5 analytes without the need for target amplification or the use of enzymes. By using different types of ECL labels (hydrophobic, hydrophilic, and quantum dots), ECL detection can be performed in either organic or aqueous solutions, or in a solid-state format. Tools such as cyclic voltammetry, ECL coupled with scanning electrochemical microscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, and electrochemical and ECL digital simulations will be used to achieve these objectives. Furthermore, investigation and preparation of nano-thickness Au film or Au nanoparticles (NPs) coatings for transparent electrodes for high performance ECL detection will be carried out. Finally, investigations of the photochemical, electrochemical, and ECL behavior as well as an exploration of sensing applications of templated micro- to nano-scale semiconductive metal chalcogenide films and NPs will be conducted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ECL biosensors may find applications in clinical diagnostics, forensic chemistry, environmental investigations, pharmaceutical studies, and even in sensitive detection of high explosives and biological warfare agents - which is a pertinent issue in global security.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Miao's research will be integrated with undergraduate and graduate education. In this context, an analytical ECL lab that is inexpensive, easy to operate, and adaptable to various levels of teaching and learning environments will be developed with an electrochemical instrument manufacture. In addition, in collaboration with colleagues from USM, Professor Miao will integrate instrumental analysis and inorganic as well as physical chemistry experiments into one senior undergraduate chemistry lab. The implementation of an integrative lab will serve as a model for other chemistry departments in the region and provide the opportunity to forge more robust relationships between USM and regional community colleges.</AbstractNarration>
