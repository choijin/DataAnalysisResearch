<AbstractNarration>This is to request support in the amount $10,000 to enable students to attend the 53rd International Conference on Electron, Ion and Photon Beam Technology and Nanofabrication, 2009, to be held in Marco Island Beach, May 26 to May 29, 2009. In the fields of nanofabrication, electron and ion-beam lithographies, photon and imprint lithographies, particle-beam optics, and forefront applications of nanofabrication, this conference is preeminent. The requested travel aid will enable students to present their research to a high level international scientific community. They will observe how scientists and engineers exchange innovative ideas and other information at conferences, and they will hear first-hand presentations of up-to-date research results in nanotechnology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Learning how a technical conference serves as a venue for conveying information to other is an important element of a students education. &lt;br/&gt;Also important is leaning how to present, in a cogent and understandable way, the results of ones research. The requested support will help to accomplish these ends. At the conference students will make important personal contacts and learn of employment opportunities. In a special student breakfast, to be held on Friday, the conference organizers will describe to the students how the conference program is put together and how papers are selected for oral or poster presentation.</AbstractNarration>
