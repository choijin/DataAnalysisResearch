<AbstractNarration>In the developing brain, spontaneous activity (not driven by external input) is critical for appropriate circuit formation.  These experiments will investigate the mechanisms by which serotonergic neurons in the embryonic mouse hindbrain begin and cease expression of spontaneous activity.  These neurons drive waves of electrical activity across the entire hindbrain, which is important in specifying axonal projections both of the serotonergic neurons, and in follower neurons.  Previous work has shown that pharmacological blockade of the serotonin receptor prevents the onset of the spontaneous activity.  The current goals, using physiological and anatomical techniques, are elucidating the mechanism(s) governing the onset of activity and the role of serotonin receptor signaling in that onset.  In addition, the mechanism(s) that dictate the retraction of activity to the driver cells and cessation over 3 developmental days will be determined.  This work characterizes important processes in the regulation of spontaneous activity which directs correct network formation.  Thus, it examines the basic mechanisms by which neurons find and maintain correct innervation patterns during development.  The lab has had many undergraduates and a number of high school students participate in the research project, to the point of publication.  This includes a week-long workshop for disabled high school students as part of a summer program, where the students are able to use physiological techniques and observe spontaneous activity.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Spontaneous activity (SA) regulates a variety of processes in central nervous system development, including regulation of phenotype, migration of both cell bodies and growth cones, pathfinding of axons and dendrites, and synaptic initiation and maintenance. The patterns and timing of SA are crucially important, as aberrant spontaneous events and accompanying changes in [Ca]i at the wrong stage(s) of development may alter gene regulation incorrectly.  Over the most recent funding period, we have explored the patterns of SA timing, patterning, and regulation in the brainstem.     SA in the mouse brainstem originates in a discrete initiation zone (see Figure 1), found at the midline of former rhombomere 2, within the developing neurons of the serotonergic (5HT) raphe.  SA waves require signaling through 5HT receptors for their activity, implying that the developing raphe is involved in the SA. More than 80% of waves initiate at the InZ, and propagate in patterns that are regulated in a spatiotemporal manner.  At embryonic day (E) 11.5, waves propagate laterally in the hindbrain, as well as extending rostrally and caudally along the midline.  24 hours later in development, at E12.5, waves no longer propagate to the lateral regions, but are able to loop along the midline of the isthmus (see below). Again, 24 hours later, waves retract from the caudal midline, and 24 hours after that, are extinguished in the InZ.  Thus, each developmental day has a specific pattern of SA associated with it.      How are the propagation patterns of waves altered?  Cells in the brainstem at early embryonic stages (E10.5) are relatively depolarized, with resting potentials of approximately -50 mV.  These cells are close to the firing threshold, and therefore are perfectly situated to undergo depolarization with small inputs.  Cells in the InZ have high input resistance, and express a calcium channel that tends to open at -50 mV; thus, these cells are able to undergo spontaneous depolarizing events (Moruzzi et al., 2009).  These waves invade other depolarized cells, as they are near threshold.  Our lab recently demonstrated, using patch clamp recording, that cells in the hindbrain undergo gradual hyperpolarization, in a spatiotemporal pattern that mirrors the pattern of retraction of propagating waves (Watari et al., 2013). This hyperpolarization is mediated by upregulation of a resting K channel, and leads to an increase in conductance concomitant with the change in potential (see Figure 2).  Both of these features lead to the inability of waves to successfully invade the hyperpolarized cells; thus, propagating waves retract gradually over developmental time.     In addition, our lab showed that at each specific developmental time-point, different groups of cells, presumably those undergoing defined events such as specification or differentiation, are allowed to experience the waves.  Remarkably, one of the more unique patterns is at E12.5, in which midline cells and cells on the midbrain side of the isthmus undergo repeated volleys of activity, sometimes lasting 20-60 minutes (see Figure 3; Watari et al., 2014).  These prolonged [Ca]i transients are likely to have substantial effects on the genome of the cells, dictating certain steps in gene expression.      Why is the biological consequence of the altered propagation patterns of SA waves?  At E11.5, waves are able to invade all regions of the hindbrain, though lateral waves are less intense than midline waves.  Lateral cells soon drop out of propagating waves, while midline waves remain more intense and occur in repeated volleys.  Even at E13.5, after the period of rapid loops, the region between the initiation zone and the isthmus experiences repeated increases in [Ca]i . Thus, we investigated the effect of SA on cells and axons closest to the midline that are involved in SA waves.  In the developing hindbrain, serotonergic neurons are born in two groups: The rostral group, innervating the entire ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
