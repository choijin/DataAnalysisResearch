<AbstractNarration>0960222&lt;br/&gt;Glass&lt;br/&gt;U. of Louisiana at Lafayette&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Summary:  &lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is an ongoing critical need for new-generation techniques to probe materials structure and properties with nanoscale resolutions and to manipulate organic and inorganic nano-materials.  High energy (MeV) ions can penetrate well below surfaces of materials with negligible scattering and with precisely controllable ion-atom interactions, thereby offering a unique means by which surface to sub-surface regions can be studied and/or manipulated.  The rather cumbersome magnetic focusing systems that have been utilized worldwide as the mainstay of MeV proton microprobe systems have attained notable operational accomplishments, but the inability of these systems to focus heavy ion beams has skewed virtually all work with focused MeV ion beams to those topics for which proton beams can be used - the remainder of the periodic table has remained essentially untouched. &lt;br/&gt;This project will develop a novel electrostatic high energy focused ion beam (HEFIB) nanoprobe system specifically designed for modifying and characterizing materials at nanoscale dimensions using heavy MeV ions.  In contrast to the mass dependent magnetic field focusing systems now used worldwide, a mass-independent electrostatic quadrupole focusing will enable major improvements of more than an order of magnitude for several of the operational and physical parameters relative to the presently available magnetic focusing systems.  The most significant of these technological improvements to be realized are the substantial reduction of the minimum attainable probe size for MeV heavy ions to sub-100 nm dimensions and the capability to produce sub-100 nm probes of any ion or charged cluster.&lt;br/&gt;Collaborating in the development of the system will be the Louisiana Accelerator Center at The University of Louisiana at Lafayette, The University of North Texas, and National Electrostatics Corporation.  Additionally, the establishment of a synergistic collaborative network within this development project which links national laboratories and other universities will enhance and accelerate the dissemination of technology advancement in a number of research areas having national and international relevance.  Notably, this unique instrumentation constitutes a revolutionary advancement of technological resources for materials research and the students participating in this project will work side by side with leading U.S. experts in the field from universities, national laboratories, and industry to develop a unique research tool, while concurrently gaining invaluable experience with interdisciplinary fields of science and engineering.  The anticipated broad growth and impact of this technology will also simultaneously open new opportunities for a demographically diverse community of students and faculty.&lt;br/&gt;Layman Summary:  &lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scientists and engineers are continually looking for new ways to probe and study materials on the microscopic scale and high energy ion beams are one of the versatile technological tools available.  An ion is the result of removing one or more electrons from an atom to make it electrically charged and therefore able to have its motion influenced with magnetic or electric fields. When high energy ions strike the surfaces of materials they interact with the atoms in the surface to allow the study of surface and bulk properties.  Focusing these ion beams to small spots makes it possible to investigate the properties of materials on a microscopic scale.  Patterns can also be "written" in a process called nanolithography.  However, the magnetic focusing systems presently in use today have a major disadvantage because the focusing is effective only for low mass proton (hydrogen ion) beams.   &lt;br/&gt;The Louisiana Accelerator Center of The University of Louisiana at Lafayette will work with The University of North Texas and National Electrostatics Corporation to develop the first electric field-based High Energy Focused Ion Beam (HEFIB) nanoprobe to allow highly effective focusing of high energy heavy ions capable of studying and modifying materials at nanoscale dimensions.  This revolutionary step forward will provide unique research tools for scientists engaged in many important areas of materials research including biology, medicine, agriculture, semiconductors, geology, nanofabrication, nanomaterials, archaeology, art, forensic science, catalysis, and radioactive waste management.  The students participating in this project will work side by side with leading U.S. experts in the field from universities, national laboratories, and industry to develop a unique research tool while gaining invaluable experience with interdisciplinary fields of science and engineering in research with worldwide relevance.  The anticipated wide distribution of this technology will also open new opportunities for students and faculty across a wide range of educational and cultural backgrounds.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Scientists and engineers are continually looking for new ways to probe and study materials on the microscopic scale and high energy ion beams are one of the versatile technological tools available. An ion is the result of removing one or more electrons from an atom to make it electrically charged and therefore able to have its motion influenced with magnetic or electric fields. When high energy ions strike the surfaces of materials they interact with the atoms in the surface to allow the study of surface and bulk properties. Focusing these ion beams to small spots makes it possible to investigate the properties of materials on a microscopic scale. Patterns can also be "written" in a process called nanolithography. However, the magnetic focusing systems presently in use today have a major disadvantage because the focusing is effective only for low mass proton (hydrogen ion) beams.   In this project physicists and students have developed electric field-based focusing lenses to allow highly effective focusing of high energy heavy ion beams capable of studying and modifying materials at microscale dimensions. This unique research tool will be used in many important areas of materials research including biology, medicine, agriculture, semiconductors, geology, nanofabrication, nanomaterials, archaeology, art and forensic science. The students participating in this project worked side by side with leading U.S. experts in the field from several universities, two national laboratories, and industry thereby gaining invaluable experience in the practical application of physics principles coupled with engineering design to fabricate the lens system.    The lens system consists of two sets of cylindrical electrodes supported by an external frame structure.  The electrodes are constructed by depositing a thin conducting layer of gold on quartz rods of a specific diameter.  Each rod has two electrodes of a specific length separated by an uncoated section.  The complete "doublet" lens system consists of four of these electrode pairs positioned precisely and held in place by an outer frame support constructed of non-magnetic stainless steel.  Focusing is accomplished by applying precise high voltages to the electrodes to create electric fields between the electrodes with the special characteristics necessary to focus ion beams.  Since the ion beams focused by the lenses will be used as probes to study features in materials which are smaller than a single red blood cell, it was necessary to fabricate all components with high precision.   The electric fields used to focus the ions must have precise properties in order to properly focus the ion beams, therefore any small imperfections in the fabrication and assembly process can be detrimental to the focusing.  Some of these mechanical imperfections can be compensated by adjusting the voltages applied to the electrodes but it is advantageous to fabricate all components with the highest precision possible.  The photograph shows the completed doublet lens with the gold-coated electrode rods supported by the stainless steel outer frame.
