<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;The long-term goal of this research is to understand the regulation of gene expression, focusing specifically on the connections between gene transcription and RNA processing.  While a substantial base of knowledge has been accumulated about these processes individually, how they are coupled and how this coupling affects regulation has yet to be determined.  This project will explore the mechanistic interconnections between RNA processing events (splicing and cleavage-polyadenylation) and transcription elongation and termination in the immunoglobulin M (IgM or µ) gene.  The µ gene is an excellent model system in which to address these questions since its expression is regulated during B lymphocyte maturation at multiple steps, including RNA splicing, cleavage-polyadenylation and transcription termination.  An extensive collection of well-characterized modified µ genes, multiple reagents to analyze µ gene expression and microarray data from B cells before and after being stimulated to differentiate, are available in the PI's lab for this work.  The project will identify trans-regulators of µ alternative RNA processing based on microarray data and gene expression experiments, determine how RNA processing signals affect RNA polymerase II elongation, using a combination of nuclear run-on and high-resolution chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays and characterize changes in factors associated with elongating pol II over wild-type and modified µ genes in B cells and plasma cells by high-resolution ChIP experiments.  These studies will lead to a better understanding of the connections between transcription and RNA processing in the µ gene and will shed new light on these connections, which also regulate the expression of many other genes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this research include the involvement of graduate, undergraduate, and possibly high school students in the research, as well as their participation in local and national scientific meetings.  The majority of students associated with the PI's lab over the past eighteen years have been female.  An on-going collaboration with a former graduate student from this lab, who is currently an Associate Professor at Middle TN State University, will continue; the microarray data has been the basis for projects in undergraduate lab courses and individual student independent research projects.  The PI of this grant continues to support science in the broader community by participating as a science fair judge and visiting high school classrooms.  In addition, as a part-time Associate Vice President for Research at the University of Kentucky and member of the KY Academy of Sciences, the PI supports research in institutions across the state of KY.  The data and resources generated from this project will be shared widely with the scientific community through national and international meeting presentations and publications.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit  The long-term goal of this research is to understand the regulation of gene expression, focusing specifically on the connections between gene transcription and RNA processing.  While we have a good knowledge base about these processes individually, how they are coupled and how this coupling affects regulation is less clear.  The immunoglobulin (Ig) gene was the first cellular gene identified to produce two different proteins by way of alternative RNA processing.  The Ig proteins are either secreted or membrane-associated and their production in regulated during B lymphocyte development.  The alternative RNA processing reactions are either use of an intronic poly(A) signal (to encode the secreted protein) or splicing of this intron to two downstream exons (to encode the membrane-associated protein).  This gene, with two alternative mRNAs, regulated in two different cell types, has been a model system for studying RNA processing regulatory mechanisms for more than 25 years.  Because it is so well-studied and multiple modified versions of the IgM gene are available, more detailed questions can be addressed concerning coupling between cleavage/polyadenylation, splicing, transcription elongation and chromatin structure.  The current work addressed how changes to RNA processing signals (making them stronger or weaker) affected how cleavage-polyadenylation factors are recruited, using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by quantitative RT-PCR or deep sequencing.  We see changes in the data that correlate with the specific modifications in the gene.  In addition, we continued to mine microarray data, using a combination of our own data and two published datasets, to identify RNA processing factors that may regulate IgM mRNA processing.  Two candidates we studied in detail did not affect IgM expression and thus are not likely to be IgM regulators.  However, we established several new techniques in the lab that will make future work go more smoothly.  Broader Impacts  The broader impacts of this research include the involvement of post-doctoral (2), graduate (2) and undergraduate (2) students in the research.  Of these six students who have spent substantial time on the project, five were women and three were under-represented minorities.  In addition, multiple other graduate students have been able to work for brief times in the lab and the PI continued to be involved in mentoring and outreach activities such as judging science fairs and KY Academy of Sciences presentations and discussing NSF grant processes with junior faculty.  The data generated from this project has been presented as posters at three national meetings and four publications are in preparation.
