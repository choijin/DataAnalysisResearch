<AbstractNarration>Many languages of the world show grammatical agreement of some sort, where the grammatical features of a linguistic constituent are visible on another associated constituent. Recent psycholinguistic research has uncovered a number of semantic and syntactic factors that influence how we compute agreement during language production, though much less is known about how these factors interact during language comprehension. Understanding the processing of agreement is also of critical importance in the field of second language acquisition (SLA), as it is frequently observed that second language (L2) learners show considerable trouble with grammatical agreement, often despite many years of formal language instruction and immersion in an L2 environment. Many SLA scholars have proposed that L2 learners' problems with agreement are the result of processing problems, though little research has directly investigated this.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This dissertation research project investigates how subject-verb agreement is computed during real-time sentence comprehension by native speakers of English and by advanced second language learners of English from different linguistic backgrounds, specifically focusing on how a sentence's syntactic complexity influences agreement processing. The experiment uses grammatical agreement phenomena to additionally investigate recent hypotheses that nonnative grammatical contrasts are unacquirable by L2 learners and that L2 learners' language processing systems are radically different from native language systems.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;These questions will be addressed by recording event-related brain potentials (ERPs) while participants read sentences in English. ERPs have been shown to be highly sensitive to many facets of native language agreement processing, though no studies have investigated how syntactic complexity affects agreement computation. Additionally, ERPs have only recently been used to study L2 processing. There is thus a paucity of knowledge about the neural substrates underlying L2 agreement processing or how agreement, syntax, and L1 experience interact during L2 processing. The inclusion of modern psycholinguistic and neurophysiological techniques in studying L2 acquisition and processing will therefore complement the existing rich theoretical linguistic literature on L2 grammatical representation. The outcomes of this research will be of interest to cognitive neuroscientists interested in language and to theoretical linguists and psycholinguists studying agreement, its relationship to syntactic structure, and how agreement interacts with syntactic parsing systems. The results will additionally be of interest to theoretical and applied SLA researchers, having potentially significant implications for language acquisition theory and language pedagogy.</AbstractNarration>
