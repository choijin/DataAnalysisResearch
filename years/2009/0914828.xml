<AbstractNarration>CIF: Small: Primitives for Cryptography and Communications                       &lt;br/&gt;                                                                                    &lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Andrew Klapper, University of Kentucky                      &lt;br/&gt;                                                                                    &lt;br/&gt;Pseudorandom sequences and highly nonlinear functions are essential for &lt;br/&gt;digital communications and information technology.  They are used in &lt;br/&gt;stream cipher cryptosystems, spread spectrum systems in cellular &lt;br/&gt;telephones, GPS systems, satellite communications, error-correcting codes &lt;br/&gt;for digital communication, and large simulations for such applications as &lt;br/&gt;weather prediction, reactor design, oil well exploration, radiation cancer &lt;br/&gt;therapy, traffic flow, and pricing of  financial instruments.  In each case &lt;br/&gt;sequences or nonlinear functions with particular properties are needed.  &lt;br/&gt;Yet few general constructions of high quality pseudorandom sequences &lt;br/&gt;and highly nonlinear functions are known.  This research involves the &lt;br/&gt;development and analysis of a large supply of these tools for a variety of &lt;br/&gt;applications in  cryptography, coding theory, and simulations.                      &lt;br/&gt;                                                                                    &lt;br/&gt;In 1994 Klapper and Goresky proposed "feedback-with-carry shift registers"&lt;br/&gt;(FCSRs), pseudorandom generators which are easily implemented and which &lt;br/&gt;rapidly generate sequences with many desirable properties.  These generalize&lt;br/&gt;to algebraic feedback shift registers (AFSRs).  Many basic properties of FCSRs &lt;br/&gt;and AFSRs have been determined and they have been used in stream ciphers&lt;br/&gt;and quasi-Monte Carlo.   This project addresses issues concerning FCSR and &lt;br/&gt;AFSR sequences including (1) The development of new classes of highly &lt;br/&gt;nonlinear functions for use in block ciphers and stream ciphers, (2) the &lt;br/&gt;development of new tools for the analysis of nonlinear functions based on the &lt;br/&gt;"with-carry" paradigm, (3) the solution of the "register synthesis problem" &lt;br/&gt;for AFSRs, (4) the identification of new classes of AFSR sequences with good&lt;br/&gt;randomness properties, and (5) the extension of various ideas and methods in cryptography to vector valued functions and sequence generators.  &lt;br/&gt;                 &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
