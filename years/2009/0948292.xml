<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The study proposed is for a MARGINS postdoctoral researcher. The postdoctoral researcher will integrate downhole log data and the rock samples obtained from an Integrated Ocean Drilling Program drill hole. The long term aim of the work is to be able to identify sediment types using the log data when no core samples are available.  This information will be used to assess how sediments change as they are subducted, especially in the region where earthquakes occur.  Development of a method to use log data fully is important to the broad geosciences community. &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts include the career advancement and training of an early career female scientist&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
