<AbstractNarration>This project examines the relationship between individual personal credit, entrepreneurship and business formation. An important part of innovation policy targets small firms, but little is known about the links between individual finances and firm startups.  The contribution of this research is to create a new dataset that combines data on individual credit reports with new firm startups.  The research assesses the role of individual credit in influencing new firm start-up and longer term success. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The contribution of the research is to advance understanding of the role of credit access and personal credit scores on individual decisions regarding personal and small business finance. This research provides new insights into the importance of personal credit and human capital in understanding:  a) individual decisions at the personal level such as delinquency, personal default and bankruptcy b) the formation, success and failure of small businesses that are partially funded by personal finance with personal guarantees, c) the link between human capital accumulation and the availability of credit from banks and other sources, and d) the effect of job churn on individual bankruptcy and new firm formation. This project also deepens understanding about the ways in which an important policy lever, Small Business Administration (SBA) loans, affects the subsequent growth of small entrepreneurial firms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The results of the research should inform innovation policies regarding access to credit by small firms and new firm formation.  The research also creates an important new dataset for many researchers to study the links between access to credit and firm dynamics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this project, we examine how consumer credit access impacts job flows, earnings, and entrepreneurship? To answer these questions, we build the first administrative dataset to link individual employment and entrepreneur tax records from Census data to individual TransUnion credit reports.  At the core of this work is building and assessing new links between credit, entrepreneurship and work patterns databases at the Census Bureau.  We have worker credit histories from TransUnion which have been linked to the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) and the Survey of Business Owners (SBO), using Protected Identification Keys (PIKs).  We empirically and theoretically examine how consumer credit access affects displaced workers.  In "How Credit Constraints Impact Job Finding Rates, Sorting &amp; Aggregate Output?", we show that an increase in credit limits worth 10% of prior annual earnings allows individuals to take .15 to 3 weeks longer to find a job. Conditional on finding a job, they earn more and work at more productive firms. We develop a labor sorting model with credit to provide structural estimates of the impact of credit on employment outcomes, which we find are similar to our empirical estimates.  We use the model to understand the impact of consumer credit on the macroeconomy. We find that if credit limits tighten during a downturn, employment recovers quicker, but output and productivity remain depressed. This is because when limits tighten, low-asset, low-productivity job losers cannot self-insure. Therefore, they search less thoroughly and take more accessible jobs at less productive firms.    Our results are consistent with individuals using personal credit to fund longer unemployment spells so that they can search and find better job matches.  These results show that independent of realized borrowing, the potential to borrow affects search decisions regardless if credit lines are actually drawn down.   To our knowledge, we are the first to measure the elasticity of non-employment durations and the elasticity of earnings replacement rates with respect to consumer credit access.  In "How Does Consumer Credit Access Impact Entrepreneurial Firm Employment?," we examine entrepreneurship and credit exploiting the discrete increase in consumer credit access following bankruptcy flag removal. Our approach is to compare individuals whose bankruptcy flags are  removed during our sample period to individuals whose bankruptcy flags are not removed.

These results are consistent with credit checks having adverse effects on earnings and employment opp...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
