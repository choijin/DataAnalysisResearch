<AbstractNarration>The proposal focuses on developing statistical methodology, theory and methods of adaptive nonparametric curve estimation in the presence of nuisance functions. It is motivated by biological and medical applications. The investigator studies four main classes of considered problems. Each is classified by how an estimator can match the performance of an oracle knowing underlying nuisance functions. They are: (a) Estimator can match oracle. An example is a regression problem with a smooth design density being nuisance function. (b) Estimator can match oracle if complementary observations are available. Examples are deconvolution and regression with measurement errors in predictors where complementary observations are needed to estimate distribution of measurement error. (c) Estimator cannot match oracle. An example is estimation of the density of regression error when a nuisance regression function is not sufficiently smooth. (d) A mixture of the above-formulated settings. It is proposed to develop a general theory of adaptive estimation for the aforementioned classes of statistical problems with particular applications to:  missing, stratified and censored data, hidden components, mixed multivariate models involving continuous and nominal or ordinal categorical variables, and time series. Theoretical results are tested and applied to the analysis of ChIP-on-chip microarrays and ultra-fast fMRI.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary focus of the research is to create adaptive statistical procedures which can work in the presence of nuisance functions. This research is motivated by and tested on well-understood applications in the statistical analysis of: (i) ChIP-on-chip microarrays used to find regulatory protein binding sites in a bacterial genome. Interactions between protein and DNA are fundamental to life. They facilitate and mediate gene expression, DNA replication and repair. The proposed statistical analysis of ChIP-on-chip microarrays points on exact location of protein-DNA binding sites. Because the statistical analysis does not require measuring of nuisance functions, it makes microarray experiments cheaper, faster and more accurate. (ii) Ultra-fast functional magnet resonance images, which help in understanding aging and brain diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Diseases. Ultra-fast fMRI is an exciting new technology for studying brain functions with the temporal resolution of 50 milliseconds. This resolution sheds light on both neurons and physiological activities in the brain. Proposed statistical analysis, which is robust to nuisance functions, can denoise emodynamic responses, study cognitive functions like memory, speech and emotion, and create a map of physiological activities of the human brain.</AbstractNarration>

It has been  motivated by recent biological, medical, actuarial and engineering  applications which are complicated by the presence of nuisance functions that do not allow statisticians to use traditional methods of statistical inference.  The main scientific intellectual challenge  was in understanding how nuisance functions affect the statistical inference. Three classes of problems have been formulated and then solved.

(2) Estimator can match an oracle only if complementary observations are available; in this case adaptive sequential procedures are developed. (3)  It is impossible to match an oracle;  in this case remedial procedures are suggested.  In particular, new theoretical results have been obtained for the case of missing and modified, by censoring and truncation, data.    Theoretical results have been used in collaborative applications with the UT Southwestern Medical School, the Department of Molecular and Cell Biology at the UTDallas, the Moores Cancer Center at UCSD, and the insurance company Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Texas. The applied results of the project are as follows. Wavelet denoising and signal decomposition is developed for the super-frequent functional magnet resonance imaging (fMRI). This is an exciting new technology for studying brain functions ranging from simple visual and auditory   sensations  to cognitive functions like memory, speech and emotion. The aim of the fMRI  is to observe  hemodynamic responses associated with neuronal activity. These responses are relatively weak with respect to the noise induced by the MRI.   This necessitates to develop innovative statistical methods of denoising.  Developed statistical methods allow physicians to visualize denoised hemodynamic responses. Furthermore, the denoising is so accurate  that physicians can also visualize respiratory and cardiac signals at voxel level.  This allows bioengineers  and physicians to model neuronal activities and better  understand the process of  aging and diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Developed methods of nonparametric estimation of cross-correlation functions for neuron signals have been used to understand the neuron  plasticity,  which sheds light on the possibility of training different parts of the human brain. Discovered plasticity in neuron  pathways between left and  right human brain hemispheres sheds a new light on possible treatments of the  stroke via training healthy brain tissues. New methods of survival analysis of left-truncated and right-censored data have been used to understand the effect of a diet on survival of women after    breast cancer surgery.  Another interesting application is the analysis of actuarial data with missing data where unbiased procedures have been suggested and successfully tested.   Obtained results have been published in peer reviewed journals and presented at conferences and symposiums, statistical software is developed and freely available,  and four graduate students, who  participated in the research, successfully defended their PhD theses.
