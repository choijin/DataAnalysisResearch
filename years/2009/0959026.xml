<AbstractNarration>This two-year project is communicating the results of scientific discoveries produced by an on-going LTER (Long-term Ecological Research) project devoted to understanding the Everglades ecosystem. Specifically, Dr. Heithaus is capitalizing on the discoveries funded through 0620409 (Coastal Oligotrophic Ecosystems Research) about the role of large-bodied, top predators in the Everglades, including bull sharks (Carcharhinus leucas) and American alligators (Alligator mississippiensis). The STEM content of this project is biology, in particular ecology, the environment, and conservation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These results are being communicated via: (1) multimedia exhibit presentations at  multiple museums and nature centers in southern Florida, primarily the Museum of Discovery and Science (MODS), located in Ft. Lauderdale near the Everglades and (2) online dissemination of mini-documentaries and other educational components at social media websites and the LTER web site. The target audience for the museum exhibit components includes learners from diverse cultural backgrounds, such as urban family groups reflecting the demographics of southern Florida. This project will also develop a documentary about Everglades ecology that is planned for dissemination on a cable TV channel devoted to natural history. In order to link with formal education, related educational deliverables are being produced for use in science classroom settings (grades 4 through 12) that are aligned with the state science standards and benchmarks. Formative assessment conducted by museum staff and university students will evaluate learning outcomes as they relate to STEM content learning goals.  After the two-year funding period, the science learning opportunities produced from the current Communicating Research to Public Audiences (CRPA) project will be sustained as the exhibit travels to other venues and as web deliverables are accessed on-line.</AbstractNarration>

In this project, we extended our study of the ecological role of top predators in the coastal Everglades as part of the Florida Coastal Everglades Long Term Ecological Research Project (FCE LTER; DEB-9910514).

Our growing understanding of the behavior and roles of top predators will help to predict the consequences of human-driven changes to the system and lead to more effective management in addition to enhancing our understanding of ecological systems in general.   Broader Impacts   We used the NSF-funded research of the FCE LTER, especially that focused on predators, to enhance knowledge about science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) and appreciation for scientific research across a broad range of age groups and geographic locations. We produced  1) Two 26-minute documentaries.   Coastal Carnivores (http://video.wpbt2.org/video/2252471153/) - a part of the PBS Series Changing Seas - aired on PBS2 in Miami as well as on 90% of all PBS stations nationwide and in 34 countries.

Science Matters depicted the adventure of 14 elementary school teachers from Missouri who traveled to the Everglades to join research projects studying sharks and explored the oceans and marshes of South Florida.  It highlighted how the flow of water connects distant ecosystems as well as people's role in environmental change both through habitat alterations and invasive species.

It also discusses how environmental change will affect the ecosystem and inspires the young public about careers in science.  3) An interactive animal movement visualization tool that allows the public to view the movements of all individual alligators, bull sharks, snook, and gar that have been tagged as part of the FCE LTER relative to the environmental variables that are being measured by FCE researchers and the USGS (e.g. salinity, precipitation, water temperature, dissolved oxygen, etc) as a movie animation. This tool is part of a kiosk that includes video vignettes that is deployed  online at tracking.fiu.edu and at the EcoDiscovery Center at MODS.
