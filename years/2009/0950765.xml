<AbstractNarration>Understanding evolution is critical to understanding basic biology and is equally important for applied aspects of science, including organismal interactions with the environment.  This project probes evolutionary changes in regulatory genes, called Hox genes, and asks how they have impacted animal development.  The Hox genes are patterning genes that encode transcription factors controlling embryonic development, which are remarkably conserved throughout the animal kingdom.  This finding was initially surprising because Hox genes were first identified in fruit flies, where mutations result in bizarre phenotypes (called homeotic transformations) in which one body part is transformed to a different body part.  However, cloning of these genes revealed that they are present in all animals, including humans.  In addition, studies have shown that genes from mammals can substitute for those of the fly and recapitulate functions of the fly homologs when expressed in the fly, underscoring the high degree of relatedness of these genes and gene products among different organisms.  How then does each animal achieve its own specific body form?  This project addresses the question by tracking the evolutionary changes in one Hox gene, fushi tarazu (ftz).  The roles of ftz in development have been shown to change during evolution due to changes in both its protein coding sequence and its expression pattern.  Studies undertaken in this project will identify the points in evolutionary history at which these changes occurred and using living animals that represent different branches of an evolutionary tree, will determine how they impacted body patterning.  In addition, this award will contribute to the training of three Ph.D. students and at least 3 undergraduate students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit:  How is diversity generated in nature? While we are far from a final answer to this broad question, it is clear that changes in gene function direct changes in the embryonic development of organisms that lead to changes in body morphology, physiology and behavior.  Our project has probed the underlying basis for changes in gene function.  We have examined one gene in particular that has changed dramatically during the radiation of insects, fushi tarazu (ftz). This gene began its life as a homeotic, Hox gene, whose role was to specific the identity of a specific body region.  This role is retained in a number of extant arthropods but has been lost in insects, including the model insect Drosophila melanogaster.  Our studies have established systems for studying the function of this gene across insect phylogeny.  We have found that ftz expression and function varies extensively among extant insect taxa and that it gained a new function in promoting the formation of body segments in lineages leading to Drosophila.   The change in ftz function is explained by a change in protein partners for Ftz due to changes in specific amino acids that mediate protein-protein interactions.  This work provides evidence for unexpected variation in the function of key regulatory genes during evolution and suggests that such variation is extensive in nature.     Broader Impacts:  This work has trained undergraduate and graduate students in laboratory procedures, experimental design and critical thinking.  It has also supported outreach efforts to a local majority minority middle school, where the PI interacted with the Entomology Club and taught classes to 7th graders on Genetics.  Further outreach efforts to the public included participation in the annual Maryland Day exhibit &ndash; An Insect Petting Zoo &ndash; and other interactions with individuals about insect pests.
