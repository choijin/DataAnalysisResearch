<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit.  For the past two decades studies from around the world in a wide variety of geological environments in both continental and marine settings have revealed the extent and variety of subsurface microbial ecosystems.  From polar permafrost and ice sheets to equatorial marine sediments, from permeable aquifers ~200 meters deep to fractured rock 4 km deep, from deep vadose zones to oil reservoirs, diverse assemblages of bacteria and archaea, including many novel species, have been discovered.  As depth and temperature increase in both the continental and oceanic crust, the effects of changing surface climate and photospheric processes on the subsurface microbial ecosystem diminish while Fisher-Tropsch-like and radiolytic processes, which enrich the crust with a mixture of organic and inorganic nutrients, become increasingly important.  Regardless of the origin of the organic carbon, the rules that govern its biodegradation to CO2 and CH4 should be similar to those for petroleum reservoirs.  The goals of this project are to determine those rules, determine the rates and limits of the biodegradation of organic matter by subsurface microbial ecosystems, and determine who is responsible. To accomplish these goals, investigators will utilize the readily accessible boreholes present in the mines of the Witwatersrand Basin, South Africa, which range in depth from 0.8 to 3.8 km, to examine the extent of and the inter-species interactions involved in biodegradation of organic photosynthate in shallow depths and abiogenic hydrocarbons at great depth.  By employing a combination of 1) GCMS, HPLC, and NMR characterization of the DOC, 2) 13C analyses of DOC, DIC, hydrocarbons, lipids, and organic acids, 3) H isotope analyses of hydrocarbons, 4) 14C analyses of CH4, DIC, DOC, and lipids, and 5) stable isotope probes (SIP) of the 16S rRNA, we will delineate the relative importance of 1) chemoautotrophically produced organic acids, 2) abiogenically produced hydrocarbons, 3) thermogenically produced organic acids and 4) dissolved organic matter (DOC) from the surface photosphere, to the subsurface microbial community structure and its trophic interactions during carbon metabolism.  These analyses will be performed on planktonic microbial communities collected from fracture water ranging in age from thousands of years to tens of millions of years.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts. The program of study will engage undergraduates and graduates in hands-on interdisciplinary research where they will integrate isotope geochemistry and organic geochemical analyses with genetic analyses.  Students from North America and South Africa will participate in the field and laboratory research as part of an ongoing collaboration with South African scientists.  The RNA-SIP incubation experiments will be accompanied by isolation experiments that will further enlarge the subsurface culture collection and genetic database at the Univ. of Free State (UFS) and enhance their bioremediation and biotechnology efforts.  The project will begin to integrate the genetic, taxonomic and functional diversity with respect to carbon metabolism. Investigators will work to assemble a web-based subsurface microbial database with a gallery of SEM/TEM images of subsurface microorganisms that can be downloaded for press releases; and as part of the gallery we will initiate a "Where in the world does this organism occur?" describing where related strains or sequences have been found.  The web site will provide the beginnings of a microbial biogeographical database for the deep subsurface.  When permitted by the mining companies videos of the sampling expeditions will be posted on the web site.  The project will also provide fundamental scientific underpinnings for optimal exploitation of untapped natural gas reservoirs in the Witwatersrand Basin and for the development of CO2 sequestration projects in South Africa by private firms</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The deep subsurface biosphere comprises a substantial fraction of the Earth?s biomass, with many inhabitant microbes actively participating in cycling of carbon and other biologically relevant elements.  Despite their importance, these subsurface ecosystems remain poorly understood, in part due to the cost of drilling.  Deep mines provide a cost-effective alternative to drilling from the surface, an approach we?ve been utilizing in South Africa, where mines extend to 3.8 km or more.  The mines drill boreholes that intersect fractures filled with ancient groundwater, which we analyze geochemically and microbiologically.  Our previous research revealed diverse microbes living in darkness without exposure to photosynthetically generated O2.  In the deepest sites, the microbes function without access to photosynthetically generated organic carbon, as well; instead, they?re fueled by hydrogen (H2) generated from rock-water reactions.  Our previous findings raised two questions that formed the basis for our most recent project: 1) Who are the  "living" members of the microbial community that are actively turning over the carbon and producing cellular matter? and 2) What are the carbon sources for the subsurface biomass?  We hypothesized that carbon sources include: 1) organic acids biologically produced from dissolved inorganic carbon (acetogenesis), 2) hydrocarbons abiotically produced by Fischer-Tropsch-like processes, 3) Archean, thermogenically produced organic acids and 4) dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from the surface.  We addressed these questions and hypotheses by 1) capturing the biomass and determining its stable and radioactive carbon isotope signatures; 2) comparing the biomass isotopic composition to that of the dissolved organic compounds, dissolved inorganic carbon, and gaseous carbon species; and by 3) determining the metabolic pathways of active microorganisms by sequencing their RNA. Sixty-two field trips were made to 14 gold, diamond, and platinum mines during 2011-2013 (Figs. 1 and 2). The majority of analyses were performed in our labs in the United States and in those of our Canadian collaborators.     Isotopic analyses of biomass and dissolved carbon showed that in the shallower sites (1-1.3 km), the biomass was derived from microbially generated methane (CH4).  DNA and RNA sequence analyses corroborate simultaneous active biological production and consumption of CH4.  At greater depth (3.1 km), the biomass is primarily derived from inorganic carbon; molecular biology results also showed active biological CO2 fixation fueled by H2.  Methane-generating microbes appear to be the dominant primary producers in the deep groundwater, even though they comprise only ~1% of the total biomass.  Metagenomic sequence data revealed a common core of genes encoding nitrogen cycling, including nitrogen fixation and denitrification (Fig. 3). DNA sequencing further showed a surprising commonality in compositions among geographically separated microbial communities (Fig. 4).  The ubiquitous but as yet uncultivated sulfate reducer Candidatus Desulforudis audaxviator was among the core group of microbes.  Single-cell genomic analyses detected viral infection of D. audaxviator and other microbes.  Preliminary results of ongoing DOC analyses suggest that the DOC in the Witwatersrand Basin is dominated by heterocyclic compounds containing O, N and S which is similar in composition to the radiolytically altered carbon-rich seams.  Overall results indicate surprisingly similar microbial functions among widely separated sites and microbial ecosystems that are powered by rock-water generated energy sources and are not sustained by photosynthetically derived organic C.  These rock-water-reaction-dominated ecosystems may be widespread in continental subsurface ecosystems and they may be important in global carbon cycling.  They may also serve as terrestrial analogs for possible subsurface life on other planetary bodies.   This collaborative project engaged 9 undergrads at New Mexico Tech and Princeton, 3 grad students at New Mexico Tech, Princeton, and McMaster University, and one postdoctoral scientist at Princeton; all of these are continuing in their scientific careers.  The project led to other funding from NSF to test a new krypton isotope-based method for determining the age of groundwater; from the New Mexico Space Grant Consortium for high-throughput DNA sequencing; from the Department of Energy?s Joint Genome Institute for genomic sequencing of single cells; and from the Sloan Foundation?s Deep Carbon Observatory for post-doctoral scientists working on the project in South Africa, the United Kingdom, and Canada, and for more DNA sequencing.  Our field work in South Africa over the years has fostered a collaboration with the University of the Free State, where many of their scientists and students have now dedicated considerable time and resources to the study of deep life.  Scientists from several other institutions have made significant contributions at no cost to the project, e.g., at the Environmental Molecular Sciences Lab in Washington State for solid-state NMR characterization of DOC, from ExxonMobil for mass spectrometry of DOC, and from the University of Delaware for quantification of viruses.  The network of subsurface scientists nurtured by this project is now leading to other opportunities for sampling the deep biosphere, including via the International Continental Scientific Drilling Program.
