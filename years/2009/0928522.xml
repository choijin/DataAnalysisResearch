<AbstractNarration>Lead Institution: Boise State University.  &lt;br/&gt;Partner Institutions: Caldwell School District, Boise School District, Emmett School District, Meridian Joint School District, Idaho State Department of Education, University of Idaho, Idaho State University, Micron Foundation, Idaho National Laboratory, and Discovery Center of Idaho.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Across the nation, there is concern about the quality and quantity of K-12 education in science, technology, engineering and math. Idaho is no exception, where a primary concern is the lack of highly qualified STEM education teachers. Teachers' abilities influence students' knowledge and subsequently affect students' achievement and career choices. School districts, parents, corporations, legislators, colleges, universities, and other stakeholders are promoting efforts to address this situation, yet these efforts are often isolated and disparate, and therefore, fragmented in their impact. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This MSP-Start grant, led by faculty at Boise State University, brings together a wide range of partners to create a shared vision and develop common goals for STEM education throughout Idaho. Using this shared vision as a guide, the team is conducting a needs analysis supported by data collection and reviews of the STEM education literature. In developing a shared strategic plan, the team will focus on assuring all students access to challenging courses and curricula, increasing teacher quality, quantity and diversity of math and science teachers, and integrating the new plan with promising practices in the partner institutions. The goal of the project is the development of an MSP-Target or Institute Partnership proposal. The type and focus of the proposal will depend on the outcome of the data collection, the shared vision, and the strategic plan informed by the data analysis and planning process with all partners.</AbstractNarration>
