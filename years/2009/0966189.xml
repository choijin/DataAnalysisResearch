<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to increase the number of highly qualified and capable students who are able to complete degrees in STEM majors by providing approximately 20 need-based scholarships at Bowling Green State University, Owens Community College, and Terra Community College.  A variety of student support programs are designed, such as a 5-week summer bridge for entering students to prepare them for the rigors of college science and math courses; a tiered system of mentoring by peers and faculty; learning communities with monthly events that draw students and faculty together by merging academics and social networking; undergraduate research; and support and promotion of graduate and professional studies after completion of a baccalaureate degree.  This project increases the graduation rate in mathematics and science of economically disadvantaged students and of under-represented women and ethnic minority students.</AbstractNarration>
