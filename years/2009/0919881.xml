<AbstractNarration>The award will support trainee-related activities at two annual meetings of the Society for Behavioral Neuroendocrinology (SBN). The annual conference brings together a diverse group of scientists studying the integration of genetic, cellular and molecular concepts into functional frameworks that improve our understanding of behavior.  This grant supports significant initiatives to foster participation by undergraduate, graduate students, and post-doctoral fellows at society meetings.  Funds will support the following:  (1) Young Investigators Symposium. A selected group of graduate students and/or post-docs including substantial numbers of women present talks in a dedicated symposium.  This format recognizes the accomplishments of trainees, facilitates their movement into more advanced positions, and motivates younger trainees. (2)  Career Development Workshops.  Workshops educate trainees on important career development topics and retain trainees in the sciences.  (3)  Travel Awards.  Funding for travel to meetings is provided for the best trainees.  This allows trainees to present their work in a supportive environment and gain exposure to the breadth and depth of the field.  (4)  Mentor-Mentee Lunches. Based on the professional and personal needs of the trainee, trainees will be matched with a senior Mentor. The pair will establish a long-term mentoring relationship. Trainees thus acquire a mentor outside of their advisor and local environment that will give them new insights into the research enterprise, how to balance life and work, and consult on career choices and options. (5)  Trainee Poster Competition.  Posters presented by undergraduates, graduate students, and post-doctoral fellows are judged, based on the scientific merit of the research, the effectiveness of the presentation and the trainee role in the research.  The competition provides an opportunity to encourage and reward success at each level.  Funding for trainee events at the SBN meeting will play a key role in the attraction and retention of the brightest and best-trained interdisciplinary scientists.</AbstractNarration>
