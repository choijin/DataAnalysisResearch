<AbstractNarration>0949962&lt;br/&gt;Ito&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This collaborative grant between the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities and Duluth (EAR-0949285) campuses supports renewed support of operations and laboratory improvements at LacCore, a national multi-user lacustrine core archival and analysis facility.  LacCore was previously supported under EAR-0652769.  The LacCore Facility supports the limnological community for studies that contribute to our understanding of past climates, ecological systems, and biogeochemical dynamics on the continents though detailed sedimentological analysis and archival services for lacustrine cores.  LacCore operates open laboratories to allow community access to specialized field and laboratory equipment and staff expertise for Initial Core Description (ICD) methods including: core splitting; non-destructive multi-sensor core logging; palynological preparation; grain size analysis; carbon coulometry; phase identification via x-ray diffraction; biogenic silica analysis; preparation of samples for subsequent stable isotopic analysis; digital core photography, and optical petrography/smear slide analysis.  LacCore also provides refrigerated and frozen core storage and archival services and field coring equipment and curatorial materials (D-tubes) support for lake coring expeditions.   LacCore staff are also responsible for curation of lake core ICD metadata and the routine transmission of all data to NOAA?s National Geophysical Data Center.   The Large Lake Observatory at Duluth will now be a node of LacCore and will provide x-ray fluorescence (XRF) core scanning services to the broader paleorecords research community for rapid down core elemental analysis.  LacCore will institute a user fee schedule beginning in 2011.  The Facility will continue as a training ground for hundreds of researchers, particularly graduate students, in coring and core analysis techniques.  LacCore staff are engaged in education and outreach including an ongoing collaborative project aimed at study of the paleoenvironments of wild rice lakes in northern Minnesota with tribal college students and teachers from the Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa and Fond du Lac Tribal and Community College. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The LacCore Facility, funded by this award for the years 2010-2016, is a unique facility globally for support of scientific research involving the study of drill core samples. LacCore maintains expensive and specialized field equipment, lab instrumentation, software applications for working with data, and a sample and data repository, all of which are available for use by scientists and their students in the US and around the globe. By providing these common services for the scientific community, all research projects, regardless of size or topic, can use the best methods for collecting, analyzing, and curating their core samples and data at the lowest possible cost.  During the years funded by this award, LacCore made tremendous changes to diversify its services for support of additional scientific disciplines and a greater throughput capacity, and witnessed continually increasing enthusiasm for its services. Renowned for its innovative approaches and commitment to the scientific community, LacCore is viewed as a model for the establishment and operations of similar facilities worldwide.  In the years funded by this award, a minimum of:  1,772 unique individuals from 349 institutions worldwide visited LacCore for 7,796 total visits. 4,382 unique individuals from 1,000 institutions received LacCore support through more than 65,451 total contacts. 686 graduate students, 910 undergraduate students, and 116 primary/secondary students received training and mentorship in geoscience research. 812 scientific projects were supported. 442 peer-reviewed research articles were published by projects receiving LacCore support. 91 projects were supported in the field, through 1,594 staff-days of fieldwork. 166 projects rented field equipment. 400 requests for samples from the repository were filled. 226 orders for field and lab supplies were filled. 182 orders for specialized field equipment were filled.  6,970 sites fill the repository core sample collection.  Hundreds to thousands of scientists worldwide use the software applications developed at the LacCore facility.   These numbers regarding visitors and contacts are larger, and together with the other numbers represent a greater range of activity, than the published statistics of any similar facility worldwide.
