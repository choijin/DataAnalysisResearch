<AbstractNarration>This research integrates the theoretical perspectives of personality trait psychologists and cultural psychologists to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship between culture and personality, as well as the impact of personality on behavior and mental health in different cultures.  Cross-cultural research on personality processes can identify cultural universals and differences, and clarify the role of socio-cultural factors in personality, behavior, and psychological well-being. In six studies, across nine countries including the United States, Australia, Norway, Mexico, Venezuela, Philippines, Malaysia, China, and Japan, the investigators will address fundamental questions regarding personality and mental health across cultures, including the following: Do personality traits predict important behaviors and mental health equally well in different cultures? Do people in different cultures vary in the consistency or stability of their personality characteristics across different situational contexts? Is such consistency more important for mental health in some cultures than others? Are there universal psychological needs that account for personality consistency and well-being in all cultures? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the significance of the research for scientific theory derives in part, from the importance of integrating the personality trait and cultural psychology perspectives, the broader impacts of this work are notable. Indeed, the involvement of collaborators from countries that are underrepresented in the scientific literature will contribute to a broadening of the data base of scientific psychology, and this will ultimately have important implications for mental health interventions and treatment outcomes in each of the societies.     &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

In a series of studies in eight countries (United States, Australia, Mexico, Venezuela, Philippines, Malaysia, China, and Japan), the researchers report significant findings regarding cultural universals and differences in the impact of personality traits on daily behavior, mood, and overall well-being. These studies were important to conduct because some cultural psychologists have suggested that personality traits such as extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, emotional stability, and openness to experience may be less important determinants of behavior and mental health in collectivistic or group-centered cultures than in individualistic cultures such as the United States. Overall, the results indicated that personality traits play a similar role in a range of different cultures. For example, people in each culture showed moderate accuracy and agreement in their ratings of othersÆ personality characteristics, suggesting that personality traits are real and observable attributes of individuals. Personality traits also predicted daily behaviors and moods to a similar extent in each culture. At the same time, people in all cultures showed considerable variability in their personality-related behavior across different social roles or daily situations and this variability was predicted to some extent by how much various needs were satisfied in the respective situations. In general, people in all cultures exhibit reliable patterns of differences in their trait-related behaviors across various social roles.  There is also some tendency for people who exhibit greater variability in their trait-related behavior across situations to report less emotional stability and more negative moods. In all cultures studied, an important determinant of well-being was the extent to which important needs were perceived as satisfied in various interpersonal roles. In addition, individuals who view their own personality traits more positively (relative to how they view othersÆ traits or how they are viewed by others) tended to report better psychological adjustment, but were not necessarily viewed as better adjusted by others.             Although greater similarities than differences were observed across cultures, some cultural differences were also noted. For example, in individualistic cultures, as compared to collectivistic cultures, friends and family members of target individuals showed greater agreement in their evaluations of the target individualsÆ personality traits. This suggests that peopleÆs behavior with different friends and family members may vary more in collectivistic cultures, where behavior is expected to be more adaptive to social roles or contexts. Consistent with this finding, people in collectivistic cultures, as compared to those in individualistic cultures, also tended to believe that behavior is more dependent on the situation. Having a consistent and stable view of oneÆs traits (i.e., self-concept) across various social roles was more strongly associated with some aspects of psychological well-being in individualistic cultures than in collectivistic cultures.  Finally, participants in Asian cultures reported lower average need satisfaction and well-being than participants in Western cultures, and these differences were accounted for, in part, by cultural differences in self-concepts and cognitive styles.             The studies were important in advancing scientific theory regarding personality processes in different cultures. One overarching goal of the project was to better integrate...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
