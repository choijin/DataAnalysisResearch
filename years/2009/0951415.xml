<AbstractNarration>This project investigates the relationships between fragile high self-esteem, self-doubt, and self- and other-focused destructive behavior. Self-esteem has been a topic of substantial interest to researchers and the public alike because of high self-esteem's presumed importance for psychological well-being. Recent evidence, however, suggests that high self-esteem comprises subtypes, and that one subtype in particular, fragile high self-esteem, may be associated with undesirable qualities that have important societal implications, such as aggression in the face of perceived threat.   This research includes 5 studies which use psychophysiological measures to offer new insight into the experience of people with fragile high-self esteem.  The proposed research can advance existing knowledge in a number of major ways. For example, although multiple facets of fragile high self-esteem have been linked theoretically, a core element -- easily activated self-doubt -- has yet to be empirically demonstrated.  In this work, it will be tested as a core element. In addition, a range of seemingly disparate behaviors that are destructive to the self and others will also be investigated. The distinct bodies of evidence associated with the destructive behaviors will be bridged by testing a common link to easily activated self-doubt among people with fragile high self-esteem&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research seeks to illuminate why people with fragile high self-esteem engage in destructive behavior and as such it has several potential benefits for society.  First, substantial resources are regularly invested in trying to raise people's self-esteem. Understanding fragile high self-esteem will help to ensure that such well-intended efforts do not inadvertently create it. Second, this research can suggest methods to prevent people from engaging in costly destructive behavior. The behaviors under investigation include aggression and ethnic discrimination, both of which contribute to important social problems. Given these benefits, results of the proposed research should generate broad interest in both the field of psychology and the general public.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Self-esteem&mdash;which refers to how positively or negatively people evaluate themselves&mdash;is a familiar concept even outside the field of psychology. For example, the self-help section of any bookstore is full of books that try to help readers feel better about themselves; in other words, to raise their self-esteem. It seems intuitive that high self-esteem should be &ldquo;good,&rdquo; an important part of mental health and well-being, and thus more desirable than low self-esteem. Despite the appeal of this common-sense idea, however, research suggests that the story of self-esteem is not so simple. Specifically, not all high self-esteem is alike. Secure high self-esteem has been associated with positive aspects of high self-esteem, but fragile high self-esteem has been associated with undesirable qualities like defensiveness (for example, blaming another person for one&rsquo;s own failure). This research project sought to better understand fragile high self-esteem by testing the motivations that explain why people with fragile high self-esteem act this way, the circumstances that lead them to do so, and the destructive nature of their responses. These efforts have resulted in a number of advances for the field of psychology, including the following three major contributions.</p> <p>First, this research used individuals&rsquo; bodily responses to assess their psychological experience as it occurred, which allowed access to this experience without relying on individuals&rsquo; conscious attention. This methodology provides insight into people&rsquo;s experience of self-doubt in particular, which may be at the core of fragile high self-esteem. Results revealed that relative to other individuals, those with fragile high self-esteem exhibited bodily responses consistent with greater self-doubt only when a set of conditions was met. When taking an important intelligence test, this self-doubt emerged when the test was described as revealing exceptionally high ability, but not when it was described as revealing whether or not someone had very low ability. Self-doubt only emerged if this test was also highly difficult, so that failure seemed likely, but not when an easier test made success seem possible. These findings suggest that for people with fragile high self-esteem, the prospect of failure activates self-doubt specifically during situations that risk demonstrating a lack of exceptionally high ability. Activated self-doubt may in turn motivate destructive behavior.&nbsp;</p> <p>Second, the relationship between self-esteem and envy was investigated. There are two types of envy: malicious envy, characterized by the desire to bring an envy target down, and benign envy, characterized by the desire to bring oneself up to the level of an envy target. Results revealed that when exposed to another person&rsquo;s impressive success, people with fragile high self-esteem exhibited responses consistent with malicious envy, whereas participants with secure high self-esteem exhibited responses consistent with benign envy. These findings suggest that people with fragile high self-esteem are especially likely to experience malicious envy, which has destructive implications. In contrast, people with secure self-esteem still experience a form of envy, but it is especially likely to be benign envy, which actually promotes self-improvement rather than other-directed destructive responses.</p> <p>Third, the relationship between self-esteem and aggression was tested. People with fragile high self-esteem responded more aggressively than others only after their own failure at a previous task and only when the aggressive act was certain rather than uncertain to cause harm.
