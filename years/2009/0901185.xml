<AbstractNarration>The proposal consists of several interrelated parts. The first part is to study the rings of semi-invariants of quivers and of quivers with relations. &lt;br/&gt;The investigator proposes to continue  study the walls of cones of weights of rings of semi-invariants of quivers and multiplicities of weight spaces for these rings. In particular case this includes the cones defined by Klyachko inequalities. For the semi-invariants of quivers with relations the main problem is to characterize the finite type and tame quivers with relations in terms of semi-invariants. Another aspect is the connection of quiver representations and cluster algebras. The principal investigator plans to study quivers with potential and the mutations of related Jacobian algebras. He also plans to study the connection of certain sphere triangulations and the Igusa-Orr theory of pictures related to nilpotent groups. The second part is devoted to studying defining ideals of equivariant varieties. Several types of varieties are proposed: orbit closures for representations with finitely many orbits, tangential and secant varieties of orbits of highest weight vectors, and orbit closures for Dynkin quivers corresponding to Schubert varieties in the Grassmannian. The third part involves problems related to Boij-Soderberg conjectures for Betti tables of graded modules.  The principal investigator proposes to study cohomology tables of vector bundles on homogeneous spaces and &lt;br/&gt;equivariant refinements of Boij-Soderberg conjectures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is related to several branches of mathematics: representations of quivers and commutative algebra. A representation of a quiver is a way to associate vector space data to the vertices of some oriented graph. The edges &lt;br/&gt;can be viewed as relations between these data.  Abstract algebra allows to study such objects systematically and the results of research might lead to better algorithms dealing with linear algebra problems.  Commutative algebra studies polynomial functions of geometric objects. The second part of the proposal  is devoted to studying polynomial equations defining objects characterized geometrically such as rank conditions on matrices.  Various conditions of this type on tensors are of interest for engineers and &lt;br/&gt;computer scientists. The third part of the proposal studies Betti tables: certain family of numerical invariants associated to modules over a polynomial ring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The PI proposed to work on representations of quivers with relations, syzygies of varieties with symmetries and on problems related to free resolutions (Boij-Soderbergh theory).  In the part of project regarding quivers with relations, the PI worked with Derksen and Zelevinsky on quivers with potential and their applications to the theory of cluster algebras. They developed a general theory and applied it to prove several conjectures of Fomin and Zelevinsky  on cluster algebras. Two papers on this subject are widely cited, they already have over hundred citations each.  The second part, more classical, had the goal of understanding the notion of representation type of a given algebra in terms of semi-invariants. The PI advanced several conjectures on the subject, but some of them turned out to be false, as he showed in a joint paper with Chindris and Kinser.   Still this part turned out to be connected to some results of Ringel and Bongartz and the PI continues continue to work on the refined conjectures.  The PI worked on cluster complexes and their relation to semi-invariants and so-called pictures for nilpotent groups in a long term project with Igusa, Orr and Todorov.   This goal of this project is to establish a relation of cluster algebras to homology of nilpotent groups.  Several of PI's  Ph.D. students wrote theses related to quivers. Andrew Carroll wrote a thesis on semi-invariants and generic decompositions of string algebras.  Kristin Webster wrote a thesis on semi-invariants of tubular algebras. Steven Sam extended saturation results for tensor product multiplicities to classical groups using the semi-invariants of symmetric quivers.   In the part on syzygies of varieties with symmetries the PI worked on so-called Vinberg representations, i.e. the representations with finitely many orbits under the action of a reductive groups. These simplest representations were classified by Kac and Vinberg in 1980's.  The PI worked with Kraskiewicz to describe the properties of singularities of orbit closures. His student Federico Galetto wrote a Ph.D. thesis making the results more precise.  The PI also worked with Gruson and Sam on more complicated cases of representations whose quotient is an affine space, where we used the work with Kraskiewicz.  Finally the PI wrote a survey (joint with Burgisser, Lansberg and Manivel) where they looked at the Geometric Complexity Theory of Mulmuley-Sohoni from the perspective of mathematicians.   The PI also worked on a book on quivers written jointly with Harm Derksen. The book is almost finished, the authors will deliver the manuscript to AMS within this year.  The PIs in a joint work with Igusa and Orr worked on cluster theory, with empasis on the relations between cluster algebras, cluster categories, semi-invariants on presentation spaces and associated picture groups. The results are obtained for all finite dimensional hereditary algebras which includes modulated quivers. Furthermore, the precise relation between domains of semi-invariants and c-vectors is given.  The second PI, in a joint work with Brustle, Hermes and igusa used the above relation between domains of semi-invariants the c-vectors in order to prove two conjectures about maximal green sequences, mathematical notion related to BPS-states of certain particles in physics.  The second PI together with Igusa introduced the notion of continuous cluster categories, which are noncountable generalizations of the cluster categories of finite or countable quivers of type A and D.   The second PI investigated functorialy finite torsion classes for herediatary algebras in the joint work with Iyama, Reiten, Thomas and showed that such classes form lattice exactly for Dynkin quivers of finite type or quivers with two vertices.
