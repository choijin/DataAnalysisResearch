<AbstractNarration>This award provides three years of funding to support the team of experimental particle physicists engaged in the high energy physics program at Cornell University. The intellectual merit is focused primarily upon the LHC and CMS in particular, but also includes the completion of physics programs at existing facilities (CLEO and CDF) and a technology development project for future ILC-type detectors. This mix of projects exploits the varied expertise of group members while balancing their responsibilities to bring existing efforts to a natural close, to provide thesis opportunities to graduate students and career development for postdocs and young faculty, to have a major impact upon LHC physics output, and to pave the way for the future. The broader impacts will include bringing the challenge and excitement of LHC physics into their extensive program of outreach: to local K-12 schools, including both in-school programs and out- of-school workshops for teachers, educators, and high school students; to the general public; and to undergraduates.</AbstractNarration>
