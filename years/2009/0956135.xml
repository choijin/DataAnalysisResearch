<AbstractNarration>This proposal will fund the development of detector arrays and analysis software for a new scientific instrument that will be used on the NSF-funded South Pole Telescope. Undergraduates, graduate students, and a post-doctoral researcher will work on different facets of this research and instrumentation project. Observations of the cosmic microwave background with this instrument promise to provide insights into the physics of inflation and will help us understand the reionization history of the universe. Another component of this award will develop a data analysis pipeline for the aforementioned instrument. Such a pipeline is a critical component of modern astronomical instruments since it can be used to test the robustness of scientific results. This is especially important for catching errors in the low signal-to-noise data that is expected from the observations made by the instrument. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the award are centered on the restructuring of a graduate level course titled "Observations, Data Analysis, and Statistics". In addition to modernizing the course through the use of peer instruction and new techniques like clicker questions, the PI will incorporate real-world analysis of the Cosmic Microwave Background into the lessons.  The proposed coursework will help develop the core skills that are used throughout the career of a research scientist. Materials developed for this course will be made available on the web so they can be used in other courses. Dr. Halverson and his team will also present public lectures at Fiske planetarium and other venues.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Ancient light, detectable by modern microwave telescopes, allows us to take images of the Universe in its infancy and reveals clues about our ultimate origin. Since its discovery in 1964 by a pair of radio astronomers, this light, called the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), has revealed a wealth of information about the early Universe, and is one of the major pillars of evidence for the Big Bang. Currently, observations of the CMB are being used to test a theory called "Inflation" which postulates that the Universe underwent a period of rapid expansion a fraction of a second after birth, seeding the Universe with the first hints of structure that later grew into stars, galaxies, and clusters of galaxies, and the filaments in between that are known as the "cosmic web." Inflation is also predicted to have launched gravitational waves, ripples propagating in the fabric of spacetime that would have imprinted a subtle curling pattern in the polarization of the CMB light, known as "B-modes", and  the race is on to search for this signal from the first moments after the Big Bang. The scientific goals of the project were to conduct sensitive polarization measurements of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) using the South Pole Telescope (SPT) with an instrument called SPTpol in order to look for the inflationary signal, and to characterize the growth of large-scale structure. For the educational component of this award, the objective was to restructure a graduate core course, ``Observations, Data Analysis, and Statistics,'' to incorporate peer instruction, clicker questions, and diverse conceptual assessment tools.  The goal was to improve understanding and assimilation of core skills used throughout the careers of future scientists who take this course. Award funds were used to help develop, deploy, and analyze data from the SPTpol instrument. Since the instrument was deployed in late 2011, we have published several conference proceedings papers on SPTpol technology development and five science results papers from the SPTpol instrument, including he first detection of so-called B-mode polarization in the CMB that was produced by gravitational lensing from large-scale matter fluctuations in the universe, and precise measurements of the so-called E-mode polarization that was produced by sound waves when the universe was about 400,000 years old. The SPTpol project has helped hone our understanding of the early universe.

The award helped train four graduate students, one undergraduate student, and two postdoctoral scholars in technology development and science. The particular skills are widely transferrable for a variety of jobs in academia, government labs, and private industry.  This research directly addresses the fundamental human drive to understand our origins and the origins of the Universe. Deploying instruments to the South Pole to image ancient light captures our imagination and inspires future generations of scientists and engineers.
