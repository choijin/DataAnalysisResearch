<AbstractNarration>Overlay anonymity systems like Tor are effective against many kinds of attacks&lt;br/&gt;on privacy, but they have significantly slower network performance than regular&lt;br/&gt;Internet traffic. The purpose of this project is to explore the design of&lt;br/&gt;anon.next, an anonymity system for the next-generation Internet. In anon.next,&lt;br/&gt;we embed anonymizing proxies into new Internet architectures, so that the&lt;br/&gt;network itself can provide efficient and effective privacy protection in a way&lt;br/&gt;that overlay designs cannot. This project seeks to make major advances in two&lt;br/&gt;areas key to the design of anon.next. First, methods to construct&lt;br/&gt;high-throughput paths of anonymizing proxies to route the user's packets to&lt;br/&gt;their destinations with minimal leakage of privacy. Second, secure methods to&lt;br/&gt;locate those proxies without relying on centralized directory servers or&lt;br/&gt;exposing the users' packet routes. Both components require us to develop new&lt;br/&gt;metrics for the privacy provided by a given anonymizing path and by the system&lt;br/&gt;as a whole. We are conducting analysis and simulation studies and validating&lt;br/&gt;these with extensive experimentation on GENI testbeds.  These efforts will&lt;br/&gt;provide major insights into the design of anonymity systems, which provide&lt;br/&gt;personal privacy as well as censorship resistance and protection for&lt;br/&gt;whistle-blowers, journalists, and intelligence services. Our project is also&lt;br/&gt;part of the large effort required to understand and design distributed systems&lt;br/&gt;in the next-generation Internet. This project involves students at many levels,&lt;br/&gt;including middle and high school students in summer camp settings,&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate students in research into finding new attacks against our&lt;br/&gt;systems, and graduate students.</AbstractNarration>

In a series of works on stepping stone detection and covert channels, we demonstrated ways for communications to evade observation and blend in with other traffic.
