<AbstractNarration>This International Research Experience for Students (IRES) award entitled Fish Biodiversity Research and Education in Kenya provides a diverse group of US biology students from Tulane University and nearby historically Black universities in New Orleans with a program of language and cultural training and collaborative fish biodiversity research in Kenya.  In each of the three award years, one graduate and three undergraduate students will travel to Kenya for field and laboratory research with collaborators at the National Museums of Kenya and the University of Nairobi.  Prior to the five-week summer research experience, students will be trained in biodiversity research methods in the laboratory of US PI Henry Bart and culture and Kenyan language training at Tulane during the academic year. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The IRES program will train a cadre of undergraduate and graduate students in scientific methods and motivate them to pursue academic research careers and contribute to the U.S. scientific workforce.  Participants will gain experience in all phases of scientific research from developing research questions and data gathering, to final publication and other forms of dissemination of research results.  The project will leverage information and resources from the Cypriniformes Tree of Life Project.  For the international collaborators, the project will help to build research capacity and infrastructure in the Ichthyology Section of the National Museums of Kenya, and will assist the country?s nascent effort to develop into a regional center for ichthyological research.  Finally, from an institutional perspective, this project will serve as a model for international research and education programs across the curriculum.</AbstractNarration>

Funding from the IRES Program enabled teams of U.S. and Kenyan researchers, graduate students, and equal numbers of U.S. and Kenyan undergraduates (24 in all) to samples fishes at 66 sites on rivers across central, southern and western Kenya during the summers of 2010-2012 (See Fig. 1).

The U.S. graduate assistant on the project, Dr. Ray Schmidt, also developed close ties to Dr. Nyingi and her associates while working in Kenya two years as a Smithsonian Postdoctoral Fellow. Schmidt is now pursuing important ichthyological research in other parts of Africa as a result of the Kenya IRES project.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>U.S. project participants also enjoyed rich cultural experiences while in Kenya, including in include being in Kenya and witnessing firsthand Kenya?s historic referendum to approve its first constitution (2010); visiting the site of the 1998 U.S. Embassy bombing and memorial (2010); going on safari in Maasai Mara and visiting a Maasai village (2010); attending a performance of the Bomas of Kenya dance group (2010); visiting an animal orphanage outside Nairobi (2010); visiting NMK?s Kisumu Museum, in Kisumu, Kenya and learning about customs of Kenya?s Luo tribal people (2011); visiting the Village of Kogelo (the ancestral home of President Barak Obama?s father and grandfather) and meeting President Obama's paternal grandmother, Mama Sarah Obama (2011); becoming involved in the Kenya Wetlands Biodiversity Research Team (KENWEB) and learning about critical environmental issues confronting Kenyan wetlands (2011,-2012); visiting and sampling fishes in several of Kenya?s game parks (Amboseli, Meru, Nairobi National Park, Samburu, Shaba and Tsavo) and learning about big game conservation from biologists with the Kenya Wildlife Service (2010-2012).</p> <p>Bart and Schmidt continued to visit Kenya and other parts of East Africa annually from 2013-2016, doing field work, conducting research, organizing and attending conferences, and leading professional-development workshops.&nbsp;Our focus now is on publishing papers based on our findings.
