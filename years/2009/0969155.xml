<AbstractNarration>Thin films of single-walled carbon nanotubes show considerable promise for applications that require flexible conductive coatings, and the deformation mechanics of nanotube-nanotube contacts is what ultimately dictates the strength and durability of such films. Electronic type can have a significant impact on the strength of these contacts through the nature of the van der Waals interactions between contacted nanotubes. In work supported by this grant, we are separating nanotubes into metallic and semiconducting fractions and assembling them as pristine membranes on flexible polymer surfaces. Strain-induced structural changes will be investigated over a broad range of length scales using a diverse set of measurement techniques. To interpret these measurements, we will use coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of nanoscale deformation in two-dimensional rigid-rod networks with adjustable friction and tunable interaction potentials. These simulations allow us to model anisotropic changes in network elasticity over a wide range of experimentally relevant parameters, providing critical insight into the local structural changes that govern the mechanics of flexible nanotube films.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this work can be found in both the commercial sector and the classroom. The insight gained will lead to improvements in the mechanical performance and durability of nanotube films, with emerging applications in photovoltaic devices and fuel-cell membranes. Undergraduate research participation is a significant part of this research. Our group has an established record of mentoring undergraduates, including women and under-represented minorities, through challenging research projects that culminate in publications in leading scientific journals. The insight we gain will also be directly incorporated into the graduate and undergraduate curriculum in Materials and Nanotechnology at NDSU, a newly established interdisciplinary program that spans the departments of Physics, Mechanical Engineering, Civil Engineering, and Coatings &amp; Polymeric Materials.</AbstractNarration>

Conceptually, they are much like polymers or common plastics - materials that revolutionized technology and commerce in the 1960s. They are more sophisticated, however, in that they are comprised of a very thin (one ten-millionth of a centimeter) hollow tube of crystalline carbon atoms arranged like rolled-up chicken wire. A consequence of this unique structure is that nanotubes are extremely stiff and strong, like diamond, while also being electrically conductive like metals or semiconductors - two other materials that have had a tremendous technological impact. Although we typically get a random mix of metallic and semiconducting nanotubes when we make them, we now have ways to quickly purify them by type or species.   Thin films of purified nanotubes have potential applications as transparent conductors (like the touch screen in a smart phone), transistors for computers, or photovoltaics that turn sunlight into electricity, to name just a few. Because of their unprecedented mechanical properties and polymer-like structure, nanotubes also offer the possibility of making all of these applications flexible, like a solar cell that can conform to any surface or a touch screen that can be rolled up like a piece of paper. Although they have very high modulus, they are so thin that they can readily flex and bend. Despite this potential, there had been virtually no previous studies of the mechanics of thin flexible nanotube films.   Supported by this grant from the National Science Foundation, we performed a study of the flexure mechanics of thin ultra-pure nanotube films. In light of the resemblance of nanotubes to polymers, our approach was built on methods used to study the mechanics of thin polymer films. In simple terms, we stretched a piece of transparent rubber, adhered a nanotube film to it, and then released the stretch. When you do this with a thin stiff film, the film wrinkles and the spacing of the wrinkles tells you how stiff the film is.   What we found gave us a window into the remarkable mechanical properties of single-wall carbon nanotubes, but with complications. Because the nanotube films are very much like thin porous paper, they rearrange as the film is compressed, which changes their mechanical and electronic properties. Analogous types of "plastic" behavior are found in many materials, but what was unique about the nanotubes was how quickly these changes occurred when the films were compressed. By quantifying and modeling our measurements for different nanotube types, we identified the underlying mechanisms of structural change, and the insight we gained helped us design processes that circumvent or reduce this type of plasticity. In conjunction with funds from a separate grant, we then used these processes to make solar cells with record energy-conversion efficiencies out of nanotubes.   The grant supported two PhD students and several undergraduates. We also worked with two high-school students from North Dakota - an opportunity that gave both of these young women a chance to experience scientific research at a very early point in their careers. One of these high-school students contributed to a publication and got her name on the paper. In total, the grant led directly or contributed to twelve publications in leading scientific journals, two journal covers, and several seminars and presentations. The work laid the foundation for further studies that will exploit our findings to engineer even stronger and more resilient flexible films out of highly purified single-wall carbon nanotubes and use these films to create new types of flexible devices.
