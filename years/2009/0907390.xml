<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;The proposal seeks to explore the potential of semifluorinated polymers as responsive self healing interfaces. Responsive interfaces are ubiquitous in biological manifolds.  From self cleaning surfaces and adhesion controlled interfaces to self healing layers, nature has inspired intensive efforts to design synthetic responsive polymeric interfaces. Fluorinated and protonated segments are highly immiscible and exhibit very different surface interactions. As a result, inserting a short fluorinated segment into a polymer chain is often sufficient to induce micro-phase separation as well as long range order. Tailoring highly incompatible short segments into one chain offers a means to obtain interfaces that can locally rearrange and respond to changes in the environment while retaining the integrity of the layers. The driving forces for reversible responses lie in the tendency of any system to achieve thermodynamic equilibrium.  &lt;br/&gt;To attain this goal, the research will identify and quantify when feasible, the factors that control the structure and interfacial characteristics of thin semifluorinated films, study the dynamics of solvents at these complex interfaces and identify the conditions under which they form  interfaces that respond to stimuli.  The proposed study will focus on three groups of semifluorinated copolymers: a) hydrocarbons and fluorinated aliphatic chains, b) random co-polymer bridged by perfluoro cyclobutane, and c) diblock copolymers of polystyrene and semifluorinated siloxane blocks.  The structure and energies of the interfaces will be studied by microscopy and scattering techniques accompanied by molecular dynamic computer simulations. These measurements, in comparison with the bulk structure and dynamics will provide a multiple length scale picture critical for effective design of responsive interfaces.&lt;br/&gt;NON TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will impact the development of new technologies and contribute to science education. Developing responsive polymeric materials with controlled optical and conducting characteristics together with selective adhesion is essential for the design of next generation devices from nano-bio sensors and implants to plastic electronics and self healing coatings. The results of the proposed research will directly impact technological advancements.  Ongoing collaboration of the PI with scientists at 3M will serve as a jump start for technological implementation and testing of the findings. Further applications of transport will be explored via small business initiatives at Clemson.  &lt;br/&gt;With the realization of the significance of to science education at early stages, the proposed research will incorporate projects designed for high school students and derive ways to disseminate science highlights to the public. This will be done together with two high school teachers in Greenville SC, David Dollbey from Riverside High School and Dr. Wisenhunt from Greenville High School.&lt;br/&gt;On the graduate level, the project will incorporate studies at Clemson University and in national laboratories, using neutron and X-ray sources. The traditional graduate education will transcend to training the next generation of material researches to take advantage of the unique information extracted from neutron and X-ray techniques to the design of new materials.  This is particularly significance in a state where the use of these techniques has been very limited.  The PI is the first scientist from her University to use some of these resources.  This initiative will foster new collaborations between Clemson scientists and those in national laboratories. This educational initiative in of further significance in view of recent developments in experimental neutron techniques, funded partially by the National Science Foundation, that allow probing the response of new materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Thin films with well-defined electrical and optical behavior that can change their surface properties as their environment changes are highly desired for a large number of ground breaking, innovative technologies such as touch sensitive screens and coatings for optical devices to biotechnology. One path to achieve these characteristics is to utilize co-polymers, which are macromolecules with several blocks that do not readily mix.  One class of such potential materials is semifluorinated co-polymers, polymers that contain fluorinated segments. Varying the amount of fluorine has the potential to be able to tune both the dielectric and optical properties of material while at the same time controlling the interfacial energies of the surfaces.   Using neutron scattering techniques and computational tools, we investigated the effects of fluorinated segments on the interfacial structure and dynamics of thin polymeric films. We found that even small amounts of fluorine are sufficient to affect the structure of the thin polymeric layers. Further, we found that their interface contains nano domains of fluorine where small changes in their structure results in large changes of the surface energy. These changes affect the adhesion and the ability of these surfaces to reflect light.  In presence of vapor, such as high humidity or organic solvents, the surface composition changes spontaneously in response to these substances, forming responsive though stable thin polymeric films.  These studies have provided one important path to achieve responsive, though stable polymeric thin films.  Several critical questions, regarding the spreading of liquids on polymeric films and the ability of macromolecules to weld upon heating, that arise from these results were studied further by computational tools.  In addition to the direct benefit of the knowledge of physics of polymers, this work had made strides towards materials by design where computational tools play acritical role.  In parallel to the scientific contributions of the work several educational activities have been initiated to promote the use of neutron-based techniques to understand the complex behavior of polymers and propagate the design of new materials.  Neutron techniques are especially powerful to understand the structure of polymers and their motion.  The  PI has taught several specialized courses, in the US in the framework of the American Physical Society meeting and internationally that introduced the basic concepts of these techniques and their applications.   The combined research-educational activities have promoted the understanding of new classes of polymers, and their response together with integrating the state of the art neutron and computational tools to advance the design of new polymeric materials. These activities in turn impact the development of a wide range of new technologies from clean energy to biotechnology.
