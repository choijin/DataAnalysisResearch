    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop high-performance polymer nanocomposites containing functionalized few-walled carbon nanotubes (FWNT). First, the synthesis conditions for FWNTs will be optimized to identify the best FWNTs for composites application. Second, the FWNTs will be functionalized to a high soluble degree with a unique technique without destroying their perfect graphite structure so that the intrinsic properties will be retained. Then the functionalized FWNTs with different loading will be well dispersed into a polymer matrix to fabricate FWNTs/polymer nanocomposites. Finally, the mechanical and physical properties of the resulting nanocomposites will be evaluated with correlation to the FWNT loading ratio and dispersion degree.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impact of this project will be the potential to obtain FWNT/polymer nanocomposites with superior physical, thermal and mechanical properties. The FWNTs have advantages over multi- and single-walled carbon nanotubes such as high structure perfection and thermal stability respectively. The incorporation of FWNTs into light weight polymer matrix will enhance both physical and thermal properties of the FWNT/polymer composites. This technology is of commercial importance in developing high-performance and light-weight polymer nanocomposites which will have wide-range of end users including aerospace, packaging, building and construction, electronics, medical equipment and sports goods etc.</AbstractNarration>
