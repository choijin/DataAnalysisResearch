    <AbstractNarration>Support of Student Participation in the North American Paleontological&lt;br/&gt;Convention (NAPC-2009--Cincinnati, Ohio; June 21-June 26, 2009)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;William I. Ausich, Paleontological Society&lt;br/&gt;EAR-0904136&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant was supported by funds from both the Sedimentary Geology and Paleobiology Program (GEO) and the Systematic Biology &amp; Biodiversity Inventories Cluster (BIO)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;The North American Paleontological Convention (NAPC) is held every four years to bring together disparate parts of the paleontological sciences that otherwise seldom meet. It is supported by paleontological groups headquartered in North America and is open to all who are interested in paleontology. The meeting planned for June 21 through June 26, 2009 at the University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio will be the ninth NAPC. Furthermore, the 2009 NAPC coincides with the bicentennial of the birth of Charles Darwin and the sesquicentennial of the publication of The Origin of Species. NSF has supported the participation of American students in previous NAPCs and this proposal requests funds to support students at next year's meeting. Based on past experience, the Organizing Committee anticipates that about 100-150 students will attend. The support will be used for two purposes. First of all funds will be provided to the meeting organizers to reduce the cost of student registration. Secondly, funds will be available to support the travel costs for some students to the meeting. Grantees would be selected on the basis of merit, and appropriate attention will be paid to the need to support minority groups and women.</AbstractNarration>
