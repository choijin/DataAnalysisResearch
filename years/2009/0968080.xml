<AbstractNarration>0968080&lt;br/&gt;Goldsborough&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this project is to investigate and understand the ignition and pollutant formation chemistry of next-generation of biofuels. Bio-derived fuels represent an important domestic resource with the potential to enable sustainability targets to be achieved while addressing regional air quality problems.  These fuels behave significantly differently from conventional fuels and a fundamental understanding is critical for the development advanced combustion engines (ACE). This study will focus on biodiesels, or more specifically biodiesel surrogates.  These surrogates are medium weight esters whose molecular structure is similar to today?s biodiesels and tomorrow?s bio-derived synthetic-derivatives. Synthetic derivatives are being pursued by the bio-fuel industry in order to improve important fuel properties such viscosity, surface tension, pour point and thermo-oxidative stability. It is hypothesized that manipulations of the fuel?s molecular structure not only impacts these properties, but also ignition behavior and pollutant formation. Various fuel structures will be investigated in this study including different fatty acid chains and different ester groups.  A well-characterized, rapid compression expansion machine (RCEM) along with an integrated gas sampling system and GC/MS analytical unit will be employed to acquire necessary data. The data from the RCEM will be used to develop chemical kinetic mechanisms that can describe ignition delay, heat released, and combustion intermediates. The mechanisms will be validated and refined with the aid of reaction path and sensitivity analysis tools.  The PI will work closely with collaborators at the National Center for Food and Agricultural Research, LLNL, the National University of Ireland Galway, ANL, Reaction Design and Ford. These organizations represent a wide spectrum of parties invested in the development and effective utilization of next-generation fuels in ACEs. The PI and his research group, through this project, will play an integral part in this evolving industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The combustion chemistry of bio-derived fuels is not well understood.  The proposed work will focus on C13- esters as surrogates for larger C17- C21- molecules in order to reveal how fuel molecular structure, including novel synthetic formulations, regulates ignition behavior and pollutant formation when used in operating combustion engines.  Of particular interest are processes in ACE regimes including low/intermediate temperature (600-1100K), high pressure (2-20MPa) and various levels of dilution.  Fundamental data for diesel and bio-diesel relevant fuels are scarce in part due to the problem of involatility. This research will develop techniques to overcome this barrier and acquire the necessary data. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This integrated research and education plan will enable collaboration with others, to recruit and retain a diverse pool of high-quality undergraduate and graduate students in mechanical engineering at Marquette University.  Through this program students will be exposed to: critical issues facing our nation, techniques and tools for scientific discovery, exciting and relevant research topics, and opportunities for professional development, collaborative environments and international perspectives. Strong relationships will be cultivated between the PI and three national labs, one international university, two industrial organizations.  Education and outreach to area high schools will be facilitated through the College of Engineering?s participation in Project Lead the Way.  The data and understanding acquired through this work will contribute to an urgently needed body of knowledge regarding bio-derived fuel combustion. Results will be disseminated widely in journal, conference, working group and web-based forums.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project investigated the ignition and pollutant chemistry of next-generation biodiesels.  Biodiesels are trans-esterified plant oils, typically methyl esters that have carbon chains as long as 12-22+ atoms.  They are often blended with petroleum-based diesel, but can be directly substituted for non-renewable fuels for use in combustion engines.  Soy and rapeseed-based biodiesel comprise the largest share of biodiesels produced, though a number of alternative oil feedstocks have been investigated in order to improve cost and performance, as well as reduce life-cycle impacts.  The structure of the molecules within the fuel, such as the size and shape of the alkyl portion of the compound as well as of the ester group, can significantly impact a biodiesel?s combustion behavior, affecting properties such as ignitability, and well as pollution formation tendencies.  Physical properties like viscosity and cloud point can also be affected.  Novel synthesis techniques have been explored in the literature to manipulate these structures, e.g., via methyl substitution and dehydrogenation within the alkyl chain or alteration of the ester moiety from methyl to ethyl.  A fundamental understanding of the combustion chemistry for such biodiesels is needed however, in order to facilitate fuel design and widespread, renewable fuel deployment.  Biodiesels are involatile, with very high boiling points, and this makes fundamental, gas phase combustion experiments difficult.  As part of this project, a novel technique was developed in order to prepare fuel/air mixtures for use in well-controlled apparatuses, such as rapid compression machines (RCMs), so that autoignition tests could be conducted at high fuel-loading conditions.  A so-called ?aerosol fueling? method, originally proposed for shock tube experiments, was explored both computationally and via physical testing.  Unique challenges associated with application to RCMs were addressed, while the operational performance and limitations were characterized over a range of conditions.  In addition, a reduced-order, physical model for the system was developed so that autoignition experiments conducted with the ?aerosol fueling? approach can be simulated using detailed chemical kinetic models.  Autoignition tests using an RCM with the ?aerosol fueling? technique were unable to be conducted, so experiments employing a high pressure, single-pulse shock tube facility (SPST) were undertaken instead.  These tests, while not able to explore the lowest temperatures experienced in combustion engines (750&ndash;850 K), were extremely unique since the decomposition chemical intermediates could be monitored across a range of temperatures, at engine-relevant pressures (40&ndash;60 bar).  In the SPST, very dilute mixtures were used with oxygen concentrations less than 1%, so that conventional, preheating preparation techniques could be employed.  Tests specifically investigated the influence of double carbon bonding along the alkyl chain where two isomers of methyl nonenoate (methyl trans-2-noneoate and methyl trans-3-noneoate, C10H18O2), two octene isomers (1-octene and trans-2-octene, C8H16) and four decene isomers (1-decene, cis-5-decene, trans-5-decene and cis-2-decene, C10H20) were employed.  Substantial differences were noted in fuel decomposition behavior as well as intermediate species production based on the molecular structure of the alkyl chain.  Detailed chemical kinetic models for the oxidation of the decene, octene and methyl decenoate isomers were developed using automated generation techniques, i.e., Reaction Mechanism Generator (RMG), in order to describe and understand the measurements acquired with the SPST experiments.  The resulting mechanisms were found to reasonably represent the oxidation features of the four isomers, though some noticeable discrepancies were discovered.  Monte Carlo techniques were used to quantify the uncertainty within the models, and while the robustness of the experiment and the model were highlighted under some conditions, species such as acetylene and ethane were not well predicted by the automatically generated model.  It was conclusively demonstrated that the foundational chemistry model used in conjunction with RMG has a significant influence on the predicted results.
