    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pH of the ocean is predicted to decrease by 0.2-0.5 pH units in the next 50 to100 years as a result of increasing atmospheric CO2. To date almost all the research on impending ocean acidification has focused on the impacts to calcifying organisms and the carbonate system. However, ocean acidification will also affect other significant marine processes that are pH dependent. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, researchers at the University of California at Santa Barbara will investigate the impact of ocean acidification on the organic carbon or 'soft tissue' biological pump. They predict that a decline in oceanic pH will result in an increase in the protonation of negatively charged substances, especially of Transparent Exopolymer Particles (TEP), the gel-like particles that provide the matrix of aggregates and bind particles together. A decreased polarity of these highly surface-active particles may reduce their "stickiness" resulting in decreased aggregation of organic-rich particles and a decreased ability of aggregates to scavenge and retain heavy ballast minerals. A reduction in aggregation will lower the fraction of POC enclosed in fast-sinking aggregates. Decreased scavenging of minerals by aggregates will result in reduced sinking velocities and consequently a decline in the fraction of material escaping degradation in the water column. Both processes ultimately reduce carbon flux to depth. The resulting weakening of the biological pump will alter pelagic ecology and potentially produce a positive feed-back pathway that further increases atmospheric CO2 concentrations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research team will experimentally investigate TEP-production, aggregation rates and aggregate characteristics, mineral scavenging and sinking velocity as a function of ocean acidification, because these parameters are susceptible to pH and central in determining sedimentation rate of organic carbon. They will determine potential changes in the abiotic formation of TEP or in the release rate of TEP or TEP-precursors by phytoplankton that have been adapted to increased CO2 regimes for multiple generations, up to 1000 doublings. Additionally, they will experimentally test potential changes in the aggregation rate of adapted phytoplankton and natural particles, and measure impacts on scavenging rates of ballast minerals by aggregates. Effects of various acidification levels on aggregate characteristics, including size, composition, density, and sinking velocity will also be determined. These results are expected to provide parameterization for a predictive model that will be used to investigate the impact of changing ballasting or aggregation on carbon flux. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact: Climate and environmental change are a global challenge to society. We need to know if possible positive feed back mechanisms to the biological pump will further increase atmospheric CO2 in order to prepare for and hopefully manage future climate changes. This project will also foster international collaboration between scientists in the US and Europe and contribute appreciably to the training of (female) students. Results will be made available to local K-12 classrooms and to the general public to increase public awareness of the potential impacts of ocean acidification on marine ecosystems.</AbstractNarration>
