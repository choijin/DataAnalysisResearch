<AbstractNarration>This project seeks to quantify the inherent predictability of observed precipitation variations over the U.S. on seasonal to multi-decadal timescales. The questions to be addressed include: 1) What amount of observed seasonal-mean precipitation variability is uniquely related to variations in the background state of the observed system during a given time-period?  2) When and where do these inherently predictable variations in seasonal-mean precipitation occur within the U.S.? 3) What is the inherent predictability of short-term (&lt;12-months) and long-term (&gt;12-month) drought occurrences? 4) Do numerical climate models adequately reproduce the inherent predictability of precipitation variations over the U.S.?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To answer these questions, the investigators will (i) construct stochastic weather-generation models based upon observed station-based daily precipitation, which can be used to establish the envelope of variability that arises solely from the random behavior of precipitation events, (ii)  identify observed interannual to multi-decadal scale variations in seasonal-mean precipitation across the U.S. that lie outside this envelope produced by chance, (iii) use the observed and stochastically-generated daily-precipitation time-series to detect inherently-predictable variations in the severity of drought, as represented by the Standard Precipitation Index, and (vi) evaluate numerical model capability in reproducing the observed inherent predictability of seasonal-mean precipitation and drought over the U.S., using daily precipitation estimates from numerical model representations of the climate of the 20th century.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this project will include improving our confidence in climate forecasts for many regions of the U.S by identifying  "hot-spot" regions of historical predictability that are strongly influenced by climate-change processes. Further it will establish the groundwork for a better understanding of the role that regional- and large-scale atmospheric circulations and ocean- and land-surface forcings play in modifying regional precipitation on interannual to multi-decadal time-scales. It will also guide future investigations into numerical model systems' portrayal of physical mechanisms that give rise to observed predictability. Finally, it will help determine the applicability of using stochastic weather-generation models for identifying and analyzing inherently predictable precipitation variations in other regions of the world.</AbstractNarration>

To answer these questions, we constructed stochastic weather-generation models based upon observed station-based daily precipitation, which can be used to establish the envelop of variability that arises solely from the random behavior of precipitation events. We then identified observed interannual to multi-decadal scale variations in seasonal-mean precipitation across the U.S. that lie outside this envelope produced by chance.  Further, we used the observed and stochastically-generated daily-precipitation time-series to detect inherently-predictable variations in precipitation extremes, including extreme dry spells leading to droughts or heavy precipitation events leading to flooding.  Finally, we are in the process of developing a "unified" stochastic weather-generation model framework that is equally applicable for grid-point based precipitation as well as station-based precipitation.  Using daily precipitation estimates from numerical model representations of the climate of the 20th century in combination with the new unified stochastic weather-generation model, we will continue to evaluate numerical model capability in reproducing the observed inherent predictability of seasonal-mean precipitation and drought over the U.S.  The broader impacts of the project  include improving our confidence in climate forecasts for many regions of the U.S by identifying  "hot-spot" regions of historical predictability that are strongly influenced by climate-change processes.
