<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for a 3 year standard award to support a Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) in Engineering Site program at Georgia Institute of Technology (GA Tech) entitled, "RET Site: National Nanotechnology Infrastructure Network (NNIN)", under the direction of Dr. Nancy Healy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) in Engineering Site is a renewal of a successful RET Site program hosted by the National Nanotechnology Infrastructure Network (NNIN) with the lead at Georgia Institute of Technology and partners at Harvard University, Howard University, Pennsylvania State University, and the University of California Santa Barbara.  This site will provide a total of 45 in-service, grades 6-12 science teachers from local school districts (15 per year for 3 years) an opportunity to engage in high-quality, hands-on research in state-of-the-art nanotechnology facilities at NNIN sites for 6 weeks during the summer with 2 weeks of follow-up activities throughout the year.  The objectives of the program are to assist science teachers in understanding and communicating the importance of using inquiry-based methods to solve problems by doing research in nanotechnology; establish a long-term mentorship support group of teachers who will become advocates for STEM and nanotechnology education and careers; nurture a mentorship community between professors, graduate student mentors, and science teachers in high-need school districts; and build a library of classroom activities for the classroom.</AbstractNarration>
