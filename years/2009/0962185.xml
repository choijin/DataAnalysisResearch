<AbstractNarration>Common approaches to resource and political conflicts often assume adversaries understand the world on the basis of rational choices. Given this assumption, one can predict the behavior of potential allies and adversaries by analyzing the costs and benefits of a given action from their perspective. In prior research involving psychological experiments, anthropological fieldwork and political science surveys relating to political and resource conflicts, the PIs have found that that when sacred or protected values (e.g. &lt;br/&gt;"My values are not for sale"; "Do the right thing regardless of the consequences") are in play, the assumption that the values people place on different actions is simply the sum of the values of their consequences may be wrong.  As a result, the practice of providing incentives to increase the attractiveness of certain courses of action and/or penalties to make other courses of action less attractive to try and achieve a desired outcome in a conflict may backfire.  Planning and acting in ignorance of or disregard for non-consequentialist value frameworks may exacerbate conflict, with grievous loss of treasure and lives. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the proposed research, the PIs examine how different moral frames, with different types and uses of sacred values, shape personal and collective identity, influence cultural and political decision making, and sustain inter-group conflict. The studies will broaden theoretical and empirical analyses of moral cognition, including how protected or sacred values (SVs) affect people's lives and play out in diverse cultural contexts. SVs are distinct from secular values because of their association with transcendental beliefs, relative immunity to tradeoffs with instrumental values, emotional salience, and significance for personal and collective identity. The project will examine how SVs operate in real-world contexts, identifying those circumstances where they result in decision makers ignoring material consequences and distance in time or place and produce paradoxical results as well as those where they produce outcomes that track those that follow from the consequentialist assumption. The methodology integrates basic and applied research, combining laboratory and field experiments, surveys and interviews in a number of different cultural settings (North America, the Middle East, and India) in order to provide "real-world" relevance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results will contribute to a comprehensive theoretical framework and wide-ranging empirical analysis of the psychological and cultural mechanisms underlying moral reasoning and decision making, the formation of cultural identity, and the nature of sacred values.</AbstractNarration>

Sometimes people make decisions by assessing pluses and minuses (so-called cost-benefit analysis) but at other times we follow rules and principles and refuse to assign a monetary value to the object or entity in question. It is common to hear people say "you canÆt put a price on a human life" and many people hold their liberties to be priceless and worth dying for. An important characteristic of sacred values is that the people who hold them sometimes fail to consider, much less maximize, consequences. This runs counter to most normative models of rational choice, and has obvious implication for understanding cross-cultural conflict in cases where one or both adversaries make decisions that appear contrary to their own interests.  Our goal has been to understand how strong values affect peopleÆs lives and play out in diverse cultural contexts in seemingly paradoxical ways, sometimes ignoring material consequences and distance in time or place, while on other occasions tracking them closely. We have used a combination of lab studies and field research with a wide range of cultural groups (Israeli settlers, Palestinian refugees, people in positions of power in the Middle East, Indigenous populations in Guatemala, Panama, Chile and the US, Evangelical Christians and hunters from rural Wisconsin, Kurds living in Turkey, Persians living outside of and in Iran, etc.) and our understanding of sacred values and modes of decision making has been considerably broadened and deepened.
