<AbstractNarration>Engineering - Electrical (55)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is developing and implementing a novel junior level Applied Quantum Mechanics Course for Electrical Engineers that fits in the standard Electrical and Computer Engineering curriculum. The proposed course aligns quantum mechanics with existing courses on electromagnetic field theory and electronic devices in order to connect related wave behavior and quantum theory between the three courses.  This combination is providing a more cohesive background in these areas and allowing extended coverage in upper division solid state device courses.  The new course is using a spiral teaching model to incorporate fundamental quantum concepts into applied scientific and engineering case studies that are relevant to electrical engineering.  It also is using computer simulation tools to provide visualization of both fundamental and applied quantum concepts and a peer led team learning (PLTL) model to facilitate learning and to motivate students to become active learners.  Course materials are being developed in conjunction with the NSF funded Network for Computational Nanotechnology (NCN) to be incorporated into the NanoHUB website.  Assessment efforts are being led by two independent evaluators with one measuring progress toward project goals and the other conducting exploratory research and evaluation on conative (motivation and volition) functions in learning and performing in relation to course goals.  The project team is disseminating their materials and evaluation results through website posting, faculty workshops with the University of Texas System's LSAMP, special programs with an alliance for minority serving institutions, conference presentation, and journal publications.  Broader impacts include the dissemination of their material with a special focus on minority serving institutions.</AbstractNarration>
