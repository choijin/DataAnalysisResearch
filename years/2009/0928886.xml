<AbstractNarration>The goal of this US-Korea-Japan research effort is to develop a transformative framework for Wireless Smart Sensor Networks (WSSN) to monitor critical civil infrastructure that builds upon a foundation of substantial existing collaboration with our international counterparts.  To achieve the project goal, four principal tasks are defined: 1) Develop multi-metric and multi-scale sensors and associated algorithms that are informed by the sensory perception of biological organisms; 2) Implement a service-oriented architecture that will result in modular, easy to maintain applications that can be adapted for monitoring different types of structures and will manage the complexity demanded by multi-metric sensing; 3) Develop a user-driven WSSN macro-programming environment to facilitate the implementation of structural health monitoring for critical civil infrastructure; and 4) Prototype and test the WSSN by implementing the developed software in both laboratory and full-scale test beds.   The benefits of this approach include greatly improving the scalability of the software development process, enabling multiple dynamic, context-aware applications to run concurrently in a shared environment, and increasing efficiency through global shared resource management across applications.  Successful completion of this research will accelerate the practical implementation of innovative strategies for protecting our respective nations infrastructure.</AbstractNarration>
