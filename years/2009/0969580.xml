<AbstractNarration>This work focuses on theoretical aspects of tests of fundamental symmetries with atoms and molecules. The project  is driven by searches for new physics, such as supersymmetry, beyond the standard model of elementary particles, with atomic parity violation. Such searches rely on exquisite experimental sensitivity to minute effects of fundamental forces on atomic and molecular structure. High-accuracy calculations are required for revealing (or extracting constraints on) new, yet undiscovered particles. The derived constraints are competitive and, at the same time complementary to the information gained from particle colliders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this work evidently reach beyond AMO physics, into fundamental elementary particle theory. The impacts are broad, as the work may contribute to extensions of the standard model.  In addition, this grant will support research and education of a graduate student. The student will be encouraged to participate at meetings and activities of the American Physical Society. The findings and results will be disseminated through publications in scientific journals, conference presentations, and the Internet.</AbstractNarration>

While a typical wristwatch keeps time accurate to about a second over a week, modern atomic clocks aim at neither gaining nor loosing a second over the age of the Universe.  Atomic clocks are ubiquitous and among many places, they tick away on stock exchanges, in data centers, and in the hearts of GPS satellites.   Our work has paved the way for expanding the frontier of accuracy of modern time-keeping. We proposed and theoretically investigated two classes of clocks: the nuclear clock and clocks based on highly-charged ions.

In turn such accuracy could improve relativistic geodesy and searches for new phenomena that so far escaped the detection by the previous-generation devices.  Additionally, we also carried various theoretical studies at the interface of particle, nuclear and atomic physics.    The research has been carried out in Nevada, one of the EPSCoR (Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research) states, underrepresented in the scientific enterprise. The funding of the proposal fulfilled one of the strategic goals of the NSF to "broaden participation and enhance diversity in NSF programs." In addition, this grant supported research and education of two graduate and two undergraduate  students, i.e., "advanced discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, training, and learning."
