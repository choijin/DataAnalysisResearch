<AbstractNarration>AST-0908276&lt;br/&gt;Campins&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is a three-year spectroscopic study of 20 Cybele and Hilda asteroids.  Cybeles and Hildas orbit between two significantly different populations of primitive asteroids, those in the main belt and those in the Jupiter Trojan clouds.  Many Cybele and Hilda asteroids can now be reached by near-infrared and mid-infrared spectroscopy, which is diagnostic of the mineralogy of the asteroid surfaces.  This study will determine if Cybele and Hilda asteroids show surface characteristics similar to Jupiter Trojans, and will therefore test the recent dynamical models that argue that many asteroids in this region are actually captured objects from the primordial transneptunian belt.  This team has already demonstrated the potential of this observational approach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Undergraduate and graduate students, some female or members of other under-represented groups, will be directly involved in the research.  The methods and results of this research will be incorporated into undergraduate and graduate courses, and the results will also inform public outreach activities.</AbstractNarration>
