<AbstractNarration>0932724&lt;br/&gt;Graedel&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the most part, the long term availability of "specialty metals" of great importance to society (e.g., hafnium, niobium, molybdenum, cobalt, tantalum, etc.) is essentially unknown.  Methodology for assessing the "criticality" of these materials will be used together with extensive data on geology, product engineering, and other relevant factors to evaluate the criticality of twelve metals central to modern technology.  This will provide a comprehensive analytical framework for assessing the criticality of the specialty metals, as well as new guidance to product designers and industry and government managers and policy makers.  The results of this research are anticipated to be immediately employable critical materials information for sectors including corporate design engineers, international trade analysts, industry institutes, and the National Defense Stockpile Center.  Additionally, the research project will train a dozen young scientists and engineers in the assessment of the long-term sustainability of materials.</AbstractNarration>
