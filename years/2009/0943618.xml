<AbstractNarration>A request is made to provide funds to purchase equipment for the establishment of a Potential Fields Equipment Pool. It is intended that the Potential Fields Pool Equipment (PFPE) effort would continue as a long-term service to UNOLS ship operators. The equipment would include needed spare parts and related electronics needed to repair broken gyros on behalf of all UNOLS operators running BGM-3 gravimeters on their ships for academic research, as well as to purchase a portable magnetometer system that could be used by any UNOLS operator for marine magnetics surveying. The services and equipment includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Repairs to BGM-3 gyros       &lt;br/&gt;2) Acquisition of Lockheed-Martin spare BGM-3 electronics boards  $ &lt;br/&gt;3) Acquisition of 1 complete surface towed Marine Magnetics SeaSPY&lt;br/&gt;       magnetometer system &amp; winch (including shipping)   &lt;br/&gt;4) Gyro equipment cabinets, tools, shipping cases    &lt;br/&gt;5) Shipping and Telephone costs (yearly)     &lt;br/&gt;6) Recalibration of s/n210 BGM-3 sensor     &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal impact of the present proposal is under criterion two, providing infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition,  maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

This effort represents a continuation of several funded grants from NSFÆs-Oceanographic Instrumentation Program, which provided support for acquisition and refurbishment of the gravimeters (NSF-OCE 0705964).   Under this grant we provided key spare parts, real-time consultation support for troubleshooting, and repairs to various components of the gravimeters in order to better support their operation.

Acquisition of a Towed Magnetometer and Portable Winch: In discussions with various UNOLS operators and based on use demand, acquisition of a portable high precision marine magnetometer system was deemed as an important priority. A complete system, including a Marine Magnetics SeaSPY magnetometer and a portable winch, was purchased and is available through the WHOI-MISO facility as part of the PFPE inventory.
