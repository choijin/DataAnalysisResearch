    <AbstractNarration>Many genetic changes affect several different traits, and the same locus can have both benefits and costs, realized through its effects on different traits. This study combines molecular genetic and field experimental techniques to investigate the genetic and ecological basis of a flower color polymorphism in the Texas wildflower Phlox drummondii. Most P. drummondii have blue flowers caused by the production of anthocyanins, which are produced by a biochemical pathway that is common in plants. Anthocyanins, which are also produced throughout plants' vegetative tissue, are believed to have other effects, including defense against herbivores and protection from UV damage. White-flowered P. drummondii lack anthocyanin. This study will determine the genetic basis of the white flower color and investigate the environmental effects of anthocyanin levels that are related to traits other than flower color. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study has implications for understanding novel adaptation and the maintenance of biodiversity. The project will provide diverse research-based training for the graduate student CoPI and for undergraduate and high school students that the CoPI will mentor and train</AbstractNarration>
