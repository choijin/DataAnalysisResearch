<AbstractNarration>This research proposal consists of two related research thrusts, all centered around the common goal of an integrated treatment of statistical and computational issues.  The first research thrust concerns various issues associated with the use of structured regularization methods in high-dimensional inference.  Such types of regularization are natural in different settings, including estimation of structured covariance matrices, graphical model selection, and hierarchical data modeling.  The researchers propose to provide sharp characterizations of when structured regularization, with its typically higher computational costs, is guaranteed to yield improvements in statistical efficiency, or conversely, when structured regularization might impair statistical efficiency.  The second research thrust addresses the role of statistical stability in optimization, and the development of new methodology for choosing path length parameters in iterative algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Statistical inference problems of a high-dimensional nature---meaning where the number of observations n is similar to or even smaller than the number of parameters p---are ubiquitous throughout various areas of science and engineering, among them genomics, neuroscience, remote sensing, natural language processing, data compression, financial time series, and statistical signal processing.  As a concrete instances, consider the problem of estimating the structure of a social network consisting of a large number of individuals (p could be 10,000 or larger) based on a relatively small number of snapshots (n could be 100 to 1,000).  The overarching theme of the proposal is the development of new methodology and theory for high-dimensional data. Given the ubiquity of such data, such developments have the potential to impact a variety of fields making use of statistical modeling and tools, among them information technology (IT), neuroscience, remote sensing, and data compression.  Moreover, the proposal is inter-disciplinary in nature, and so has the potential to strengthen bridges between statisticians and researchers in other departments (e.g., computer science, electrical and civil engineering) also working on IT applications.  Via this type of intellectual unification, the proposed research is likely to have broader impact---much beyond any specific technical contributions---in terms of bridging different research communities, and providing broad training to graduate students and postdoctoral researchers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Various branches of science and engineering, including geosciences and  remote sensing, astrophysics, and social network analysis, involve the  analysis of high-dimensional data sets involving large numbers of  variables.  These high-dimensional data sets present a variety of new  challenges, both statistical and computational in nature, in that  classical methods can often break down badly, or be computationally  intractable to implement.  The main focus of this research project was  to develop novel methods for such settings, along with rigorous  mathematical analysis of their properties.    The outcomes of this project include the development and analysis of  various novel algorithms and methods for extracting useful information  from high-dimensional data sets.  Among other contributions, the PIs  developed novel methods for supervised learning problems in which the  features are embedded within a graph (e.g., gene expressions level in  a gene network; individual behavior within a social network).  They  also studied the convergence rates of simple first-order methods for  solving extremely large-scale optimization problems that arise in  statistics.  This line of work showed that the same structural  properties that guarantee good behavior of a statistical estimator can  also be used to certify that simple algorithms will converge very  quickly.  A related line of work involved applications of these  techniques in the analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging  (fMRI) of brain activity, and in particular in solving the inverse  problem of predicting visual stimuli from brain responses.  The PIs  also investigated various types of matrix decomposition problems, in  which the goal is to estimate a pair of two matrices, each possessing  some type of complementary low-dimensional structure.  Such matrix  decomposition problems arise in a variety of applications, including  the problem of dimensionality reduction (finding a lower-dimensional  space which describes the majority of the variance in a dataset) with  outliers, the problem of on-line recommender systems with adversarial  corruptions, and the problem of inferring graphical structures with  hidden variables.
