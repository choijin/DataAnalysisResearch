<AbstractNarration>THE WINNESHIEK LAGERSTÄTTE, STRATIGRAPHY AND DEPOSITIONAL ENVIRONMENTS OF THE LOWER PORTION OF THE ST. PETER SANDSTONE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Huaibao P. Lui, Robert M. McKay, and Brian Witzke&lt;br/&gt;Iowa Department of Natural Resources&lt;br/&gt;EAR-0921245&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Derek Briggs&lt;br/&gt;Yale University&lt;br/&gt;EAR-0922054&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;A remarkably preserved Middle Ordovician fossil fauna, the Winneshiek fauna, was recently discovered in a localized shale unit in the lower St. Peter Sandstone in northeast Iowa. Known from a single locality, the fauna displays exceptional fossil preservation, including soft tissues (a Konservat-Lagerstätte), and contains a variety of vertebrate and invertebrate fossils.  The fauna, preserved in finely laminated dark shale, was deposited in a previously unknown Ordovician environment within an isolated basin along the margin of the tropical Laurentian seaway.  There are few Ordovician Lagerstätten identified worldwide, and the Winneshiek fauna (the oldest known) has been recognized as one of the most important recent discoveries in Ordovician paleontology.  The preservation, archiving, and study of these exceptional fossils are needed to ensure the scientific and paleontologic heritage of this unique and significant discovery.  The fauna contains a variety of rare and poorly known taxa, including conodonts (many natural assemblages, some associated with soft-tissues), articulated jawless fish (among the rarest of Ordovician fossils), eurypterids and other chelicerates (among the oldest known), early phyllocarid crustaceans (many with soft-bodied preservation), ostracods, linguloid brachiopods, mollusks, and a variety of problematic organisms (especially ?worm-like? vermiforms).  The exceptional preservation of the fauna will enable detailed studies of the anatomy and phylogenetic relationships of several poorly known groups early in their evolutionary history, particularly within the arthropods (chelicerates, crustaceans) and vertebrates (conodonts and stem gnathostomes).  The funded research will study and describe the taxonomy and evolutionary relationships of the fauna, the sedimentology and taphonomy of the fossil occurrences, and the paleoenvironmental setting of this unique deposit.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project investigated a deposit containing exceptionally preserved fossils which occurs within an ancient meteorite crater near Decorah in northeast Iowa. The meteorite impact generated a circular depression about 5.6 km in diameter near the margin of a shallow sea that covered the mid-continent at that time. The fossils, and the crater that contains them, are Middle Ordovician in age, about 460 million-years-old. The impact crater was flooded by the sea and muddy sediments rich in organic material accumulated in very fine layers in the quiet oxygen-poor bottom waters, facilitating the remarkable preservation of the fossils. The deposit, known as the Winneshiek Shale, was excavated by temporarily damming an area along the margin of the Upper Iowa River. Careful splitting of the blocks of shale that were recovered yielded more than 5,000 fossil specimens, which are held in the University of Iowa Paleontology Repository. Because the impact crater was on the edge of an inland sea it was not colonized by a normal shelly marine fauna (corals, echinoderms, trilobites, for example, are absent). The fossils discovered from the Winneshiek Shale are dominated by extinct eel-like vertebrates known as conodonts: the tooth-like structures (known as elements) which made up their feeding apparatus are commonly preserved on the surface of the shale. The conodont elements in the Winneshiek Shale are some of the largest known, indicating that the total body length of the animals might have reached a meter. A second animal found in the deposit was probably even larger, a new sea-scorpion or eurypterid belong to a group called megalograptids which have spiny grasping limbs (and, like all eurypterids, are extinct). Many fragments of the skeleton of these eurypterids&nbsp;accumulated as the animals molted providing ample evidence for a reconstruction: extrapolation based on larger specimens indicates that some of the eurypterids&nbsp;may have been up to 1.7 meters long. This giant predator is the earliest eurypterid documented from the fossil record to date. Other arthropods in the Winneshiek Shale include a variety of smaller shrimp-like forms with a carapace of two valves, some of them, like the&nbsp;eurypterid, new to science. Rarer forms found in the deposit include microscopic spores, probably of algae, tiny shelled forms called brachiopods, and the external plates of a new ancient jawless fish.
