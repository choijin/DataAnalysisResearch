<AbstractNarration>High-energy gamma rays are used to study the most extreme objects in the Universe, such as pulsars, black holes at the center of active galaxies, and gamma-ray bursts. Cosmic gamma rays can also be signatures for new physics beyond the standard models of particle physics and cosmology. At the low end of the gamma-ray spectrum, the flux of gamma rays is sufficient to detect them with satellites in orbit above the atmosphere. Studies with very-high-energy (VHE) gamma rays, above about 100 GeV, require detectors with thousands of square meters of collection area, which can only be built on the ground. These ground-based devices detect gamma rays indirectly, by detecting the shower of secondary particles produced when a gamma ray interacts in the atmosphere. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will provide funds for the UCSC group to use the VERITAS (Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System) imaging Cherenkov telescope array in southern Arizona to study VHE gamma rays. They plan to explore the extreme behavior of the two most powerful known classes of gamma-ray source: gamma-ray bursts (GRB) and active galactic nuclei (AGN). The details of how GRBs work and the role they play in other high energy phenomena (for example, are they the accelerators of the highest energy cosmic rays?) are still being explored. Learning whether they are capable of creating VHE gamma rays in general, in particular circumstances, or not at all, will constrain GRB models and properties of the burst environment. Similarly, measurements of the VHE gamma-ray emission from AGN probe properties of the AGN jet, providing crucial information about the particles being accelerated and how the acceleration works. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work has wide-ranging broader impacts, particularly in the areas of education and technological infrastructure. Graduate and undergraduate students, including students from underrepresented groups, play an important part in the research effort. The researchers interact with the California State University to foster undergraduate interest in research and graduate education. They will work with their VERITAS collaborators to develop exhibits on gamma-ray astrophysics for use at science museums and observatory visitors' centers. There is an important interplay between the VERITAS data and data from other wavelengths, particularly X-ray and lower energy gamma-ray data from satellite missions such as Swift and Fermi. More can be learned from both types of data used together than from either alone.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Very-high-energy gamma rays from cosmic sources can be used to study some of the most extreme objects in the universe, such as active galaxies with massive black holes in the center, gamma-ray bursts from the explosive collapse of massive stars that have exhausted their fuel, and pulsars, which are rapidly spinning neutron stars with strong magnetic fields and with the mass of the Sun compressed into a sphere with radius about 10 km.  The research supported by this award has led to new insights about each of these types of object.  Among the broader impacts of the research are the improvement of the VERITAS gamma-ray telescopes for use in this and future research and the training of a number of developing scientists from diverse backgrounds.  Gamma rays with energy greater than 100 GeV, roughly a hundred billion times as energetic as optical light and ten million times as energetic as X-rays, are classified as very high energy (VHE).  When these gamma rays strike the EarthÆs atmosphere, the energy is converted into a cascade of lower energy particles which in turn produce a brief, faint flash of light as they move through the atmosphere.  The VERITAS system of four telescopes is designed to collect and focus this light onto specialized cameras capable of recording images 500 million times a second under night sky.  The images recorded by the cameras on the four telescopes are used to determine the energy and direction of incoming gamma rays, as well as to distinguish gamma rays from other types of cosmic rays, primarily protons.  Part of this research included studies for the design of improved, more sensitive cameras for the VERITAS telescopes and their installation in the summer of 2012.   The VERITAS telescopes, both before and after the installation of the improved cameras, were the primary tool used in this research to study VHE gamma rays from celestial objects.   A few of the key results are summarized in the following.  Observations of the Crab Pulsar revealed gamma-ray emission at energies higher than 100 GeV for the first time.  This result had not been expected in theoretical models of gamma-ray production by pulsars and has required a substantial re-thinking of those models for how pulsars work.  The bright gamma-ray burst discovered on April 27, 2013 (hence named GRB 130427A) was detected and studied across the electromagnetic spectrum.  However, observations with VERITAS starting about 20 hours after the burst (the earliest time after the burst that VERITAS could observe that part of the sky) did not find a gamma-ray signal, although at slightly lower energies the burst was strongly detected by the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on the Fermi satellite.  In many of the scenarios explaining the gamma-ray signal detected by the LAT, a corresponding signal is expected to be seen with VERITAS.  The absence of such a signal therefore reduces the number of viable explanations for how gamma-ray burst explosions develop and points the way towards the most promising models.  A number of active galaxies were studied as part of this research.  VHE gamma-ray emission was discovered from several of these, including the most distant source of VHE gamma rays known at the time (a more distant source has since been discovered).  The new data from this research provided more precise gamma-ray measurements of active galaxies compared to earlier studies, starting to reveal shortcomings in the simplest model which had successfully accounted for many earlier observations.  In this model, high energy electrons accelerated by the active galaxy emit X-rays, some of which collide with a second electron to get boosted in energy to the gamma-ray band.  There is increasing evidence that additional sources of X-rays, for example radiated from hot material accreting onto the black hole, are needed to explain the observations.  This project provided an opportunity for many developing scientists to get involved in research for the first time or to e...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
