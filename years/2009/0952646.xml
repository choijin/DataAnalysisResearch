<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project is to predict the aggregation kinetics of monoclonal-type antibodies, and to explore novel strategies to prolong antibody's shelf life. Antibody is important for disease treatment and medical diagnosis. Aggregation is a critical concern in antibody drug manufacturing, delivery, and storage. Because once aggregated, the unfolded antibodies will fail to recognize or bind antigens, which will reduce the drug efficacy and may cause harmful immune responses. To achieve the goal, the proposed research approaches are to: (a) identify the role of mobility of monoclonal antibodies in drug solutions, (b) predict the aggregation kinetics, and (c) provide a computational tool that can facilitate the antibody drug development. Models will be developed and validated against light scattering, spectroscopy, and rheological experiments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Availability of high quality, concentrated, yet low cost antibody drug has great economical and societal impacts. If successful, the project will enhance the antibody manufacturing and storage processes, which can save billions in healthcare costs and make the life-saving medicines broadly available especially in developing countries. The integrated research and education project will provide interdisciplinary training on nano-bio-mechanics for students in engineering and pharmaceutical science programs. Innovated modeling courses will be developed. The scientific materials will be demonstrated to high school teachers and K-12 students and will be made available to public using podcasting technology. Advanced results will also be disseminated in a scientific workshop.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project is to investigate the hydrodynamic mobility and interactions of protein particles in molecularly crowded solutions. The figures demonstrate the pair interaction of particles in polymer solutions with depletion effect, which plays an important role in many processes such as protein crystallization, aggregation, molecular crowding, self-assembly of colloidal particles, and food processing. The relevant dynamics and transport phenomena in colloid-polymer mixtures were investigated in details and studies were extended to various applications in precision property measurement of complex fluids. In the demonstrated case, a stochastic model that describes the correlated random motion of a pair of spherical colloids in non-adsorbing polymer solutions is presented. The pair interaction is affected by the thermal fluctuation, three-dimensional hydrodynamic interactions in inhomogeneous medium, and the entropic force owing to the polymer depletion effect. The mobility tensor is computed by the simplified two-layer model using the boundary integral method, which accounts for the momentum transport in the low viscosity layer around the colloids. The coupling of Brownian force is determined based on the computed mobility and the fluctuation-dissipation theory. Overall the attractive entropy force causes a reduction of cross-correlation and an increase of autocorrelation of the colloids. The result is compared with experimental data using optical tweezers, and represents an essential step for the ongoing dynamic simulation of many-particle behaviors in colloid-polymer mixtures. The broader impacts of this study have contributed to thermal fluid and soft matter sciences, applied mechanics, pharmaceutical sciences, and multidisciplinary education. On the education and outreach activities, seven graduate students have been trained and supported by this project, one PhD and four MS students graduated, one RET high school teacher and seven undergraduates (two REU, one minority and two woman) students were involved in the training and outreach activities. The major research activities and outcomes have been described in details in annual reports submitted to NSF.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 04/28/2016<br>      Modified by: Tai-Hsi&nbsp;Fan</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/0952646/0952646_10013088_1461882260442_Figure--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/0952646/0952646_10013088_1461882260442_Figure--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Interactions of two Brownian hard spheres in the presence of depletants"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/0952646/0952646_10013088_1461882260442_Figure--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Interactions of two Brownian hard spheres in the presence of depletants"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Decomposition of pair hydrodynamic interactions, showing the scaled velocity and flow patterns induced by the moving spheres corresponding to two parallel and two perpendicular modes with respect to the center-to-center line.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Mehdi Karzar-Jeddi and Tai-Hsi Fan</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Tai-Hsi&nbsp;Fan</div> <div class="imageTitle">Interactions of two Brownian hard spheres in the presence of depletants</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
