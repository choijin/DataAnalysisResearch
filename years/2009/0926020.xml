<AbstractNarration>The objectives of this research pertain to modeling the effects of various environmental factors on reliability of distribution feeders to identify parts of the system with high probability of failures and to provide comparative analysis of actual performance with expected performance. These models will include representation of the effects of lightning, wind, trees, and squirrels on outages in distribution feeders. Methodologies will be investigated to compare observed performance of the systems with expected performance based on selected models for performance benchmarking. The Westar Energy distribution system will serve as a test bed to validate the models and methodologies. Based on the research educational modules will be developed for inclusion in three courses. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merits of the proposal are: 1) innovative methodologies are presented for determining the effects of environmental factors on power distribution systems, 2) it is based on synthesis of two different disciplines within electrical and computer engineering to address an important problem, 3) it advances the frontier of knowledge in the field of reliability evaluation, 4) it proposes to tackle a real-life problem with significant relevance to society with collaboration of industry, 5) the proposed methodology can be applied to other components of distribution systems as well as other engineering systems, and 6) a well organized plan of activities is proposed for the project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the proposal are: 1) participation of students from underrepresented groups, 2) education and research training of all the participating students, 4) enhancement of the research infrastructure through collaboration between university and industry, 5) dissemination of the results through professional journals and also web sites to reach broader audience, 6) integration of the research results into courses, 7) advancement of the state of the knowledge in distribution reliability analysis, and 8) higher levels of reliability of electricity supply for the customers, which will increase productivity and satisfaction. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Any interruption, momentary or sustained in electricity supply, results in great inconvenience and financial loss.  Since a large part of the distribution system in the US is overhead, it is susceptible to outages caused by environmental factors such as lightning, wind, trees, and animals.  Knowledge on correlation of these factors to outages in the system allows utilities to benchmark the system relaibility and plan improvements.  Various regression models and machine learning models were  investigated in this project to study effects of lightning, wind, trees, and  squirrels on outages in distribution systems of four districts in Kansas.  The regression models included linear, quadratic and  exponential models, and the machnine learning models included neural  network.  Two different Ababoost and an annealed mixture of  experts (AME) were the ensemble-based machine learning approaches implemented for the  analysis.  The  study period for lightning, wind, and tree effects was from 2005 to  2011, but for squirrel effects it  was from 1998 to 2007.   Aggregated  daily lightning stokes and the maximum five-second gust, or one-minute  sustained wind for days with no recorded gust, were considered as the  input for the models.  The total outages on each day in the system  caused by lightning, wind, and trees were the outputs.  For analyzing the effects of squirrels, the  data was aggregated on a weeky basis.  Number of fair weather days in  each week and the number of outages during the week were used as inputs.  This was done to compare our models with previous models which used the same approach for data processing. The duration of study for  squirrel outages is different from lightning and wind outages because we  wanted the study duration to coincide with the previously used  duration.  A comparison of the results showed that the AME model performed the best in all the districts for outages caused by lightning and wind.   This was followed by Ababoost, neural network, regression in order of  performance. Similarly, for squirrel-related outages AME  provided the best results, which was followed by Adaboost and neural  network in order.  Regression was not used for squirrel outages.   In this project, innovative methodologies based on synthesis of two different disciplines within electrical and computer engineering were investigated to anlyze the effects of environmental factors on power distribution systems.   The analysis was conducted with real data provided by a utility.   The outcomes of this project advance the frontier of knowledge for reliability evaluation of electricity distribution systems.  A woman graduate student worked on the project and completed the Ph. D. degree.  Several papers based on the rersearch have been presented and published.  The graduate student was provided opportunities to attend conferences to present the research.  This resulted in significant professional development for the student. Material related to this research was included in  classes on electricity distribution system and on machine learning.  Selected list of publications for additional information:  P. Kankanala, S.
