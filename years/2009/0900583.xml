    <AbstractNarration>Abstract &lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to provide viable solutions to major bottleneck issues in nano manufacturing, including, i) precise placement of nanomaterials/devices in high enough densities, and ii) convenient high-throughput fabrications. The approach is to introduce new concepts and techniques involving massively parallel, electron-beam-emitting nano probes for large area, simultaneous nano patterning. An array of extremely fine, scanning probe tips with sub-10 nm dimension and identical heights will be fabricated using silicon fabrication, carbon nanotubes, and related materials and processes. The principles and materials behavior involved in the nanofabrication processing steps as well as underlying phenomena during localized electron field emission from extremely small probe tips will be investigated. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the proposed research on the 10 nm regime nano manufacturing science and technology include scientific understanding and novel conceptual advances. The successful outcome of this research will allow fabrication of a variety of ultra-high-density nanofeatured structures for nanoelectronics, nanophotonics, nanomagnetics, and nano-bio devices. More importantly, high throughput processing of precisely placed, ultra-high-density materials and devices will enable wider use of nanotechnology for electronics and other applications. The ultimate aim is to enable broader industrial utilization in areas such as advanced displays, sensor array technologies, telecommunications systems, information storage memory systems, and medical therapeutics. The research outcome will be leveraged to enhance education in nano-science and technology.</AbstractNarration>
