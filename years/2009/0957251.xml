<AbstractNarration>The Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program of the Division of Chemistry supports the research efforts of Professor Pradip K. Mascharak of the University of California Santa Cruz in studying metal nitrosyl complexes as exogenous NO donors that are activated with light.  Such photoactive nitrosyl complexes are employed to deliver NO to chemical, biological and cellular targets on demand.  Density functional theory (DFT) and TD-DFT calculations are used in the smart design of metal (Fe, Mn, and Ru) nitrosyls.  These computational techniques are used to fine tune the ligand design so that the complexes are sensitive to near infrared light (which is better for photodynamic therapy).  The nitrosyl-dye conjugates are used as "trackable NO donors" in tracing NO delivery in cellular targets (malignant sites) and monitoring NO-induced apoptosis (programmed cell death).  In order to make the various nitrosyls suitable for site-specific delivery of NO, the group incorporates the metal complexes into different polymer matrices.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nitric oxide (NO) is recognized as a key mediator in a variety of physiological and pathological pathways such as blood pressure regulation, immune response, neurotransmission, and cellular apoptosis.  Typical systemic NO drugs (such as glyceryl trinitrate) cannot be used for site-specific NO delivery because of the inexorability of NO release from NO donors.  The drug goes everywhere in the body and NO is released via various enzymatic and non-enzymatic (such as pH and temperature) pathways.  Light, on the other hand, can control NO release from proper NO donors in a cellular environment.  This research project provides insight into the design and synthesis of metal complexes that release NO in response to specific stimuli (light).  This goal-oriented project provides an excellent opportunity for graduate and undergraduate students to participate in research at the interface of chemistry and biology.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Research during past few decades has revealed that surprisingly unusual (and toxic) molecules like nitric oxide (NO) and carbon monoxide (CO) play critical roles as signaling molecules in various biological pathways. Exploration of the physiology and pathology of NO entered its accelerated phase in 1987 when the so-called &ldquo;endothelium derived relaxation factor&rdquo; was identified as NO. Research in the following years led to the discovery of the roles of NO in blood pressure regulation, innate immune response during pathogen invasion and chronic infection, neurotransmission, and cellular apoptosis. In mammals, endogenous NO (produced from arginine by the enzyme nitric oxide synthase) participates in these pathways and the outcome depends on the concentration of NO (at nanomolar to micromolar levels). The desire to modulate NO concentrations at biological targets via delivery of exogenous NO has inspired research in the area of designed molecules that release NO on demand (NO donors). NO donors like glycerin trinitrate, nitrosothiols, and N-diazeniumdiolates (NONOates) afford NO upon exposure to heat, oxidants or thiols and in some cases via enzymatic reactions. Although a few of these <em>systemic</em> drugs have found wide use in hospitals, lack of control on NO release often forbids use of these NO donors for specific purposes such as <em>selective destruction</em> of infected or malignant sites via higher concentrations of NO. In order to avoid this problem, we synthesized designed photoactive metal nitrosyls (NO complexes of transition metals) to deliver NO at selected sites through the control of light exposure. Our design has been based on specific chemical principles in addition to results of theoretical calculations.
