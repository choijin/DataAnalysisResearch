<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: This research focuses on two key social factors that are important predictors of women's math performance: negative stereotypes about women's math abilities and perspectives on the nature of math ability as being either a fixed trait or a developable skill.  The researchers are particularly interested in how a sense of belonging (SOB)--feeling like an accepted member of an academic community whose contributions are valued--can buffer women against the negative impacts of negative stereotypes or fixed concepts of math ability.  The PIs will conduct a series of four studies designed to test hypotheses about how SOB emerges from various sources: a) experiencing high achievement; b) having friends in the domain; or c) exerting high effort.  The PIs predict that effort-based sense of belonging will mitigate gender differences in math achievement, aspirations and learning, particularly those due to stereotype threat and fixed-ability learning environments.  Hypotheses will be tested by experimentally manipulating both SOB and either stereotype threat or theories of intelligence and data will be analyzed through ANOVAs on math achievement, math aspirations, course-taking behaviors, and math learning. The study will involve both college freshmen and middle school students as they transition to high school. Research sites include Baruch College and middle schools in Montclair, NJ.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The proposed research addresses two key moments in students' educational lives--transitions to high school and college. Educational experiences at these points lay the foundation for future interest in STEM domains, and thus influence decisions about future career paths. If findings support the notion that effort-based sense of belonging decreases the effects of stereotype threat and messages of fixed ability for females, then fostering effort-based sense of belonging may address pipeline issues for women in STEM fields and redress the persistent gender gaps in these domains. Specifically, educators who emphasize effort (rather than high achievement) as a key determination in students' belongingness in STEM may help eliminate the culture of "talent" and the mentality of the "weed-out system" that pervades many STEM classrooms and that can undermine women's STEM outcomes. Specifically, environments that foster a culture in which anyone who develops their skills through effort and engagement is considered a member of the community may encourage many more females to pursue STEM degrees. In addition, the methods of increasing SOB are easily implemented in any classroom setting. Although this study focuses specifically on sex differences in math outcomes, the findings may apply to any STEM discipline and to members of any group who face negative stereotypes and messages of limited ability, such as Black and Latino Americans.</AbstractNarration>

Specifically, the project focused on a key factor driving womenÆs STEM outcomes: their sense of belonging to these fields of study (Good, Rattan, &amp; Dweck, 2012).   Sense of belonging to math&mdash;oneÆs feelings of membership and acceptance in math&mdash;is an important factor in the representation and achievement gap between males and females (Good, et al., 2012).

The current project addresses these questions by studying the foundations upon which sense of belonging to an academic domain may be based&mdash;such as instances when students demonstrate high ability versus fully engage with their studies in the domain&mdash;and the differential outcomes that these various foundations of belonging may engender. Furthermore, this work extends past findings that sense of belonging mediates the effects of negative stereotypes (Good, et al, 2012) by determining which foundation of belonging best protects against the negative impact of stereotypes on learning engagement and learning outcomes.   Across multiple studies, this project 1) validated a new measure of contingencies of belonging, 2) investigated the effects of negative stereotypes on math learning engagement and math learning, and 3) investigated whether the negative impact of stereotypes could be attenuated by fostering either an ability-based or effort-based sense of belonging.    We first developed the new Contingencies of Belonging scale to measure the extent to which students base their feelings of belonging in math on their achievement or their effort and engagement.  Importantly, we found that effort-based sense of belonging predicted femalesÆ intrinsic motivation to pursue math in the future, and as such, is a new and important construct that can contribute to femalesÆ representation in STEM fields.

We then used the math tutor in an experimental design to test whether a) negative stereotypes can disrupt learning engagement and learning outcomes and b) whether contingencies of belonging can be transformed into an actionable intervention to reduce gender gaps in math learning.  The results showed for the first time that negative stereotypes undermine femalesÆ math learning engagement and math learning. Specifically, when ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
