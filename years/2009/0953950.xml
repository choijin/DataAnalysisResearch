<AbstractNarration>The long-term research goal is to develop novel data mining&lt;br/&gt;technologies to elucidate the structures and dynamics of complex&lt;br/&gt;but ubiquitous networks. A  complex network is a large system&lt;br/&gt;of elements (vertices) that are joined by non-trivial relationships&lt;br/&gt;(edges). Examples of such complex networks include the WWW,&lt;br/&gt;metabolic and protein networks, social networks, and economic&lt;br/&gt;and financial markets. The underlying principles and laws of these&lt;br/&gt;network systems can help us construct more effective&lt;br/&gt;communication mechanisms, find cures for fatal diseases, and&lt;br/&gt;deal with economic crises.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In spite of the significant advances that have been made towards&lt;br/&gt;understanding the fundamental laws that govern the structure and&lt;br/&gt;behavior of complex networks, there is still a disconnect between&lt;br/&gt; current analytical techniques and their applicability to real-world&lt;br/&gt;complex networks. A principled approach is lacking to systematically&lt;br/&gt;analyze a single large complex network and link system behaviors to&lt;br/&gt; network structure. There is also immediate and crucial need for a&lt;br/&gt;theoretical framework to understand the relationships between&lt;br/&gt;multiple networks, which is the key for comparative network analysis. &lt;br/&gt;How to integrate and leverage the rich system data, such as&lt;br/&gt;measurement time series, associated with network topology to study&lt;br/&gt;complex systems is still an open question. This project addresses&lt;br/&gt;these issues by:  1) developing novel graph and information&lt;br/&gt;theoretical approaches to extracting network backbones which both&lt;br/&gt;simplify and highlight network structures; 2) developing information&lt;br/&gt;theoretical network distance measures and clustering algorithms for&lt;br/&gt;comparative network analysis; 3) applying causality inference and&lt;br/&gt;network modularity to integrate time series with network topology.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed mining methodologies build upon an innovative blend&lt;br/&gt;of graph theoretical, information theoretical, and statistical learning&lt;br/&gt;concepts and techniques, and can greatly expand the reach of&lt;br/&gt;data mining. This project will also help us better analyze the&lt;br/&gt;emerging complexity, heterogeneity, and large scale of real-world&lt;br/&gt;complex network data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a close collaboration with domain experts from social and political&lt;br/&gt;sciences, software engineering, and bioinformatics, the proposed&lt;br/&gt;techniques have the potential to help understand how human society is&lt;br/&gt;organized at the individual level (social networks) and organizational&lt;br/&gt;level (political science); illuminate how large scale software systems&lt;br/&gt;form and evolve; reveal the organizational principles of biocellular&lt;br/&gt;systems in a dynamic environment; and identify therapeutic or drug&lt;br/&gt;targets. Using the popular online social networks, such as MySpace&lt;br/&gt;and Facebook, as ``hooks'', this project will attract, recruit, and&lt;br/&gt;prepare students from underrepresented groups including women&lt;br/&gt;and minorities to computer science and involve underrepresented&lt;br/&gt;students in the cutting-edge research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For further information see the project web page at:&lt;br/&gt;http://www.cs.kent.edu/~jin/NSFCAREER/</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The outcome of this CAREER grant can be described in three folds:     The research carried out in this grant has produced a number of important results for complex network analysis, data mining and graph databases:  Inspired by network backbone structure, we have developed novel algorithms to discover backbones and utilize it for reachability and distance computation;  We have formalized the first axiomatic role-similar measure which effectively model how two vertices are similar in terms of their roles in a network;  We have studied dense component/local communities in a list of unique settings, such as in uncertain graphs, in dual-network, and thoroughly investigated the free-rider effect in a single network setting.  We have developed novel machine learning approaches, such as a joint personal and social latent factor (PSLF) model, dynamic Gaussian Process model, to model social network, user behavior data, and activity data for recommendation and human-behavior modeling in social network setting.    These research has helped laid out foundation and provided insights into how to discover and leverage network structure, such as backbone, for basic graph queries, how to model role similarity, shed lights into dense component and local network structure in complex network setting, and develop novel modeling approaches to understand how network structures support the diverse and even intelligence behavior of complex systems, such human activity and preferences.  Further, the research results obtained in this project can potentially impact disciplines and fields, such as bioinformatics, e-commerce, social science, and even transportation beyond computer science.  Those research results have been published or accepted in 30 research papers at the top database and data mining conferences and journals: (conferences): 6 SIGMOD, 6 PVLDB, 3 KDD, 4 ICDM, 1 ICDE, 2 CIKM, (journals): 1 AAAI, 2 TKDD, 1 TODS, 1 VLDB J, 1 TKDE, 1 Machine Learning, 1 DMKD, 1 KAIS.    This research grant has helped train and produce four Ph.D.s, four Master students, and has involved 4 undergraduate students and 2 high school students. I have developed three new courses, which covered some of the research results produced in this research grants. Finally, I have given more than a dozen presentations and invited talks in conferences, workshops or at other research institutes.
