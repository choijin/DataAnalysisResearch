<AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though perhaps unfortunate, as a practical matter software is often&lt;br/&gt;built with functionality as a primary goal, and security features are&lt;br/&gt;only added later, often after vulnerabilities have been identified.&lt;br/&gt;To reduce the cost and increase assurance in the process of security&lt;br/&gt;retrofitting, the aim to develop a methodology involving automated and&lt;br/&gt;semi-automated tools and techniques to add authorization policy&lt;br/&gt;enforcement functionality to legacy software systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main insight is that major portions of the tasks involved in&lt;br/&gt;retrofitting code can be or already have been automated, so the design&lt;br/&gt;process focuses on enabling further automation and aggregating these&lt;br/&gt;tasks into a single, coherent approach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More specifically, techniques and tools are being developed to: (1)&lt;br/&gt;identify and label security-relevant objects and I/O channels by&lt;br/&gt;analyzing and instrumenting annotated application source code; (2)&lt;br/&gt;insert code to mediate access to labeled entities; (3) abstract the&lt;br/&gt;inserted checks into policy-relevant, security-sensitive operations&lt;br/&gt;that are authorized (or denied) by the application's security policy;&lt;br/&gt;(4) integrate the retrofitted legacy code with the site's specific&lt;br/&gt;policy at deployment time to ensure, through advanced policy analysis,&lt;br/&gt;that the application enforces that site's policy correctly, and (5)&lt;br/&gt;verify correct enforcement of OS policy delegation by the retrofitted&lt;br/&gt;application.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The techniques and tools being developed are useful not only&lt;br/&gt;for retrofitting, but also for augmenting and verifying existing code&lt;br/&gt;already outfitted with security functionality; hence improving the&lt;br/&gt;state-of-the-art in creating more secure software.</AbstractNarration>
