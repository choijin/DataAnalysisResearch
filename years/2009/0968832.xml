<AbstractNarration>The objective of this project is to support increased participation of US graduate students, postdoctoral associates and junior tenure-track faculty members at the 9th International Workshop on Micro and Nanotechnology for Power Generation and Energy Conversion Applications. This workshop provides a highly interactive forum for researchers to present and discuss recent innovations in micro and nanotechnology for power generation and energy conversion applications. The scope ranges from integrated microsystems for power generation, dissipation, harvesting, and management to novel nanostructures and materials for energy-related applications. The support provided through this project serves to defray the costs for junior researchers (students, postdocs, and junior faculty members) to attend the workshop to present their work and learn more about the economically and environmentally vital field of high power microsystems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Attending meetings to present their work and learn more about the broader context of their field is a key educational experience for students and postdocs everywhere, and indeed for junior faculty.  These new researchers are also the future of this field, and the interdisciplinary connections fostered by this workshop are the basis for the field's future progress.  Without travel support, students, postdocs and new faculty are less likely to be able to attend this workshop and take advantage of this educational opportunity, and travel support may encourage many to attend.  To encourage increased and diverse participation, news of the workshop has been disseminated broadly through print media, web presence, direct emails to past participants, and direct outreach to interested individuals and groups, including underrepresented minorities and women.</AbstractNarration>
