<AbstractNarration>"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5)" &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this MRI-R2 project is to add device fabrication capabilities to the South Dakota School of Mines &amp; Technology campus for organic electronics and energy-related nanoscience research and education. The approach is the acquisition of a thin-film deposition glovebox system, which will be the principal instrument for material synthesis and device fabrication in organic electronic and photovoltaic research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The requested thin-film deposition system and accessories will provide infrastructure for researchers to conduct cutting-edge research projects in the area of organic electronics and energy-related nanoscience. The system will enable researchers to fabricate devices such as organic transistors, hybrid or dye-sensitized solar cells, plasmonic material based nanophotonics, and sensors. With the fabrication capabilities of the system, collaborative efforts from students and faculty across different disciplines will reveal new scientific insights in the field of electronic and photovoltaic materials and devices, and lead to development of innovative device structures and technologies for future organic electronics and solar cells.</AbstractNarration>
