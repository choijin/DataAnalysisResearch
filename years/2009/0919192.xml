<AbstractNarration>Aphids are a large group of phloem-feeding insects that cause extensive damage to plants and vector important viruses.  However, our understanding of plant defense against aphids is limited.  The interaction between Arabidopsis thaliana and Myzus persicae, commonly known as green peach aphid (GPA), has uncovered a role for the Arabidopsis TPS11 gene, which exhibits homology to trehalose metabolism genes, in plant defense against aphids.  The goal of this project is to characterize the involvement of TPS11 in trehalose metabolism, and the role of trehalose metabolism in plant defense against aphids.  A combination of biochemical, molecular, genetic and genomic tools combined with insect bioassays and behavioral studies will be utilized to accomplish these goals. Since trehalose and its metabolites are present at low levels in plants, it is anticipated that this study will uncover a regulatory function of trehalose metabolism in plants.  The proposed activity will enhance understanding of plant defense against GPA, which is a pest of &gt;50 plant families and vectors several important viruses.  In addition, it will fill important gaps in our knowledge of trehalose metabolism and its involvement in plant stress response.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  This project will benefit a graduate student and a post-doctoral fellow who will receive training in biochemistry, molecular biology and genetics.  In addition, through the PI's instructional activities this project will bring current knowledge of plant signaling, carbohydrate metabolism and stress response into the classroom.  This project will also provide an opportunity to train undergraduates and high school students and broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in research.  Results from this project will also have potential benefits to society at large, because they will identify steps in plant metabolism that mediate defense against insects.  In the future, manipulation of these steps may augment aphid resistance and enhance quality and productivity of plants.</AbstractNarration>
