<AbstractNarration>In this NSF CAREER award, Dr. Kim will examine the academic and socio-emotional development of language brokers (i.e., children who act as translators for their parents), in Mexican immigrant families.  Close to 90% of children in immigrant families perform a language brokering function in their family's resettlement process, taking on the task of translating between the heritage language and English for parents with limited English-speaking skills.  However, scholars have thus far paid little attention to the developmental consequences of being a language broker.  This project on Mexican American families will explore the language brokering experience from multiple perspectives (target child, mother, father).  The goal is to illuminate how language brokering impacts parent-child relationships and, more importantly, how it affects children's adjustment in terms of both academic and socio-emotional outcomes.  Three hundred fifty Mexican American families will be recruited for the project, from schools with a wide range of Latinos in the student population. The study has three research aims: 1) to understand how child language brokering affects parent-child relationships, including any differential effects for mothers and fathers; 2) to investigate how parent-child relationships may be linked to child adjustment in terms of both socio-emotional development and academic outcomes; and 3) to explore how adolescent gender and schools'/neighborhoods' density of Mexican immigrants may influence aims 1 and 2.  This project has the potential to bring to light the effects language brokering may have on the adjustment of the children of Mexican immigrants, the largest and fastest growing minority group in the United States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will examine developmental outcomes for children of Mexican immigrants, a high-risk population with high rates of poverty and low levels of educational attainment. The project aims to understand the mechanisms involved in improving the academic performance of children of immigrants, a growing and significant percentage of America's children, who represent the future of the U.S. workforce.  It also focuses on the developmental period of adolescence, a period of transition in which children are susceptible to developing socio-emotional problems that can compromise school performance.  This research has the potential to identify risk factors that can be used to inform future preventive intervention work with children of immigrants.  Finally, this project will train undergraduate and graduate students who have been traditionally under-represented in the sciences, particularly those of Mexican origin; deliver a curriculum to educate students about the role of immigration, ethnicity, and race in informing child development; and provide workshops, training sessions, and newsletters to educators on the role of language brokering in children's academic functioning.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Su Yeong Kim, Principal Investigator CAREER: Language Brokering and Child Adjustment in Mexican American Children   Children in immigrant families may surpass their parents? English skills and knowledge of the host culture. Known as language brokers, these English-fluent children in immigrant families often function as interpreters and intermediaries between their more English-limited parents and the U.S. institutions with which they must interact.   Development of Language Brokering Experiences Measures   This project developed one of the first rigorously-tested language brokering scales to assess multiple dimensions of language brokering experiences. We also conducted the first study on longitudinal measurement invariance of subjective language brokering experiences in Mexican-American adolescent language brokers (Kim, Hou, Shen, &amp; Zhang, 2017).

These assessment tools also represent a critical first step in demonstrating that it is not simply the frequency of language brokering, but rather the subjective appraisal of the language brokering experience, that impacts adolescent outcomes.   Variation in Subjective Language Brokering Experiences and Depressive Symptoms   One longstanding and perplexing issue in the literature on language brokering has been the mixed findings on the consequences of brokering, with studies showing that more frequent language brokering can relate to both positive and negative child outcomes. To untangle this issue, we proposed that it is important to recognize how subjective experiences of language brokering may combine with personal attributes and the quality of parent-child relationships to influence adolescent outcomes. We have found that both detrimental and beneficial effects &ndash; a sense of burden from language brokering relating to more depressive symptoms, and feelings of efficacy from language brokering relating to lower depressive symptoms &ndash; are most apparent in high-risk adolescents, or in other words, adolescents with a low sense of resilience and a high level of alienation from parents (Kim, Hou, &amp; Gonzalez, 2017: Child Development). Language-brokering adolescents most at risk are therefore more likely to be amenable to change from interventions.     Broader Impacts  Reports of our study findings have been presented to educators at the middle schools where data was originally collected with an enthusiastic response.
