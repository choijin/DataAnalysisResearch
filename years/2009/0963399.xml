<AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will renovate the campus network infrastructure and the wide-area network connection at the University of Delaware.  This includes adding a second external connection point to the campus network, improving external network capacity, providing higher-bandwidth connectivity, providing the capability to use dynamic network circuits, and upgrading campus network devices to enable the ability to provide multiple 10-Gbp/s connections from research centers and groups to the campus backbone.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The renovation will enhance research in a number of fields of research pursued at the University of Delaware, including: astronomy and space physics, catalysis and energy research, critical zone studies in oceanography and marine biology, bioinformatics, genomics, protein modeling, and computer science research on networks.  Examples of specific projects that will be affected include: the analysis of data from the Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System (VERITAS) that scans the night sky for remnants of exploded stars, distant active galaxies, powerful gamma-ray bursts, and evidence of dark matter particles; conducting cosmic ray science using the IceCube neutrino detector; archiving,  analysis and visualization of the output from hydrodynamic and magnetohydrodynamic turbulence simulations; studies of hydrological and coastal resources, wetlands, and land resources using data from remote sensing platforms; studies of deep-water convection in the North-Atlantic Ocean; multiscale modeling of nanomaterials to help develop innovative catalytic technologies for efficient conversion of biomass into chemicals, electricity, and fuels; network performance in distributed computing; future support of the Protein Information Resource, a public bioinformatics resource that supports genomic, proteomic and systems biology research and scientific studies; the use of remote supercomputing facilities for bioinformatics research; and research in plant functional genomics in collaboration with partners in other north-eastern EPSCoR states.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to providing infrastructure for research, the renovation will enhance access to dynamic network and computing resources for graduate research training and education.  Research seminars and technical courses feature projects that make use of computing resources. The network renovation will allow such users to exploit the current trends of virtualization so that computing work is no longer tied to a particular lab or group of systems.  The University will use the enhanced network connectivity to make its computational and network resources available, for education and research, to other four- and two-year colleges in Delaware.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  CITADel - CyberInfrastructure Technology Advancement for Delaware  This project upgraded the wide area network, computing centers networking,and campus network at the University of Delaware (UD). In so doing, it addressed a central purpose of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, "To provide investments needed to increase economic efficiency by spurring technological advances in science and health."  The wide area network received a fourfold capacity upgrade by installing wave-division multiplexing network equipment. This network is a fiber-optic ring connecting UD in Newark, the State of Delaware backbone in Wilmington and internet service providers . It serves UDÆs campuses, Delaware State University and the A.I. duPont Institute and Hospital, among other institutions.  The upgrade includes improved Internet2 connectivity.  Computing centers at UD contain supercomputing clusters with approximately 10,000 processing nodes, in aggregate. The intra-center switching was upgraded and the inter-center link given a fourfold increase in capacity.  To work with these facilities, researchers need good access from their work- sites to their computing clusters in numerous locations. This requires high bandwidth connections to the campus computing centers and the national network. Network links to key science and engineering buildings have been given a tenfold increase in capacity.  Research activities that benefit from this network infrastructure upgrade include:  Sustainable remote sensing infrastructure for critical zone studies, including remote sensing of hydrological and coastal resources, of wetlands, and of land resources.   A satellite receiving station for the Center for Remote Sensing that captures real-time land and sea temperature measures, ocean color, and a variety of atmospheric measures, which are fed into models at campus computing clusters allowing quick response and dissemination.   Integrating satellite based bioinformatic water mass and biome classifica- tion algorithms with high resolution, subsurface glider, autonomous underwater vehicles and ARGO data, advance global biome characterization and regional water mass characterization.   Altimetry studies of deep-water convection in the North-Atlantic Ocean.   Models that predict the path of drifting sensors in the ocean.   Innovative catalytic technologies for efficient conversion of biomass into chemicals, electricity, and fuels.   Novel models for describing molecular recognition processes. Development of new pharmaceuticals targeted against diseases like HIV and AlzheimerÆs requires evaluation of millions of candidate molecules (ligands) that bind with proteins to turn protein functions on and off.    Exact linear algebra computation. LinBox, an open source softwarelibrary (at linalg.org), is applicable to a wide range of research and educational  processes involving matrices and linear operators. A petabyte-scale matrix computation is enabled by this network capacity.   Genome sequencing and functional annotation of the Little Skate, Leucoraja erinacea, and a study of metagenomics of algal blooms, within the five-state Northeast Cyberinfrastructure Consortium (NECC), which includes Delaware, New Hampshire, Maine, Rhode Island and Vermont.  The sequencing and annotation data are stored in a regional database center at UD's Center for Bioinformatics and Computational Biology and are worked on remotely the Northeast Bioinformatics Collaborative (NEBC), comprised of key bioinformatics experts in the NECC.    The iProXpress bioinformatics framework, provides a functional annota- tion pipeline, allowing users to couple literature mining with the analysis of the sequence, structure, function and evolutionary relationships of com- plete genomes in the pathway, network, and systems biology context.   Bioinformatics and plant functional genomics.   The intellectual merit of this project is that it facilitates research in the above-mentioned areas. Broader i...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
