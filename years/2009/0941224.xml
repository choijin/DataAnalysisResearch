<AbstractNarration>The goal of the project, which builds on prior NSF support, is to develop haptics-augmented software activities and Internet-based tutorials and to integrat these tools into undergraduate statics and dynamics engineering courses.  Specifically the investigators are (1) developing a full suite of haptics-augmented statics and dynamics activities to complement standard textbooks; (2) evaluating these products in two large engineering schools; (3) developing curricula that integrates these products into statics and dynamics courses; (4) applying educational pedagogy research for experiential inquiry-based learning and implementing a learner-based hypothesis generation and testing procedure to encourage learners to translate tactile responses to their real world causes; and (5) using a design research approach in the evaluation process to make it an integral part of the development process.  They are working to commercialize a unique CD-based set of software activities and tutorials that will enable students to change parameters, predict answers, interact with animations, and feel the results through the haptic device.  The evaluation effort, under the direction of an experienced, independent evaluator, is examining student work captured on video along with student surveys and focus groups to monitor student learning. The broader impacts will include the dissemination of their products and results, particularly through commercialization and linking the material to successful textbooks.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our primary finding is that haptic-augmentation can be a significant motivational element in learning engineering physics content. Although, our empirical data did not reveal an increase in learning on a variety of measures we have attributed that to the relatively high experience level of our studyÃ†s participants. We believe that novice engineering students may benefit from the concreteness of our approach. More importantly we believe that middle-school aged students, the age group when many youths will decide to pursue engineering careers, would benefit from the haptic-augmented feedback system we created.     Our software focuses on principles of statics and dynamics. However, we believe the materials are easily extendable to physics in all its manifestations in the curriculum, in any topics in which forces are central.     This project required the development of a unique skill set.  Our team now has the capability to integrate haptic feedback devices with a visual presentation/simulation system.   This project has supported the development of physical plant and institutional support to perform haptics-augmented engineering education developments and evaluations.   Success in this project has encouraged us to pursue commercialization with the institutional help of the Ohio University Technology Transfer Office and Voinovich School.  D.R. Moore, R.L.
