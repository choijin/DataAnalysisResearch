<AbstractNarration>With technology scaling and increasing integration density in the nanometer technology regime, design considerations for yield and reliability have become critical. The objective of this collaborative research is to explore low-overhead formal design methodology with distributed micro-scale sensor network and systematic feedback control to achieve auto-curing of digital, analog and mixed-signal electronic systems under large process and temporal variations. Such auto-curing approaches will play a key role in preventing yield loss for nanoscale designs, while ensuring reliability of operation and low power dissipation. The research investigates self-curing concepts/techniques for logic circuits, digital signal processing (DSP) units, embedded memory and analog components using appropriate variation sensing and compensation techniques to achieve high yield with optimal power/die-area overhead. It also explores system-level self-curing approaches using global parameter sensor and global controller to determine optimal compensation of mixed-signal cores under power constraint. To realize the curing methodologies in an automatic synthesis environment, the research will aim at developing appropriate Computer-Aided Design tools and a library of self-correcting mixed-signal cores. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, it will help the semiconductor industry deliver complex nanoelectronic systems with high reliability, low power and high yield. The proposed research will integrate education and training through course development, summer research program for undergraduates, and senior project design.</AbstractNarration>

The major intellectual contributions of the project are described next in details.   (1) System-level Healing Approach:  We have observed the effect of post-silicon process compensation or 'healing' of integrated circuits (ICs) to improve yield and reliability under parameter variations. In a SoC comprising of multiple cores, different cores can experience different process shift due to local variations. We have developed an efficient system-level healing solution using a priori design-time information about the relative sensitivities of the cores to system performance and power.

Fig 1(a) shows the block diagram for the main components of an example mixed-signal self-healing SoC used for image compression and Fig. 1(b) shows an example local sensor and control knob for the memory core.  (2) Variation Resilience through Operand Truncation:  We have developed a novel healing approach, as shown in Fig. 2, and associated algorithm, referred as VaROT that provides a novel, low-overhead approach for post-silicon healing of delay failures. It exploits the fact that in typical DSP datapath modules (such as adder, multiply-and-accumulate units), critical timing paths originate from the least significant bits (LSBs) and they can be shortened by truncating the LSBs &ndash; i.e. setting constant values e.g. "0" to these bits. Truncating the input bits, however, affects the output quality but it is found that in common DSP applications, truncating the least significant input bits lead to minimum loss in output quality of service (QoS). It provides a low-overhead approach to healing DSP systems to improve yield under parameter variations.  (3) Adaptive error correction for run-time failure tolerance:  Post-silicon healing techniques that rely on built-in redundancy are not effective in improving robustness under various run-time failures in memory circuits. Traditionally, a uniform worst-case protection using Error Correction Code (ECC) is used for all blocks in a large memory array for runt-time error resiliency. However, with both spatial and temporal shift in intrinsic reliability of a memory block, such uniform protection can be unattractive in terms of either ECC overhead or protection level.

However, mapping of these applications to FPGA typically suffers from poor energy efficiency due to high energy overhead of programmable interconnects (PI) in FPGA devices.  We have explored an energy-efficient heterogeneous application mapping framework in FPGA, where the conventional application mappings to logic and DSP blocks (for DSP-enhanced FPGA devices) are combined with judicious mapping of specific computati...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
