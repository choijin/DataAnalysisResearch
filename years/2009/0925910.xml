<AbstractNarration>     Lifestyle changes associated with market integration have been closely linked with increased risk of chronic disease, although minimal research has addressed the effects on bone density and bone loss. Bone mineral density (BMD) is a critical diagnostic measure of bone health and is often applied in clinical settings as a marker for future fracture risk and osteoporosis. Although various lifestyle and reproductive factors are suggested to shape BMD, data are often inconsistent and there are major gaps in our current knowledge.  This, in part, stems from relatively homogenous study populations and a reliance on sometimes problematic self-report data.  &lt;br/&gt;     The proposed research will focus on the indigenous Shuar of Ecuador, an Amazonian forager-horticulturalist population currently undergoing rapid cultural and economic change. The study will assess the effects of lifestyle and reproduction on BMD among adults in six Shuar communities experiencing varying degrees of market integration. The study will be cross-sectional and employ an urban-rural design with an adult sample (&gt; 14 years old; 90 females, 90 males from each of the two regional areas). Using a mixed quantitative-qualitative approach, basic anthropometric and BMD data (measured using quantitative ultrasound techniques) will be collected along with measures of physical activity (assessed using accelerometry), diet, female reproductive history (number of pregnancies and breastfeeding patterns), socioeconomic status, and lifestyle change. &lt;br/&gt;     Intellectual Merit: The results from this study will expand upon previous research on the health effects of economic development and lifestyle change by adding a skeletal component. This study will also increase current understanding of how the human skeleton is affected by lifestyle factors, and will improve the ability of biological anthropologists to interpret skeletal variation in past populations. Broader Impacts: In addition to strengthening international research collaborations and providing locally relevant health information to study partners, the proposed research has the potential to inform osteoporosis treatment and prevention efforts.  This doctoral dissertation research project will contribute to the academic training of a female graduate student from an underrepresented group. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
