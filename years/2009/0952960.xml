<AbstractNarration>Advances in computing power over the past two decades have driven successive generations of powerful supercomputers.  Petascale systems have recently emerged that contain tens of thousands of processors.  At this scale, frequent component and software faults cause parallel applications to fail often, forcing users to save critical program data (checkpoint) repeatedly at an unsustainable scale and pace, wasting resources and triggering additional faults.  This has created a crisis: recent experience with petascale systems reveal that increased checkpoint frequency is inducing additional faults, and the excessive overhead required for checkpointing on&lt;br/&gt;peta- and exascale systems is reaching theoretical scaling limits.  These problems represent a petascale reliability barrier that prevents the effective use of these systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To address this problem, the investigator is pursuing a research and education program to improve the reliability and efficiency of high performance computing systems through a comprehensive approach to fault detection, prediction, response, and recovery.  The effort involves work on four fronts: i) investigation of new methods for fault detection and prediction; ii) creation of new algorithms, techniques, and tools to avoid faults by proactively responding  to potential faults, and to efficiently recover from faults when they occur; iii) creation of a fault injection framework and architecture testbed to assess and validate fault prediction, detection, and proactive and reactive response mechanisms; and iv) development of a education and training program to disseminate fault-aware practices for systems administrators and application developers.  The expected results are: more reliable HPC systems and parallel applications; new fault prediction, detection, and response algorithms, software libraries, and tools; and the establishment of a cohort of students and researchers trained to use fault prediction and response technologies.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project focused on seeking to improve the reliability of high performance computing systems through the investigation of new methods of fault detection and prediction; the creation of new approaches, techniques, and tools to seek to avoid faults by proactively responding to potential faults; research into a fault injection framework and architecture testbed; and efforts to increase the awareness of faults and their effects on computing systems through education.   In the area of new methods of fault detection and prediction, the project sought to distill knowledge from systems operations logs to understand the effects of node behaviors on the occurrence of events and the overall health of a node in a large-scale system.  We investigated approaches to quickly analyze system logs, predict node health, and to analyze spatially and temporally clustered system event information.  For the first area of work, we developed a system log event classification approach based on Markov Random Field analysis.  Our approach is based on leveraging training information provided by an expert analyst (such as a systems administrator) to quickly analyze each event in the system log to determine whether the log entry is related to the training samples for a specific category.  This approach is an extension of an e-mail spam detection approach (binomial &ndash; either spam on not-spam) to a multinomial categorization approach for more than two categories.  In the second area of work, predicting node health, we investigated a technique to use the sequence of node events and corresponding health states over time inferred from events in the system log to seek to predict the future health state of a node using a Hidden Semi-Markov Model.   In the area of exploring proactive response techniques, we investigated a method that aims to allow a job scheduler for a high performance computing system to integrate information about the relative health of nodes within the system into decisions about the allocation of system node resources to computational jobs based on the reliability need of a job. The approaches we investigated focused on adding awareness of the historical reliability of nodes, the relative reliability need of computational jobs, and the resource needs of job requests submitted to the system.   We also explored a networking approach to facilitate the use of container based virtualization and the live migration of containers hosting a running parallel application to understand the effects of the live migration of containers that could potentially be used to move a running application from an unhealthy physical host node to a healthier physical host node.   In the area of education, material about the reliability of large scale systems was taught in undergraduate and graduate courses. We also organized and participated in workshops for middle and high school students that included material about high performance computing and reliability for workshop participants.
