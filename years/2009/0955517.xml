<AbstractNarration>Over the last several decades, the traditional fields of evolutionary biology, developmental biology and ecology have moved closer together both conceptually and technically. The newly synthetic field of modern Evolutionary and Ecological Developmental Biology, or Evo-Devo-Eco, is the result. Advances in Evo-Devo-Eco rely heavily on transferring and adapting technologies originally developed for use with traditional laboratory model organisms, in order to apply them to new and emerging model organisms. Presently, insufficient networking often leads laboratories working on non-traditional, yet promising, model organisms, to inefficiently and inadvertently duplicate effort when developing new protocols for use in their systems. Moreover, there is enormous untapped potential for the exchange of techniques, ideas, and knowledge to flow not just from established models to lesser-known systems, but also from the unique biology exposed by lesser-known systems to traditional models. This project will create a new research coordination network called EDEN (Evo-Devo-Eco Network). EDEN will facilitate new support networks and collaborations among laboratories that do not currently enjoy the large community resources of traditional model species. The four major activities of EDEN will be: (1) fostering active interchange of tools and techniques among labs working on emerging model systems; (2) training undergraduates in the field of Evo-Devo-Eco with a focus on emerging model systems; (3) documenting the tools and techniques used and developed in these organisms, and making them publicly available online for future users; and (4) promoting interactions across the Evo-Devo-Eco community through conference funding and the sponsoring of workshops. The advertising strategies and funding priorities of the network are designed to maximize accessibility by participants of underrepresented groups. The gender, ethnic, and career stage diversity of the EDEN core network group will serve as a visibly positive starting point for further increasing the diversity of the next generation of researchers.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>For centuries, biologists have been trying to understand how the organisms on our planet grow, reproduce, and change over time in the process we call evolution. One approach to achieving this understanding is to examine three interconnected processes. First, we study the development of organisms &ndash; that is, the process whereby a single cell, a fertilized egg, divides to make tens, and then millions, of cells, each of which adopts a specific fate within the embryo and ultimately the adult organism. Second, we study the differences in development between organisms, to see how much of the reason that organisms and behave look so differently as adults, is because they develop differently as embryos. Third, we study how conditions outside of the embryo &ndash; environmental factors like, for example temperature and nutrition &ndash; affect the developmental process, and potentially contribute in this way to the differences between adult organisms. The study of all of these things together &ndash; development, evolution and ecology &ndash; is what defines the field of research usually called Evolutionary and Ecological Developmental Biology, or EvoDevoEco. Because the goal of this field is to study a wide diversity of organisms, but most biological laboratory research often focuses on only a small number of organisms, a major challenge for EvoDevoEco researchers is to develop tools and techniques that will allow them to study their development, evolution and ecology in detail. The goal of this project was to create an &ldquo;EvoDevoEco Network&rdquo; (EDEN), that would strengthen this field in a number of ways. &nbsp;First, we wished to provide researchers at all career stages with collaborative training opportunities, whereby they can both learn and share new tools and technologies for use with non-traditional model organisms. We achieved this goal by awarding small travel grants to graduate students, postdocs, and early career faculty scientists, and summer research internships to undergraduate students, every year for six years. EDEN funds were used to enable the scientists to travel to the labs of other researchers, in order to learn or develop a tool or technique that would help them pursue EvoDevoEco research. Second, to ensure that as many scientists as possible would benefit from the development of these resources, all EDEN awardees wrote reports on their experience, and detailed protocols explaining how to perform the techniques that they had learned or develop. These materials were made freely available through a website dedicated to the project (<a href="http://www.edenrcn.com">www.edenrcn.com</a>). Third, to help EvoDEvoEco scientists find and connect with each other, we created a web-based survey on the EDEN website, where researchers from around the world could self identify as being interested in EvoDevoEco, and provide information about themselves, their expertise, and their interest in collaborating with others. We met the first goal by funding nearly 100 young scientists at all careet stages to pursue EDEN-related research in tool and technology development for new model organisms. This means that at least 200 scientists were directly involved in EDEN-supported work, since each of the EDEN awardees traveled to the lab of another scientist to perform the work or internship. EDEN awardees were able to present their work at conferences, publish scientific papers, and move on to further career stages throughout the duration of the award. With respect to the second goal, we collected over 100 protocols for techniques developed or taught/learned with EDEN support, and made them freely available online at the EDEN website. Finally, the EDEN &ldquo;participating labs&rdquo; survey generated a self-identified community of over 400 researchers from 40 countries worldwide, who can search for and find each other based on location, expertise, study organism and other criteria, via the EDEN website.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/17/2017<br>      Modified by: Cassandra&nbsp;G&nbsp;Extavour</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
