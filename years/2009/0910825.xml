<AbstractNarration>Professor Mark L. Schlossman of the University of Illinois at Chicago and Professor Petr Vanysek of Northern Illinois University are supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry to conduct X-ray scattering studies on interfaces between immiscible electrolyte solutions.  The goals of the proposed research is to systematically characterize the distribution of ions across interfaces between two immiscible electrolyte solutions, and to explore the structural dependence of protein-lipid binding at lipid monolayers adsorbed to liquid-liquid interfaces.  The PIs will combine X-ray surface scattering with in situ electrochemical measurements to achieve these goals.  The proposed work will advance our understanding of interfacial structure of liquid/liquid systems, and test fundamental assumptions underlying analytical and computational studies of the liquid/liquid interface.  This research is also expected to advance our understanding of the structure-function relationship of membrane proteins that play a fundamental role in cell signaling and trafficking. Graduate and undergraduate students as well as post-doctoral associates will be trained in the use of X-ray scattering methods to solve electrochemical problems at the liquid/liquid interface, and will be exposed to a broad range of research disciplines.</AbstractNarration>
