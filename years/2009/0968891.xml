<AbstractNarration>This award supports the development, assessment, and dissemination of resource material for "Peer Instruction" in quantum mechanics, from sophomore-level modern physics to the junior-senior level courses, to prepare future scientists and engineers for the demands of a high-tech workplace with its growing dependence on quantum phenomena. The resource material includes the "ConcepTests" for formative assessment, standardized assessment tools for  summative assessment and the material for Just-In-Time Teaching (JITT) including "Reactive Homework" problems for modern physics and quantum mechanics courses. The research-based material will continue to be developed using findings of student misconceptions and difficulties in learning quantum mechanics.   A major goal of this phase of the project will be a rigorous assessment of the material at other colleges and Universities. Control studies comparing similar courses in Modern Physics and Quantum Mechanics in which Peer Instruction was employed with those for which this pedagogical method was not employed are ongoing.   Such studies will be extended to other colleges and universities. Standardized assessment tools involving multiple-choice questions will continue to be developed and refined for assessment purposes.   Peer Instruction material developed will continue to be disseminated through workshops at professional meetings, publications in journals, personal and professional society websites, and presentations at colloquia and seminars at various universities and colleges. The resource material developed as part of this project will be published as a reference book suitable for instructors towards the end of the project period.</AbstractNarration>
