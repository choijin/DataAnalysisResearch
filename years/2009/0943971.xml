<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: This project addresses the exploration and development of a new materials system, electrically conducting zeolite-like or zeoate frameworks, targeted for improved electrical energy storage. Zeolites and zeoates are characterized by the presence of nanoscale channels and pores in their crystalline framework, and occur naturally or can be synthesized by inorganic methods. The work pursues the synthesis of zeoate frameworks and their structural and electrical characterization. The motivation for studying the materials for energy applications lies in the critical need to improve electrical energy storage capabilities by increasing both the energy density and the power density provided by existing solutions, such as batteries and ultracapacitors. Conducting framework materials have a large and possibly disruptive role to play in electrical energy storage. Yet, insight is needed in the materials factors that control ionic and electronic conductivity in zeoate materials, in combination with wide electrochemical, chemical, and thermal stability. Based on fundamental science, novel energy storage and conversion mechanisms can be predicted and designed into new materials for many electrical energy applications, from transportation to power-consuming electronics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DETAILS: The exploratory research bridges two established areas, microporous materials and electrically conducting materials, to study an as yet largely unexplored but transformative subject, namely electronically and ionically conducting microporous zeoate materials. The materials can be harnessed for electrical energy storage. The project addresses fundamental materials questions related to the origin of electrical conductivity in zeoates, and evaluates the use of electrically conducting zeoates for energy applications, by a combination of structural characterization methods, spectroscopies, and charge transport experiments. The research develops new insights and new avenues in zeoates, to tackle timely and pressing technological concerns in energy applications. The research under this EAGER grant is exploratory, and yet can be leveraged to important scientific, societal and economic benefits. Furthermore, graduate and undergraduate students are trained in the growing field of materials for energy applications. Outreach activities include collaborations with middle and high school students and their teachers in economically disadvantaged communities, through the introduction of timely and relevant themes in the science curriculum. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
