<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;Structural and computational methods will be applied to understand why some proteins undergo transitions from their soluble, globular structures to form insoluble, elongated fibrils.  In previous work, we have shown that an essential feature of fibril structure is that the protein contains a short self-complementary sequence of amino acids.  We developed a computer algorithm that accurately identifies such segments, and we have validated the algorithm by experiments, which show that the identified segments do in fact form fibrils.  Our goal now is to determine the universe of fibril-forming proteins, which we term the amylome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;The wider implications of the work include the following: (1) Protein fibrils can form the basis of new materials. (2) A UCLA course in Structural Molecular Biology is linked to this research.  In the laboratory section, students learn hands-on protein structure determination.  Graduates of this course now teach and carry out research at some 30 universities, colleges, and research institutes.  UCLA has perhaps the most diverse student body of any university, and our course reflects the demography of the campus.  We plan to recruit students to this course, and through it, to the field of structural molecular biology, from a wide range of backgrounds, particularly those from underrepresented minority groups.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Amphiphilic Proteins &amp; Peptides Federal Award 10: 0958111 Report Submission Period: 04/01/2015 to 09/30/2015  PI David Eisenberg  Intellectual merit: The overall goal of the project has been to illuminate the principles of how proteins interact with each other.  Perhaps our most important discovery is that the new technique of micro-electron diffraction (microED) can give previously unknown atomic-resolution structures of interacting proteins.  This work, done in collaboration with the research group of Dr. Tamir Gonen at Janelia Farm Research Campus of HHMI, has so far produced 10 structures of proteins in the fibrous, amyloid state.  These are the first previously unknown structures determined by microED, and the structures of highest resolution of any cryoEM method.  That is, we have shown that microED has the potential to become a major tool of structural biology to stand alongside of x-ray diffraction, cryo-electron microscopy, and NMR.  In addition, each of the 10 structures advances understanding of how the class of proteins known as amyloid-formers stack to form fibrils.  Some such fibrils are pathogenic, such as those causing AlzheimerÆs and ParkinsonÆs diseases; others function in normal cellular metabolism.  One example of the power of microED is its application to the toxic core of alpha-synuclein, the protein whose aggregation seems to be responsible for the development of ParkinsonÆs disease.  The central 11-amino acid residue segment of alpha-synuclein, called NACore, has been shown to be necessary for its aggregation into toxic fibrils. We were able to grow crystals of NACore for studies of its structure, but these crystals were smaller than the wavelength of visible light, and thus invisible in optical microscopes.      Crystals of segments of alpha-synuclein.   (See Figure 1b in Rodriguez et al. Nature 2015, 525, 486-490)  The top row shows crystals of three segments of alpha-synuclein as seen by a high power optical microscope.  Notice that crystals of NACore (right) are invisible, but can be seen in the electron microscope image below.  These crystals were unsuitable for x-ray diffraction but suitable for microED.  Applying microED to the crystals of both the NACore and PreNAC segments of alpha-synuclein, we were able to determine the model for the core of alpha-synuclein amyloid fibrils, shown in Fig. 2.  This work was published by Rodriguez et al. in the September 24, 2015 issue of Nature.      Core of the alpha-synuclein fibril.   (See Figure 3d in Rodriguez et al. Nature 2015, 525, 486-490).  The NACore segment is shown in gold and the PreNAC segment is shown in blue. They are connected by a loop of presently unknown structure, shown here in gray.  Each alpha-synuclein molecule stacks on the one below, forming a fibril.  The vertical black arrow shows the fibril axis.  Also in black is shown the amino acid threonine (T) which replaces alanine (A) in an early disease-onset form of alpha-synuclein, in which patients develop ParkinsonÆs disease at an early age.      Broader impacts: Our lab has been active in recruiting into science members of underrepresented groups.  We have eight female graduate students and postdoctoral fellows currently working in the laboratory.  And the lead scientist on the 10 structures of protein interaction by microED has been Dr. Jose Rodriguez who immigrated to the US from Mexico.  We also train several UCLA undergraduates each year in the tools of structural molecular biology, drawn from the student body of one of the most culturally diverse campuses in America.  We are also proud of our website which offers numerous databases, servers, and papers related to our work.
