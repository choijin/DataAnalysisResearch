<AbstractNarration>Wang&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0908051&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     This award is funded under the American Recovery and&lt;br/&gt;Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).  The investigator&lt;br/&gt;studies factors that are relevant to the low-frequency&lt;br/&gt;variability of atmospheric and oceanic flows and that play a role&lt;br/&gt;in climate changes.  He focuses on three sources of atmospheric&lt;br/&gt;and oceanic variability: the wind-driven ocean circulation, the&lt;br/&gt;thermohaline circulation, and the El Nino Southern Oscillations&lt;br/&gt;(ENSO).  The study involves, on the one hand, applications of&lt;br/&gt;existing mathematical theory to the understanding of the&lt;br/&gt;underlying problems, and, on the other hand, the further&lt;br/&gt;development of new mathematical theories -- dynamic transition&lt;br/&gt;theory, geometric theory for incompressible flows, and attractor&lt;br/&gt;bifurcation theory -- that are applied to the physical problems. &lt;br/&gt;These new theories also have application to other problems in&lt;br/&gt;nonlinear science and engineering.  The main idea of dynamic&lt;br/&gt;transition theory is to search for the full set of transition&lt;br/&gt;states, giving a complete characterization of stability and&lt;br/&gt;transition.  The set of transition states -- physical "reality"&lt;br/&gt;-- is represented by a local attractor.  Following this line,&lt;br/&gt;dynamic transition theory is developed to identify the transition&lt;br/&gt;states and to classify them both dynamically and physically.  The&lt;br/&gt;project involves specific collaborations with atmosphere/ocean&lt;br/&gt;scientists in different institutions and includes training of&lt;br/&gt;graduate students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The investigator studies some typical sources of climate&lt;br/&gt;variability, which, independently and interactively, play a&lt;br/&gt;significant role in climate changes.  Wind-driven circulation&lt;br/&gt;plays a role mostly in the oceans' subannual-to-interannual&lt;br/&gt;variability, the El Nino Southern Oscillations are associated&lt;br/&gt;with interannual variability, and the thermohaline circulation is&lt;br/&gt;most important in decadal-to-millenial variability.  The&lt;br/&gt;investigator undertakes a careful fundamental-level examination&lt;br/&gt;of these phenomena.  Graduate students are involved in the&lt;br/&gt;project.  The studies could lead to improved predictions of and&lt;br/&gt;new insights into weather, climate, and environmental phenomena&lt;br/&gt;of central importance to our economy. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
