<AbstractNarration>This award in the Chemistry of Life Processes (CLP) program, co-funded with the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences (MCB), supports work by Professor Codrina V. Popescu at Ursinus College, an undergraduate liberal arts institution.  The proposed Mössbauer investigations include studies of iron complexes and the exploration of novel iron sites in proteins.  Mössbauer spectroscopy provides insight into the electronic structure and bonding situation of iron compounds by probing the iron nucleus.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;Iron is the most abundant transition metal found in biological systems, being involved in a variety of physiological processes carried out by enzymes and transport proteins.  Thus, to understand biological processes at a molecular level, one must elucidate the electronic structure of iron coordination complexes.  The study of metalloproteins has seen a great development due to the enticing prospect of using design elements inspired by Nature in manmade catalysts for cleaning out pollutants through catalytic oxidation, or cheaply obtaining hydrogen to be used as a fuel.  This fundamental research seeks to accomplish two types of results.  First, large families of iron compounds could be systematically characterized, a broad study useful in establishing correlations between structural and spectroscopic changes in these molecules.  A second, more challenging endeavor, is the resolution of spectroscopic problems by analyzing a set of spectra for a single compound under carefully chosen conditions.  A picture of the electronic structure of a given compound can then be generated from the spectral parameters.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;The long-term goals of this research are the elucidation of structure and mechanism of hydrogenases and certain oxygenases, which have direct applications in fuel and pollution control technologies.  For example, the enzymes hydrogenases catalyze the production and breakdown of molecular hydrogen.  If understood well, these enzymes may offer a cheaper, non-polluting way, to obtain hydrogen fuel. This type of research has a significant impact in the chemical and biological sciences, given that it provides answers to fundamental structural questions, such as structure and bonding, and uncovers their profound implications on the function of the active sites in question.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In terms of broader impacts, the proposed research supports a close mentor-student relationship, in which students are part of the scientific pursuit from hypothesis generation to interpretation of results.  The expected impacts on undergraduate training and education include: (1) to develop and maintain an undergraduate research program that fosters student growth and independence through cultivation of logic and problem-solving skills; (2) to provide students with interdisciplinary projects that promote learning spectroscopy hands-on while solving current scientific problems; (3) to provide the resources for external presentations and publications.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The research accomplished under this award aimed to train undergraduate students at Ursinus College, a small liberal arts college, in interdisciplinary research in the spectroscopy of proteins and small-molecule models for enzymes.  The intellectual merit of this research is its goal of elucidating the structure and function of novel biological and chemical catalysts, through Mossbauer spectroscopy, at the frontier of our knowledge about the design of iron-based catalysts.  The themes of the research were the catalytic hydrogen production by enzymes and synthesized molecules and the mechanism of the enzyme dehaloperoxidase.  A third related concentration was exploration of novel iron compounds with poorly understood structures, specifically monovalent iron.   The outcomes are the training of young people, including under-represented minorities and students with challenging economic background, advancement of fundamental science and dissemination of scientific discoveries.  During the period 2010-2014, eleven students supported through this award learned first-hand the theoretical background for Mossbauer spectroscopy, inorganic chemistry, biochemistry and aspects of electronic structure of molecules which cannot be covered entirely in a class-based undergraduate curriculum.  In addition, the research setting in the PIÆs lab allowed a close mentoring relationship and students could design their own hypotheses and experimental strategies.  The entire research plan was accomplished and work continues in new directions.  The broader impacts of this research are the collaborative work with four researchers at larger universities and the involvement of undergraduates in all the stages of discovery, collaboration and dissemination.  The synthesis and characterization of model complexes, as the purification of iron proteins are time-consuming and complex.  On the other hand, Mossbauer spectroscopy is a complex technique, for which the PI is highly qualified.  Thus through collaboration between chemists (or biochemists) and a spectroscopist we were able to introduce Mossbauer spectroscopy to all students involved (both graduate students, undergraduates and postdocs), design better experiments and answer electronic structure and mechanism questions which otherwise were not approachable.  An early exposure to research and to spectroscopy stimulates students from all backgrounds to become lifelong learners, to pursue advanced degrees, and to communicate valuable scientific facts to society.  Moreover, Mossbauer spectroscopy has become a broadly used technique for characterization of synthesized iron compounds, materials, and iron proteins and training in this technique is an asset for future biochemists and chemists.   The results were published five research articles in peer reviewed journals and more than ten research conference presentations, by the PI or by students (four publications were co-authored by students).   A major goal in this award period and now a notable accomplishment was a study of the electronic structure of the catalytic site of the iron-only hydrogenase, focused on two catalytic models synthesized in the laboratory of Professor Darensbourg at Texas A&amp;M University. [i]   Three Ursinus undergraduates co-authored this paper and were involved at different stages of the work over a period that includes the life of the award.  This Mossbauer study revealed both through experimental determination and through theoretical modeling, the structure, bonding and magnetism in two model molecules for the hydrogenase active site.  The larger relevance of this study for the field of Chemistry is to elucidate the structure of the active enzyme and to indicate fundamental differences between present molecular models and the enzyme, pointing out possible future development.  In connection with this work on the active site of the hydrogenase enzyme, we also characterized a monovalent iron complex (in collaboration with Professor Ch...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
