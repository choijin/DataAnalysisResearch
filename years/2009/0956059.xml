<AbstractNarration>There is an urgent need to develop experience-based learning opportunities for undergraduate students that will invigorate their interest in science, biology, and global sustainability. In the intermountain west, the impacts of climate change are manifest through large scale phenomena such as the pine bark beetle outbreak, increased wildland fire, long-term drought, and invasive species. All these issues, many of which interact with changes in land use, are impacting communities that depend on natural resources for recreation, jobs, and economic stability. How can we prepare the next generation of public land stewards with the multidisciplinary skills needed to address impacts of climate change? The Rocky Mountain Sustainability and Science Network (RMSSN) will combine real-world careers and biological education using field experiences to address critical issues for the sustainability and ecological integrity of public lands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this network focus on undergraduate understanding of biological and sustainability concepts and their application to land management.The RMSSN strives to increase the representation of the multicultural demographic of the western states through active engagement of minority serving institutions and purposefully outreach. The RMSSN has four principle goals. First, identify and assess opportunities for students to develop their understanding of sustainability and biological sciences through experiential learning. Second, build partnerships among federal agencies, non-profits, and academic institutions to address issues of sustainability and student development. Third, build a model of experiential science learning and design assessment tools which will facilitate the application of the RMSSN learning model to other experiential learning programs throughout the country. Fourth, establish a diverse next generation of land stewards who excel in the sciences required to address sustainability issues in the rapidly changing and multicultural intermountain west. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is supported jointly by the Biological Sciences Directorate and the Division of Undergraduate Education.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Rocky Mountain Sustainability and Science Network (RMSSN) was funded as a collaborative network of mostly western universities to use public lands to teach undergraduates about science and sustainability.  The research coordination network (RCN) originally consisted of 15 members who formed an operating board to develop an academy to bring in underrepresented minorities (URM) students interested in learning about science and sustainability in public lands.  RMSSN academy was first hosted at the Short Grass Steppe Research Center in Colorado hosted by Colorado State University but then moved to the Murie Center (Moose, Wyoming) and then Teton Science School as the academy grew and matured.  The RMSSN academy consisted of a a ten-day intensive experience for 25 students arranged in small cohorts of 4-5 students per team.  During the academy, each cohort conducts a series of exercises and workshops where students learned about the management of resources and sustainable practices from the perspective of public land managers including the National Park Service, The Bureau of Land Management, the City of Jackson and the US Forest Service. The students were selected by competitive application in the early spring and all applications were graded by three reviewers for acceptance.  Academic faculty for the academy were selected from a wide variety of institutions including Colorado State University, Unviersity of Wyoming, Utah State University, Harvard, Moravian College, Michigan Technological University, Clemson University, Northwestern University and University of Colorado Denver.  The RMSSN academy used a series of evaluation tools to determine success.  These tools including social network analysis (by Texas A&amp;M University), team assembling and networking (Northwestern University), student self effacy surveys (Colorado State University) and student professional career follow up surveys 2- 4 years post experience (Colorado State University).  In addition, students completed digital selfie-videos used for self evaluations; digital databases for technical skill evaluation and digital journalling. All data were analyzed by faculty teams and submitted for publication.  Preliminary results from this project indicate that URM students greatly benefited from both the cohort experience and the introduction to public lands.  Student self effacy surveys indicated great confidence expressed by the students in understanding sustainability and the challenges of public land management post academy experience.  In addition, semi-structured interviews with students indicated that students found the academy to be "life changing" and "monumental experiences" that helped them form career decisions.   Engaging underrepresented minorities in science and technology is in the nation's interest.  As the population of the U.S. shifts and becomes more diverse, the number of students entering academic careers interested in sciences needs to reflect that increasingly diverse population.  RMSSN demonstrates that URM students can be engaged in science and technology using a cohort model and authenic research at our national parks.  Why national parks?  Public lands are critical laboratories for global sustainability and by bringing URM students to national parks as future scientists and leaders, we actively encouraged students to consider science careers while also providing them with the social and academic networks they needed for success in science.
