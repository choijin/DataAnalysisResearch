<AbstractNarration>The University Corporation for Atmospheric Research is collaborating with the GLOBE program, the University of Colorado, New York University, the Texas Regional Collaboratives and several other partners to design, implement, and evaluate an Earth System Science learning experience for teachers and students. The goals of the From Learning to Research project are to prepare 80 teachers to engage middle and high school students in Earth System Science research on local, regional, and national scales, expose teachers and students to Earth Science careers, and allow students to interact with scientists from around the world. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is providing onsite and virtual professional development activities for teachers and the GLOBE Student Research Collaboratory (GSRC) is supporting teacher and student learning about climate science and research. Teachers and students are learning about climate science and develop systems thinking, problem-solving, data analysis, communication, and collaboration skills. The project is (1) producing research findings on teacher and student use of GIS visualization tools, modeling programs, and social collaboration technologies; (2) implementing and evaluating GSRC's impact on motivating and preparing middle and high school students for careers in STEM; and (3) providing teachers with resources and strategies for ensuring that their students know about and prepared for STEM careers in earth science-related careers.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ From Learning to Research: Developing Future Earth System Scientist and Professionals  The From Learning to Research (L2R) project was a three-year project working with students and teachers from across the United States.  The overall goals of L2R were:  To provide teachers with the knowledge, skills, strategies, and confidence to engage middle and secondary students in authentic Earth System Science research on local, regional, and global scales. To expose teachers and students to careers in the Earth Sciences. To allow students to experience Earth System Science research by interacting with scientists from around the world.     L2R was a collaborative project between The GLOBE Program (Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environment), the University of Texas-Tyler, the University of Colorado-Boulder, and New York University.   The GLOBE Program, http://www.globe.gov,  is an international K-12 science and education program that encourages students to explore their local environments and share their findings with students, teachers, and scientists from around the world.  In order to complete the above goals, two cohorts of teachers were brought to summer institutes (Tyler, Texas in 2011 and Boulder, Colorado in 2012) and then participated in ongoing professional development during the subsequent school year.  In total, 75 teachers participated from over 22 states plus Puerto Rico.  These included teachers representing urban, rural, public, and private schools and a diverse population of students. In total, the teachers had approximately 8,000 students.  During year three of the project, a group of teachers met to create products they would have found useful to complete L2R.  These products included an informational brochure about project-based learning, project-based learning graphic organizers, a discovering climate learning activity, and STEM Is&hellip; posters.  Interested students, teachers, parents, and scientists then reviewed each product at GLOBEÆs Annual Partner Meeting.    During the summer institutes, teachers learned about project-based learning, Next Generation Science Standards, general climate science and education, misconceptions and controversies in teaching about climate science, 21st century skills, methods for collaboration, and were given an overview of GLOBE science protocols. By the end of the week, each teacher had a plan for a research project that included data collection and analysis, collaboration with scientists and other teachers, and technology usage.  During the summer workshop, teachers also spent time learning about iPads, the new GLOBE webpage and its applications including blogging, discussion forums, sharing documents, and data entry, Skype, and Adobe Connect.   During the school year, webinars were held using Adobe Connect every two weeks.  Each webinar consisted of general announcements, a STEM career speaker, teacher updates on the student research, and sometimes included a more in-depth look at some part of GLOBE (e.g., data entry or using the discussion forums).  Career speakers came from a wide variety of fields and included GLOBE alumni, GLOBE teachers, and scientists or STEM professionals from both the private and public sectors. Teachers also frequently communicated with other schools, scientists, or L2R staff via Skype, Adobe Connect, and emails.   The final requirement for L2R was for students to submit their research projects to the GLOBE Virtual Student Conference.  In 2012, the first cohort of L2R teachers piloted the conference.  In 2013, all GLOBE students were invited to attend along with the L2R students.  All the L2R student reports included analyses of GLOBE data and supplemental data, an abstract, a research report, and a video presentation of their reports.  Examples of student projects included:  Climate change and oyster gardens Is climate change the reason why we did not have any school snow days this year? Are there more asthma attacks when the air qua...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
