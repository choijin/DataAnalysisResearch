<AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;This award will fund the acquisition of a gas chromatography triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (CG-TQ-MS/MS), an electron multiplier, and an oxidation system. These instruments will support research on 2 major topics, 1) the transfer of terrigenous organic matter (TOM) from watersheds to aquatic systems in both dissolved and particulate forms and 2) the impact of biomass combustion on air quality in urban and rural settings. Such transport is strongly dependent on hydrological processes in the watershed with short-lived flood events playing a substantial role in large-scale pulse transfers. The PIs will investigate how hydrological shifts predicted by climate change scenarios may impact the overall transport of natural organic matter in natural and perturbed (e.g. urban) watersheds. The Arctic project is also introducing lignin as an additional tracer for upper Arctic Ocean ventilation processes in order to reconcile recently observed discrepancies among other established oceanographic tracers. In particular, TOM tracers will help to identify the different components of the Arctic freshwater cycle. The GC/MS will also contribute analytical capacity to recent research at TAMUG in characterizing the composition of combustion-derived particles depositing over urban to rural watersheds. Biomass combustion is a major source of atmospheric particles that affect air quality at the local to regional scale and climate at the regional to global scale. Climate fluctuations, and in particular changes in drought cyclicity and intensity are strong drivers of wildfire events which themselves contribute substantially to atmospheric aerosol loads.</AbstractNarration>

In the seven months since its installation (August 2010), the new GC/MS Triple Quadrupole (TQMS) system supported a series of projects performed by both undergraduate and graduate students. In the summer of 2010, in the firs few months of the instrument&rsquo;s installation, two undergraduate students joined Dr. Louchouarn&rsquo;s group as part of TAMUG&rsquo;s NSF-REU program to recruit students from underserved and underrepresented groups in STEM disciplines. Both students worked on the characterization of dissolved and particulate matter in river and ocean samples using both an older GC/MS ion trap and the new GC/TQMS. This work allowed us to demonstrate the presence of fire biomarkers in particulate matter in open ocean systems demonstrating the long residence time of these terrestrially-derived organic compounds in aquatic systems and thus their potential to trace fire events over large scales of space and time. In the fall, the new instrument was also used in a research project performed in a newly developed upper level undergraduate class in <em>Quantitative Chemistry and Instrumental Analysis</em> at TAMUG. The project was further developed into a senior thesis as a partial requirement to the completion of a student&rsquo;s Honor Undergraduate Research Scholars (UGR) program at Texas A&amp;M University.
