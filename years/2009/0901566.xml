<AbstractNarration>GOALI: NANOTHERMITE BASED MICRO SHOCKWAVE GENERATORS AND&lt;br/&gt;NANOPARTICLES FOR TARGETED AND EFFICIENT DRUG DELIVERY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to develop a novel digitally controlled micro shockwave&lt;br/&gt;generator by integrating nanothermites with microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). The&lt;br/&gt;approach is based on shockwaves from redox reactions of nanothermites. The shockwaves are&lt;br/&gt;used to deliver genes and/or drugs into cells with high transfection efficiency and cell survival.&lt;br/&gt;Furthermore, organosilicate nanoparticles synthesized on site will be utilized as an effective and&lt;br/&gt;targeted delivery vehicle via the shockwave.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit. The proposed miniaturized systems will cover the large impulse range&lt;br/&gt;necessary for permeabilization of a variety of cells and tissues with different mechanical&lt;br/&gt;properties and/or environments. Unlike physical gene delivery methods which rely on bulky and&lt;br/&gt;expensive instrumentation or chemical delivery methods that exhibit low transfection efficiency,&lt;br/&gt;the proposed MEMS-based shockwave generator -- alone or in combination with nanoparticles -&lt;br/&gt;- will produce shockwave interactions and drug delivery at the single cell level, providing&lt;br/&gt;unprecedented control over cell transfection processes.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts. The proposed research is expected to transform the study and understanding&lt;br/&gt;of biological processes in health and disease, and enable novel diagnostics and interventions.&lt;br/&gt;Educational objectives include recruitment of students from regional college programs, including&lt;br/&gt;those with predominantly Black and Hispanic enrollment and a summer ?Nano Camp? for high&lt;br/&gt;school students. Undergraduate and graduate students, particularly from rural areas of Missouri&lt;br/&gt;will be trained to develop leadership, ownership, mentoring, career skills and entrepreneurship to&lt;br/&gt;prepare them for the 21st century work force.</AbstractNarration>
