<AbstractNarration>Texas A&amp;M University, in collaboration with Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and Auburn University, proposes to use culturally responsive approaches to attract and retain high school students to computer science. They will expand two frameworks that have been developed for math education into computing education. The AADMLSS City Stroll (African American Distributed Multiple Learning Styles System) and CSDT (Culturally Situated Design Tools) are interactive environments that use culturally relevant cues to teach math. AADMLSS City Stroll system is a game-like environment that includes instruction, practice, and assessment. CSDTs are web-based applets, based on ethnomathematics, that is, the mathematical knowledge embedded in cultural designs such as cornrow hairstyles, Native American beadwork, Latino percussion rhythms, etc. The essential idea of CSDTs is one of translating knowledge from informal to formal systems. The goals of the proposed project are: (1) to assist the efforts to extend the work on these math educational tools to include computing; (2) to develop a institutional "pipeline" such that K-12 students successfully participating in these activities can maximize their odds of entering undergraduate programs in computing; and (3)  extend the current work with CSDTs and AADMLSS, from the local or regional scale to the national scale, by incorporating it into the Boys and Girls Clubs of America (BGCA).</AbstractNarration>

Increased achievement in math and computing subjects  All the sites attempted to gather achievement data; however only College Station and Troy were able to collect both pre and post samples from the students. The students at the College Station sites made modest gains in their understanding of math concepts and Cartesian coordinates. The students attending the Troy BGC also showed an increase in their knowledge of math concepts after using the VBL and Skateboarder tools. The students at the Albany site increased their scores after using the Anishinaabe Arcs tool.
