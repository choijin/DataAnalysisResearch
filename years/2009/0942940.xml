<AbstractNarration>Chemistry (12) Two instruments, a handheld X-Ray Fluorescence spectrometer (XRF) and an Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometer (ICP-OES) are being integrated into undergraduate laboratories in the departments of Chemistry, Geosciences, and Biology at Trinity University. This integration of analytical tools into undergraduate curricula is helping address three primary goals: improving science and non-science major learning by engagement in interdisciplinary endeavors; improving student depth of understanding of elemental analysis methods; and increasing multidisciplinary interactions among faculty and students which in the long term will fundamentally transform STEM education on the Trinity campus. Project faculty are developing new, engaging laboratories for non-science and science majors that involve hands-on use of these sophisticated, research-grade instruments. The strategy of using relevant (environmental water samples), unique (museum paintings and artifacts), and interdisciplinary samples and problem frameworks (distribution of metals in soils and plants and ecosystems) is intended to better capture student interest than traditional isolated experimentation within a discipline. Elemental analysis methods are being explored at a variety of skill levels across a broad range of disciplines. The impacted courses and programs are affecting a large percentage of female and minority students. This equipment is being used by at least three departments and by two community partners. An outside, experienced consultant is performing formative and will be performing summative assessments of the project. The dissemination plan includes conference presentations, peer-reviewed publications, and web based materials (sites hosted by both Trinity University and the NSDL) that target multidisciplinary audiences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  This award funded the purchase of two instruments for elemental analysis, including an Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometer (ICP-OES) and a portable X-ray fluorescence spectrometer (pXRF).

We have successfully used these complementary instruments in teaching labs in the departments of Chemistry, Environmental Studies, and Geosciences. They have transformed many aspects of the instructional program and have been a catalyst for the development of new collaborations both on and off campus.   To address intellectual merit criteria, we developed interdisciplinary lab and classroom activities that strongly link science and non-science majors and courses from a variety of disciplines. We promoted a hands-on teaching philosophy that involved analyses of a variety of interesting, relevant, and unique samples in order to capture student interest and to bridge disciplinary divisions at a range of skill levels. These activities increased interdisciplinary interactions for students and faculty in both teaching and research activities. Faculty from Art and Art History, Biology, Chemistry, Classics, Engineering Science, Environmental Science, and Geosciences have been involved in these activities. Undergraduate students have also used these instruments in independent research projects. Importantly, we have established collaborations between Trinity University faculty and students with museum curators and art conservators, with public utilities, and commercial building owners. Research projects at the San Antonio Museum of Art have involved detailed studies of the surface decoration on marble sculpture, and our collaborations with officials at the Alamo have helped establish the true extent of fresco decoration, which had not been visible for well over 100 years.   In response to the broader impacts criteria, we note that our grant-related activities strongly impacted women and minority students because the interdisciplinary activities discussed above were used heavily in courses that enroll disproportionate numbers of such students. The results of the project have been disseminated to scientific audiences at conferences, in peer-reviewed publication, to general audiences at public lectures, and through mass media outlets. In addition, grant-related activities led to a project assessment workshop at an NSF conference, and have fostered increased discussion of the use of the pXRF in teaching and research at Trinity and at other educational institutions. Information on the quality and quantity of condensate waters is being provided to the San Antonio Water System and commercial building owners so that informed decisions can be made about reclaiming these waters. Activities stemming from this grant, including the organization of a symposium on pXRF at an up coming national chemistry meeting, will continue when grant funding ends.   Our project had three primary goals. The first was to improve both science and non-science majorsÆ understanding and appreciation of the scientific method by providing engaging, interdisciplinary learning opportunities. The second was to improve the depth of understanding and application of elemental analysis methods and spectroscopies in college students at all curricular levels. The third was to develop studentsÆ appreciation and recognition of the inherent interdisciplinary nature of many scientific problems while fostering multidisciplinary faculty interactions to form the foundation of future collaborations. An external evaluator assessed all aspects of the project and provided both formative and summative assessment reports....]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
