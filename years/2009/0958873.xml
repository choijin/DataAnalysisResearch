<AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funds from the Major Research Instrumentation-Recovery and Reinvestment (MRI-R2) program were used to support the acquisition of a tabletop scanning electron microscope and associated equipment at the Missouri Botanical Gardens (MBG). An automated microscopy system was also acquired to facilitate the digitization of specimen slides.  The instrumentation provides expanded research opportunities for a wide range of MBG curators, students, and visitors in research areas such as plant taxonomy, ecology, evolution, biogeography, pollen biology, ethnobotany, GIS and conservation. Research at MBG promotes the study and conservation of plants all over the world, from biodiversity tropical hotspots to native plants and habitats in Missouri, involving people from diverse cultures, occupations, age groups and ethnicity.  Scientific study of plants provides the knowledge needed for rational management and conservation of plant resources. The acquired instrumentation expands the MBG laboratory capacity and allows botanists and students to extend their investigations, discovery, and propagation of knowledge. Use of the instruments is promoted through demonstrations in the garden's K-12 education programs, teacher training, special workshops and undergraduate research programs. The knowledge gained from the use of this instrumentation is widely disseminated through popular and technical publications, seminars, meetings, and building tours.</AbstractNarration>
