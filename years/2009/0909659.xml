<AbstractNarration>The goal of this research project is to advance knowledge about student and faculty perceptions of connection to community as factors in academic engagement. The three phases of this research will mold basic research results into applied strategies for improvements in engagement in higher education STEM environments. The first phase is a tool development phase which will provide a valid tool box for evaluating target constructs (engagement, participation, affect, cognition, etc.). Three data collection tools will be developed: student surveys, student focus group protocols, and faculty interview protocols. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second phase focuses on addressing the following research question: What connections to community are contributing to significant differences in academic engagement? and How do institutional characteristics mold the classroom experience toward increased community? Surveys will be administered to students and focus group and interviews conducted with students at five different post-secondary institutions. Data will be analyzed within and across institutions to gauge the effects of higher education institutional characteristics on student affect, perception, cognition, sense of belonging, engagement, and participation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, the third phase emphasizes applying results to develop strategies by which successful community-building characteristics of the various participating institutions can be transferred elsewhere. In all phases, the research team brings a broad range of diversity of expertise and institutional fabric to the proposed study. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Five different types of institutions are represented in this effort: Research 1 (University of Washington), Comprehensive (Minnesota State), Master's L (Simmons College), Private, Faith-Based (Seattle Pacific), and HBCU (Tuskegee). Each of these institutions has unique historical strengths for undergraduate education; this research will improve understanding of how these strengths impact connections to community via mediating engagement and subsequently predicting student learning. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[This collaborative research effort entitled "Connection, Community, and Engagement in STEM education" involved researchers from five disparate universities who studied the impact of STEM students' connections to their academic communities on their academic engagement. STEM is of particular interest because students in engineering and science fields tend to spend more time in their studies than other majors (which may limit their time for non-academic activities) and are entering fields which are expected to experience workforce shortages.  Our results have shown that belonging connects to and predicts academic engagement among STEM students.   Other research, in turn, has connected academic engagement to a wide variety of positive academic outcomes, including persistence, GPA, and fulfillment.    Not surprisingly, local connections to peers and faculty in the student's world are most consistently associated with the student's academic engagement and also predict future engagement.   Despite the demands of studying in engineering, science, and related fields, students find the time to participate in both academic and non-academic extracurricular activities and do so very strategically.  For example, a student may participate in a community outside of the major in order to facilitate a sense of belonging to the university, meet self-esteem needs, or release stress and stem anxiety associated with major studies.   Similarly, students strategically choose academic communities such as study groups to benefit from the social learning opportunities available only as students work and study together.   Interestingly enough, students who are less confident, but involved in non-academic communities, tend to be more engaged in their studies than lesser involved peers, while the differences among higher confidence students are much smaller.   In contrast, students who have greater self confidence and participate in academic groups tend to be more engaged in their studies than confident students who are not involved; this difference almost disappears for students who are less confident.    This study also looked closely at the role of faculty support in student engagement.   The role and influence of faculty cannot be overstated.  It is not only linked directly to student engagement but is also indirectly linked to engagement through its connection to belonging.  Strong faculty support is associated with both better engagement and stronger sense of belonging.   What faculty do this year also predicts how well students will engage next year, but this relationship differs by institution.  What faculty do outside of a course seems to be more influential at a larger, more research focused institution, while what they do inside of class seems to be more influential at smaller and more teaching-focused colleges and universities.  Regardless, what faculty do and how students perceive what they do has a significant and rich impact on students' academic experience.   Finally, this project has shown that the relationships among support, belonging, and engagement are complex.   Many of the project outcomes vary by institution, and the data from the project clearly indicate that the cause for the differences is institutional culture.  While the complexity of relationships among support, belonging, and engagement limit generalizations, the importance of belonging is consistent across the institutions and majors studied.   This project has underscored the importance of working to ensure that every student who enters a university or college in the U.S. is provided viable opportunities to belong.   Without this sense of belonging, the student cannot fully benefit from higher education. This research effort resulted in roughly 1500 student surveys, 400 classroom observations, 200 students interviewed and more than 20 faculty interviewed.  More than twenty publications resulted from this project which can be consulted for more details.  Intellectual Merit: ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
