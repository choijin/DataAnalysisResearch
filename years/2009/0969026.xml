<AbstractNarration>Planning Grant for an I/UCRC for Advanced Non-Ferrous Structural Alloys&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;0969031 Colorado School of Mines; Michael Kaufman &lt;br/&gt;0969026 University of North Texas; Srinivasan Srivilliputhur&lt;br/&gt;     &lt;br/&gt;The Center for Advanced Non-Ferrous Structural Alloys will focus on the physical metallurgy of non-ferrous alloys (alloying and processing effects on microstructure, properties and performance) and on the industries that develop, manufacture, and use these alloys.  Colorado School of Mines (CSM) and the University of North Texas (UNT) are collaborating to establish the proposed center, with CSM as the lead institution.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed Center aims to establish the industrial support, operational mechanisms, and a prospective research portfolio for a viable research Center that will conduct critical basic and applied physical metallurgy research of direct relevance to the industries that develop, manufacture and use advanced non-ferrous structural alloys.  The PIs are proposing the following topical areas: solidification and casting, lightweight alloys (Al, Mg and Ti), high performance alloys (superalloys), and high production alloys.  The PIs will insure that students have the opportunity to work on state-of-the-art projects and be mentored by both experimental and modeling experts.  CSM and UNT plan to use the NSF planning grant fund to hold a meeting with prospective industrial partners to establish the proposed Center's organizational framework, and to establish research projects of greatest relevance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed Center has the potential to improve sustainability and profitability of US manufacturing by developing advanced non-ferrous alloys that could reduce energy consumption and pollution in the manufacturing of these alloys.  The research would also improve the competitiveness of US manufacturers.  The PIs will insure that both undergraduate and graduate students receive appropriate education and training to become well grounded in the fundamental principles of physical metallurgy. The Center plans to provide research opportunities to qualified students from underrepresented groups, and to hiring researchers (from the minority groups) at the faculty level that might expand the Center activities.  The proposed Center will showcase its activities and invite high school students from the local community to emphasize to them the role of structural materials in the world around them.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This Planning Grant allowed the PIs at the University of North Texas, in collaboration with the Colorado School of Mines, to successfully conduct the planning stages required for a full Industry/University Cooperative Research Center.  As a result a successful Planning Meeting in October 2010, the team of PIs at both institutions were able to secure the necessary commitments by a variety of industrial partners to launch a full Center focused on the advanced non-ferrous structural alloys.  Further, the team has identified and is in discussions with a large number of additional potential members.  The industrial members include members of the aerospace community, propulsion community, primary materials community, coatings community, and material processing experts.  May of them made commitments to join based upon the needs to maintain a leadership position in advanced non-ferrous structural alloys (titanium, nickel, magnesium, aluminum, etc), as well as to have students who are highly trained in this area.  It is expected that this center will be very successful, and will result in significant advances in projects that will immediately inpact the industrial partners and ultimately the broader community.  In addition, projects will also increase the number of students at both the graduate and undergraduate levels trained in these materials.
