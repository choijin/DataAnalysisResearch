<AbstractNarration>0941106&lt;br/&gt;Melchiorre&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant supports upgrade of an existing energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) mated to a scanning electron microscope (SEM) at California State University, San Bernardino (CSUSB).  Improved capability for microspatial chemical analysis will support PI research and student research training including: 1) studies of the origin of placer gold deposits; 2) assessment of the distribution of lead and zinc impacted soils adjoining abandoned highways in California; 3) chemostratigraphy of volcanic deposits; and 4) archaeological artifact provenance.  CSUSB is a Hispanic Serving Institution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>
