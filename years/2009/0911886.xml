<AbstractNarration>Computer Science (31)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Georgia Tech Information Security Center (GTISC), a designated Center of Academic Excellence, is the umbrella organization covering research and education in information security, information assurance, critical information infrastructure protection (IS/IA/CIIP) and related subjects across the Institute. Participating faculty and relevant degree programs exist in the College of Computing, which has a curriculum that supports a fully dedicated Master of Science in IS and about 30 PhD students in IS/IA; the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE); and the Sam Nunn School (SNS), including the Center for International Strategy, Technology and Policy (CISTP) that coverers technology-related homeland, national, and international security studies. In addition to about 10 courses that are wholly or largely dedicated to IS/IA/CIIP, these and other units offer a rich selection of graduate courses on networks, operating systems, software engineering, wireless communications, sensors, fault tolerance, risk and cost-benefit analyses, e-government, Human Computer Interaction, security analysis and policy, and telecommunications policy. The GTISC core has about a dozen faculty members, and approximately 30 additional faculty and research staff have serious interests in IS/IA/CIIP. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the current SFS program, several lessons have been learned that shape and focus the present proposal towards educating high quality, technically educated students in one of two Master's programs. One is in IS, and the other concentrates on policy and homeland/national/international security. The latter includes such areas as CIIP, criminal and terrorist use of cyberspace, international cooperation in dealing with cyber security problems, critical information systems for dealing with epidemics and other biologically-oriented threats, and IT-related security policies at several levels. Among students in the SNS, there is a pool of high achieving students, more than half women, with good communications skills, and a high percentage of clearable US citizens. They are particularly sensitive to people and policy issues in cyber security, and have no trouble taking a core of 3-4 technical IS/IA courses. Measured by academic performance and placement, they have proven to be the most successful contingent of SFS students we have had. All of them became interested in IS/IA/CIIP and government service because of the SFS program. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goals of this project were:  First and foremost: To educate and graduate SFS students, and to see them into suitable Federally approved positions.  To build capacity by developing 2-3 new courses.  To provide a smooth transition for students under this  grant to complete their funding periods and graduate under the new and  larger successor SFS program at Georgia Tech.  All of the students who were fully funded during the period of this grant have left Georgia Tech and have been placed in approved positions. All but one obtained their degrees. The one is a PhD student who has not completed his dissertation, but will hopefully do so while in federal employment. Two students who were partially and conditionally funded but still had eligibility have been covered under the new grant. Both have graduated and are suitably employed. One student from an earlier SFS grant who was released after an extensive but unsuccessful effort to find suitable employment has come back after a good career in the private sector and is now with a federal agency and doing well.  The students came from a wide spectrum of backgrounds including computer science, electrical and computer engineering, business administration, international affairs, economics, and data analytics.   Three new courses were offered at least once during the grant period, but we have been having trouble finding faculty to offer them on a permanent basis.  We were successful in obtaining a much larger new SFS grant and the transition from this grant to the next went well.
