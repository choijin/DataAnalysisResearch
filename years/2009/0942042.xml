<AbstractNarration>Computer Science (31) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This collaborative project from the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, Southern Polytechnic State University, and Tuskegee University develops a sequence of two cryptography courses. The first course adopts intensive labs and focuses on understanding the properties and vulnerabilities of various cryptography techniques. The second course challenges students with real-world cases in emerging areas in a collaborative environment. The project develops five teaching modules based on labs and case studies and conducts a detailed assessment of the proposed hands-on learning materials, case studies, and modules. The PIs organize three summer mini-workshops to train faculty members from the three campuses and other universities nationwide on how to use the new courses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project proposes novel pedagogies for undergraduate Cryptography and the hands-on exercises tied with cryptography topics teach students cryptographic algorithms and their vulnerabilities. The designed case studies bridge the gap between cryptographic theory and real-world cryptographic applications in emerging areas. The modules can be used in several courses such as network security or security management.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project facilitates faculty collaboration and development at three institutions in three states Tennessee, Georgia and Alabama. It broadens participations of minority students in Information Assurance due to the leadership of Tuskegee University, an experienced institution in minority education. Dissemination of the generated teaching materials is supported by summer mini-workshops, a dedicated website developed and maintained by the PIs, conference presentations, and journal publications.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Title - Collaborative Project: Teaching Cryptography through Hand-on Learning and Case Studies  This is a collaborative project lead by Dr. Li Yang, University of Tennessee at Chattanooga. The other PIÃ†s are Dr Andy Wang, Southern Polytechnic State University, and Dr. Chung-Han Chen, Tuskegee University.  The major goals of this project include:  Developed hands-on learning exercises and restructure lectures of a cryptography course. This activity addressed the shortage of hands-on pedagogical materials for cryptography Developed a course that uses case studies to teach cryptography (Crypto II). This improved the ability of students to applycryptographic techniques to solve real-world problems. Developed cryptography modules that will be incorporated into IA courses such as information security management, computer network security, and computer forensics, etc.    The following hand-on labs, case studies, and cryptography modules have been developed during the project period:   Hands-On Labs:     Lab on frequency analysis Lab on design criteria of S-box and P-box Lab on Testing Different Modes in Symmetric Ciphers Lab on RSA attacks and padding (short message attacks and timing attacks) Lab on hash function Lab on digital signature Lab on key management (CA) Lab on comprehensive exercise   Lab on differential cryptanalysis Lab on linear cryptanalysis   Case Studies:  Case 1: How do you secure BlackBerry devices?  Case 2: Do you trust others in virtual environment?  Case 3: Is SSL/TLS enough to secure e-commerce?  Case 4: How do you secure patient data?  Case 5: Ensure the validity of forensic evidence by using a hash function.   Cryptography Modules:  Module 1.Cryptography Basics  Module 2. Network Security  Module 3.E-commerce/Web Security  Module 4.Security Management  Module 5. Digital Forensics   All materials can be downloaded at: http://www.codebridge.org/utc-cryptolabs/   "This Project Outcomes Report for the General Public is displayed verbatim as submitted by the Principal Investigator (PI) for this award.
