<AbstractNarration>Lagrangian methods assume a central role in the analysis and visualization of vector fields resulting from simulation and measurement across many application domains. These methods provide key insight into vector field structures and dynamics, but are based on the expensive computation of integral curves. Applied to large-scale problems and data sets, they are burdened heavily by enormous computational cost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To improve this situation, the problem-specific computation of integral curves employed in vector field visualization techniques is replaced by a two-stage process consisting of an adaptive pre-computation of integral curve sets and methods for interpolation within these sets, effectively transferring the vector field representation to the Lagrangian domain. Hence, the computational burden is isolated into a pre-computation stage. The obtained Lagrangian representation is stored into efficient out-of-core data structures. Integration-based visualization algorithms can leverage the resulting fast interpolation of integral curves, whose approximative characteristics are examined in detail, from this pre-computed data. This generic framework permits enhancement of existing integration-based visualization methods to become interactive and provides a basis for research into novel efficient and interactive vector field visualization for very large vector fields. Taking advantage of these properties, new visualization tools are developed to study transport processes in vector fields using Lagrangian analysis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To increase the impact of this research and distribute it to a large community of scientists and engineers, the developed algorithms are integrated with an open-source visualization package. These new techniques are integrated into coursework and student projects that enable students to study new methods of analysis of flow computations. Information concerning these new methods are found on the project website (http://idav.ucdavis.edu/~joy/NSF-IIS-0916289).&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The study of fluid flows is an essential topic in a broad range of engineering, bio-medical and scientific applications. Examples include application areas such as combustion, turbo-machinery, automotive engineering, and aeronautics. Modern simulation techniques utilize computer models that allow one to study many application scenarios. Flow visualization method play a key role in this effort by providing tools that allow increased insight into and understanding of these complex flow datasets.  The primary activity in our work was to develop new methods for the visual analysis of flow, specifically through Lagrangian techniques.  Lagrangian techniques are new, in that they utilize a mathematical concept of "Lyapunov Exponent" and "Lagrangian Coherent Structures" to allow us to visualize characteristics of flow about a point.  They are costly to calculate, but give new information about the flow.  Enabled by this work, we have created several new visualization methods that have led us to address a variety of problems throughout the flow visualization area, and establish several new techniques that were not previously possible.  We have worked on the concept of "flow maps", changing the data representation for flow from arrows (direction vectors) residing at grid points, to short timeline/pathline/streamlines emantating from grid points.  This required new methods to establish and track streamline/timeline/pathlines at points, but was faster, took up less memory, and was more accurate than past methods.    We have worked on establishing new visualization methods for flow, notably stream surfaces, time surfaces, and streak surfaces.  These methods greatly enhance the legacy methods for flow that were basically used only on early static problems, where the flow did not move over time.  Our new techniques can be used on dynamic flows, flows that change in time, and they vastly increase the capabilities of the scientist examining the flow.   We have worked on a number of applications of these methods, frequently together with scientists examining complex flows.  The most notable is a collaboration with PC-MRI researchers on blood flow above the heart.  We were able to examine the reverse vortex in the aortic arch above the heart.     As computational methods improve, and computer systems get faster, scientists can collect massive data from simulations by continuously running the simulation with different parameters.  These so-called ensembles are extremely difficult to analyze, but provide significant insight into the scientific application.  These simulations produce large collections of flow data sets, each of which are simulated with different parameters, and they must  be analyzed as a collection.  We were among the first to discover methods to analyze these new types of data.   The analysis of flow is difficult, yet it is extremely important to advance our knowledge in engineering and science.  The new techniques developed under this project have enabled a significant advance in the methods of flow visualization.
