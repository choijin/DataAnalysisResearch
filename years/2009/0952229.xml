<AbstractNarration>Geomorphic processes that sculpt landscapes and constitute natural hazards vary with climatic fluctuations that have characterized the last several million years of Earth history.  While some climate-driven erosional processes, such as glaciers, leave a profound topographic imprint, others are more difficult to decipher.  Changes in vegetation, for example, should affect the frequency and magnitude of landslides and the vigor of soil production and transport on hillslopes, yet there is sparse information regarding landscape response to late Quaternary variations in vegetation.  By coupling records of paleo-erosion and paleo-ecology from a landslide-dammed lake in the Oregon Coast Range, this research will document how late Quaternary vegetation changes translated into landscape modification.  The study will extend and augment a previously published paleoenvironmental record showing that the structure and composition of forests in the study area have changed dramatically over the last 40,000+ years.  By analyzing paleo-erosion rates using cosmogenic radionuclides  from additional lake sediment cores, the study will determine whether increases in the density and size of trees tend to increase or decrease rates of sediment transport and erosion.  Although trees and understory vegetation are important for anchoring soil and suppressing erosion over human timescales, bioturbation is thought to be a major driver of landscape change when integrated through time.  As such, the net geomorphic effect of a change from meadow-dominated, parkland forests to closed, coniferous forests is difficult to predict with the current knowledge base.  The project results will address first-order linkages between climate and geomorphic processes and test emerging numerical models that assess how landscapes evolve in response to millenial-scale climate and vegetation changes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research project seeks to document and quantify how changes in climate and vegetation over the last 40,000 years have affected rates of erosion in a steep, forested landscape.  The anticipated outcomes are important for predicting how future climate change will influence landscape dynamics as well as interpreting human-induced changes, such as those associated with timber harvesting.  Although numerous numerical models exist to predict landscape adjustment to climate change, the governing equations are poorly understood and in particular, the role of vegetation requires significant quantitative advancement.  By exploiting a detailed sedimentary record preserved in a lake from a mountainous environment, the results will reveal how ecosystems and landscapes may have co-evolved to generate the current terrain.  The results should also reveal whether 'events' or periods of rapid surface change have occurred in recent geological history in response to climate or vegetation change.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     Weathering and erosion of rock and soil depend on climate and vegetation.  It is well known that glaciers can scour deep valleys, and that many glaciated mountains were highly eroded during the last glacial maximum about 20,000 years ago.  Evidence for this erosion includes steep slopes of bare rock and talus and piles of glacial sediment that accumulated downvalley.  In unglaciated landscapes, however, the role of climate is much less clear.  Past climate changes have caused vegetation to change from forest to grassland, but the erosional response of these changes are difficult to discern, and even more difficult to quantify.   We have investigated a lake in Oregon that was dammed by a natural landslide prior to the last glaciation.  The lake has been partially filled with sediment that was eroded from its watershed.  By coring the lake bed, dating the sediment, and identifying pollen and plant fragments we were able to reconstruct past vegetation communities over a full glacial-interglacial climate cycle.  We see that the vegetation during the coldest period was similar to the present-day community in Hyder, Alaska.   We are able to infer how erosion rates changed through time using cosmogenic 10Be in the sediment.  Beryllium-10 is produced within the mineral quartz by nuclear reactions from secondary cosmic rays.   These cosmic rays penetrate about a meter below the ground surface, so the buildup of 10Be in a mineral grain indicates how long it has been exposed near the ground surface in soil and shallow bedrock.  Beryllium-10 measurement in stream sediment is now a standard method for inferring erosion rates in quartz-bearing landscapes.  By analyzing 10Be in quartz collected from throughout the core, we were able to decipher how erosion rates changed through time, and if they matched changes in vegetation.  We see that erosion rates during the coldest period were about three times faster than they are today, even though the watershed was never glaciated.  Climate clearly had a strong influence on erosion rates.   We postulate that this is because the temperature dropped to a point where frost-cracking of the sandstone bedrock was significant.  Frost-cracking occurs when lenses of ice grow inside the bedrock, forcing cracks to open and facilitating weathering and erosion of the weakened sandstone bedrock.  Climate modeling shows that the central Oregon Coast Range where we sampled would have been in an ideal climate for frost-cracking at the same time that we see enhanced erosion rates.  This research has brought together scientists from a variety of disciplines to study a problem that will have far-reaching implications for understanding erosion and sediment delivery in cold but unglaciated landscapes around the world.  We suspect that the processes we see in Oregon were widespread during previous cold climates, and may have been largely overlooked.  We have reached out to landowners and schoolchildren in our study area to help them understand the landscape in which they live and to introduce them to our science.  This work has funded the Ph.D. of a female scientist with a promising research career in understanding the interactions between soil, vegetation, and climate.
