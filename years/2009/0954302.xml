<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award consists of answering an important, fundamental question: how does mechanical connectivity between the nucleus and the cytoskeleton control key cell functions like cell mechanosensing, cell motility and cell adhesion? Mechanical forces control the in vivo development of tissues and are crucial for the in vitro development of tissue substitutes like artificial arteries and tissue-engineered heart valves. The molecular mechanisms by which cells sense mechanical stimuli and transduce them into signaling responses are not well-understood. The research approach combines engineering techniques to apply controlled mechanical stimuli to cells, with molecular biology techniques to interfere with the function of nesprin proteins that physically link the nucleus and the cytoskeleton. The following objectives are proposed: 1) Determine the mechanism by which nesprin family proteins control cell sensing of applied forces. 2) Test the hypothesis that nuclear-cytoskeletal linkages regulate cell sensing of substrate rigidity. 3) Determine the extent to which nesprins transfer mechanical force between the nucleus and the cytoskeleton. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will lead to improved understanding of tissue development where mechanical forces control developmental gene expression, embryogenesis and tissue patterning. The proposed research will develop molecular-level understanding of cell mechanosensing. Consequently, it will aid the success of engineering strategies which use mechanical forces for developing tissue substitutes with improved performance. Given the ever-growing need for tissue substitutes, this research has strong potential for benefitting society. The educational program will impact students at different levels over the award period including middle and high school students, and undergraduate students from under-represented groups.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The nucleus of the mammalian cell which houses the genome is molecularly bound to structures in the cell. It is known that disrupting molecular linkages between nucleus and cell causes cell, tissue and organ dysfunction, although how this happens is not understood.  We tested two inter-related ideas: 1) that molecular linkers transmit mechanical force between the nucleus and cell, and 2) disrupting molecular linkers causes nuclear forces which impact mechanical function of the cell.   To test these two ideas, we developed a host of novel approaches that sought to measure and/or apply controlled mechanical force on the nuclear surface. Using a new method, we applied a nanoNewton force to the nuclear surface to pull on it. Remarkably we found that the nucleus deforms instead of moving when the force is applied, which directly indicates the extent of tight mechanical integration between the nucleus and the cell. We demonstrated that the mechanical integration depends on the molecular linkers.  In other studies, we quantified traction forces exerted by cells on soft solid materials, and estimated the force exerted on the nucleus by a migrating cell. We proposed the novel idea that force transmission through the nucleus is required for the cell to detach its trailing edge, and to migrate efficiently.  We have also discovered that disrupting molecular linkers interrupts the transmission of force from the external surroundings to the nuclear surface, and disrupts the cellÃ†s ability to sense mechanical forces. The ability to sense mechanical stress is crucial for cells in the blood supply network, and our results provide an explanation for cell dysfunction in human diseases associated with abnormal nuclear-cell linkage.  The educational program mentored an African American student from Morehouse college who performed summer research in the laboratory, several undergraduate students many of whom were from minority backgrounds, high school students who performed research in the laboratory and PhD students including female students. This award also enabled the PI to teach science at a middle school every week for over a period of two years. The middle school serves a large percentage of under-represented groups.
