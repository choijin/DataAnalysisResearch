<AbstractNarration>This project focuses on the design, development, and evaluation of the effectiveness of computing interventions to assist parents in ensuring the healthy development of their child.  As young children undergo rapid development and learn skills that will influence their entire lives, regular visits to a pediatrician and detailed record-keeping can ensure that children are progressing and can identify early warning signs of developmental delay or disability.  The PI will use a comprehensive human-centered approach to explore and understand the tensions and opportunities for technology to support the health of young children while involving parents and professionals across diverse and underserved populations.  The PI will seek to create feasible and effective technologies that motivate and encourage record-keeping by parents.  Both qualitative and quantitative research methods will be employed to validate technology designs using a long-term study lasting 18 months in collaboration with Seattle Children's Health and Seattle King-County Public Health.  Research outcomes will include:  Discovery of design requirements for technologies to support the health of young children, especially for families from diverse and underserved populations;  A suite of three new technologies based on the design requirements that leverage mobile and social computing technologies for assisting parents of young children with tracking their child's health information and learning about children's health;  Validation of computing technology as a viable means of supporting parent record-keeping, of increasing parent knowledge and confidence in their child's developmental progress, and improving parent-pediatrician communication.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  This research involves conducting formative studies that further our knowledge of how health technology can be designed for underserved populations so as to minimize anxiety and support the doctor-patient relationship.  Thus, the project will address a major public health goal of more closely tracking the health and development of young children, especially those from lower income backgrounds and those with developmental delay.  The findings will have implications for domains beyond early childhood development.  Project outcomes will expand our knowledge about how mobile and social computing applications can be developed and adapted based on the financial and time constraints of the users.  Finally, this work will help refine techniques for evaluating technology applications designed for behavior change and long term outcomes, which in turn will advance the field of Human-Computer Interaction in general.</AbstractNarration>

These formative studies led to design considerations and insights into the design of interactive tools to support families in tracking children's development. Primary design considerations from this phase included: 1) no single technology will reach and engage all families&ndash;we need to meet them where they are; 2) many families are already motivated to keep sentimental records like photos and memories&ndash;we can link screening with these activities; and 3) care must be taken to reduce the emotional burden and potential anxiety surrounding developmental tracking.</p> <p>Through a human-centered design process, we designed, developed, and evaluated a set of three technology tools for helping parents with tracking their children's development. This included 1) a social-media supported tool using Twitter to reach and engage families in the process of tracking development, 2) a text-messaging tool that prompts parents to answer questions about their child's development through text messaging, and 3) a web portal that allows parents to engage in sentimental record-keeping, including creating a timeline of their child's development and uploading photos and videos for sharing. We conducted pilot deployment studies for all 3 technologies and determined the tools were usable and feasible for tracking children's developmental progress in the short-term, though a simplified approach to using social media may be more sustainable than using Twitter.</p> <p>To assess the suitability of the tools for sustaining engagement over the long-term, we conducted a 15-month deployment study with 139 families using two versions of the Baby Steps system. The experimental version consisted of the full Baby Steps system including the web portal with sentimental tracking, text-messaging, and simplified links to social media. The control version consisted of only a web-based tool for completing a developmental screener, similar to current approaches. We compared the use of the two systems in improving connection to resources, parent engagement, and user burden.</p> <p>We found that both versions of the system connected families to early intervention services at a similar rate and that both systems had low user burden, but parents using the experimental system had fewer drop outs and answered more screening questions, indicating a higher level of long-term engagement. The text messaging component in particular seems to have driven this engagement, as we saw increased use of the system after that feature was introduced. Parents in the experimental group also found the system to be significantly more useful than those in the control group.</p> <p>Parents using the full version of Baby Steps commented that they credited the system in helping them feel educated as first time parents and in identifying and addressing a problem early. Parents in the control group indicated they would like reminders, which was a critical component of the text messaging system. Participants in both groups indicated a smartphone version would help increase the usability and accessibility of the system further.</p> <p>As a whole, this research opened a new line of inquiry into the concept of user burden in computing systems.
