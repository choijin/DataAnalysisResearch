<AbstractNarration>PSERC is proposing a Phase III support (third five-year period) for the Center, including support for center personnel, evaluation and research.  The proposed Center is a multi-university Center comprised of the following universities: Arizona State University (lead), Cornell University, Texas A &amp; M, Howard University, Washington State University, the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Iowa S ate University, Wichita State University, Georgia Tech, the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, the University of California-Berkeley, and Colorado School of Mines.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The proposal from PSERC seeks funding for a Phase III (3rd five-year period) led by Arizona State University (ASU). PSERC had its origin as a multi-university IUCRC in 1996, and was created with the vision that collaboration amongst a large group of academic, industrial, and governmental institutions can develop solutions to the complex problems in electric energy. PSERC (currently comprised of 12 universities) will conduct research organized under three primary research stem areas: markets stem, system stem, and transmission and distribution technologies stem. PSERC leverages the expertise of some 40 multidisciplinary researchers. The PI and all of the other site directors are very well-qualified and have access to appropriate and adequate resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work addresses important improvements and advancements in the transmission and delivery of electricity. PSERC has been a leader in in developing several key concepts with regard to the development of electricity markets. PSERC researchers also developed one of the first large scale visualization tools for the electric power industry, and this effort has resulted in the creation of a company that has commercially developed the tool. Over the past six years, PSERC member companies have employed an average of 80 graduate and undergraduate students per year from PSERC universities. In the area of diversity, one of the PSERC member universities is Howard University, a historically black university. PSERC will continue to seek women and minorities through students and faculty at member universities as well as on an individual basis as research associates.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Power Systems Engineering Research Center   The Power Systems Engineering Research Center (PSERC) draws on university capabilities to creatively address the challenges facing the electric power industry. Its core purpose is to empower minds to engineer the future electric energy system. Under the banner of PSERC, multiple U.S. universities are working collaboratively toward:  engage in forward-thinking about future scenarios for the industry and the challenges that might arise from them conduct research for innovative solutions to these challenges using multidisciplinary research expertise in a unique multi-campus work environment facilitate interchange of ideas and collaboration among academia, industry and government on critical industry issues educate the next generation of power industry engineers.   PSERC provides:  efficient access to experienced university researchers in an array of relevant disciplines and geographically located across the U.S. leading-edge research in cost-effective projects jointly developed by industry leaders and university experts high quality education of future power engineers.   The multidisciplinary expertise of PSERC's researchers includes power systems, applied mathematics, complex systems, computing, control theory, power electronics, operations research, non-linear systems, economics, industrial organization and public policy. PSERC partners with private and public organizations that provide integrated energy services, transmission and distribution services, power system planning, control and oversight, market management services, and public policy development.
