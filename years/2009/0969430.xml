<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to discover new fundamental theories and algorithms for stochastic optimal control with application in solar energy transmission.  The approach is based on novel statistical control with cost cumulants and neural networks.  In statistical control, one views the performance index as a random variable and shapes the distribution of the performance index.  By shaping the performance index, more accurate control performance is achieved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit.  A new optimal control paradigm of performance shaping is proposed.   This paradigm will lead to a new direction of research in optimal control for the general nonlinear stochastic systems.  By using artificial neural networks, this project proposes to solve the nonlinear optimal control problems.  Nonlinear statistical control will allow high performance controllers for various applications.  This transformative optimal control theory is applied to a high societal impact application of space solar power harvesting.  Statistical control will significantly improve the solar power transmission performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts.  This project will advance the fundamental knowledge in optimal stochastic control.  By applying a new optimal control method to the space solar power transmission application, the energy will be transmitted more accurately, which means that the energy is harvested more economically.  This research will allow efficient space solar energy transmission by addressing the antenna pointing control problem.  Space solar energy harvesting is an issue of national strategic importance.  Furthermore, through this project and spacecraft systems engineering course, students of underrepresented groups will be educated about engineering and state-of-the-art research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A novel control theory called statistical optimal control was developed in this project.  This method allows us to control a laser targeting system more accurately. The solution was derived using a new numerical method. We also developed a hardware testbed to validate the developed control algorithm.   We found out that the new method performed more than 20% better than other more traditional control methods such as proportional-integral-derivative and H-infinity methods.   This project produced three thesis, three top journal publications, and four conference publications.  Among other applications, this project has an application on the solar energy transmission.   Accurate pointing of the solar energy transmission from the space to antennas on the ground will allow more efficient transmission.   We built a small scale testbed to validate our controller.  As a broader impact, we trained four doctoral students and five undergraduate students during this project.  Two thesis, five conference publications, and four journal publications were generated by these students.  Three students participated in summer undergraduate research program, which exposed students to this NSF research.  More than forty students took systems engineering course about aerospace engineering.  Over one hundred K-8 students visited Temple University to learn about STEM field.  Most of these K-8 students were members of underrepresented groups.       Last Modified: 06/16/2014       Submitted by: Chang-Hee Won]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
