<AbstractNarration>The proposed research aims at developing methods for solving stochastic dynamic optimization problems that involve risk-averse preferences. Mathematical models of risk aversion capture entire distributions of random outcomes with increased attention to events of small probability and high consequences.  The project will concentrate on multistage stochastic optimization problems and on Markov decision processes incorporating dynamic risk measures and dynamic stochastic ordering constraints.  The proposed numerical approach integrates modern theories of risk measures and stochastic orders with decomposition techniques for large-scale optimization problems, methods of nonsmooth optimization, and stochastic control methods.  The approach will be based on sequential risk-neutral approximations of risk-averse problems. The approximations will be used to devise primal and dual decomposition methods for multistage problems with dynamic risk measures and dynamic stochastic ordering constraints. Special attention will be paid to Markov decision problems. A theory of Markov risk measures and risk-averse dynamic programming will be developed. Numerical methods for risk-averse dynamic programming will also explore the idea of sequential risk-neutral approximations.&lt;br/&gt;The project will provide qualitative advance in areas involving multi-stage decision-making in stochastic systems under high uncertainty and risk. It will provide modeling and algorithmic tools to formalize and solve long-term planning problems in which risk is an important issue and average performance criteria are insufficient.  Problems of this nature arise in supply chain management, military planning problems, energy production and distribution, telecommunication, insurance and finance, medicine, and other areas. The project will benefit the graduate education at Rutgers University and Stevens Institute of Technology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Decision problems under uncertainty arise in many areas: energy production and distribution, telecommunication, insurance and finance, logistics, medicine, security and military applications. In most cases the decisions have to be made over time: decisions, as well as the random environment, influence evolution of a system, which creates the need to make new decisons, etc. Therefore, a policy has to be designed which incorporates rules for responding to future states of the system. So far, most theoretical models of such decision problems were based on average performance criteria.  This project was concerned with multistage decision problems in which risk aversion is essential, with risk understood as the possibility of occurrence of highly undesirable scenarios. The following issues were addressed:  1. Construction of proper mathematical models of risk aversion in time-evolving systems;  2. Analysis of dynamic decision problems involving risk aversion; and  3. Development of numerical methods for solving such problems.  The main achievement in the first area is the advance of the theory of dynamic measures of risk. The class of time-consistent measures of risk has been analysed and their useful mathematical representations constructed. Special measures of risk suitable for stochastic Markov models have been identifierd and analyzed. Significant achievements were made in the theory of stochastic dominance, by introducing concepts of robust and approximate dominance relations.  In the second direction of research, optimality conditions for multistage problems with dynamic measures of risk have been developed. In particular, for Markov models these conditions take on the form of dynamic programming equations. For models with dominance constraints, the role of utility functions has been revealed. As an important theoretical byproduct of the research, new unifying theory of utility models has been developed.  In the third area, novel decomposition methods for risk-averse multistage problems have been constructed and tested on a production planning example. Several numerical methods for solving risk-averse dynamic programming equations have been developed and tested on examples in medicine and finance. Moreover, new methods for solving optimization problems with stochastic dominance constraints have been developed.  Applications to portfolio optimization, credit limit control, and supply chain management were used to motivate and evaluate the research in this project.  One female doctoral student was supported  by the project. Some project funds were used to support organization of a workshop on optimization of stochastic systems. Twelve publications in refereed journals acknowledge support from the project.       Last Modified: 08/09/2013       Submitted by: Andrzej Ruszczynski]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
