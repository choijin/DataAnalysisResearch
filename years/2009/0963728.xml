<AbstractNarration>The "Penn State- Göttingen International Summer Schools in Mathematics" will be held during Summer 2010 at Penn State University, during Summer 2011 at the Georg-August-Universität in Göttingen, Germany, and during Summer 2012 at Penn State University. The summer school will be scheduled for three weeks and will have a different thematic focus each year. The first two weeks will concentrate on educational activities, while during the third week an international research conference will be held on the featured topic. The target audience for the project is undergraduate and beginning graduate students in mathematics who are based in the U.S. and in Germany. The summer schools integrate education and research and offer international experiences in instruction and collaboration for students at an early stage of their mathematical career. During each summer school, faculty from both Penn State and the University of Göttingen will conduct lecture courses and supervise student work. Students will work in international teams to accomplish theoretical work, work in a computer lab, and carry out comprehensive projects. The program will also facilitate networking between students and researchers. Students will experience the research atmosphere in the field at the international research conference. Part of the conference program will be an information forum about graduate work and graduate school application procedures and selection criteria.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The summer schools will contribute to attracting and retaining talented students to pursue graduate work and mathematical careers in academia, industry, and government, both in the United States and in Germany. They will provide international education and research experiences, promote the exchange of ideas and mutual understanding of different disciplinary cultures, and will enhance the ability of the participating students to engage in international collaborations in their future professional careers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of the three Penn State &ndash; G&ouml;ttingen International Summer Schools in Mathematics on Differential Equations (in 2010), Dynamical Systems (in 2011), and Number Theory (in 2012) was to provide a program that integrates education and research for undergraduate and beginning graduate students in mathematics who are enrolled in Universities in the United States and in Germany. Each Summer School was a three-week program that featured two weeks of coursework as well as supervised work on undergraduate research projects in small teams comprised of students originating from both countries. The third week of each Summer School featured an international research conference with experts in the field.  The primary objectives of all three Summer Schools have been the following:  Expose students to an international environment of instruction.  This objective was achieved through lecture courses delivered by faculty members from Penn State University, the University of G&ouml;ttingen in Germany, and from other Universities in the United States and in Europe during each Summer School. Moreover, the research conferences during the last week of each program also featured invited overview talks or mini-courses by experts in the field. These lectures were specifically geared towards the participating students.  Thus students were exposed to and experienced first-hand similarities and differences in the disciplinary culture and the approach towards teaching mathematics at the University level in different countries. Facilitate international collaborations.  This objective was achieved primarily through undergraduate research projects that the students worked on in small teams during and after the Summer Schools. Each team was comprised of both U.S. and German students. A selection of the resulting project papers is available from the web pages devoted to the Summer Schools (see below). Facilitate networking between students and researchers.  This objective was achieved through the integrated research conference that was held during the third week of the program each year. These conferences provided ample opportunity for interactions between the participating students and active researchers in the specific field of mathematics featured by the Summer School. The coursework during the program prior to the conferences was designed in part to lay or augment necessary foundations so that the students would have a rewarding and inspiring conference experience. Recruit talented students to pursue a career in mathematics.  In addition to the activities already mentioned, an information session in the form of a panel discussion on graduate education in the United States and in Germany was held during each Summer School.   The following web pages are devoted to the three Summer Schools: Summer School 2010 on Differential Equations  http://math.aa.psu.edu/~summerschool/  This web page contains information about the participating students and showcases six student research papers that were produced during and after the Summer School 2010. One of these papers was published in 2012 in Volume 5 of SIAM Undergraduate Research Online. Moreover, this web page contains information about the lecture courses and mini-courses that were held during the program with references to the literature and/or lecture notes available for download. The titles and abstracts of talks (and slides for some of these talks) that were given during the conference week are available for viewing and download from this web page as well, along with a list and discussion of open problems that were proposed by conference participants during an Open Problem Session at the conference week.  At the time of writing of this report in June of 2013, 15 out of the 17 students originating from U.S. Universities who attended the Summer School in 2010 went on to pursue graduate studies in STEM disciplines.
