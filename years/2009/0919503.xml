<AbstractNarration>University of Miami proposes to support technical services on two research vessels, one operated by the University?s Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences (RSMAS) and one operated by Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution (HBOI).  Both are operated as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) research fleet.  Ships to be supported include R/V Walton Smith (RSMAS) and R/V Seward Johnson (HBOI).  As part of their basic operations they will provide one (Smith) or two (SJ) technicians on each seagoing research project, and will maintain, calibrate and provide for qualified users items from their pool of shared-use research instrumentation.  The budget included with this proposal is for the first year of a 3-year continuing grant.</AbstractNarration>
