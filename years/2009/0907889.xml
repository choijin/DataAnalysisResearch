<AbstractNarration>Proposal Number: IIS - 0907889&lt;br/&gt;PI: John Gero&lt;br/&gt;Institution: George Mason University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Problem: Visual and spatial reasoning often play pivotal roles in design creativity, most noticeably through sketching, diagrams, visualization and visual imagery. There is research on visual and spatial reasoning in multiple disciplines but very little is focused on design creativity. There is a need to bring this research to bear onto design creativity to improve it. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Proposal: This Workshop brings together the leading researchers from the disciplines that carry out research into visual and spatial reasoning of relevance to design creativity: &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; design science, &lt;br/&gt; computer science, &lt;br/&gt; cognitive science, and &lt;br/&gt; neuroscience &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;in order to define the state-of-the-art and to produce the opportunity for transdisciplinary activity related to design creativity. The workshop format allows a focus on discussion and groups work on research agendas and grand challenges. Presentations are catalysts for discussion rather than the primary focus. To improve international collaboration, the workshop is held in France. One doctoral student from each area is also invited. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Each of the four sciences studies visual and spatial reasoning in isolation without a focus on design creativity. Bringing together researchers from these different communities provides opportunities for transdisciplinary research. Making designing the focus is expected to result in knowledge about processes for studying visual and spatial reasoning that will produce new knowledge about design creativity. One enduring output of the workshop will be archival proceedings, expected to be published by Springer. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: Design creativity holds the key to transformational products and processes. The outcomes of this workshop will form the basis of the development of a research agenda for visual and spatial reasoning in design creativity and provide the basis for an education agenda to improve the creativity of designers. The aim is to develop international research collaborations. Studying visual and spatial reasoning produces knowledge of design creativity. The knowledge derived from studying design creativity has the potential to form the foundations of new kinds of support tools for creative designing. Attention to a diverse and inclusive group of discussants, attention to design for social impact, and plans for a larger conference are also elements of the meeting.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

There is research on visual and spatial reasoning in multiple disciplines but very little is focused on design creativity. Four disparate disciplines carry out scientific studies of creativity: design science, computer science, cognitive science and neuroscience.  Design has become a fruitful research area for cognitive scientists and computer scientists as well as for design scientists. For cognitive scientists it represents a particularly rich and open environment within which to study complex human behavior. For computer scientists it represents a challenging area. For design scientists the tools to study and model designers are only now becoming available. For neuroscientists design is largely a novel domain. Each of these four sciences studies visual and spatial reasoning researches creativity in isolation without a focus on design creativity.   The workshop participants presented the state-of-the-art of the research in their discipline. In addition to the state-of-the-art the workshop resulted in outlining the major research challenges ahead and explored educational opportunities that can be foundational in aiding individual and team creativity.  By bringing together researchers from these different communities the workshop provided opportunities to lay the foundation for transdisciplinary research. This has the potential to improve American creative design.  The material presented at the workshop will be publicly available through the publication of an edited book Studying Visual and Spatial Reasoing for Design Creativity to be published by Springer.
