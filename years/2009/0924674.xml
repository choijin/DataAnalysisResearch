<AbstractNarration>Humans are unique in that they can learn and use language. However, we share many brain mechanisms for perception and action with our primate cousins, the monkeys and apes. The proposed research will chart how these shared brain mechanisms provide the basis for the uniquely human brain mechanisms that support the learning, perception, and production of language. The key idea is based on the mirror system, a system for controlling both the execution and observation of action, found for grasping in moneys.  This idea  was extended "beyond the mirror" in humans to encompass mechanisms for language. The approach to the research is computational: to develop computer programs that make explicit the implications of ape and monkey data and human data for analysis of the human language-ready brain. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study of language within a more general understanding of action and perception may ground new approaches to language education and the treatment of language disorders. In particular, linguists have long debated what it is about language that is innate and what reflects the child's social learning. The assumptions of different schools of thought clearly influence approaches to language education. By laying bare underlying brain mechanisms that include an account of neural plasticity, the proposed research has the potential to transform the innateness debate in ways that can inform educators. To support this, the research will also develop a new information infrastructure, the Brain Operation Database, which will provide a repository of summaries of the empirical data used to test and develop models, descriptions of the models themselves together with summarized simulation results, and tools for comparing the success of different models in explaining known data and supporting predictions for new empirical research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work is co-funded by SBE/BCS and CISE/IIS/RI.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Brain mechanisms underlying the human use of language are too often analyzed without due attention to the extent to which they overlap with mechanisms relevant to other modes of motor control and perception. The brains of macaque monkeys contain "mirror neurons," each of which is active for both the execution of specific hand actions and for the observation of similar actions performed by others. A similar "mirror system for manual actions" has been found by imaging the human brain in an area, BrocaÆs area, traditionally associated with speech production. Why are these functions associated in the human brain? An important explanation has been provided by the Mirror System Hypothesis for "How the Brain Got Language" which holds that communication via gestures rather than voice was a crucial step for our distant ancestors, and that this led to a protosign system that paved the way for protospeech. The Hypothesis holds that mechanisms supporting the parity property for language (that the hearer can perceive what was meant by the speaker) evolved atop a mirror system for grasping homologous to that found in macaques, but extended "beyond the mirror" in humans to encompass mechanisms for imitation, protosign and protospeech as a basis for language.
