<AbstractNarration>This award funds doctoral dissertation research that uses lab decision making experiments to test hypotheses about the effects of legislative apportionment on the allocation of resources.  These hypotheses are developed from a political economy model that uses game theory methods.  This model predicts that the allocation of power to propose how to allocate funds and not the allocation of power to vote on that proposal that determines how legislatures allocate resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this award include the support of graduate education, the involvement of undergraduates in conducting the research, and the interdisciplinary impact of this research on game theory, economics, and political science.</AbstractNarration>
