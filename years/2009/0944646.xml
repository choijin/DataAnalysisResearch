<AbstractNarration>This research project will continue studies of a taxonomically definitive group of early evolving (single-chambered) Foraminifera at both multi-gene molecular and ultrastructural levels of analysis, in order to generate more robust and detailed phylogenies of these ecologically-important organisms. Studies will be extended to include members of the enigmatic genus Gromia, to better define their ecological significance and placement within the protistan supergroup Rhizara. Together, these structural and molecular data will be used to complete taxonomic descriptions of over 20 new rhizarian species. The research will develop rapid molecular screening methods for future ecological studies of rhizarian protists, and uncover the driving forces that led to their diversification. A range of educational activities will target local and national audiences, and include development of hands-on, standards-based, innovative science classroom activities. In addition, a short art/science documentary film depicting research on the biology and evolution of Antarctic rhizarian protists will form the basis of a workshop hosted by the Capital Region Center for Arts in Education.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit  This project investigated the evolutionary history and modern distribution of foraminiferan protists, an important group of single-celled marine organisms. McMurdo Sound, Antarctica is home to an unusually abundant and diverse array of evolutionarily "primitive" foraminifera.
