<AbstractNarration>This research project builds upon recent advances in stereotype threat research by investigating a Multi-Threat Framework that distinguishes between different forms of stereotype threat.  Situational aspects of academic and organizational environments, such as filling out demographic information immediately before taking a test, being the only woman in an engineering firm, or being the only racial minority in an upper division course at an elite university, can make salient negative stereotypes that elicit a cascade of distracting thoughts and concerns. Stereotype threat research reveals that these concerns ultimately create disparities in cognition, motivation, and performance in stereotype-relevant tasks and fields.  This work focuses on the psychological experience of stereotype threat and helps to explain why women, racial/ethnic minorities, and other commonly stereotyped groups are under-represented in many fields. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed experiments will test the differentiability of the stereotype threats, drawing from well-established cognitive tasks and traditional stereotype threat paradigms. The first set of experiments explores the different stereotype threats that emerge in different situations. The second set of experiments explores the different stereotype threats that are likely to emerge between and within negatively stereotyped groups. The third set of experiments will employ the Multi-Threat Framework to test interventions designed to reduce the different forms of stereotype threat.  Ultimately, this research can enhance our knowledge of who is at risk for stereotype threat, when they are at risk, why they are at risk, and how to reduce that risk.  In addition, given that the topic of stereotype threat is of interest to undergraduate and graduate students, this research will facilitate hands-on research training as well as conference participation and publications.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  When it comes to explaining achievement gaps and social disparities between majority and under-represented groups, commentators and researchers alike often focus on cultural, parental, or even biological factors. However, another factor, the psychological experience of stereotype threat&mdash;a concern about confirming a negative stereotype associated with one's group&mdash;demonstrates that situational aspects of academic and organizational environments can also create disparities in cognition, motivation, and performance in stereotype-relevant fields (Steele, Spencer, &amp; Aronson, 2002).  A closer look at this literature reveals that "stereotype threat" often means different things to different researchers and is often employed to describe and explain distinct processes and phenomena. The present research takes a more fine-grained approach to stereotype threat, proposing a novel conceptualization of multiple, qualitatively distinct stereotype threats that are elicited by different variables, are moderated and mediated by different factors, are experienced to different degrees by different groups, and most importantly, will require different interventions to overcome. Specifically, the Multi-Threat Framework (Shapiro &amp; Neuberg, 2007, PSPR) outlines six core stereotype threats that emerge from the intersection of two dimensions&mdash;the target (the self/one?s group) and the source (the self/others) of the stereotype threat. The proposed research aimed to differentiate between these stereotype threats, clarifying the relevant underlying mechanisms. The final goal was to examine the utility of the Multi-Threat Framework for guiding the development of effective stereotype threat-reducing interventions.  We tested these aims across 8 studies.
