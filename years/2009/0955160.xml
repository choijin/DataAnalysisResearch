<AbstractNarration>Objective:  The objective of this research project is to design and establish the device foundations for a Terahertz Micro-Nanoscope capable of submicron resolutions. The proposed approach is based on the demonstration of compact THz photonic devices and the integration to achieve a near-field imaging system that can successfully image submicron-scale individual structures such as a single cell, while probing their spectral and spatial characteristics.  More compact and user-friendly components are key to enabling the envisioned THz micro-nanoscope and ensuring it can be widely used or adopted in the future.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The intellectual merit of the proposed CAREER program stems from the investigation of a new paradigm of interaction between light and matter to attain combined spectroscopic sensing and near-field imaging capabilities by utilizing THz waves, which originate from a portion of the electromagnetic spectrum that has not been fully utilized to date.  The new, transformative device foundation is based on the use of nitride semiconductor materials and nanostructures that can enable more compact THz photonics systems, and thus push the limits of imaging currently available in a wide range of fields.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact.  The broader impact of the research will be in facilitating the development of THz-based diagnostic tools to fight against diseases.  This work will be integrated with education and outreach activities (including K-12) aimed at increasing the participation of women and students from underrepresented groups in science and engineering.  Planned collaborations with industry will ensure the proposed research can more easily lead to commercial applications.</AbstractNarration>
