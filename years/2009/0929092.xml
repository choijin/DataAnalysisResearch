<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT HRD 0929092&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff (UAPB) is implementing The STEM&lt;br/&gt;Academy program (Phase II) toward increasing the number of minorities in STEM research careers. The key components of the 2009-2013 STEM implementation plan include: 1) Intense curricula revisions, faculty development and two faculty added in Biology; 2) Expanded research opportunities for STEM Scholars during the academic year; 3) Development of learning communities; 4) Pre-Graduate School workshops, including GRE preparation and graduate school application process; 5) Piloting of a licensure program for STEM Scholars who desire to be science, and mathematics teachers, 6) Piloting of an international summer/winter intersession research component for STEM Scholars and faculty. UAPB is focusing on ?best practices? and ?lessons learned? that have proven to be successful in increasing the number of STEM majors and graduates. The project is enhanced through continuous evaluation and assessment of the activities and interventions, feedback, and modifications as needed, as well as summative evaluation.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
