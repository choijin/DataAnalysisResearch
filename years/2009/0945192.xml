<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt; Computer instrumentation of living environments promises to extend the independent life span of our aging populations. This technological potential will not be realized unless people are willing to trust their lives to such support systems, as a replacement for human support. Very little is known about how and why people make these important decisions. The proposed research will study this issue using a widely adopted, computer-dependent life-saving device, the Implantable Cardiac Device (ICD).  This research will provide a foundation for understanding how and why people agree to place their life in the hands of computerized equipment that they cannot fully understand or control. The study will design and validate instruments for gathering data on this decision. The study will use in-depth interviews, and survey methods, and will gather data from persons who have accepted or refused implantable defibrillators. Phase I, will be an interview study, working through cardiologists, to reach their patients. Phase II will develop, an extensible Web-based survey that can be readily adapted to other patient populations and other technologies. Both graduate and undergraduate students will be involved in the research plan.  In addition, there are a number of broader impacts.  First, this research will enhance our understanding of the key factors in the decision to entrust one?s life to a complex computer whose workings are not understood. It will also add to the meager collection of instruments for collecting this kind of data. Second, the information gained about the decision to accept implant will be new, and can serve as a guide in the design of patient information material. Third, the information will guide the design of patient information for ?pervasive computing home environments? and will therefore be useful to scientists and engineers as they consider what will be the most useful features of any proposed design.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This study explored the decision to use a complex, computer-based medical support system, from the perspectives of the patients themselves.  The key findings suggest a growing acceptance of computerized technology that may autonomously intervene to support patient's health.   While patients are generally not well-informed about the technical details of their implanted devices, they are aware of, and benefit from the ability to be remotely monitored, avoiding trips to the doctor's office. [As an incidental finding, the study confirms that a majority of the patients have not ever received a life-saving shock from the device.]  However, patients report that their knowledge that the device is available to provide such life-saving automatic intervention provides "peace of mind" that  they view as justifying the procedure.  Interviews with nearly 200 people who have implanted cardiac defibrillators inside their body were conducted and analyzed in detail.  The study confirmed the perceived importance of security and the life-saving benefits of these devices. The researchers were able to further classify attitudes towards the decision and the device as being active -- representing control over one's own life, or passive -- representing dependence on the medical establishment. This research supports the growing role that patients play in controlling decisions about their own care and their fates in the health care system, as it grows ever more complex and technological.
