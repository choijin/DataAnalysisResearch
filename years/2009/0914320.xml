<AbstractNarration>The International Ethological Conference (IEC) was initiated over 50 years ago and has been attended by participants from over 65 countries.  The XXXI IEC will be held 19-24 August, 2009 in Rennes, France and hosted by the University of Rennes in association with the two major French behavior societies.  The IEC is the primary international gathering of scientists who focus on evolutionary and mechanistic aspects of behavior.  The conference includes participants from diverse disciplines (ethology, comparative psychology, ecology, evolution, conservation, psychobiology, anthropology, neurobiology, endocrinology, parasitology, primatology, animal welfare, veterinary medicine and human evolution) and the financial assistance provided to young scientists (recently graduated Ph. D. students) will make it possible for individuals to attend who might not otherwise have been able to afford travel expenses.   A committee of three United States IEC representatives will evaluate applications for funds from young scientist participants.  The committee members are committed to assuring that diversity will be enhanced at the IEC and will select a diverse group of scientists with respect to gender, career stage, and membership in groups underrepresented in science.  Information at the IEC is exchanged in plenary lectures, symposia, contributed oral presentations, poster sessions and informal conversations.  Attendance and participation in the meeting offer an unparalleled opportunity for American animal behaviorists to share their research with an international audience, meet new colleagues and to initiate cooperative, international projects.</AbstractNarration>
