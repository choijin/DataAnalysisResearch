<AbstractNarration>Computer Science (31)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Software visualizations are recognized as valuable teaching and learning tools.  Prior NSF funding produced jGRASP, a software development environment that allows students to visualize their programs and data structures.  While jGRASP has been widely disseminated and has been met with a high degree of success, teachers do not use the data structure visualization features to their full potential.  Objectives of this project are to train teachers to use effective program visualization practices in the classroom and to develop a set of learning materials that integrate dynamic visualizations with appropriate teaching strategies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two summer workshops are the primary strategy for developing materials and training faculty.  The first workshop is designed to develop data structure visualizations and make plans for participants to use the materials during the following academic year.  The second workshop is designed to refine materials and to train additional teachers.  Expected outcomes include learning resources, data structure visualizations and a diverse community of trained faculty from high schools, community colleges and universities.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

However, we used materials developed during the project period, and NSF support was cited.)   Each workshop focused on providing computing faculty with knowledge and experience in using effective software visualizations for Java as an integral part of their classroom instruction. We received valuable feedback from each workshop that informed the continued development of jGRASP and its visualizations.  We disseminated the results of the project via the jGRASP website (www.jgrasp.org), conference publications, and a booth at the annual SIGCSE conference (2011, 2012, 2013, 2014).  The two most significant results of this project are (1) a community of educators who perceive the software visualizations provided by jGRASP to be useful, and (2) students who perceive value from using these visualizations as part of their classroom experience.   The 21 veteran CS1, CS2, and Algorithms faculty members who participated in the 2011 workshop were asked to respond to a survey instrument focused on the perceived efficacy of the software visualizations provided by jGRASP.  The survey instrument consisted of sixteen items grouped into four evaluation categories (EC). EC1 &ndash; Successful integration of visualization and IDE; EC2 &ndash; Usability; EC3 &ndash; Suitability for use in courses; EC4 &ndash; Aid in student learning.  The 21 faculty members were asked to respond to each item on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 indicated that the respondent strongly disagreed with the statement and 5 indicated that the respondent strongly agreed with the statement. While it is significant that the results were extremely positive across all evaluation question categories, it is particularly important to examine the responses that correspond to the effect on student learning (EC4).  Item 12: jGRASP can positively affect the studentsÆ knowledge, skills, and behavior.

Mean = 4.48; Item 15: When appropriate, students will use visualizations in their approach to solving problems. Mean = 4.05; Item 16: When students use visualizations in their approach to solving problems, they can inherently gain a deeper understanding of the problem. Mean = 4.57. The faculty responding to the survey clearly believed that the visualizations in jGRASP could positively affect student learning. ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
