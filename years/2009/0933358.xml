<AbstractNarration>0933358 &lt;br/&gt;McCarthy &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite recent advances, particle processing still lags significantly behind its counterpart of fluid processing.  The unifying theme of this proposal is the adaption of concepts from fluid processing in order to develop novel techniques for particle applications. Specifically, we target the mixing of dissimilar materials in surface flows of cohesionless (free flowing) materials as well as novel particle separation techniques. The underlying hypothesis of the first focus area of this work is that by exploiting flow perturbations a technique with a long history in fluid processing we can develop, for the first time, a general method for limiting particle segregation in free flowing systems, perhaps the most common and well studied of granular flows. The key to this approach lies in recognizing that it takes a finite time for material to segregate and that there is always a preferred direction that particles tend to segregate. In order to exploit these two facts, one needs to perturb the flow at a high frequency and in such a way that the surface layer is inverted. Particle separations techniques are typically quite low tech and often are energy intensive (e.g., sieving) or environmentally unfriendly (e.g., froth floatation) or both. The underlying hypothesis of the second focus area of this work is that we can develop rate based separations techniques based on granular temperature driven segregation and non-equipartition of (granular) energy. Specifically, we aim to build an analog of a granular chromatograph using a shaking table that imparts a gradient in vibration energy and hence, a gradient in granular temperature. Additionally, we plan to explore granular ratchets in analogy to Brownian ratchets from microfluidic studies because non equipartition of energy will yield the equivalent of the species dependent diffusion coefficient necessary for ratcheting to function for separations. These fluids inspired particle separations devices should not only overcome several of the shortcomings of traditional particle separations techniques, but also will help to validate kinetic theory based models in a very practical context. The chief intellectual merit of this work will be evidenced through advancing knowledge and understanding across fields of engineering and physics via: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Expanding our preliminary mixing results past the proof of concept stage and into a general methodology for limiting both single (density or size) and mixed mode segregation in a variety of surface dominated flows, including developing a set of validating experimental and simulation results that demonstrate the utility of flow perturbations for limiting segregation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Establishing design heuristics for segregation free operation of a variety of particle processing devices.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;3. A series of experiments that can be used as a test bed for variations on kinetic theory expressions.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;4. Two novel particle separation devices: a granular chromatograph and a granular ratchet apparatus The primary broader impacts will be related to the economic impact on the wide variety of industries that deal with particle processing for whom mixing/segregation and particle separation have dramatic product/revenue implications. Additional broader impacts of the work lie in integrating teaching and research. This teaching/research integration will take two forms: training of two graduate students and several undergraduate researchers (with emphasis on under represented groups), and the development of a novel handson K-12 teacher training/partnership program focused on building interest in science in disadvantaged youths. Coupling a particle technology researchers natural propensity for hands-on instruction with a desire to have a positive impact on the the disadvantaged youth in the local community, the PI is proposing to form a partnership with the Academy Charter School (http://www.theacademysystem.com).  This 8-12 grade school is the only charter school in the US exclusively focused on educating court ejudicated youth. Hands-on or inquiry based science education has been shown to not only improve student attitudes toward science, but also to foster higher overall achievement as well as a more flat response as a function of demographic background. The proposed partnership will comprise workshop like sessions between the PI and instructors in the Academy Charter School aimed at developing and/or adapting inquiry based educational modules suitable for science/engineering education in this unique learning environment highly competitive nature of the proposals submitted to the Program and the panel recommendation, the Program Director recommends that this proposal be awarded.</AbstractNarration>
