<AbstractNarration>The subduction zone system on Earth is where net material transfer from the mantle to the continental crust occurs, and where material that is created at spreading ridges is returned to the mantle.  Unlike volcanism in mid-ocean ridges, where melting components are limited and melting mechanism are considerably simpler, volcanism in arcs is considerably more complex: components of melt are numerous, such as the down going slab, the mantle wedge, the overlying mantle and continental lithospheres, fluids and sediments.    As a result, arc magmas exhibit rich diversity in elemental and isotopic composition over short distances. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is generally agreed that fluid addition plays an important role in melting in subduction zones, most likely by hydrating the mantle wedge and lowering the solidus temperature.  The timing of fluid addition and the extent of fluid involvement in generation of magmas in certain arcs, such as the Cascade subduction zone, are not clear.  The Cascade arc represents both a slow converging and warm end-member of the global arc system. It is also one of the best characterized arcs, given almost century long geophysical and geologic studies.  A uranium-series based study in this arc is ideally suited to answer a number of the outstanding questions.  These include, 1) the relative importance of flux melting and dynamic melting in arcs in general and the Cascades in particular, 2) the explanation for the paradox of the estimated high pre-eruptive water content (up to 8% H2O) inferred for some Cascade lavas and yet the lack of enrichment in key fluid indicating elements and isotopic ratios, 3) and the amount of crust component in Cascade lavas.  The proposed study will utilize 230Th-238U, 226Ra-230Th, 231Pa-235U, Sr, Nd, Pb and Os isotopic data on young lavas and mineral separates to address the above and related questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although this project's aim is answering basic scientific questions, it will support the human development and infrastructural building efforts at the University of New Mexico.  The project will serve as a venue for training two graduate students in analytically-based geochemistry and petrology.  The lab is used not only by the PIs group but also by a variety of other groups, including students from small undergraduate colleges, such as Cornell College, Iowa, and University of Puget Sound, Washington.  The University of New Mexico is a minority serving institution and the current proposal is coupled to an existing Sloan Foundation grant to the PI to support minority PhD students.    The study area is a National area of concern for volcanic hazards, and results from this project may contribute towards understanding of volcanic eruption cycles.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Material from the deep part of the Earth, the mantle, is brought up in mid-ocean ridges and much of the new material in the form of ocean lithosphere is returned back into the mantle in subduction zones.  Subduction zones are where the dense ocean lithosphere sinks under the lighter (younger ocean lithosphere) or continental lithosphere.  This process results in active volcanism along the axis of subduction, called arc magmastism. The Cascade volcanoes are the result of such process, by which the Juan De Fuca Plate is sinking underneath the less dense North American Plate.   Using short-lived isotopes of the decay of uranium and other isotope and elemental tracers, we constrained the style and time-scale of melting and in particular the role of water in generating the melting. We discovered that despite prior indications of significant amount of water, the role of water is very limited and much of the melting is the result of depressurization of the rising mantle material, not unlike what happens in mid-ocean ridges.  We also demonstrated that the whole process of melting, transport through the lithospheric column and eruption is very short, even short relative to the half-life of some of the short-lived nuclides, such as protactinium-231, 27,000 years. Results from our research have been and are being published in leading journals in the field and presented at national and international conferences.    The broad impact of the project included student training in this highly specialized field.  Our laboratory is one of the few places in the Country that specializes in short-lived isotopes for application in the study of volcanism.  A number of students, including undergraduate students, get hands-on experience.  One of the students supported through this grant has received his PhD and is now a faculty member at Washington and Lee University.
