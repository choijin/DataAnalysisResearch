<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to address a pressing need for techniques that control the power outputs of large-scale, grid-interconnected wind farms, so that wind energy may be utilized efficiently, reliably, and economically. The approach is based on a blend of advanced theories in nonlinear control, energy conversion, and power system reliability, which involves theoretical research and algorithm development, including modeling of wind farms for power system operation, seamless control of such farms so that they can operate in both the maximum power tracking and power regulation modes, and analysis of their dynamic power output characteristics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project bridges the gap between advanced control theory and power system engineering practice, by providing novel control technologies for enabling integration of large-scale uncertain wind generation into the power system. The research requires state-of-the-art modeling of electric machines, wind turbines, and power system reliability. In addition, the research supports nationwide development in wind energy and addresses a set of theoretical challenges in advanced nonlinear control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project promotes national policy on renewable energy, by providing solutions to several defining issues in reliable and economic utilization of wind resources. It also promotes integration of interdisciplinary research with education at state universities. The integration will be realized through incorporation of new topics in traditional energy conversion and power systems courses, field trips to actual wind farms, graduate research mentorship, design of a new graduate course, and involvement of underrepresented groups. The principal investigator is also currently a mentor at two high-school robotics teams.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
