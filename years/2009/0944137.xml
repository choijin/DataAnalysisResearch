<AbstractNarration>Mining activity has left enormous piles of material in numerous places around Europe and Asia spanning the last seven millennia. Because copper smelting requires melting of ore at high temperatures in furnaces, there is abundant charcoal intimately associated with the copper slag, enabling the direct dating of the archaeological debris.    It turns out that metallurgical debris can retain an excellent record of the ancient geomagnetic field strength.  This, combined with unprecedented ability to date the material, means that high resolution records of changes in field strength are now available to us.  We have already documented a period of time in Jordan (10th century BCE) of extraordinarily high magnetic field strengths, nearly three times the present field.  This geomagnetic field "spike" must have happened very quickly.  Comparison of these data with those from nearby studies in Greece suggest that there is a significant discrepancy between the Grecian master curve and the data from Jordan. To assess the various possible causes for this discrepancy (e.g., extremely short wavelength features in the geomagnetic field, extremely high frequency temporal changes in the geomagnetic field missed, etc.), we are excavating a second site near to and co-eval with the site containing the "spike" and a  co-eval site in Cyprus that has comparable material. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The combination of archaeology and the study of the ancient geomagnetic field (paleomagnetism) is inherently interdisciplinary, with broad impacts in both disciplines. Interdisciplinary research is difficult in practice because graduate students need to become expert in their own fields and run the risk of becoming too broad at the expense of depth.  We are handling this problem in our research by having two graduate students work closely together, each firmly rooted in one discipline but learning a great deal about the other discipline from the other student.  The benefits of such interdisciplinary efforts are wide ranging.  From the point of view of studying the geomagnetic field, an accurate picture of intensity changes on a global scale (a goal to which this project contributes but does not solve by itself) is essential for such different endeavors as "ground truthing" numerical models and understanding variations in the production of radiocarbon and the calibration of the radiocarbon time scale.  From the archaeological perspective, placing   archaeological materials in a tight temporal framework is always a challenge and our work is already being put to use to solve dating puzzles in archaeometallurgy.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The interplay between archaeology and the study of the Earth's ancient magnetic field goes back to the late 19th century when physicists realized that ceramics and other archeological materials could retain a record of the ancient magnetic field. Ceramic materials were among the very first targets of modern experimental methods to determine the ancient field strength and the field known as  "archaeomagnetism" remains vibrant today.   Archaeologists are beginning to take advantage of the powerful constraints on ages of material for which full magnetic vectors are possible in regions with an accurate reference model and geomagnetists are taking advantage of the growing archeomagnetic data base which is producing more high quality data with better age constraints.  However, partly owing to the experimental difficulties in recovering ancient magnetic field strength from geological and archaeological materials and partly because of a lack of well-dated materials for study, the archaeomagnetic data base remains heavily biased towards European data from the last millennia.    This grant supported efforts to expand the global data set over the last four millennia, including new radiocarbon age control and new paleomagnetic and archaeomagnetic data from places that are currently under-sampled.     The  research supported here had profound implications for numerical simulations of the geomagnetic field, and provided higher resolution age constraints for archaeological research. An accurate picture of paleointensity changes on a global scale (a goal to which this project contributes but does not solve by itself) is essential for understanding variations in the production of radiocarbon and the calibration of the radiocarbon time scale.   Finally, this proposal helped support the continued development of online paleomagnetic teaching materials in the form of the Essentials of Paleomagnetism online textbook project of the PI  (see http://magician.ucsd.edu/Essentials) and facilitated offering of online classes in paleomagnetism offered to graduate students the world over.
