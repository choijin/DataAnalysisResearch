<AbstractNarration>Student comprehension of scientific concepts and principles presents a particular challenge when the phenomena are not directly observable. This issue has emerged as core to effective teaching and successful student learning in chemistry. The goal is to identify whether students' individual differences influence the effectiveness of visualizations for learning scientific concepts as measured with process and product-based metrics of evaluation. The investigators will also develop design principles for the use of visualizations as instructional tools in chemistry and STEM fields more broadly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The central issues are: When and how students rely on visualizations while trying to comprehend unobservable chemistry content; whether reliance on visualizations varies as a function of student characteristics; and whether usage patterns inform instructional interventions. In a series of randomized, controlled experiments involving undergraduates at four institutions, investigators will: (a) determine baseline chemical knowledge, spatial ability, reasoning ability, and interest in learning; (b) use eye tracking to characterize the moment-by-moment scan and fixation processes that students rely on while viewing visualizations; (c) utilize concurrent interview protocols to assess learning strategies and knowledge acquisition; and (d) implement post-visualization tests to examine student memory for the visualization content and application of knowledge.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Every day, we are literally bombarded with visual information from newspapers, journals, internet sources, and even video games. Given the ubiquity of this approach to data distribution, evaluating how individuals attempt to comprehend these displays, and the different ways in which individuals might engage with them, proves critical for understanding how individuals transfer information into knowledge and skills. While obviously important for formal education particularly in STEM fields, these processes are fundamental to our experiences with an ever-increasing supply of information. This project contributes to efforts aimed at understanding how individuals deal with complex displays of information and how best to present information to facilitate deep learning.     Despite the potential supports they might offer, it turns out that visualizations are not a panacea for student understanding.  To better understand studentsÆ use of visualizations, this project explored student interactions with chemistry visualizations, both as they are being studied and as a consequence of working with them. Chemistry was chosen because it inherently involves phenomena that are not visible to the naked eye yet developing a "mental model" for chemical interactions is a necessary step to developing predictive capabilities.     The project focused on two issues with regard to studentsÆ experiences with visualizations.  First, we examined the ways in which students engage with visualizations, and how those engagements might be supported.  We presented students with both familiar and novel displays and asked them to answer questions for which the novel displays are particularly useful.  Analyses of accuracy rates, eye-movements, and verbal explanations indicated (a) most participants initially relied on the familiar to answer difficult questions, but that (b) high-achieving students, but not struggling students, began utilizing and benefitting from the novel visualizations over the course of the experimental session. It is clear that struggling students need additional support. This opens the two-pronged issue that all educators grapple with: What support is needed and, provided support, can struggling students become more successful?      Our results provide important guidance for educators. Without support students may never develop sufficient competence to use the novel visualizations. Thus, rather than automatically enhancing performance, studentsÆ understanding, use of visualizations necessitates knowledge and practice, just like any other educational tool or method.  A picture may be worth a thousand words, but students did not necessarily understand the basic "language" offered by the pictorial displays.  As a second issue, we examined whether students of varying cognitive abilities benefit equally from visualizations. Research has often argued that (a) students with high spatial abilities are more likely to learn from visual displays than are students with low spatial abilities, and (b) visual displays may help bridge the gap between low- and high-spatial students.  Our findings further complicate these relationships by indicating that spatial abilities can be directed in effective and ineffective ways, depending on task demands. Students in this project studied videos of simulated experiments while simultaneously viewing animations of molecular movement.  Ideally, students would integrate information from the two displays to support their understanding; but students did not engage in such integration spontaneously. Even high-spatial ability students focused solely on real-world videos when tasks required them to predict experimental outcomes.  In other words, task demands and instructional guidance greatly affect integration even for students that we expect will do it.     These findings inform the kinds of supports that should be built into the design of visualizations.  While the work focused specifically on chemistry, the issues raised ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
