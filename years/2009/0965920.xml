<AbstractNarration>The Zoo and Aquarium Sciences (ZAS) Scholars project is awarding scholarships to 15 to 20 academically talented, financially needy students who have completed their first year of studies. The ZAS program combines a rigorous classroom curriculum with extensive cooperative learning experiences and includes a 320-hour internship that takes place the summer after the freshman year. Scholarships are also being provided to newly admitted eligible students for first semester required costs to remove this barrier for student entrance into the program. Of the 70 students admitted into the program over a period of 3 years, 60 have been female. Thus, the ZAS program is increasing the number of underrepresented students in the field of aquarium science. It is also noteworthy that program graduates teach hundreds of citizens that the earth's living resources are a treasure for current and future generations of humankind and that sustaining our living resources provide essential economic, environmental, aesthetic, and cultural benefits to humanity.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ PURPOSE: The Zoo &amp; Aquarium Science degree program (ZAS) prepares students for entry level professional employment in the technical fields of exotic animal care &amp; husbandry (zoo track) and in aquarium science (aquarium track).  The program combines challenging academic coursework with a rigorous 4 semester internship experience totaling in excess of 1300 hours.  The zoo track provides students with opportunities to learn theory then develop the related skills sets required to successfully care for and management animal collections.  These skills sets include operant conditioning, environmental enrichment, and basic vet-tech level health management.  In addition to these skills sets, the aquarium track provides students with the opportunities related to design, construction and successful maintainence of marine and fresh water life support and filtration systems.  In addition to technical skill sets, all ZAS students learn and experience first-hand the scientific method associated with practical research by completing a short term environmental enrichment research study.  The general purpose of this study is to increase natural behaviors and decrease stereotypic behaviors (resulting in an increase in well-being) in selected animal species.   Students work in small teams to design, implement, build species-specific ethograms, gather behavior data, statistically analyze data and present findings and recommendations to the supervising curatorial staff.  The ZAS scholarship grant project contributes to student success by providing funds that allowed students with academic potential to successfully complete internships at AZA accredited facilities throughout the mid-Atlantic states.  The internships are a vital learning component providing students valuable experiences as they apply animal management principles and theory in a zoo/aquarium setting under the supervision of academic and curatorial staff.  In addition, students are able to develop the "soft skills" required to be a successful in the professional workplace.  RESULTS: Over the 5 year grant period (2010-2015) the ZAS Scholarship Project funded scholarships for 74 students.  Data was collected in terms of student retention and completion, employment rates of  graduates,  the pursuit of advanced degrees in STEM fields by graduates and the introduction of STEM education opportunities and professions to minorities. Results are as follows:    1.       Student Success, Retention &amp; Completion:  Of the 74 students awarded scholarships, 14 students were awarded scholarships in fall 2014 as 1st year students.  14 of these 14 1st year students (100%) are on pace to graduate in spring 2016.  53 of the remaining 60 students (88%)  that were awarded scholarships graduated from the program within 3 years. This graduation rate is almost 3 times the national graduation rate of 26% within the same general time period.      2.       Employability- 39 the 53 graduates (74%) were successful in obtaining STEM related employment upon graduation.  11 of 53 graduates (21%) made the decision to continue their education in STEM related fields (see 3 below).  The remaining 3 graduates (5%) graduated in May of 2015 and are in the process of pursuing fulltime employment.      3.       Education- 11 of 53 graduates (21%) have made the decision to continue to pursue their education in STEM related fields before beginning their professional careers.  These graduates are in the process or have earned bachelors degrees (9), a masters degree (1) or have earned both higher degrees (1).      4.       Introducing Minorities to STEM education and Employment- One of the goals of the  ZAS scholars project has been to attract minority students to STEM academic programs, have these students successfully complete the program of study earning their Applied Associates in Science degree and find employment in a STEM career.  The scholarship fund was extremely successful in attracting  female students to th...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
