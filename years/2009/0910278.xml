<AbstractNarration>This research project responds to the changing nature of biological science, which has become less fragmented and more focused on models of complex interacting systems. The investigators will study a framework that they hypothesize is well-suited to facilitating students thinking about complex systems across the biological span from sub-cellular genetic processes to evolution and ecology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The selected framework is Structure-Behavior-Function Theory (SBF), in which a system is represented by the component elements of its structure, the processes that these components perform, and the overall function or purpose of the system. The framework originated in the Artificial Intelligence literature, as an effective strategy for reasoning about designed systems such as electrical circuits. In this research, it will be applied to reasoning about topics such as genes, evolution, and ecology. The investigators will use SBF theory as a pedagogy as a well as an assessment system, in the context of several courses in introductory biology at Michigan State University for both life science majors and non-majors. Students will create, refine, and reason with diagrammatic representations of their own models of the topics they study, and investigators will build software to automate the coding of such representations and the ways they change over the course. The work of approximately 800 students will be analyzed to look for shifts in student reasoning at key points in the instruction, tracking learning trajectories over time. The assessment method will be validated by correlating the scores with those on other forms of parallel assessment, such as multiple-choice, short-answer, and diagrammatic questions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overall, the investigators will develop and evaluate a framework for analyzing student understanding, propose strategies for promoting systems thinking and metacognition, and advance research on learning about complex systems. The project is innovative in its application of SBF theory to the pedagogy, assessment, and analysis of introductory biology college courses, and also in its adaptation of software tools to automate the analysis of students models and associated reasoning.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our work in Simplifying Complexity was inspired by the diversity of thinking we observed when we asked our students to draw, rather than write about, their understanding of biological systems. While many students proved more proficient when communicating through drawings and models than narrative text, the variability and range of student responses posed significant challenges for analyzing and comparing student thinking at different points in time or in different contexts. Importantly, modeling &ndash; using, constructing, and reasoning from &ndash; is a foundational practice across STEM disciplines and is identified as a core competency in current frameworks for science education (e.g., Next Generation Science Standards, Vision and Change in Undergraduate Education) Our work adapted a theoretical framework developed by Design Systems Engineering that served to align our goals for instruction and assessment with research about studentsÆ representations (models) of biological systems.   Outcome 1: We adapted Structure-Behavior-Function Theory (SBF; Goel et al., 1996) as a framework for representing and analyzing studentsÆ models of biological systems. SBF deconstructs systems into 3 constituents: structures are components or elements of systems, behaviors describe mechanisms relating pairs of structures, and functions are the roles, outputs, or purposes of systems.

In addition, we developed and adapted metrics that enabled us to evaluate the quality of student models by referencing components of the SBF framework.  Our work demonstrated that SBF was broadly applicable for a range of biological systems typically encountered in college biology.  Outcome 2: In this project, we developed curricular materials, assessments, rubrics, and activities to facilitate model-based instruction in college-level biology courses, particularly at the introductory level. Our instructional strategies use conceptual modeling as a foundational activity and assessment intended to cohere and integrate studentsÆ thinking about "big picture" ideas in introductory biology. Our instructional materials have been implemented (wholly or in part) in diverse courses nationally, and have been shown to be feasible in large-enrollment courses (&gt; 400 students).  Our support materials are regularly shared through numerous workshops, conferences, and symposia led by members of the project team, as well as faculty who have adopted our approach.   Outcome 3: A primary motivation for our work in this project was to conduct research that could contribute to our understanding about how students learn with scientific models. Our research revealed three key findings:  (1) Student thinking represented in models changes substantively over a semester of instruction. From early to mid-semester, changes in studentsÆ models are characterized by increased numbers of structures and connections, and improvements in their ability to describe system relationships. Later in the semester, students continue to improve in their use of biological language, but connectedness plateaus (Dauer et al., 2013).  These patterns are consistent with research on concept maps that show students rapidly accrete and reorganize their knowledge early in instruction to accommodate new information, but later learning is characterized by refining existing knowledge that clarifies or improves the specificity of their thinking (Mintzes and Quinn, 2007; Pearsall et al., 1997).  (2) Trajectories of model-based performance vary among achievement groups. We analyzed patterns of change in models for students in different achievement tritiles based on their cumulative GPA upon entering the course. While general patterns were the same for all tritiles, lower- and mid-performing students made greater relative gains in correctness over time (Dauer et al., 2013).
