<AbstractNarration>Human well-being is tied inextricably to the delivery of ecosystem services, which provide a key connection between human and natural systems.  Urban populations are simultaneously increasing demand on and reducing the capacity of natural systems to provide valued ecosystem services, contributing to an urgent call for local and regional policy and management solutions to be at the forefront of scientific investigation.  The boundaries of human institutions rarely coincide with natural boundaries, however, making the management of coupled human and natural systems a challenge.  These two systems also are scaled differently:  human institutions tend to make decisions that are "fast and local,"? while the environmental consequences of these decisions tend to be regional and long-term.  The overarching goal of this collaborative research project is to begin to reconcile the spatial and temporal disparities between human and natural systems, with a focus on social and environmental equity issues that arise when markets and policy instruments control the supply and demand of ecosystem services.  This project will focus on the Triangle Region of North Carolina, which has 45 municipal and 7 county governments with an institutional mechanism for collaborative management.  The region is experiencing high population growth, putting increasing demands on ecosystem services and the human institutions responsible for managing their supply and distribution.  The investigators will use a three-part framework that addresses (1) the production of ecosystem services by ecological systems; (2) their valuation and monetization by people; and (3) the design, implementation, and evaluation of policies to pay for and allocate these benefits equitably.  Project objectives are to apply this framework in a case study of the ecosystem service of clean water production in collaboration with state and local government agencies; to further develop a network of collaborators through a series of four community workshops focused on ecological, economic, policy, and synthesis topics; and to develop an integrated data platform that will serve researchers, government agencies, and ultimately the public at large.  The investigators will employ empirical and process-based modeling, field sampling, remote sensing, geographic information systems, social surveys, and geo-demographic analyses to achieve their objectives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is expected to contribute to a richer understanding of the production of ecosystem services as a function of spatially integrated built and natural environments and to set the foundation for a multi-disciplinary and policy-relevant program focused on managing coupled human and natural systems.  The initial case study on land use and water quality will embrace many of the central challenges in urban ecology today, including issues of scale, spatial processes, and system-level feedbacks.  Over the longer term, the effort to map the flow of ecosystem services from where they are produced to where they are consumed will set a new standard for spatially explicit valuation.  This project will help resolve questions about feedbacks between human behavior and institutions and ecosystem processes in the spatially structured environment of urban systems.  The information produced during the course of this project will help land-use planners and policy makers to identify the most appropriate areas for land-use controls aimed at protecting water quality, to more equitably distribute the costs of producing clean water, and to create policy to support the equitable distribution of the costs and benefits of clean water.  Overall, project results will help provide the scientific basis for emerging policy instruments and markets for ecosystem services and to help guide land-use planning decisions in the Triangle Region.  This award was funded as an Urban Long-Term Research Area Exploratory (ULTRA-Ex) award as the result of a special competition jointly supported by the National Science Foundation and the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Environmental Justice and the Provisioning of Ecosystem Services   We conducted a diverse set of studies on the spatial distribution of ecosystem services in Raleigh, the Research Triangle, and the State of NC.  Our intent was to uncover relationships between segments of the population that benefit from nature and those burdened to ensure a continuous supply of ecosystem services.  The initial focus of our research was water resources, but our studies included related research on land cover dynamics that influence the availability of ecosystem services in urban environments.    Demographic Shifts Around Drinking Water Supply Reservoirs in North Carolina, USA   We studied 66 reservoirs across NC to uncover the potential effects on socio-demographics of creating drinking water reservoirs.  The ratio of white people to non-white people was significantly higher in communities within 0.5 miles of reservoir shorelines than in more distant communities.  Even as NC overall became less white from 1990 to 2010, the ratio of white people to non-white people within the 0.5 miles of the shoreline increased relative to the overall ratio in the State.  There were similar, but less distinct, shifts in per capita income during the period. Reservoirs might have induced demographic shifts in communities adjacent to newly created lakeshores similar to the shifts associated with environmental gentrification and amenity migration, and may be perpetuating those shifts.   Tree Cover Influences Water Quality   RaleighÆs high tree cover can contribute to water quality by reducing throughfall (i.e. the amount of water that lands on the ground) during small storms and therefore slowing and decreasing stormwater runoff. Differences in landscaping among front- and back-yards led to disparate effects on throughfall, with backyard landscapes tending towards more forested conditions and providing more ecosystem services.   PeopleÆs landscaping decisions on individual parcels can have an effect on water quality in cities. Policies for maintaining RaleighÆs urban forest cover could be instrumental to positive long-term effects on water quality in the area.   Land Cover Variability in Urban Watersheds and the Potential Effects on Water Resources   Urban watersheds become significantly degraded as impervious surfaces reach 20-30% land cover.  Yet, a lot of deviation in surface water quality across urban watersheds cannot be explained by imperviousness alone.  Our research on land cover patterns and water infrastructure across 30 urban watersheds showed that trees and lawns are divergent cover types in urban systems &ndash; where lawn cover also increases with urbanization.  The variation in lawn cover across urban landscapes could be another cause of increased impairment of surface water.  These results support efforts to limit both impervious and lawn cover in urban ecosystems.       Urban Morphology is a Driver of Tree Cover in Urban Ecosystems   Trees have been shown to provide a number of ecosystem services to urban residents, including cleaner air and reduced energy costs.  Neighborhood level socioeconomic status, personal lifestyle choices, and local urban form all have an influence on where trees are located in cities.  Although residents in Raleigh currently receive numerous benefits from the cityÆs extensive tree cover (55%), our results suggest that decreasing parcel size in Raleigh may lead it to lose itÆs title of "City of Oaks" as tree cover declines.     Perceptions of climate change vulnerability in Raleigh, NC   We interviewed 21 people from three stakeholder groups involved in policy creation in Raleigh, North Carolina: elected officials, their advisors, and officials of environmental organizations.  Most respondents reported that droughts (90% of respondents), extreme weather events such as storms and heat waves (71%), and flooding (62%) posed the most significant potential impacts to Raleigh.   Several respondents (38%) suggested that Raleig...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
