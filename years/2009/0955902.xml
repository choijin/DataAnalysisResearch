<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This CAREER award supports theoretical research and education on new states of matter that may arise in condensed matter.  The research focuses broadly on two areas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Novel quantum order states of matter. A quantum ordered state restores its broken symmetries via a proliferation of topological defects. In conventional quantum fluids and gases only the simplest topological defects are important. The PI will investigate different possibilities which might arise in multicomponent quantum fluids and gases with strong or long-range intercomponent interaction. In such systems there can be phase transitions associated with proliferation of complex bound states of topological defects which do not produce a complete restoration of symmetry. It can lead to formation of new types of the aggregate "super" states of matter with partially broken symmetries such as metallic and superconducting superfluids which may arise at ultrahigh pressures in hydrogen isotopes and hydrogen-rich alloys. The PI plans to develop a theory and to predict experimental manifestations and possible probes of these projected new states of matter. The PI will investigate the properties of paired superfluids and super-counter-fluids in mixtures of Bose-Einstein condensates of cold atoms in optical lattices&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Magnetic response of multicomponent superconductors beyond the Meissner effect. The Meissner effect is the quintessential property of a single-component superconductor. The PI will investigate whether in some multicomponent systems gauge field fluctuations render the effective description mappable to Faddeev-Skyrme-like effective models at certain length scales. The magnetic response of these systems might differ fundamentally from the Meissner effect. The PI will investigate whether this results in topological defects in which energy is a non-monotonic function of the defect size. Existence of such defects in multicomponent systems may result in entirely novel physics.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The PI will also investigate the properties of "type-1.5" superconductivity and the conditions under which it appears. This is a superconducting state with non-monotonic vortex interaction potential which can arise in multicomponent, for example two-band, superconductors. The magnetic response of this state is different from that of traditional type-I and type-II superconductors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The educational activities are aimed at bridging classroom education with independent research training through an original implementation of the Problem Based Learning concept used in medical schools and other areas for teaching Natural Sciences. The educational and research part will be integrated also by creating a broad course which will cover in a unified way concepts from condensed matter physics, high energy physics, and cosmology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This CAREER award supports theoretical research and education seeking to predict the existence of new states of matter that may occur in materials under a wide range of conditions. The research focuses on states of matter where a macroscopically large number of electrons or atoms can act in a lock-step fashion according to the laws of quantum mechanics. This leads to phenomena that are a reflection of the counterintuitive laws of the quantum world, the world of the smallest particles like electrons and atoms, but on the macroscopic human scale.  Superconductivity, a state of electrons that can conduct electricity without dissipation, is an example which occurs in some materials at low temperature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will study new kinds of quantum fluids that may arise in the electrons in complex materials, the element hydrogen under very high pressures which lies at the frontiers of experiments, and atoms that are cooled close to the absolute zero of temperature and trapped by laser beams. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The educational activities are aimed at bridging classroom education with independent research training through an original implementation of the Problem Based Learning concept used in medical schools and other areas for teaching Natural Sciences. The educational and research part will be integrated also by creating a broad course which will cover in a unified way concepts from condensed matter physics, high energy physics, and cosmology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Superconductors and superfluids are states without electrical resistance and viscosity correspondingly. These states have  been of great academic interest in physics. Remarkably the microworld laws can appear in these   states as collective phenomena with manifestations on macroscopic length scales.   This made research on superconductors and superfluids also a  vehicle to develop key concepts that are also useful in ostensibly unrelated branches of physics.  Beside the fundamental interest in  these states, there is a list of their important existing and potential applications. These range from MRI scanners in hospitals, power lines, and current controllers, to high precision gyroscopes and accelerometers. Most recently a pursuit has started to use these states for implementation of qubits for quantum computers and quantum emulators. This raises the need to understand the origins and fundamental properties of these states. In recent years there was a number of experimental breakthroughs  yielding discoveries of systems which exhibit  multi-component  superconductivity and superfluidity.    The behaviour of first discovered   single- and multi-component superfluids and superconductors exhibits  a large degree of  well-understood universality, with many macroscopic properties being  determined  by ratios of fundamental physical constants, irrespective of the microscopic physics.   In this project we are explored possibilities of new states of matter  in the multicomponent quantum many-body systems with long-range, strong or frustrated inter-component interactions. We found that in many instances these kinds of  interactions can change behavior which is universal in the previously known "super" states of matter. We found that it can  result in new aggregate "super"  states of matter such as metallic and superconducting superfluids with new types of  behaviour. We also explored mixtures of superfluids of ultra-cold atoms in optically created periodic potentials (optical lattices). We described properties and experimental manifestations of the optical-lattice-induced pairing between different species of ultra cold atoms, as well as super-counter-fluidity: the state where only counter-flows of different species of atoms are dissipation-less. Experimental set ups involving cold atomic mixtures can serve as quantum emulators for various states and phase transitions for technologically relevant materials. One of the central parts of this project was aimed at the basic question of classification  of magnetic properties of superconductors. Superconductors since 1950ies were classified as either type-1 or type-2.   That is, type-1 superconductors expel weak applied magnetic fields, while strong fields destroy superconducting state. The response of type-2 superconductors is different: Weak applied magnetic field is expelled. Above this value the superconductor forms a periodic lattice or liquid of quantum vortices that carry magnetic flux through superconductor. Only at a higher second critical value  of applied field is superconductivity destroyed. As was shown by Ginzburg, Landau, and Abrikosov, these different responses are consequences of the energy cost of a boundary between superconducting and normal domains, and of inter-vortex interaction.     Type-2 superconductivity occurs when the  magnetic field penetration length is larger than so called coherence length (the coherence length  characterises superconducting electrons density variations). In this case, the energy cost of a boundary between normal and superconducting domains is negative, while the interaction between vortices is repulsive. This leads to formation of stable vortex lattices. In type-1 superconductors   the  magnetic field penetration length   is smaller than the coherence length and  the situation is the opposite: The boundary energy between normal and superconducting domains is positive, the vortex interaction is attractive, and vortices are thermodynamically uns...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
