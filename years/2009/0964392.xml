<AbstractNarration>Insufficient attention has been given to enterprise Identity and Access Management (IAM) as a process that needs to be carried out on a continuing basis in the presence of change and evolution.  In particular, there is little formal support for how IAM can exploit experience the enterprise collects over time.   This project is developing a lifecycle model of IAM called Experience Based Access Management (EBAM) that provides a set of models, techniques, and tools to reconcile differences between the "ideal" access model, as judged by high-level enterprise, professional, and legal standards, and the "enforced" access control, specific to the operational IAM system.  The principal component of an EBAM support system is an "expected" access model that is used to represent differences between the ideal and enforced models based on information collected from access logs and other operational information.  The project is developing and validating an approach to the expected model based on using probabilistic information to inform the design of access rules.  The project focuses on EBAM for hospital information systems since these are an especially important class of enterprise systems that present diverse and interesting challenges but also provide potential insight into similar issues in other types of enterprise IAM systems.  The team consists of specialists in cyber security, biomedical informatics, and a physician who serves as chief medical information officer within a major hospital system.  The project will demonstrate how analysis of clinical experience can address gaps between ideal and enforced access control models in a representative hospital.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The goal of this project was to investigate ways to evolve access control frameworks with respect to how information systems are used in daily operations.  To accomplish this goal, developed a collection of strategies for learning the utilization behaviors of users in the system and detecting deviation from expected control models.  The approach tailored these strategies to the roles, business practices, and legal requirements associated with healthcare infrastructures and the information technology in use at hospitals.  To do so, studies were evaluated with data solicited from the electronic medical record systems in use at multiple academic medical centers. The resultant methodology is known as Experience Based Access Management (EBAM).   A key element of the project was the development of a dataset of a year of audit logs for accesses by hospital personnel (users) of patient medical medical records at Northwestern Memorial Hospital (NMH). The NMH audit dataset included such information as the time of access and identifiers for thousands of users and tens of thousands of patients. The dataset also included information about the user role and patient location, service, diagnoses, procedures, and medications. This dataset was used to guide and validate most of the studies done on the project. In some cases the project augmented the NMH audit dataset with similar information from Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC), particularly in studies that explored the generalizability of information learned from NMH and to develop techniques for meaningful comparisons.

Another contribution of the project was a technique called bispective analysis that allows analysts to look at realistic costs associated with the tradeoff between the risk of denying a potential user access to a medical record (to protect security and privacy) versus the risk of preventing a legitimate access (and thus risking wasted resources or even the safety of a patient). The study of bispective analysis involved a rich collaboration between computer scientists and medi...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
