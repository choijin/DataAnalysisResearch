<AbstractNarration>The United States must retain more students in the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines to maintain a skilled workforce. Retention is often lower in the STEM undergraduate majors when compared to other majors, especially for underrepresented minorities. Research indicates that living-learning communities (i.e., specialized learning dorms), as well as mentorship through undergraduate research, increases student retention and strengthens the overall academic experience. These two models have been combined to form the Learning Environment and Academic Research Network (LEARN).  LEARN aims to increase retention in STEM disciplines by identifying at-risk, first-year students and provides the opportunity to join a learning community, in which they live, take courses, apprentice in research laboratories with faculty and graduate students, and interact as a group. The LEARN participants become part of a four-year research network where they find mentorship throughout their academic experience. The LEARN program is student-learning centered to provide the skills and confidence to continue their education in STEM disciplines. The program reaches approximately 120 undergraduate (participants and peer mentors) and graduate (research mentors) students in three years. Data collected through program assessment provides details regarding the best practices to increase student retention in the STEM disciplines. Assessment results are disseminated widely.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Learning Environment and Academic Research Network (LEARN): A Model for Retention in the STEM Disciplines  Retaining college-level Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) students remains a priority in higher education. A variety of methods have been shown to increase retention including mentorship, tutoring, course enhancements, community building, and engagement in high impact practices such as undergraduate research.  In 2011, at the University of Central Florida (UCF), our team developed a program that incorporates multiple forms of student-centered programming with a focus on research. Learning Environment and Academic Research Network (LEARNTM, www.our.ucf.edu/LEARN) is a living-learning community wherein first-year students live in the same residence hall, take specific classes together, work with mentors, and engage in a 12-week mentored research apprenticeship. LEARN aims to recruit first generation and underrepresented students.  The following five objectives were set for this program in the original grant submission:  Increase retention in the STEM disciplines for at-risk first-year students. Provide an inquiry based/hands-on learning experience through an early research opportunity.  Offer a small learning community at a large research university through the creation of a sustainable program.   Become a feeder for upper-level undergraduate research programs already developed and graduate programs. Develop effective LEARN student recruitment strategies.       The key outcomes of this work are as follows:  Created and implement a brand new comprehensive living-learning program (www.our.ucf.edu/LEARN). This work generated 11 academic conference presentations and 3 peer-reviewed publications.  Created a successful recruitment strategy for said program.  LEARN cohorts are made up of diverse STEM majors with high participation from underrepresented and first-generation college students (Schneider et al. 2015). To date, 111 undergraduate students have participated in the program as first-year students and 11 as peer mentors. All were STEM majors at the beginning of their program year.  Documented higher GPA, university retention rates, and STEM retention rates for the LEARN participants compared to matched control group of students (Schneider et al. 2015). Documented significant differences in critical thinking through the NSF Sponsored- Critical Thinking Assessment test scores in year 2 and 3 (non-significant positive gains in year 1; Schneider et al. 2015). Created a model of formally engaging graduate students in the mentorship of first-year students (Bickel and Schneider, 2013; Schneider and Bickel, In press). 64 graduate students in STEM disciplines have mentored with our program. These students were formally trained.  Sustained efforts at UCF in year four. The program is being continued by the university with all of the same program elements.    We were able to meet all program goals successfully and have sustained the LEARN program at UCF.  LEARN continues to grow and our team strengthens the program each year through continued assessment.          Last Modified: 02/23/2015       Submitted by: Kimberly R Schneider]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
