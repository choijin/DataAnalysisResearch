<AbstractNarration>The Environmental Chemical sciences (ECS) program of the Division of Chemistry will support the research program of Prof. Franz Geiger of Northwestern University. Prof. Geiger's research program focuses on the application for the first time of a unique spectroscopic method, named the Eisenthal chi(3) method, to study the adsorption of metal cations on mineral surfaces. The Eisenthal chi(3)method is uniquely sensitive to the interfacial potential and can be viewed as an Optical Voltmeter. If successful, the study will provide environmental scientists with a new and widely applicable tool for studying ion adsorption on mineral surfaces. The project has the potential to transform our understanding of interfacial phenomena in complex environmental systems. The project will provide excellent educational opportunities for trainees desiring to work at the forefront of environmental science.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

Just like two equally poled magnets repel one another, charge-repulsion among positively charged toxic species may lead to changes in the charge state of the surface bound species, which would yield less repulsion and allow for a orders of magnitude larger surface excess of the metal species.

Intellectual Merit: The experiments carried out under this grant provide the first concrete, as opposed to hypothetical, data into how a variety of doubly and triple charged metal contaminants change their charge state, as predicted, while other do not.  Broader Impacts. This project has provided important new benchmarks for existing theoretical and mechanistic geochemical frameworks and computer simulations.
