<AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Male ornaments, such as horns, spurs, and bright feathers have attracted the notice of humans for centuries. These traits evolved as the male-male competition and female partner preferences.   This project employs a multi-disciplinary, multi-trait perspective to determine the relative roles of nature (genes) and nurture (environment) on the evolution of these characters.  In particular, the interaction of genes and the environment on multiple metrics of male performance will be examined as well as the effects of environmental variation on the partner preferences of females. Narnia femorata, a cactus bug, is an excellent species for this research because juveniles in the wild grow up on cacti with and without fruits. This difference in diet affects male attractiveness to females and the development of male weapons (enlarged hind legs) used in territorial competition on cactus plants. The investigators will breed insects with and without cactus fruits to examine the influence and interactions of genes and nutritional environments for males and females. This work will draw on field ecology, behavioral ecology, evolutionary biology, and quantitative genetics to provide one of the most comprehensive studies to date linking natural environmental variation with male performance and female mating decisions. This research will be an important step in understanding how environmental variability influences the action of selection on these characters.  In addition, a core objective of this research collaboration is to have broad, positive impacts on society. This project will provide opportunities for graduate students and undergraduates to become involved in an international partnership and will also make research results accessible and engaging to the general public.</AbstractNarration>
