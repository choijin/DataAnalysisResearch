<AbstractNarration>Stochastic inference problems arise naturally in many applications that interact with the world, such as natural language processing (NLP), robot control, analysis of social networks, and environmental engineering. Current real-world applications require inference mechanisms that can scale to thousands and more interactions. This project is scaling up and improving precision of automated inference and learning in dynamic partially observable domains, with later application to decision making, by combining the complementary computational strengths of logical and probabilistic methods. The inference and learning algorithms being developed are being assessed by theoretical and experimental means, with aims of improving question answering from text narratives and environment-state estimation for mobile robots. Examples of societal benefits are enabling people to access and examine details hidden in large amounts of textual information as well as enabling more helpful and autonomous mobile robots.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project developed computer programs that reason about complex stochastic systems. These programs demonstrated ability to automatically learn to understand natural-language narratives, such as soccer-game descriptions, and correctly interpret uncertain spatial relationships, such as those existing between different objects, robots, and humans.  The insights underlying these developments were twofold. First, a stochastic system (such as a description of a soccer game, whereby words and actions are ambiguous) can be described as a collection of simple non-stochastic actions, with some stochastic choice. Secondly, stochastic systems (such as natural systems involving water wells and possibly faulty sensors in those wells) with many components (E.g. many wells and many possible water levels) can be used by computer processes in relational ways.   These insights have led to the development in this project of computer algorithms that scale up to large scale systems, describing and reasoning precisely about complex stochastic systems with thousands of related objects (demonstrated on environmental-engineering applications).  Also, the applications of the developed stochastic filtering methods in this project were applied to automatically learn to answer deep questions about natural-language narratives. Importantly, this was achieved with no labeled data together with few first-order logical axioms (4-8 per domain). This is important because currently other methods require many hand-labeled samples or large number of axioms to reach comparable performance. This project's success in going beyond these limitations now enables large-scale automatic learning and understanding of narratives.
