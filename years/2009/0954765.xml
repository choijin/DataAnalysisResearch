<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: The objective of this research is to develop a programmable, reconfigurable, and tunable photonic circuit platform and to explore its smart sensor applications. The platform will allow one to dynamically configure/reconfigure, tune/detune, and erase/rewrite photonic circuits on a single chip upon demand. The approach is combining nano-electro-mechanical systems and planar photonic crystal technologies to manipulate light on the wavelength scale. Nanocantilevers are fabricated over air holes in a photonic crystal slab. Each nanocantilever is individually controllable to bend into an air hole via an electrostatic actuator addressed by electronic integrated circuits. Therefore, local effective refractive indices of photonic lattices can be tuned and programmed flexibly to form various photonic devices and circuits. The smart sensors can be realized by chemically modifying the surface of nanocantilevers on the photonic circuit platform, making it sensitive to specific analytes mechanically. Through dynamic tuning of the photonic platform, the sensors can be agile enough to tune their internal optical circuits to adapt to different situations and requirements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This research will provide an unprecedented photonic circuit platform with unique reconfigurablity, tunability and programmability to satisfy the demand for multipurpose and compact photonic chips. The proposed technology could revolutionize photonic circuit design, and open up drastically new possibilities in a broad range of areas, including photonic computing, optical communication, environmental monitoring, biochemical defense, and lab-on-a-chip technologies, thus having great potential economic impact. This research will generate broad educational opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, benefit curriculum development, and provide opportunities for students to work on research projects at both university and industrial laboratories. A pyramid structure for educational outreach will be established to provide an efficient way to introduce micro/nanotechnology into high schools, middle schools, and grade schools of Iowa. Women and minority students will be attracted into science and engineering through year-round open-lab tours, summer internships, and in-class presentations.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The CAREER project has resulted in the development of a new approach to manipulating light at the subwavelength scale through the integration of photonic crystals (PCs), nano-electro-mechanical systems (NEMS), and smart materials. A reconfigurable and tunable near-to-mid infrared PC device was realized using the hybrid PC-NEMS architecture that enabled configuring and reconfiguring of optical properties of PC device. The optical field confined in the photonic device was modulated by electromechanical deflection of nanocantilevers into embedded optical resonators. The easy-to-implement tunable PC-NEMS design allowed an ultrahigh modulation frequency of 32 MHz and up to 160% optical signal modulation at a wavelength of 2.1&nbsp;&micro;m. The resulting tunable device offered different optical functionalities and exhibited various optical properties. In addition, a programmable silicon-based cantilever-pillar PC was designed by alternating tunable nanobeams and static pillars within a small footprint area, where each nanobeam served as an individual nanoelectrode, and the handling layer of silicon-on-insulation wafer served as a common electrical ground. Moreover, the project has led to the development of nanophotonic chemical and environmental sensor technologies based on the dynamic and tunable cantilever-in-PC structure. The concept of electromechanical tuning was further extended to tune nanophotonic sensors sensitive to mechanical strain, environmental temperature, electric field, and specific gas species, via the integration of PC and plasmonic structures with smart materials and structures. From the education and outreach perspectives, the CAREER project has provided ample opportunities for educating the next-generation interdisciplinary workforce. By recruiting under-represented female and minority students, the project has posed a direct impact on the diversity of in optics, micro/nanotechnology, and electrical engineering in general. Female and African-American internship students with little to no background in the concept of postgraduate work in engineering were recruited through a variety of channels, and were provided with the tools and skills to participate in a future of research. Furthermore, the project has provided professional training opportunities to thirteen undergraduate researchers, nine of them which having continued their graduate school studies. This project has served as a platform for outreach activities targeting both undergraduates and K-12 students, and has helped exposing under-represented minority and female undergraduate students and high and middle school students to state-of-the-art technologies through integrating advanced research topics into education. Lastly, this project has contributed to an improved undergraduate curriculum by introducing new lab sections and research findings into classroom teaching.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 01/09/2017<br>      Modified by: Liang&nbsp;Dong</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/0954765/0954765_10013175_1482763039753_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/0954765/0954765_10013175_1482763039753_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/0954765/0954765_10013175_1482763039753_Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">(a) Schematic of the tunable PC-NEMS photonic device.
