<AbstractNarration>This Phase I CCI will combine experimental and theoretical approaches to understanding the relationships between the molecular, mesoscale and bulk properties of neat conjugated polymers. The CCI team will test the theory that intra- and inter-polymer chain interactions give rise to macroscopic materials properties in predictable and systematic ways. The CCI will focus on the molecular origins of the bulk properties of polythiophene and other conjugated polymers that may be useful in a variety of electronic and photovoltaic applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center for Molecular Tools for Conjugated Polymer Analysis and Optimization will offer a unique educational and professional training environment by integrating spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction, microscopy, synthesis and theoretical approaches. The Center will also promote the participation of a diverse group of future scientists and engineers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Centers for Chemical Innovation (CCI) Program supports research centers that can address major, long-term fundamental chemical research challenges that have a high probability of both producing transformative research and leading to innovation. These Centers will attract broad scientific and public interest by sharing the results of their innovative approach to this challenging question.</AbstractNarration>
