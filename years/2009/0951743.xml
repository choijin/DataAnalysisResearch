<AbstractNarration>Professor Wei Zhan of Auburn University is supported by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry (MSN) Program in the Division of Chemistry to develop a new class of molecular photovoltaic systems using chromophores (porphyrins), electron acceptors (fullerenes) and donors (ferrocenes) assembled within solid-supported thin lipid bilayer films. Organothiol adsorbates on gold will be used to adjust the surface properties of the solid support including polarity, charge, work function, redox properties, and degree of electronic conjugation.  Photocurrent generation will be correlated with molecular and bilayer structural changes.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding the mechanisms of charge transfer and the relationship between film structure and photocurrent generation will shed light on important current-limiting processes, and help improve the efficiency of photovoltaic devices.  The educational initiative includes classes and demonstrations to broaden awareness of alternative energy generation, and outreach activities for a broad audience in Alabama.</AbstractNarration>

Significant Outcomes  This six-year journey has yielded at least four significant outcomes.  1. Novel Molecular Photovoltaic Systems Based on Electrode-Supported Lipid Bilayers. Our research in the past few years has produced three new photovoltaic models using various electrode-supported lipid bilayers (Figure 1). With these, we're able to advance the utility of lipids in molecular photovoltaics.  2. Analytical Power of Hybrid-Bilayer Based Photoconversion Systems.

Targeting students at all levels of the educational ladder, our educational programs have brought renewable energy research to the attention of hundreds of young minds and cultivated their critical thinking of sustainable future. Here, for example, weÆre able to base off our research results to develop a æGlow ShowÆ, demonstrating many key chemistry concepts in energy-related research. This show is billed as the best glow show the State of Alabama has to offer and over the past few years has attracted approximately 400 young students.  Outlook  The results illustrated above are certainly satisfying. However, in order to completely unravel this complex chemistry and thus be able to fully tap its application potentials, more time and effort are in order.
