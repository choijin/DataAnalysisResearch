<AbstractNarration>Jones, DMS-0940363&lt;br/&gt;Camp, DMS-0940267&lt;br/&gt;Danforth, DMS-0940271&lt;br/&gt;Fung, DMS-0940272&lt;br/&gt;Golden, DMS-0940249&lt;br/&gt;Holland, DMS-0940241&lt;br/&gt;Kostelich, DMS-0940314&lt;br/&gt;McGehee, DMS-0940366&lt;br/&gt;Pierrehumbert, DMS-0940261&lt;br/&gt;Silber, DMS-0940262&lt;br/&gt;Tung, DMS-0940342&lt;br/&gt;Zeeman, DMS-0940243&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The investigators form a "Mathematics and Climate Research&lt;br/&gt;Network."  This is a framework for an intensive effort aimed at&lt;br/&gt;bringing to bear the full power of modern applied mathematics and&lt;br/&gt;statistics on the prediction and understanding of the Earth's&lt;br/&gt;climate.  The investigators focus on three key themes: (1)&lt;br/&gt;Dynamics of Climate, (2) Climate Process Modeling, and (3) Data&lt;br/&gt;Analysis and Data Assimilation.  Dynamics of Climate addresses&lt;br/&gt;critical climate processes and their interactions.  Climate&lt;br/&gt;Process Modeling undertakes the modeling of climate components&lt;br/&gt;that have been underrepresented in extant climate models, such as&lt;br/&gt;the multi-scale material structure of sea ice.  Data Analysis and&lt;br/&gt;Data Assimilation develops mathematical tools for analyzing&lt;br/&gt;climate data and assimilating them in current climate models. &lt;br/&gt;The Research Network aims to be a national resource, with&lt;br/&gt;participants at thirteen U.S. universities.  The investigators&lt;br/&gt;work together as a virtual community that holds regular weekly&lt;br/&gt;"webinars" and working meetings over the Internet.  This&lt;br/&gt;multi-year effort is expected to help in defining a research area&lt;br/&gt;of "climate mathematics" and in educating a new generation of&lt;br/&gt;mathematical researchers to meet the scientific challenges&lt;br/&gt;associated with a changing climate. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     This project is driven by the need to better understand the&lt;br/&gt;Earth's climate system.  Climate is the result of many&lt;br/&gt;geophysical and chemical processes in the Earth's atmosphere,&lt;br/&gt;oceans and biosphere.  These processes evolve in time over many&lt;br/&gt;scales, ranging from minutes to centuries, and interact in&lt;br/&gt;multiple ways, most often nonlinearly.  Feedback mechanisms, many&lt;br/&gt;of which are poorly understood, further complicate the picture. &lt;br/&gt;Because there is only one Earth, climate cannot be studied by&lt;br/&gt;systematic experimentation; the only approach available to&lt;br/&gt;climate researchers is through computational experiments.  These&lt;br/&gt;experiments are based on mathematical models, which must be&lt;br/&gt;simple enough not to exceed the capabilities of today's advanced&lt;br/&gt;computer architectures, while still incorporating the physical&lt;br/&gt;and chemical processes that are essential for realistic climate&lt;br/&gt;outcomes.  The expertise of mathematical scientists in designing,&lt;br/&gt;assessing and interpreting these models is critical.  This&lt;br/&gt;"Mathematics and Climate Research Network" helps engage the&lt;br/&gt;mathematical sciences community to address the mathematical and&lt;br/&gt;statistical issues of our changing climate.  The Research Network&lt;br/&gt;takes full advantage of current information technology;&lt;br/&gt;communication and collaboration among the participants takes&lt;br/&gt;place mostly remotely over the Internet.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Overview The ambition of the 2010 NSF MCRN award was "no less than the creation of an area of applied mathematics", using a new and original network structure that builds on existing expertise in geographically dispersed research groups. The Bowdoin PI, Zeeman, is one of the co-directors of MCRN. The clearest picture of MCRN?s achievements is given by the evaluation carried out by Philips Wyatt Knowlton, Inc. in 2015. The snapshot of their evaluation is attached. In the evaluation, MCRN members cite the following as extraordinary advantages of this kind of distributed initiative:  &bull; Access to broad range of expertise not available on a student?s home campus, &bull; Support and mentoring by an extended mentoring team, &bull; Feeling of community of people with shared goals, &bull; Ability to forge new collaborations quickly and choose from large group of potential collaborators, &bull; Access to the resources needed to get into a new research area, &bull; Broadly-based support for seeking new opportunities.   What was achieved in the award period  serves as a model for how a new area can be defined and energized in a relatively short period of time. MCRN now serves as an infrastructure model, a research enterprise, a framework for education and training, and an international initiative.    Intellectual Merit The award provided the critical mass on which the MCRN was built, through postdoctoral fellowships and graduate student stipends, and it has forged strong bonds between the original 12 participating institutions. With a spirit of inclusion and transparency, the network has now grown to over 280 members from 135 institutions.

Each of these focus groups is geographically dispersed and vertically integrated. There are also online seminars, reading groups, and a public engagement group. The integration of research, training and mentoring that generated such strikingly enthusiastic feedback in the 2015 network evaluation was achieved by a careful balance of network-wide activities and network-facilitated small group activities.  Over 200 papers have resulted from this project.    Broader Impacts Preparing students to tackle urgent climate and sustainability problems that are more complex, multi-disciplinary and interwoven than those we are used to tackling ourselves is a non-trivial challenge, requiring profound intellectual courage on the part of the students and their mentors. It has been an especially rewarding aspect of MCRN to see our own students rapidly outgrow us in their interdisciplinary independence, as a direct result of their immersion in the MCRN community.  Broadening their reach, Zeeman and other MCRN members also played key roles in the leadership team of the Mathematics of Planet Earth (MPE) initiative.The success and longevity of the MPE initiative is sealed by the founding of the SIAM activity group for the mathematics of planet Earth, of which all four founding officers are members of MCRN.
