<AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project proposes to create an in-home gait training device that allows a post-stroke patient to undergo rehabilitation with little or no assistance. Approximately 500,000 Americans survive a stroke each year. Miraculously, most stroke survivors can relearn skills, such as walking, that are lost when part of the brain is damaged. They can relearn walking most effectively if they are aided in making the correct motions by a machine or a physical therapist while attempting to walk. This training is expensive and requires the patient to make regular visits to a stroke center or qualified physical therapy center. Berkeley Bionics proposes to create a lightweight robotic exoskeleton which cradles a patient?s lower extremities and torso, and maneuvers their rehabilitating limbs for them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this research are immense. These devices could move most post-stroke rehabilitation out of the clinical setting thereby reducing labor costs dramatically. The gait training exoskeletons will be wearable, very unobtrusive, and allow patients to maneuver in the real world. Patients would therefore be able to wear such devices for most of the day, thus remaining mobile and gaining the therapeutic effects of physical therapy over the course of a day, rather than just a short session. Furthermore, creating such a device will also give clinicians an alternative to the wheelchair to assist patients who are unable to recover adequate mobility to function in their daily lives. This could potentially reduce unhealthy effects of wheelchair use for millions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ SBIR Phase II Outcomes Report  Project Title:                      In-home Rehabilitation for Post-Stroke Patients  Company Name:              Ekso Bionics,      www.eksobionics.com  Principle Investigator:   Adam Zoss,         azoss@eksobionics.com     This project has partially supported all of the exoskeleton development for medical applications at Ekso Bionics.  The resulting outcome has been the successful launch of Ekso&trade;, the first commercialized robotic exoskeleton for use in rehabilitative and medical facilities along with two major upgrades that specifically help focus on the post-stroke patient population  Ekso is a bionic suit, or exoskeleton, which enables individuals with lower extremity paralysis to stand up and walk over ground with a weight bearing, four point reciprocal gait.  Battery-powered motors drive the legs and replace neuromuscular function.  The first generation of Ekso is intended for medically supervised use by individuals with complete or incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI) or disease, and other forms of lower extremity paralysis or weakness due to Multiple Sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, ParksinsonÆs, Guillain Barre, or other neurological disease.  With medical clearance, the suit can typically facilitate walking for individuals completely paralyzed up to their upper chest, or any level of incomplete paralysis.  Steps can be triggered by the supervising therapist, or initiated automatically when the userÆs body is detected to be in the appropriate posture.  Ekso started selling to rehabilitation centers in the US and Europe in Spring of 2012.  A major upgrade to Ekso which allows the device to better facilitate stroke populations was launched in Summer of 2013.  This new upgrade added variable assist and hemiplegic capabilities to the Ekso device.  Variable Assist is a new feature which allows clinicians to augment their patientsÆ strength and provides the ability to strategically target deficient aspects of their gait.  This means weak patients can now get up in a stable environment sooner, while helping them achieve optimal gait patterns and high step dosage. It engages patients by challenging their abilities; balancing the physical effort they exert with the amount of help they need to achieve a more normalized gait.  Variable Assist works by allowing individuals with any amount of lower extremity strength to contribute their own power -- from either leg -- to achieve walking over ground.  Based on the therapeutic goals, therapists now have the option to assign a specific amount of power contribution to augment their patientsÆ efforts, or to allow the Ekso suit to dynamically adjust to their needs in real-time.  Along with Variable Assist, this upgrade has additional hemiplegic modes where the Ekso only assists with one leg, allowing the patient full control of the opposite leg.  This is specifically targeted towards stroke patients who want to maintain the confidence and support from using their un-affected leg.  Ekso BionicÆs latest product (which is partially supported by this project) is Ekso GT&trade;.  Ekso GT is a new release which improves the adjustability and reliability of the Ekso device while adding new, rehabilitation specific features.  To provide additional freedom to patientÆs with sufficient leg strength and control to accommodate it, Ekso GT can free up to three additional degrees-of-freedom on each leg: ankle flexion, leg rotation, and leg abduction.  This allows the exoskeleton to accommodate an even wider range of different patients, different stages in the rehabilitation process, and different lower extremity disorders.  Ekso GT is expected to be sold starting in the Fall of 2013.  As of September 2013, Ekso Bionics has sold over 40 Ekso devices to rehabilitation centers across the US and Europe.  Hundreds of patients have walk millions of steps with assistance from Ekso.  This amazing product, which has become the flagship device of Ekso Bionics, would n...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
