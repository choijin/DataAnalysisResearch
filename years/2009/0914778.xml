<AbstractNarration>The objective of this proposal is to address various search problems in group theory. &lt;br/&gt;Decision problems  in group theory have been studied for over 100 years now, since Dehn put forward, &lt;br/&gt;in the beginning of the 20th century, the three famous decision problems now often referred to as &lt;br/&gt;Dehn's problems: the word problem, the conjugacy problem, and the isomorphism problem. In general, &lt;br/&gt;decision problems are problems of the following nature: given a property P and an input O, find out &lt;br/&gt;whether or not the input O has the property P. On the other hand, search problems are of the following &lt;br/&gt;nature: given a property P and an input O with the property P, find a proof (sometimes called a "witness") &lt;br/&gt;of the fact that O  has the property P. This is a substantial shift of paradigm, and in fact, studying &lt;br/&gt;search problems often gives rise to new research avenues in mathematics or computer science, very different &lt;br/&gt;from those prompted by addressing the corresponding decision problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The potential broader impacts of the proposed research are extensive; the impact on the general area &lt;br/&gt;of information security can be singled out. The difficulty of several well-studied problems, e.g. &lt;br/&gt;integer factorization and the discrete logarithm problem underlie most current public-key cryptographic &lt;br/&gt;protocols used in real-life applications.  Developing public-key protocols based upon other search problems, &lt;br/&gt;e.g. the conjugacy search problem whose difficulty has been well studied by group theorists, is prudent from &lt;br/&gt;the standpoint of robustness, particularly if factorization or related developments threaten the security of &lt;br/&gt;current protocols. The complexity of non-abelian infinite groups is a promising fertile ground for new &lt;br/&gt;protocols and there is a great deal of preliminary work required such as that proposed here.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
