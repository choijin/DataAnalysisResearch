<AbstractNarration>The goal of this Climate Process Team is to formulate and test parameterizations for internal wave mixing in the ocean interior for inclusion in state of the art coupled climate models. Mixing by internal waves is thought to be a primary mechanism governing the overall thermohaline structure of the oceans, and may have significant implications for climate variability. The project promises to reduce the uncertainty in climate prediction associated with the smallest scale physical processes that cannot be explicitly solved by climate models. The project will address three aspects of ocean mixing: near field mixing at internal wave generation sites, mixing due to breakdown of internal wave energy transported in the wave field, and far field mixing due to breakdown of internal wave energy away from sources. Parameterizations will be based on data-based relations for wave physics, radiation balance theory, and results from process models. In addition to be being based on sound theoretical ideas, the parameterizations will also be based on observational results from the growing data set of microstructure observations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Computer models of the ocean and atmosphere are our primary tool for predicting future climate change - quantities important for society such as sea level rise, storm intensity and warming.  Because of computer limitations, these models cannot include all physical processes occurring in the ocean but must rather rely on observations to properly represent or "parameterize" their effects on the model.  Model predictions of sea level rise, for example, are sensitive to how the effects of ocean turbulence are represented.  Specifically, predictions of sea level rise 100 years from now vary by about 30 cm using different turbulence representations.  Intuitively, this can be easily understood since turbulence reduces temperature gradients or contrasts in the ocean by moving heat.  The more turbulence occurring, the more heat is taken up by the ocean and the greater the sea level rise owing in part to contraction.  The primary goal of this project has been to take the detailed observations of ocean turbulence (which is primarily due to breaking internal gravity waves, the subsurface analogue of the waves we see breaking on beaches) and to develop means of including them in the climate models.  The problem is complicated because waves break far from their sources.  Hence, we have broken then problem into "local" turbulence (due to flows over seafloor bumps) and "remote" turbulence (due to waves generated by those flows that travel to other regions before breaking down into turbulence).  Additionally, the wind creates "near-inertial" waves that also lead to turbulence.  These three effects have now been included in climate models and their importance demonstrated.  Future work will continue to refine these methods and representations for improved climate state predictions.       Last Modified: 06/30/2015       Submitted by: Matthew H Alford]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
