<AbstractNarration>There has been an enormous amount of work in recent years directed&lt;br/&gt;toward understanding the structural and dynamical properties of&lt;br/&gt;"informatics graphs" or "complex networks." Most of this work has been&lt;br/&gt;on small to medium-sized networks, and it has led to an improved&lt;br/&gt;understanding of the properties of networks arising in many graph&lt;br/&gt;mining applications.  In spite of this, formulating appropriate models&lt;br/&gt;for and answering even basic questions about larger informatics&lt;br/&gt;graphs remains challenging.  For instance, recent work has shown that&lt;br/&gt;dynamic properties as well as basic structural properties of large&lt;br/&gt;informatics graphs are not reproduced even qualitatively by popular&lt;br/&gt;network generative models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work will use traditional and recently-developed&lt;br/&gt;approximation algorithms for the graph partitioning problem as&lt;br/&gt;"experimental probes" of large informatics graphs in order to&lt;br/&gt;characterize in a more robust and scalable manner the structural and&lt;br/&gt;dynamic properties of very large informatics graphs.  This will&lt;br/&gt;include extending and implementing recently-developed algorithms such&lt;br/&gt;as "local" spectral methods and algorithms that intuitively&lt;br/&gt;"interpolate" between spectral and flow-based methods, as well as&lt;br/&gt;revisiting in light of new applications traditional methods such as&lt;br/&gt;the global spectral method and ideas underlying the popular package&lt;br/&gt;Metis.  A central goal will be to provide the analyst with tools that&lt;br/&gt;have sufficient algorithmic and statistical flexibility to&lt;br/&gt;characterize the local and global structures of large networks in a&lt;br/&gt;rich and robust way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the proposed work lies in extending recent&lt;br/&gt;theoretical and algorithmic developments and applying them to very&lt;br/&gt;real-world problems.  The Broader Impact of the project lies in&lt;br/&gt;enhancing interdisciplinary education at Berkeley and Stanford and&lt;br/&gt;more generally.  This will involve the organization of meetings and&lt;br/&gt;courses that will include the opportunity for research projects,&lt;br/&gt;including by students from underrepresented groups, that focus on&lt;br/&gt;bridging theoretical methods and real-world applications.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The research addressed theoretical and practical aspects of using geometric tools to identify and exploit structure in large social and information graphs and other high-dimensional data.  This includes both structure that are geometric in the sense that there is empirical structure in the data that is meaningfully-interpretable as geometric, as well as characterizing the metric and geometric properties implicit in scalable approximation algorithms for identifying structure in large social and information graphs.  For example, spectral-based and flow-based approximation algorithms sometimes exactly solve regularized versions of the objectives that they also approximately optimize, and in several cases this was precisely characterized.  This has important implications for scalable machine learning methods, and several of these directions were explored to develop improved graph data mining tools.  The findings also have implications for the study of contagion and other diffusion-based processes in graphs as well as for the construction of graph-based data.  For example, a ubiquitous property is that realistic networks are very well-connected or expander-like at large size scales, and this implies that diffusion-based processes tend to mix or equilibrate rapidly, e.g., rumors spread quickly.  Because of this, in many cases, seemingly-minor changes in algorithms have much more substantial effects of the output of those algorithms than when those algorithms are applied in more traditional settings to more traditional data, and several methods to robustify the output of algorithms on real networks were developed.  Connections were made with areas of mathematics such as geometric group theory and structural graph theory, and ideas from these areas were used for improved structure identification in networks from many application areas.  For example, in addition to social and information networks, the methods have been applied to identify novel structure in genetic and astronomical data.  The research was widely disseminated through usual publication venues, it was incorporated into tutorials and classes that the lead researcher developed, and it was included in major meetings on large-scale data analysis that were organized.
