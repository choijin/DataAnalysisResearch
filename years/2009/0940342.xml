<AbstractNarration>Jones, DMS-0940363&lt;br/&gt;Camp, DMS-0940267&lt;br/&gt;Danforth, DMS-0940271&lt;br/&gt;Fung, DMS-0940272&lt;br/&gt;Golden, DMS-0940249&lt;br/&gt;Holland, DMS-0940241&lt;br/&gt;Kostelich, DMS-0940314&lt;br/&gt;McGehee, DMS-0940366&lt;br/&gt;Pierrehumbert, DMS-0940261&lt;br/&gt;Silber, DMS-0940262&lt;br/&gt;Tung, DMS-0940342&lt;br/&gt;Zeeman, DMS-0940243&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The investigators form a "Mathematics and Climate Research&lt;br/&gt;Network."  This is a framework for an intensive effort aimed at&lt;br/&gt;bringing to bear the full power of modern applied mathematics and&lt;br/&gt;statistics on the prediction and understanding of the Earth's&lt;br/&gt;climate.  The investigators focus on three key themes: (1)&lt;br/&gt;Dynamics of Climate, (2) Climate Process Modeling, and (3) Data&lt;br/&gt;Analysis and Data Assimilation.  Dynamics of Climate addresses&lt;br/&gt;critical climate processes and their interactions.  Climate&lt;br/&gt;Process Modeling undertakes the modeling of climate components&lt;br/&gt;that have been underrepresented in extant climate models, such as&lt;br/&gt;the multi-scale material structure of sea ice.  Data Analysis and&lt;br/&gt;Data Assimilation develops mathematical tools for analyzing&lt;br/&gt;climate data and assimilating them in current climate models. &lt;br/&gt;The Research Network aims to be a national resource, with&lt;br/&gt;participants at thirteen U.S. universities.  The investigators&lt;br/&gt;work together as a virtual community that holds regular weekly&lt;br/&gt;"webinars" and working meetings over the Internet.  This&lt;br/&gt;multi-year effort is expected to help in defining a research area&lt;br/&gt;of "climate mathematics" and in educating a new generation of&lt;br/&gt;mathematical researchers to meet the scientific challenges&lt;br/&gt;associated with a changing climate. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     This project is driven by the need to better understand the&lt;br/&gt;Earth's climate system.  Climate is the result of many&lt;br/&gt;geophysical and chemical processes in the Earth's atmosphere,&lt;br/&gt;oceans and biosphere.  These processes evolve in time over many&lt;br/&gt;scales, ranging from minutes to centuries, and interact in&lt;br/&gt;multiple ways, most often nonlinearly.  Feedback mechanisms, many&lt;br/&gt;of which are poorly understood, further complicate the picture. &lt;br/&gt;Because there is only one Earth, climate cannot be studied by&lt;br/&gt;systematic experimentation; the only approach available to&lt;br/&gt;climate researchers is through computational experiments.  These&lt;br/&gt;experiments are based on mathematical models, which must be&lt;br/&gt;simple enough not to exceed the capabilities of today's advanced&lt;br/&gt;computer architectures, while still incorporating the physical&lt;br/&gt;and chemical processes that are essential for realistic climate&lt;br/&gt;outcomes.  The expertise of mathematical scientists in designing,&lt;br/&gt;assessing and interpreting these models is critical.  This&lt;br/&gt;"Mathematics and Climate Research Network" helps engage the&lt;br/&gt;mathematical sciences community to address the mathematical and&lt;br/&gt;statistical issues of our changing climate.  The Research Network&lt;br/&gt;takes full advantage of current information technology;&lt;br/&gt;communication and collaboration among the participants takes&lt;br/&gt;place mostly remotely over the Internet.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The overarching goal is to build an area of "Climate Mathematics." This area will steer applied mathematics to a position from which it can respond as needed to the demands of a changing climate. The network serves to frame the mathematics and formulate the mathematical problems arising in critical areas of climate science.  Development of the ideas and techniques for their resolution is a central objective for all of the activities of the network. This goal is achieved in the building of a community of researchers ready and equipped to address the problems of climate science with a mathematical dimension.    University of Washington is a node in this network and our work for the past five years adheres to the goals of "Climate Mathematics", and specialized them in the area of climate data analysis with an aim to understand the causes of climate change.  We develped new techniques and applied existing techniques in novel ways to the climate data, which included: ice-core data containing proxies for past temperature changes going back 1200 year, instrumental global sea-surface temperature going back 150 years, the longest thermometer record in central England going back 360 years, and underwater ocean heat content data collected for the past few decades.  Our results help advance our understanding of our climate system as involving radiative forcing, atmosphere and ocean as an integral system.  When the surface temperature has not increased as expected even though the emission of greenhouse gases has not abated, it is to be understood that global warming of the entire climate system has not stopped since the total heat content of the system continues to increase, but that surface warming has slowed temporarily as more heat has gone into the deeper oceans.  It is this redistribution of energy into the oceans that is mainly responsible for the acceleration and slowdown of rates of global warming at the surface.  This phenomenon has been better revealed with the above mentioned datasets and the novel ways of analyzing them.
