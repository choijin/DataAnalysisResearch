<AbstractNarration>09300033&lt;br/&gt;Krajewski&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support custom software development to support a network of mobile, scanning, low power, X-band polarimetric Doppler radars acquired recently through NSF funding. The Doppler network's effective use requires internet-based remote control, real-time data visualization and data quality control software and tools for generating precipitation cell observation products. In addition, data management and archiving are needed. The software, archive and control systems will enhance observational capabilities of the fully developed mobile Doppler network and will allow scientists to address long-standing questions of how to predict flooding in ungauged basins. The mobile Doppler network was based on the enhanced capabilities for high spatial and temporal resolution imaging (manufacturer specifies 1.5 deg beamwidth with 250 square meter pixels at 10 km range with 1-2 minute scan times). Precipitation distribution and characterization of 3-D wind velocity fields will be characterized by the X-band polarimetric radars network which can achieve results far superior to existing static national NOAA/NWS network of NEXRAD radars (which are limited to 4 square km pixel resolution). The small (6 m diameter antenna) X-band radars will be trailer-mounted for mobile field deployment. As emphasized in review of the funded MRI proposal, the mobile radar network will enable PIs to addresses a first order driving mechanism of surface and ground water dynamics. The software proposed here will allow unique data acquisition and dissemination. The PI will coordinate all activities with assistance from the Co-PI. The radar units are currently being delivered. During year one, the software design and database structure will be developed along with radar control routines. In year two, algorithms will be refined while real-time data will be collected. New and improved components will be identified and developed. Two PhD students will be involved in the software development. The system will serve as a prototype for high-resolution observations and assist in flood research (especially in fast-responding basins). The heretofore unavailable spatial and temporal data will feed into improved hydrologic cycle models. Data will feed into the Prediction in Ungauged Basins initiative, and the NSF-supported WATERS Network. The software will have a web interface, thus public and educational usage will be facilitated. Two PhD students will be directly involved, and the radar system software will be incorporated into two class modules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>
