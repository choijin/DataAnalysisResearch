<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, John Sheridan and Frieder Jakle of Rutgers University at Newark will explore how scorpionate-type ligand modified polymers can be prepared and used to make assemblies of macromolecules with complex architectures and functions.  The approach is to synthesize monomers that contain bidentate and tridentate ligands based upon neutral organosilicon and anionic organoborate scorpionate structures.  The direct polymerization of these monomers will be studied, and polymer postmodification approaches will be examined as well.  The resulting macromolecules will be complexed to metal ions and metal complex fragments to create a range of new structures with potentially interesting electrochemical, thermal, and optical properties.  The broader impacts involve dissemination of research results via publications and seminars at conferences, training graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, participation in Project SEED, and continued development of a high school outreach program on polymer and materials chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will enhance our fundamental understanding about how to prepare polymers that contain metals.  The results of these studies could have many important long term impacts on solar energy, biomedical, and sensing technologies.</AbstractNarration>
