<AbstractNarration>The highland varieties of Chechen, a Nakh-Daghestanian language spoken in the central Caucasus range in Russia and Georgia, are not all mutually intelligible with each other or the (lowland) standard Chechen language. They preserve some of the most archaic grammar, vocabulary, epic literature, and oral traditions of their very ancient family, which is possibly the only surviving linguistic link to ancient north Mediterranean civilization.  They are among the world's most complex languages and have many rare structural properties of phonology, grammar, and lexicon.  Important aspects of grammar, lexicon, and language-related knowledge in the Caucasus are transmitted fully, or only, when individuals grow to linguistic adulthood in their traditional and ancestral locations.  Highland Chechen towns were cleared and the population deported in 1944, so the entire body of highland language and knowledge will pass with the passing of speakers now over 75 years.  This project will bring together Chechen and U.S. scholars to make extensive audio and video recordings of these elders and jointly begin transcription and analysis, gathering enough material to make clear the importance of Chechen to historical and comparative linguistics, sociolinguistics, ethnography, archaeology, and comparative mythology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If extensive documentation can be done while enough of the generation over 75 can still be recorded, the body of material will be large and varied enough to be useful for advanced corpus and language processing work for the foreseeable future and beyond. This is a magnitude now available only in corpora of large national languages, and the world's last chance to bank for future research on these very distinctive linguistic varieties.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     Chechen is one of the most distinctive and complex languages in all of Eurasia.  This is especially true of the highland dialects which, as in other mountain societies, are sociolinguistically more isolated from the lowland markets and cities and consequently preserve archaisms and rare features that are lost elsewhere.  Not only pure linguistic research but also computational language processing, ethnography, comparative folklore and mythology, and history will benefit from access to recorded speech reflecting the grammar, traditional knowledge, and oral traditions of the Chechen highlands.  Learning the full array of traditional speech practices, including the much-noted highland Chechen canon of courtesy, dignity, and respect, requires growing up in one's clan and its traditional town and lands, in the traditional economy, and learning by example the interpersonal pragmatics and forms of respect.  This transmission came to an end in 1944 when the entire Chechen population was deported and pauperized, with much population loss and destruction of social ties; when the survivors were allowed to return in 1957 resettlement of much of the highlands was forbidden.  It is urgent to record as much as possible from speakers who grew up in the highlands and were beyond linguistic childhood in 1944, a generation that is now passing.  The project began in 2010, 56 years after the deportation, so we needed to find highland speakers in their 70's and older.  This proved logistically more difficult than anticipated, and we were dismayed to find that the life expectancy for that generation is lower than anticipated.        The main project goal was to collect a large body of good-quality recorded speech of the oldest generation, from various individuals and life circumstances and clans and towns, primarily from highland dialects.  We planned to emphasize clan origin legends, town foundation legends, family histories, and genealogies.   Another goal was to collect a corpus adequate for research on typologically important infrequent properties, especially in relation to aspects of interpersonal pragmatics that structure traditional conversation and are being lost in the younger generation.  The project involved collaboration between UC Berkeley, the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, and project participants in the Chechen State University in Grozny, and we hoped to draw Chechen scholars into documentation and corpus work and to set up networks of communication.            We succeeded in recording a sizable corpus.  Work by postdoc Zarina Molochieva has found exactly the patterns of usage we expected in key parts of the grammar.  PI Johanna Nichols has been making initial contacts with natural language processing researchers interested in large corpora of highly non-western languages, and one project is about to begin.      The worsening international situation and its domestic repercussions made all parties fearful of recording some kinds of folklore and reluctant to record children and bring young university students into the work.  A planned pilot project on children's speech had to be abandoned.  The same factors made recording more difficult and time-consuming.  Since recording the oldest generation was consuming more resources than anticipated and it is the one component that cannot be postponed, we put nearly all of our resources into recording.       The principal merit of the project is to have gathered a large recorded corpus, large enough and varied enough to meet the anticipated research goals and adequate for research and cultural documentation for the long future.  In addition we did enough publishing and analysis to verify that the materials meet those goals, also contributing to linguistic knowledge and confirming our main research hypotheses.  The materials are now being transcribed, annotated, and prepared for archiving and also for research on automatic morpheme identification (which, if s...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
