<AbstractNarration>Jones, DMS-0940363&lt;br/&gt;Camp, DMS-0940267&lt;br/&gt;Danforth, DMS-0940271&lt;br/&gt;Fung, DMS-0940272&lt;br/&gt;Golden, DMS-0940249&lt;br/&gt;Holland, DMS-0940241&lt;br/&gt;Kostelich, DMS-0940314&lt;br/&gt;McGehee, DMS-0940366&lt;br/&gt;Pierrehumbert, DMS-0940261&lt;br/&gt;Silber, DMS-0940262&lt;br/&gt;Tung, DMS-0940342&lt;br/&gt;Zeeman, DMS-0940243&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The investigators form a "Mathematics and Climate Research&lt;br/&gt;Network."  This is a framework for an intensive effort aimed at&lt;br/&gt;bringing to bear the full power of modern applied mathematics and&lt;br/&gt;statistics on the prediction and understanding of the Earth's&lt;br/&gt;climate.  The investigators focus on three key themes: (1)&lt;br/&gt;Dynamics of Climate, (2) Climate Process Modeling, and (3) Data&lt;br/&gt;Analysis and Data Assimilation.  Dynamics of Climate addresses&lt;br/&gt;critical climate processes and their interactions.  Climate&lt;br/&gt;Process Modeling undertakes the modeling of climate components&lt;br/&gt;that have been underrepresented in extant climate models, such as&lt;br/&gt;the multi-scale material structure of sea ice.  Data Analysis and&lt;br/&gt;Data Assimilation develops mathematical tools for analyzing&lt;br/&gt;climate data and assimilating them in current climate models. &lt;br/&gt;The Research Network aims to be a national resource, with&lt;br/&gt;participants at thirteen U.S. universities.  The investigators&lt;br/&gt;work together as a virtual community that holds regular weekly&lt;br/&gt;"webinars" and working meetings over the Internet.  This&lt;br/&gt;multi-year effort is expected to help in defining a research area&lt;br/&gt;of "climate mathematics" and in educating a new generation of&lt;br/&gt;mathematical researchers to meet the scientific challenges&lt;br/&gt;associated with a changing climate. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     This project is driven by the need to better understand the&lt;br/&gt;Earth's climate system.  Climate is the result of many&lt;br/&gt;geophysical and chemical processes in the Earth's atmosphere,&lt;br/&gt;oceans and biosphere.  These processes evolve in time over many&lt;br/&gt;scales, ranging from minutes to centuries, and interact in&lt;br/&gt;multiple ways, most often nonlinearly.  Feedback mechanisms, many&lt;br/&gt;of which are poorly understood, further complicate the picture. &lt;br/&gt;Because there is only one Earth, climate cannot be studied by&lt;br/&gt;systematic experimentation; the only approach available to&lt;br/&gt;climate researchers is through computational experiments.  These&lt;br/&gt;experiments are based on mathematical models, which must be&lt;br/&gt;simple enough not to exceed the capabilities of today's advanced&lt;br/&gt;computer architectures, while still incorporating the physical&lt;br/&gt;and chemical processes that are essential for realistic climate&lt;br/&gt;outcomes.  The expertise of mathematical scientists in designing,&lt;br/&gt;assessing and interpreting these models is critical.  This&lt;br/&gt;"Mathematics and Climate Research Network" helps engage the&lt;br/&gt;mathematical sciences community to address the mathematical and&lt;br/&gt;statistical issues of our changing climate.  The Research Network&lt;br/&gt;takes full advantage of current information technology;&lt;br/&gt;communication and collaboration among the participants takes&lt;br/&gt;place mostly remotely over the Internet.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Whether terrestrial ecosystems will survive extended droughts is intimately tied to moisture availability for photosynthesis and transpiration. High-frequency observations show that water tables some 20 meters below the surface can rise by as much as a meter within days of the first winter storms in Northern California.  The rapid flow is through rock fractures, which have been shown to store as much as 30% of the moisture between the surface and the water table.  This vertical distribution of subsurface moisture and its accessibility by plant roots will be a key determinant of the fate of ecosystems.     Traditional (deterministic) approaches for modeling the hydraulic conductivity neglect the rock moisture storage, and have been demonstrated to be too slow in capturing the fast dynamics of the water table. We have developed a new stochastic parameterization of hydraulic conductivity of fracture flow.  There are two unique aspects of the parameterization.  The first is that the rate at which the mean conductivity decreases exponentially with depth is not specified apriori, but is determined by the depth of the fresh bedrock.  The second is that the variance in conductivity decreases with saturation.   The  parameterization has been shown to capture the dynamics of seven wells over six years, when the annual precipitation has varied by a factor of two.  The rapid transit of moisture minimizes overland flow and contributes to storage and runoff. The results also show that variations in the depth of fresh bedrock could introduce heterogeneity in near-surface soil moisture.     A second theme of our project is related to satellite CO2 observations.  Observations from polar-orbiting satellites have repeat cycles of order days.  To interpolate and extrapolate the satellite observations to a global synoptic field, we assimilate satellite observations of CO2 together with raw weather observations into a global carbon-climate model.  We have prototyped the data assimilation system, and are now prepared to apply it to the new observations from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2, launched in July 2014.
