<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanisms Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Robert Levis of the Chemistry Department at Temple University seeks to understand the processes that occur when polyatomic molecules are subjected to laser fields on the order of the fields binding electrons to nuclei. In this laser intensity regime, the molecule can be reprogrammed to drive desired physical and chemical processes including coherent rotational and vibrational motion, chemical reaction and non-resonant vaporization. This research seeks to understand strong field control mechanisms through experimental and theoretical investigations. Students and postdoctoral associates are trained in experiment (lasers and ultrafast optics) and theory and as such, represent an important national resource for high technology science and innovation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is leading to advances for biomedical diagnostics and therapeutics, macromolecule synthesis, nanomaterials synthesis, molecular electronics, and chemical/biological sensors. The findings of strong field chemical research have been leveraged to develop new chemical agent detection systems using adaptive strong field mass spectrometry, to develop new sensing paradigms, and to develop highly sensitive molecular monitors for stand off detection using laser filament-based methods.</AbstractNarration>
