    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0904197&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Yong-Geun Oh&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims at providing a description of Fukaya categories&lt;br/&gt;of toric manifolds and of Calabi-Yau threefolds, and establishing&lt;br/&gt;the mirror correspondence between the Fano toric A-model and the&lt;br/&gt;Landau-Ginzburg B-model based on the general Lagrangian Floer&lt;br/&gt;theory established by the PI jointly with Fukaya, Ohta and&lt;br/&gt;Ono. It also proposes to solve the simpleness problem of the area&lt;br/&gt;preserving homeomorphism group of the two sphere (and the disc)&lt;br/&gt;by investigating the extension problem of Calabi homomorphisms&lt;br/&gt;and Entov-Polterovich's quasi-morphisms to the Hamiltonian&lt;br/&gt;homeomorphism group. In addition, the PI proposes to apply the&lt;br/&gt;machinery of Floer theory to symplectic topology of toric&lt;br/&gt;manifolds and construct new quasi-morphisms on the Hamiltonian&lt;br/&gt;diffeomorphism group and Entov-Polterovich's symplectic&lt;br/&gt;quasi-states on toric manifolds. The PI anticipates that the&lt;br/&gt;proposed research will not only provide solution to the&lt;br/&gt;homological mirror symmetry of Fano toric A-model and&lt;br/&gt;Landau-Ginzburg B-model but also lead to deeper understanding of&lt;br/&gt;open-closed Floer theory and its applications to dynamical&lt;br/&gt;systems and symplectic topology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Hamiltonian formalism played a fundamental role not only for&lt;br/&gt;solving problems in classical mechanics but also for transforming&lt;br/&gt;the classical mechanics into quantum mechanics. It also plays an&lt;br/&gt;important role in deriving many basic physical equations in high&lt;br/&gt;energy physics ranging from quantum field theory to modern string&lt;br/&gt;theory. The natural space where the Hamiltonian formalism can be&lt;br/&gt;exercised is the symplectic manifold (or more generally the&lt;br/&gt;Poisson manifold). One of the most distinguished geometric&lt;br/&gt;objects of study in symplectic manifold is the Lagrangian&lt;br/&gt;submanifold; For example, `the state of a particle with zero&lt;br/&gt;momentum in space' forms a Lagrangian submanifold in `all&lt;br/&gt;possible states of a particle in space' which forms a symplectic&lt;br/&gt;manifold. Understanding the interplay between geometry of&lt;br/&gt;Lagrangian submanifolds and dynamics of Hamiltonian flows is the&lt;br/&gt;core theme of symplectic topology. The PI's proposed research&lt;br/&gt;aims at extending the Hamiltonian dynamics to the level of&lt;br/&gt;continuous dynamics and solving various problems arising from&lt;br/&gt;Hamiltonian dynamics and mirror symmetry. It also aims at easing&lt;br/&gt;the access of graduate students and researchers from other&lt;br/&gt;related fields into the study of Floer theory and mirror symmetry&lt;br/&gt;by writing a graduate level textbook on Floer homology and its&lt;br/&gt;applications to symplectic geometry.</AbstractNarration>
