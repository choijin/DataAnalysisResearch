<AbstractNarration>Columbia University doctoral student, Matthew E. West, with the guidance of Dr. Myron L. Cohen, will undertake anthropological research on the process and practice of innovation. The focus of the research will be an ethnography of the production and circulation of different forms of intellectual property during the design and manufacture of a green technology product. The research will be carried out primarily in a single green technology company's Taiwanese design and licensing branch, with additional research in their Chinese  manufacturing site. This research is important because it will provide a better understanding of the everyday practice of intellectual property, a kind of property with its associated practicies that is at the foundation of the global knowledge economy and that facilitates a global division of labor between knowledge and manufacturing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researcher will focus on the connections between intellectual property and the designs, licenses, and other products through which people normally encounter intellectual property. He will follow the product from the creation and licensing of its intellectual components through to its final manufacture. Data collection methods will include participant observation fieldwork in the company's Taiwanese and Chinese sites; semi-structured interviews with company employees and other industry experts; and the collection and analysis of related documentary materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will contribute to social science theory of high technology businesses,  complementing other research on open-source software and indigenous cultural property. It also will provide a needed micro-level perspective on the variety of connections that tie new intangible objects of ownership to tangible commodities, and so contribute to the ongoing challenges of creating policies for managing intellectual property. Funding this research also supports the education of a social scientist.</AbstractNarration>

Through these interviews and observation of Company practices, the research aimed to understand and analyze the creation, circulation, and use of patents.   Research was conducted in a Taiwanese LED company due to its particular sociological position of "between" that allowed an understanding of patents from multiple perspectives at the same time. First, Taiwanese companies produce their products between companies in the United States (Japan, and Europe) who own the majority of early (and powerful) patents in the industry and those relatively new companies in China with vast advantages in government capital and lower wages for workers. Second, in a historical sense, these companies are working in the midst of an attempted transition in Taiwan from being a "pirate" of intellectual property (IP) to being a strong advocate for enforcement of IP laws. The setting in Taiwan allowed an understanding of patents to emerge from in an industry where they are of primary importance, but in a place where their use was still relatively new; patents as property were not yet something people took for granted.

Anthropologically, the research approach and analysis has built on a long tradition of scholarly interest in property and its social consequences by adding to this issues highlighted by patents (and Taiwan) including concerns with global chains of cooperation/competition, circulation of commodities, value, and the connections between intangible owned technical knowledge and the tangible products produced with that knowledge for separate sale.*     The most important contribution of the funded research is its description and analysis, at the level of daily practice within a company, of the process by which technical knowledge becomes property.

This translation, necessarily, also creates a certain distance between the technology in-the-lab and the technology-as-owned in the patent. The account also describes the claims and counter-claims made to ownership throughout the process of the negotiations between Comapny patent engineers and patent office examiners that, rather than the engineers' work in the lab, is what actually creates the "invention" from a legal perspective. It goes on to describe the processes by which the Company's employees decide which types of knowledge to patent (and in which jurisdictions), how to assert control over the types of internal technical knowledge that will...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
