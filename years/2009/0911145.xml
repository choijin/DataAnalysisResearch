<AbstractNarration>"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5)." &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Analytical and Surface Chemistry (ASC) program of the Division of Chemistry supports the research program of Professor Richard P. Van Duyne at Northwestern University. Professor Van Duyne and his coworkers are developing new concepts and experimental tools to study four topics. First, molecular generality of single molecule surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy will be explored. At present single molecule SERS is the only experimental method to chemically identify the structure of single molecules and represents the ultimate limit in analytical sensitivity. Second, the structures of the nanoparticles required for the implementation of single molecule SERS will be obtained using spatially correlated high resolution transmission electron microscopy. Third, the project will explore the use of aluminum as a new plasmonic material for ultraviolet surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy. Finally, several new experimental methods will be employed to more deeply probe the fundamentals of molecular plasmonics. These include single nanoparticle spectroscopy and tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy. This project will lead to fundamentally new understanding of the chemistry of single molecules adsorbed on surfaces and will impact many areas of science and technology such as molecular electronics, ultrasensitive bioassays for medical diagnostics, and dye sensitized solar cells. The graduates student and postdoctoral fellow who will work on this project will be trained to become independent and innovative research leaders. Prof. Van Duyne and his coworkers will continue their collaborative research with Dr. Francesca Casadio at the Art Institute of Chicago on the applications of surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy and tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy to problems in art conservation science.</AbstractNarration>
