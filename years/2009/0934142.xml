<AbstractNarration>The Partnership for Research and Education in Materials (PREM) between three Atlanta University Center (AUC) schools and the Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) at Georgia Institute of Technology (GT) integrates research, education, and student-mentoring in order to increase the number of underrepresented students pursuing graduate degrees and to increase their overall participation in the field of materials science and engineering. The three AUC schools are Clark Atlanta University (CAU), Morehouse College (MC), and Spelman College (SC). The partner MRSEC is ?The Georgia Tech Laboratory for New Electronic Materials? in which fundamental materials properties and synthesis of epitaxial graphene are being investigated. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Graphene is a new electronic material that is poised to be the successor to silicon. Bringing epitaxial graphene to the level of a technologically relevant material depends upon fundamental research, innovation and improved methodologies to understand and control the structure and properties of this novel material.  Key features of the partnership include: (1) establishing research collaboration between AUC and GT faculty, postdoctoral associates, and graduate students; (2) strengthening the research and education infrastructure of AUC; (3) providing research opportunities for AUC undergraduates during the academic year; (4) providing summer research experiences for AUC students at GT through the collaborative research program; and (5) developing and hosting summer research institutes for high school teachers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research effort involves both experimental characterizations of epitaxially grown graphene and simulation studies of the electronic structures of graphene-related nanodevices. The broader impact of this program will be a significant enhancement of the infrastructure of AUC for materials research, education, and technology transfer; equally significant is the likely, long-term, sustainable, synergistic impact on the GT diversity programs in science and engineering. The high school students program is designed to better-prepare and motivate high school students from metro Atlanta to major in science or engineering upon entering college. Since the student population of AUC is predominantly African American, the undergraduate student activities will establish a pipeline of well-prepared and motivated undergraduate African American students who will pursue graduate studies in materials science and engineering at GT or other research universities.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
