<AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will renovate and upgrade specific existing research laboratories and facilities in the Richard King Mellon Hall of Science at Duquesne University.  The renovation will include: plumbing upgrades; replacement of worn bench tops and casework; replacement of outdated and inefficient hoods; upgrade/replacement of inadequate existing HVAC; and most importantly safety upgrades.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed renovations will result in more efficient and safer research environments in the individual research laboratories of six investigators as well as in a shared facility. These research groups, with funding through the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, and the Department of Energy, are studying a diverse array of significant chemical and biological problems, including: the generation of metallated nitriles, a study of the role of metal ions in biological processes, the quantitative determination of lipid species in biological samples, metrology problems related to environmental and homeland security, developing an understanding of the physiology and biochemistry of bacteria that transform metal and metalloids, and the study of molecular evolution in nonhuman primate genes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every research lab included in the proposed renovation has undergraduate researchers as part of the research group. A dynamic summer research program typically brings 40-45 undergraduate researchers to Duquesne for a 10-week intensive research experience each summer. An NSF-funded Research Experiences for Undergraduates program is in its 6th year of providing undergraduate students with a summer research experience integrating computational and experimental approaches to research problems. Undergraduates are supported through University funding to enable and encourage presentation of their research at national meetings. For the past 5 years, an active Project SEED summer program has brought 19 economically disadvantaged high school students, more than half of them African American, to the Duquesne campus for enriching summer research experiences.  It is anticipated that both the students in REU program and students in SEED program will greatly benefit from the renovated laboratories.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award enabled the renovation of seven research laboratory suites located in the Richard King Mellon Hall of Science at Duquesne University.  The building was constructed in 1968 and these research spaces had not been renovated since that time.   Intellectual Merit  The specific research activities impacted positively by these renovations include:  1)  Environmental impacts of shale gas extraction (Dr. John Stolz).   Flowback and water samples from several unconventional natural gas wells were analyzed, resulting in a 2013 webinar "Analysis of Flowback Water from Marcellus Unconventional Gas Extraction Using OES". Research on the composition of waste water fluids associated with unconventional shale gas extraction, focusing on the unique microbiota as well as well water quality in Southwest Pennsylvania continues in this laboratory.   Over 400 well water samples were collected during the funding period, providing a better understanding of well water quality in Southwestern PA and the impacts on this quality of unconventional shale gas extraction.   2)  Structure and function of molybdenum enzymes (Dr. Partha Basu).  The role of molybdenum-containing enzymes in transforming chemical species such as nitrate, nitrite and arsenate is being studied with the goal of defining the detailed mechanisms of these reactions.  Such reactions are prevalent in microbial systems and in some cases in mammalian systems.  The mononuclear molybdenum enzymes harbor a unique cofactor called the molybdenum cofactor.  During the funding period, progress has been made toward a chemical synthesis of the cofactor. Humans with a compromised genetic makeup whose bodies cannot properly synthesize the cofactor exhibit severe physiological distress.   3)  Use of nitriles as versatile intermediates in organic synthesis (Dr. Fraser Fleming).  During the funding period, this research group advanced knowledge of the fundamental chemical behavior of nitriles.  A newly identified reaction addressed several challenges in making metal-containing nitriles for alkylations, resulting in a reaction type particularly useful in controlling precise spatial arrangements of atoms during complex organic synthetic reactions.  This group launched a new research venture to advance the chemistry of a related group of molecules known as isonitriles, discovering a new chemical building block for the synthesis of these compounds.  A more detailed understanding of the chemistry of nitriles and isonitriles has broad applications in the laboratory synthesis of a variety of complex organic molecules.     4)  Research in primate molecular evolution (Dr. Michael Jensen-Seaman).  The renovated facilities enabled this research group to expand into new projects, including the use of recombinant proteins expressed in mammalian cells to address functional molecular evolution.  Specifically, this group explored the importance of allelic human variation in expression of pregnancy related genes, with potential implications for susceptibility to preterm birth. The renovated research space is also used for screening genomic libraries and general bacterial cloning in support of several projects related to research of primate molecular evolution.  5)  Department of Biological sciences:   Autoclave facility renovation in support of microbiology and molecular biology research groups.  The renovated autoclave room has been heavily used for research purposes since completion of the renovation.   Since completion, the renovated facility has been used by undergraduate students conducting more than 143 credit hours of independent research as well as 47 graduate student researchers in the Department of Biological Sciences.  This usage represents every funded and unfunded research project in Biological Sciences, since a majority of the projects depend upon autoclaved media, solutions, and instruments.  It has also been used by an additional 8 student researchers in Chemistry, which is also housed in Mello...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
