<AbstractNarration>Fire is an important natural disturbance in forested ecosystems around the world and serves as a critical but poorly understood link between climate change and biosphere response. In recent decades, drought, land-cover alteration, and non-native plant invasions have altered natural fire regimes at an alarming rate, and in the process threatened native biodiversity and human well-being across the planet. This interdisciplinary PIRE project focuses on similarities and contrasts in fire, climate, and land-use interactions in Australia, New Zealand and the U.S. because all have experienced extreme drought, rapid land-use change and past and present devastating fires. The main research questions to be addressed in this project are: 1) To what extent are prehistoric and modern fire regimes shaped by climate, landscape and fuel arrangements, and human activities? 2) How has the well-documented warming of the late 20th century altered wildfire activity in comparison with the variability of these fire regimes at centennial and millennial time scales? 3) How does understanding the historical range of variability of wildfire activity inform decision making with respect to mitigating and adapting to climate change impacts over the next several decades? State-of-the-art field, laboratory, and modeling tools will be used to reconstruct past and current fire regimes in multiple watersheds and increase our understanding of regional and hemispheric fire-climate linkages and land-use feedbacks. Each country's personnel lend unique expertise to this interdisciplinary team of biologists, geographers, geoscientists, paleoclimatologists, and anthropologists who will draw from and integrate techniques in paleoecology, paleoclimatology, dendroecology, GIS science and remote sensing, and fire behavior modeling to examine the past and present role of fire in the biosphere. The PIRE team anticipates that such a broad and integrated approach will help provide the scientific results necessary to guide current and future fire-related land-use decisions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The U.S. educational impacts include the training of two early-career scientists, two postdoctoral research associates, four graduate students, and 14 undergraduate students over a five year period. Educational activities range from undergraduate internships to graduate and postdoctoral fellowships, and two international scientific workshops that will provide training for students and professionals about international issues in fire science, global change, and land management. Team-taught courses, online courses and discussions, and educational materials will be developed and made available to academic institutions, government agencies, and NGOs. One unique feature of this PIRE project is the participation of young filmmakers and scientists to produce high-quality media products to extend the project's outreach to popular science and natural history web platforms. The PIRE project will team with Montana State University (MSU)'s Science and Natural History Filmmaking program, which trains science graduate students to create accurate and compelling media that communicate STEM disciplines to the public. Podcasts of WildFIRE PIRE research and discoveries will be available through the project's webpage as well as via MSU's award-winning science and natural history website TERRA: The Nature of Our World. An MFA student in the program and an undergraduate intern will gain valuable field-based experience planning, directing, and producing mini-documentary podcasts describing and reporting on the PIRE project's fire research and science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Institutional impacts of the project include strengthening international collaborations among partners and linkages to the global fire science community. The project's research addresses national priorities in the U.S., Australia, and New Zealand concerning climate change, fire, ecosystem management, and sustaining native biodiversity. It will also enhance and contribute to international fire programs, including International Geosphere Biosphere Program Cross-Project Fire Initiative and Core Program Activities; the UK-based Global Paleofire Working Group; and NOAA's International Multi-proxy Paleofire Database to study fire globally. In addition, including undergraduates from across the country, including from tribal colleges, in the overseas field research and outreach experiences will help the U.S. institutions recruit and retain a diverse and globally engaged cadre of undergraduates. At a state level, the project supports university efforts to build partnerships with communities, businesses, state government and other educational entities that will help align science education and research with pressing social and economic challenges within the state. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results of the project will provide: (1) a better understanding of the direct and indirect role of humans, climate, and fire feedbacks on ecosystem processes that operate at different temporal and spatial scales; (2) information on the historical range of variability of fire conditions necessary to assess current fire activity, risk and hazard in different settings, relative to that of the late 20th century; (3) development of new approaches that link historical with modern fire science and empirical with modeled reconstructions; and (4) training for current and future international fire scientists. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The U.S. institutions partnering in this project include Montana State University at Bozeman, the University of Idaho, the University of Colorado at Boulder, and the USDA Forest Service's Missoula Fire Sciences Laboratory (MT). The Australia partners are the University of Tasmania and Australian National University. The New Zealand partners are Manaaki Whenua - Landcare Research and the University of Auckland.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is co-funded by NSF's Office of International Science and Engineering, the Division of Earth Sciences, the Division of Behavioral and Cognitive Sciences, the Division of Environmental Biology, the Division of Human Resource Development (Tribal Colleges and Universities Program) and the Division of Research on Learning in Formal and Informal Settings.</AbstractNarration>

The WildFIRE PIRE project has been a collaboration among climatologists, vegetation modelers, fire ecologists, forest managers, Maori leaders and filmmakers interested in the consequences of increased biomass burning around the world.  In addition to the PI universities, we have developed new partnerships with tribal colleges, federal and state resource agencies, non-governmental organizations, and education specialists.

In particular, the project has focused on fire ecology and history in New Zealand, Australia, Patagonia, and the western U.S. as areas of comparison.   A total of 3296 days was spent in overseas fieldwork. Over the course of eight years, the project advanced understanding of fire-climate linkages across multiple temporal and spatial scales; examined the significance of human-set fires in wet forests where few fires occur; and explored the consequences of invasive species on natural fire-climate-vegetation linkages.  Through new data collection and analysis, modeling experiments, and data-model comparisons, the project resulted in new approaches and techniques for understanding wildfire in the past and in the future.       The project has many metrics of success: More than $7.2 million has been leveraged in additional research support to supplement the original NSF PIRE award.   Seven PhDs, 1 MS and 1 MFA involved in the project have graduated.  One Co-PI was promoted to Associate Professor, and one was elected to the National Academy of Sciences. Of our seven postdoctoral researchers, three have obtained tenure-track positions; two are university research associates, and two are university instructors.  Two PhD graduates now hold university faculty positions. A total of 116 journal articles and 17 one-time publications were completed during the grant, and numerous conference papers and invited presentations were given. Of the publications, 99 had early-career scientist or graduate student as co-authors.       New methodologies (e.g., ancient DNA, organic biomarkers) were developed to better identify past fire occurrence and human presence, improve age model development, and better estimate past fuel conditions. New modeling efforts provided better understanding of fire-climate-human interactions in New Zealand, Patagonia and the western US and allowed us to make broader inference about the climate and human drivers of past fire activity within a hypothesis-testing framework.  In addition, one component of the project examined the role of invasive pine on southern hemisphere fire regimes.  A new simulation model from this group is now used to assess thresholds of pine forest density that may permanently alter native ecosystems.  WildFIRE PIRE discoveries have been incorporated in the graduate and undergraduate curriculum in ecology, forestry, and Earth sciences at all PIRE institutions. One early-career scientist taught a graduate course on climate change and fire activity at Univ. Concepcion, Chile, during a Fulbright Fellowship.  We hosted four international workshops to share results with members of project as well as the broader scientific and forest management communities.  All PIRE PIs and senior personnel gave seminars at universities and research institutions in the US and beyond.  The projected supported 17 undergraduate interns as members of research teams working in New Zealand, Tasmania, Patagonia, and the western U.S.  We involved students from underrepresented populations, by working closely with Salish Kootenai College to recruit Native Americans into the internship program.  The interns were team members in the field and lab and spent time in non-governmental conservation organizations focused on fire-related issues.  Three of the SKC interns have gone on to graduate studies in natural resources and environmental sciences and received graduate support from the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship program, the Sloan Foundation, and university grants. WildFIRE PIRE also involved and trained numerous undergraduate research assistants in field and laboratory techniques; many of these individuals are now in graduate school.   In addition to technical publications, popular articles were published, and public presentations were given on the topic of wildfire in all of the PIRE study regions.  The co-PIs have been interviewed regularly by the media about the recent wildfire situation in their respective countries, including appearances on local and national news programs and in science films and TV programs.  Fifteen video podcasts on WildFIRE PIRE were produced by a co-PI and his students from the MFA program in Science and Natural History Filmmaking at Montana State University.  The podcasts describe the research, scientific discoveries, and broader importance of the project as it developed and have been a primary tool for broader outreach and dissemination.   The videos are accessible on the WildFIRE PIRE website and vimeo.com; two have won awards and recognition in international film festivals.
