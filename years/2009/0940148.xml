<AbstractNarration>The investigation will determine the characteristics of orographic forcing and its contribution to the total occurrence of mesospheric gravity waves.  The project entails the estimation of the momentum and energy flux associated with the mountain waves as well as the level of flux divergence, i.e., wave deposition, into the mesopause region.  The project goals will be achieved using all-sky imaging observations of the mesosphere-lower thermosphere (MLT) mountain waves in conjunction with measurements from several types of multi-diagnostic instrumentation co-located at the El Leoncito Observatory in Argentina providing hydroxyl and oxygen winds, temperatures, and brightness.  Additional satellite measurements of MLT temperature and airglow emission rate, as well as tropospheric/stratospheric winds and temperatures, will also be utilized in order to obtain a comprehensive characterization of the origin and behavior of the waves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary thrust of the project is to analyze gravity wave data generated by westerly winds flowing across the Andes and imaged in the immediate downwind region by their effects on the hydroxyl, oxygen, and sodium airglow emissions.  Mountain wave events will be identified using tropospheric and stratospheric temperature measurements obtained from satellite radiances.  These measurements, combined with mean wind information in the troposphere and stratosphere, will characterize the forcing conditions for mountain wave generation.  Other satellite measurements will provide mean state temperature covering a large vertical extent of the atmosphere which will help tie the lower atmosphere measurements to the MLT region measurements.  The subject of orographic forcing of atmospheric gravity waves is of current interest as part of efforts to determine the importance of coupling of various kinds of tropospheric processes to the upper atmosphere. The work will advance these efforts.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this project, we investigated the occurrence and characteristics of mesospheric mountain gravity waves over the Andes mountain range in Argentina.  Gravity waves are buoyancy oscillations that occur commonly throughout the atmosphere and oceans. They are an important mechanism for the transport of energy and momentum.     Mountain gravity waves are a particular type of gravity wave that is generated when wind flows over topography such as a mountain range. Although common in the lower levels of the atmosphere such as the troposphere and stratosphere, they are heavily filtered and attenuated by the wind field and so do not usually reach the upper mesosphere region at 85-100 km altitude.     In this project, the gravity waves were recorded in nighttime airglow using an all-sky imaging system located at the Boston University field station at the El Leoncito Observatory, Argentina (31.8&ordm;S, 69.3&ordm;W). Airglow is a naturally-occurring chemoluminescence that originates from narrow layers of gas near 85-100 km in the upper mesosphere. It arises from the recombination of neutral species that were broken down due to solar radiation during the daytime hours. Several species can occur with the brightness being due to hydroxyl (~87 km), sodium (~92 km), and atomic oxygen (~97km).     We undertook a more comprehensive investigation that built upon our initial study and involved several yearsÆ (2007-2013) worth of mesospheric mountain gravity wave data from El Leoncito.     Our result confirmed our earlier initial study that indicated that the occurrence of the mesospheric mountain waves was seasonally controlled with their occurrence mainly during the winter months of June to August. During that time, the seasonal winds eastward blow over the Andes mountain range at most levels in the atmosphere allowing the waves to propagate up to the mesosphere with little or no attenuation.     The mountain waves exhibited stationary behavior over the site which lasted in most cases for several hours. The waves exhibited horizontal wavelengths of 30-40 km. Estimates of momentum flux were very large ~100Æs m2s2 compared to typical values ~10Æs m2s2.     We also looked at the variability of the mountain waves on time-scales from hours to weeks and found that the daily occurrence was controlled by the phase of the diurnal wind tide. As the direction of the winds changed due to the tide, the amount of absorption of the waves by the winds also varied.     The most important result we found was that significant amounts wave energy and momentum can routinely propagate from the lower levels of the atmosphere at ~5-10 km altitude up to altitudes of ~90-100 km and higher during the favorable conditions existing over South America during the winter months. This result has important implications for understanding the seasonal transport of wave energy and momentum throughout the earth's atmosphere.     The study involved an undergraduate who learnt many aspects of upper atmospheric research including data reduction and analysis.     The results have been presented at several scientific meetings and two research papers have been written.       Last Modified: 03/31/2014       Submitted by: Steven M Smith]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
