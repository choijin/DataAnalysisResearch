<AbstractNarration>The commercial success of data mining, and the great research interest&lt;br/&gt;that this area attracts, prove that there is a need for analyzing and&lt;br/&gt;understanding data that goes well beyond classical database queries.&lt;br/&gt;Users are often particularly interested in understanding the causal&lt;br/&gt;relationship between data items and the reasons for observations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Current database systems cannot explicitly model the causal structure&lt;br/&gt;within data (although it is often implicit in the data), and thus offer&lt;br/&gt;no specific support for causal queries. In the absence of information&lt;br/&gt;about causal relationships, users have to rely on techniques for mining&lt;br/&gt;for statistically significant patterns in data. Causal relationships&lt;br/&gt;are often simply concluded from statistical dependencies. This can lead&lt;br/&gt;to inaccurate conclusions; correlation does not necessarily imply&lt;br/&gt;causation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project creates the foundations for a new breed of databases&lt;br/&gt;called causal databases. Causal databases can model causal information,&lt;br/&gt;and allow for queries regarding causality and explanations, which are&lt;br/&gt;beyond the scope of current databases. They can also take advantage of&lt;br/&gt;causal information that is implicit, but unexploited, in some current&lt;br/&gt;databases, such as those for large engineering projects. In the&lt;br/&gt;project, new database models and query languages for representing and&lt;br/&gt;transforming causal information are developed, with particular focus on&lt;br/&gt;large engineering databases and scientific databases. In addition,&lt;br/&gt;efficient and scalable techniques for processing causality and&lt;br/&gt;computing explanations in large causal databases are developed. This&lt;br/&gt;involves both work on integrating causality processing into traditional&lt;br/&gt;database query processing architectures and the development of special&lt;br/&gt;datastream techniques for scaling up to the most data-intensive&lt;br/&gt;applications.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Further information on the project can be found at the project web&lt;br/&gt;page:  http://www.cs.cornell.edu/databases/causality/&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this project, we worked on many topics related to the foundationsof causality and causality in databases.  On the foundational front,we started with the definiton of causality proposed by Judea Pearl andJoseph Halpern (PI).  We (a) proposed an improvement of the definiton,(b) showed how causal models could be represented compactly, (c) showed how toadd a notion of "normality" to the notion in a way that both captured human intuitions and dealt with problems with the definition, (d) characterized the complexity of many problems related to causality, with a focus on causal queries in databases, and (e) proposed adefinition of probabilistic causality.    With regard to causal databases, we considered modifications to theHalpern-Pearl definition that would make it more appropriate and more tractable for database queries.  These modfications allowed us to do things like rank causes and explain contributions to relational aggregate functions, aiding users in identifying errors in uncertain or untrusted data.  We then developed a framework and a system forexplaining query results.  Today, many users with a variety of backgrounds seek to extract high-level information from datasets. In a typical scenario, a user integrates a number of data sets, computes some statistics, then wants to find (causal) explanations for what she sees: Why are these data values outliers? Why are two graphs similar (or dissimilar)?  Why is this value so high (low)?  We developed a framework for finding explanations for numerical SQL queries (i.e., queries with an aggregate operator, or some arithmetic expression combining multiple such queries).  We then developed an "Explanation-Ready" database, which computes on-the-fly complexexplanations to query answers.
