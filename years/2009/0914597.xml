<AbstractNarration>The broad goal of this two-year project is to increase the enrollment of African- and Hispanic-American students in geosciences at Howard University and Pennsylvania State University. The core objective is to develop strategies to recruit and retain minority students with the goal to enter doctoral programs in geosciences or join the professional ranks. Throughout the academic year, undergraduate students will participate in supportive peer and faculty mentoring activities. Peer mentors will include resident graduate students and senior undergraduates, including majority students. Faculty mentors will work with undergraduates on research activities involving hands-on and inquiry-based approaches. Joint research projects will be carried out involving both minority and majority students. Symposia will be organized during the spring semester to allow students to practice how to present scientific results. Likewise, summer research workshops will be organized to engage students in research activities under the guidance of senior graduates and faculty members. Emphasis of the summer workshops will be on engaging undergraduates to pursue experiential research methods utilizing modern technologies. Retreats will be organized to discuss opportunities in graduate school and professional ranks. By working with students for a full calendar year, it will be possible to evaluate the most suitable approaches to attract minorities to pursue geosciences as their potential career.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project contributed to the development of strategies to recruit minority students to pursue graduate studies in Geosciences.  Three generations of (a total of 8) students received mentoring from Penn State University faculty members and graduate students on the application of scientific methods.  "Clusters of learners" were established. Each cluster comprised a faculty member, a graduate student, and an undergraduate student who worked together on common research objectives.  This grouping formation provided undergraduate students vertical mentoring opportunities (interaction with faculty, graduate students, and other leading scientists), as well as horizontal interaction (peer- to-peer) when different clusters regularly met with each other to collaborate and discuss research results.  Students acquired research skills on the operation of novel instruments so that they could acquire datasets in support of research hypotheses. Students investigated formation and transport of airborne pollutants in the lower atmosphere, and aerosol physical and chemical characteristics in Beltsville, MD (at the Howard University research facility).  At the end of the field studies, students analyzed the resulting datasets.  They made oral presentations and developed reports to highlight the principal scientific findings.  Throughout the academic year, students participated in locally organized meetings to present research results to peers and faculty members.  Also, students participated in workshops to learn the procedures for graduate school applications and the strategies to become successful in graduate school.  Through participation in field studies and use of sophisticated equipment in the field, undergraduate students became proficient not only with the deployment of instrumentation but also with many other tasks required for smooth participation in research activities.  Students learned how to work with research equipment, developed skills on data analyses and interpretation, gained experience in reporting research results via oral presentations and written reports, and interacted with leading experts in Geosciences.  This project contributed to the training of professionals.  Such outcome will increase the diversity of the geosciences workforce.  The program was also beneficial to graduate students as they acquired both skills on mentoring junior scholars and assistance in completing their own research activities.
