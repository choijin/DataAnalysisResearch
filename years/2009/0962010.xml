<AbstractNarration>Funds are provided to continue the operation of the LDGO Sample Repository and allow better community access to both sea floor materials and related information. Curation and maintenance of the existing and growing collection and expansion of the range of sedimentary archives by inclusion of coral samples are the main objectives. Further enhancement will include the generation of basic data by discrete sediment measurements as well as nondestructive scanning methods. Improvement of the digital data management and access with the Digital Sample Curation System and an expanded data mining ability is also a goal. The repository cores form important research materials for deep-sea exploration, geological hazards, marine geology, tectonics, sedimentology, geochemistry, evolution, and paleoclimate. Data from old and new materials in the collection were and will be the source for novel interpretations resulting in hundreds of high-profile and influential articles published during the past decade, in leading journals. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The Repository continues to be involved in many educational activities. It participates in Saturday Workshops for Educators where teachers can accrue up to 15 hours of new teacher staff development credits. The Repository hosts many visiting graduate and undergraduate classes and the lab is well suited for class seminars on sediments from acquisition to processing. The plan includes employing undergraduates and high school students in research-oriented positions. The repository and its staff will also continue to be available to educators and the media for opportunities to disseminate science to the general public</AbstractNarration>
