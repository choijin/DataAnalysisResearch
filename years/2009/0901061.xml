<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to combine a high-mobility semiconductor and a highly piezoelectric material to produce acoustic charge transfer (ACT) devices giving performance significantly improved over current devices. ACTs were developed from surface-acoustic wave filters to be capable of complex programmable filtering functions on high-speed analog signals. The approach is to exploit chip-to-chip bonding techniques to fabricate a novel structure consisting of a piezoelectric substrate supporting a quantum-well. &lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this research is to enable transformational improvement of ACT devices which currently need high power input to propel charges using a weakly piezoelectric semiconductor. Using a highly piezoelectric material, the power input requirement for moving charge through the quantum-well layer is substantially reduced. Initial estimates using available data show over one thousand times reduction in the input power required (e.g., from 0.35W to 300Ã¬W using typical device design parameters). This level of improvement is unprecedented and if successful would allow ACT devices to take their place as an important and competitive signal-processing device rather than as a power-hungry curiosity. &lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts include capitalizing on the PI?s frequent appearances as a scientific communicator in the broadcast media; transforming the electronic device landscape by allowing ACT usage in applications where power is at a premium; integrating research and educational goals by providing support to undergraduate Senior Design projects as well as training graduate students in techniques of both signal-processing and microfabrication, essential for future technology development; and promotion of diversity through close involvement in University minority programs.</AbstractNarration>
