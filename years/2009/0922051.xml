<AbstractNarration>Blood pressure drives fluid containing water and solutes across the walls of large arteries. Although the arterial wall is composed of several layers, the innermost layer (blood side) is composed of a single layer of cells (endothelial cells). Blocking aquaporin-1, a protein that allows water to pass through the endothelial cells, decreases fluid flow across the wall. Unexpectedly, the level of this reduction depends on the blood pressure. This project will develop a mathematical theory to explain the contribution of these aquaporins to the microanatomy of the vessel wall, including this pressure-dependence, and to the flow and transport through it. Additionally, the project will test the theory's predictions with experiments on rat vessels and on cultured cells. It will also test the hypothesis that a vessel can actively change its number of aquaporins in response to changes in blood pressure and see how these changes affect flow across the vessel wall. Because fluid flow can affect the deposition of cholesterol in the arterial wall, this research will provide a fundamental understanding of the earliest events leading to hardening of the arteries. Graduate and undergraduate students will be involved in this research. Under the guidance of the principal investigator, undergraduate students will conduct outreach activities at local high schools to stimulate the high school students' interest in the integration of the physical sciences with the biological sciences.</AbstractNarration>
