<AbstractNarration>Winberry/0944794&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a three-year study of the ongoing deceleration and stick-slip motion of Whillans Ice Stream (WIS), West Antarctica. Understanding the dynamic behavior of ice streams is essential for predicting the future of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS). Despite being one of the best-studied ice streams in Antarctica, the surprising flow characteristics of WIS continue to demand interdisciplinary research. Recent estimates indicate that the WIS may stagnate within 50 years, resulting in a significant change to the mass balance of the Siple Coast sector of West Antarctica. The reasons for the ongoing stagnation are not well known, and are possibly linked (causally or coincidentally) to the stick-slip behavior. Our recent work on WIS stick-slip motion suggest that all slip events nucleate from a common location on the ice stream, suggesting that a relatively small (approximately 10 km in diameter) region of the exerts fundamental control over the flow of this large ice stream (100s of km long and 100 kilometers wide).  We hypothesize that this is a region of increased bed strength and our measurements will address that hypothesis.  We will deploy a series of GPS receivers and seismometers on the ice stream to accurately locate the nucleation region so that a comprehensive ground based geophysical survey can be conducted to determine the physical properties of bed at the nucleation point. The ground geophysical program will consist of reflection seismic and ice-penetrating radar studies that will better constrain the properties of both the hypothesized higher-friction nucleation zone and the surrounding regions. Slip events also generate seismic energy that can be recorded 100s of km away from the ice stream, thus, the GPS and seismometer deployment will also aid us in relating seismic waveforms directly with the rapid motion that occurs during slip events. The increased ability to relate rupture processes with seismic emissions will allow us to use archived seismic records to explore changes in the behavior of WIS during the later half of the 20th century. Broader impacts of this study include improved knowledge ice sheet dynamics, which remain a poorly constrained component of the climate system, thus, limiting our ability to predict the Earth's response to climate change. The scientific work includes the education of two graduate students and continued training of one post-doctoral scholar, thus helping to train the next generation of polar scientists. We will expose the broader public to polar science through interactions with the media and by take advantaging of programs to include K-12 educators in our field work.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ For this project, we installed a network of seismographs and GPS receivers on the Whillans Ice Stream (WIS) in West Antarctica during the 2010-11 and 11-12 Austral field seasons.   The WIS is unique among large ice streams in that much of its motion occurs by sudden stick-slip events that are somewhat like large earthquakes, but occur over a period of 20-30 minutes.   Our results showed that the Whillans stick-slip events originate from one of two "sticky spots" on the southwestern part of the WIS.  They propagate across the WIS until they encounter two other sticky spots along the northern grounding line.   When the rupture front nears these high basal stress regions, the energy and rupture propagation velocity greatly increases.     This behaviour is similar to that observed for slip during large earthquakes and suggests large variations in physical conditions along the slip surface at the base of the WIS.  We also observe a continuing increase in the frequency at which expected WIS slip events fail to occur.  These "skips" have become increasingly prevalent from the time WIS slip events were first observed systematically in 2003 until the 2011-12 field season, corresponding with an overall decrease in WIS velocity.  All of these observations are consistent with a model in which the WIS is showing unusual stick-slip events and a reduction in velocity as a result of increasing basal friction, perhaps due to reductions in the amount of water avialable in its hydrologic system.
