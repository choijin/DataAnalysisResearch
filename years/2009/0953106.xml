<AbstractNarration>For many species, including our own, social bonding is essential for numerous aspects of biological and psychological function.  Therefore, it is critical to understand the neuroscience underlying social bonding.  This project will examine the neurobiology of social bonding by utilizing behavioral, neuroanatomical, and neurochemical assessments of pair bonding in the socially monogamous prairie vole.  The experiments will determine how the endogenous opioid systems interact with dopamine signaling in brain circuitry important for reward and motivation underlying pair bond formation and maintenance.  Additionally, the project will capitalize on state-of-the-art neurochemical measurement technology (fast-scan cyclic voltammetry) in the prairie vole model to further assess the role of opioid-dopamine interactions in pair bonding.  On both intellectual and technical levels, results from these studies are expected to have a tremendous impact on several biological fields.  This work focuses on the neuroscience of social bonding, is poised to enhance our understanding of reproduction, ethologically relevant learning and memory, as well as the evolutionary origins of neural mechanisms that mediate social bonding.  Importantly, the robust teaching plans will translate into the classroom (at both the graduate and undergraduate levels) and impact how this information will subsequently reach the public domain. Finally, this project provides outstanding training opportunities for both graduate and undergraduate students, revealing details on how students will be trained in the laboratory and placing an emphasis on promoting diversity in neuroscience by the recruitment and training of women and underrepresented minorities into this laboratory.</AbstractNarration>

Throughout the project undergraduates have been involved in helping with the research and their participation has been noted in annual reports, enhancing the broader impact of this research project.  Pair-bonded prairie voles become aggressive towards other prairie voles that are not their mate (we call this ?selective aggression?). First, we showed that a specific class of opiate receptors, the kappa-opioid receptors - but not the mu-opioid receptors, are involved in this pair-bonded aggression of prairie voles towards non-mates. We were also able to show that this effect is not all over the brain, but in specific brain regions of the reward circuit, the nucleus accumbens shell, in both males and females.

The changes in dopamine release associated with pair-bonding protect the male prairie vole from the reinforcing effects of drug reward.  Finally, the PI and graduate students have participated in outreach activities throughout the project, including Brains Rule! and MYELIN an outreach program to local middle school students in an after school program, initiated by Natalie Neverez and now enthusiastically maintained by Biopsychology and Neuroscience graduate students at the University of Michigan.
