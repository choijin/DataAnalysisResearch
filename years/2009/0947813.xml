<AbstractNarration>Abstract (NSF 0947813): &lt;br/&gt;The Boat-of-Knowledge in the Science Classroom (BooKS in Classroom)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The BooKS in Classroom aims to enhance and broaden science and engineering education of graduate fellows at Ohio University and improve their communication skills. Each year, nine graduate fellows will work with nine school teachers to conduct on-boat samplings and experiments related to their research along the Ohio River from Marietta to Gallipolis. These activities will be remotely transmitted to school classrooms through inquiry-designed activities to an online virtual Boat-of-Knowledge to build a sustainable curriculum. The project will enhance understanding of graduate fellows in their research and improve communication and presentation skills using hands-on activities from the river boat to classrooms. It will provide professional development for teachers to enrich learning environments of high school students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Activities of the BooKS in Classroom will enable the graduate fellows and school teachers to engage in real-world interactions and develop sustaining enthusiasm. The participating high school students will experience increased interest and effectiveness of science learning by hands-on sampling on the river boat and activities of the virtual Boat-of-Knowledge. The project will result in significant impacts on the science education of high school teachers and students in the economically and educationally depressed region of the Ohio River by bringing their most familiar environment, a neighboring river, to their classrooms. It will strengthen the graduate program at Ohio University to sustain partnerships with local school districts for STEM programs. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

The project was aimed to enhance communication skills of graduate fellows and provide high school teachers and students with enriched STEM learning resources through activities ranging from on-boat water sampling along the Ohio River to inquiry-based lesson plan development. We had also developed a virtual boat with computer games to simulate the physical boat for classroom uses with lesson plans developed. The project had conducted on-boat water sampling trips and field trips for high school students and teachers. Attachments 1shows the physical and virtual boats used for the project. Attachment 2 provides examples for on-boat water sampling and testing and Attachment 3 gives examples for field trips. The BooKS project had supported 35 graduate fellows (18 PhD and 17 MS) working with 14 local high school teachers and interacting directly and indirectly with over 5,000 high school students. The extension of the project provided us with the opportunity to enhance the lesson plans developed by the participating graduate fellows to produce127 lesson plan videos resulting in a set of three DVDs.
