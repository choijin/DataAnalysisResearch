<AbstractNarration>IIP 0934313&lt;br/&gt;Georgia Institute of Technology&lt;br/&gt;Schwan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a proposal to renew support for the Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Experimental Research in Computer Systems (CERCS).  The multi-university center is headquartered at the Georgia Institute of Technology, with an affiliate group at the Ohio State University.  CERCS was established in 2001. The focus of the CERCS faculty at Georgia Institute of Technology is on the core systems of technologies underlying large scale computing systems-technology creation.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CERCS will continue to entertain a large number and variety of projects, driven by faculty interests, industry connection and center capabilities.  Three key domains of interest to CERCS are Enterprise Systems, Scientific Computing, and Embedded Systems; and, underlying and uniting these domains are four significant research thrusts. CERCS is committed to fostering interdisciplinary research, establishing a culture of experimental research reaching out to local and national industry, and to encourage participation and contribute to the regional and national economies through the availability of talent and emerging technologies.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of CERCS is on the application of the research results on the IT producer and consumer companies.  CERCS plans to stimulate and ensure practical research with broad practical impact by collaborating with industry partners.  Work in energy management, multicore software stack, and applications to scientific computing, enterprise computing, and mobile computing will all benefit society by reducing costs of computing and allowing society to efficiently address larger computing problems than currently possible.  CERCS also plans to create broad student community for research and education activities and to educate qualified students to join the software/computing industry.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

CERCS brings together researchers from Georgia Tech's College of Computing and School of Electrical and Computer Engineering and the CETI Center at The Ohio State University who share a common focus on the design and evaluation of computer and software systems through experimental methods.  CERCS research focuses on complex systems, including their hardware, communications and system-level software, and applications.  By emphasizing the experimental method, we promote the creation of knowledge through the design, implementation, and measurement of potentially large-scale prototype systems.    Constituting one of the largest experimental systems programs in the U.S., CERCS has a mission to:  lead the innovation of new information and computing technologies,  construct the interactive information grids of the future, and  create the intellectual capital that can advance these technologies and fuel future advances.   CERCS primary mission is to lead the innovation of new information and computing technologies, to construct the interactive information systems of the future, and to create the intellectual capital that can advance these technologies and fuel future developments. To achieve this mission CERCS has three strategic thrusts:  Scientific/Technical Computing &ndash; Focus on "Big Data", Scalable, Reliable Access. Embedded Systems/Computer Architecture &ndash; Focus on Multicore. Enterprise Computing &ndash; Focus on Clean Information: Adaptive, Trusted, Sustainable.   ItÆs two extended missions have been Educational and Outreach. Its educational mission is to:  Seed new curricula at GaTech and serve as a curricular resource for educationalinstitutions worldwide. Provide business models for curricular and professional education delivery. Train and graduate students through the administration of an extensive internship program.   Its outreach mission is to:  Work with alumni to create new opportunities and build networks. Provide service to the broader community.   As an IUCRC, CERCS has had dozens of industry members, including:  AMD ATT Boeing CISCO Dell Delta Technologies, a wholly owned subsidiary of Delta Air Lines DoCoMo Fujitsu Hewlett Packard IBM ICE Intel LogicBlox Microsoft Motorola NVIDIA Nationwide Insurance Netronome Nokia OSISoft Ohio Supercomputer Center Qualcomm Raytheon Rosetta Strategic Thinking Industries Tata Consultancy Services Travelport VMWare WiPro WorldSpan Yahoo   Each year, CERCS has placed many of its students in summer internships in those and other industry partners, furthering it's outreach to the broader community, strengthening those students' education, and providing an mutual exchange of technology and information between academia and industry.  The research projects pursued by CERCS researchers have been broad and varied.  As an illustrative example, we offer a sample project in the area of `Green Computing'.  CoolIT  In the U.S., datacenter facilities consume approximately 2% of all electricity, with an estimated growth rate of 12% per year.  The majority of this datacenter power is either consumed by the computers themselves or by the HVAC units required to keep the computers from overheating.  The use of virtual machines has allowed data center managers to conserve power by consolidating data processing onto fewer servers in times low demand.  However, that consolidation had not previously been performed while taking into account its impact upon the cooling demands of the data center.  The Georgia Tech CERCS project 'CoolIT', developed in collaboration with the Mechanical Engineering department, allows the synergistic and cooperative management of IT and cooling system resources, adjusting air velocity and the location of active computing simultaneously to minimize power consumption.
