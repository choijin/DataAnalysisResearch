<AbstractNarration>As lead institution of the Oklahoma State Alliance, Oklahoma State University (OSU) requests a five-year continuation of its Oklahoma Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (OK-LSAMP) program for a fourth and final period (FY09 ? 13). Alliance members are OSU, the University of Oklahoma (OU), the University of Tulsa (TU); Langston University (LU), an Historically Black College or University (HBCU); and seven regional universities: East Central University (ECU), Northeastern State University (NSU), University of Central Oklahoma (UCO), Northwestern Oklahoma State University (NWOSU), Southeastern Oklahoma State University (SOSU), Southwestern Oklahoma State University (SWOSU), Cameron University (CU). Most programs are coordinated through multicultural/diversity offices on each campus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal accords with NSF?s goal to increase the number of students completing degree programs in STEM fields from historically underrepresented groups. In Oklahoma, this population consists primarily of African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Native Americans. OSU has the largest Native American enrollment in the United States. The Principal Investigator has more than 30 years experience leading multicultural/diversity programs. OK-LSAMP has developed a variety of innovative academic strategies over 14 years, resulting in a dramatic increase in minority STEM undergraduate enrollment and success, and transition to graduate study. Both OSU and OU have Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) programs in place. The Alliance has a committed mentoring cadre of counselors, faculty, staff and alumni. The OK- LSAMP?s main goal for this phase is to recruit and graduate at least 25% more underrepresented minority undergraduates and graduate students compared to 2007-08 numbers.&lt;br/&gt;Program activities will be to recruit increasing numbers of students into STEM fields using enhanced recruitment strategies; support students academically and professionally, relying on strong mentoring networks and links to research opportunities such as EPSCoR and Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REUs); prepare students for global success, including Study Abroad, domestic international activities, and Fulbright Exchanges; and to strengthen an infrastructure that supports student success and professional development. An Advisory Board of minority STEM faculty and staff provides culturally sensitive advice to program leaders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed activities will result in increased numbers of a wide range of minority groups in the STEM workforce of the United States. The Alliance provides an important national model for promoting the success of Native Americans ? one of the least represented groups in STEM careers. Results of this research will be disseminated widely to inform understanding of how to encourage and support minority STEM education. Building on well-established relationships with local, state, and Indian Nation authorities, OK-LSAMP can expand its impact into diverse communities. By drawing on Oklahoma?s half century of international outreach experience, students will have tremendous opportunities for global engagement ? an essential asset for career and research success. This program will exert a transformative impact by diversifying and internationalizing the scientific work force of the United States, particularly with respect to Native Americans and other underrepresented groups, and by ensuring that all aspects of America?s cultural and ethnic heritage contribute to future leadership in STEM nationwide</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The OK-LSAMP program completed Phase IV with 20 years of successful LSAMP activities.  The Oklahoma Alliance consists of 11 institutions of higher education:  Oklahoma State University (lead institution), University of Oklahoma, University of Tulsa, Cameron University, East Central University, Langston University (HBCU), Northeastern State University, Northwestern Oklahoma State University, Southeastern Oklahoma State University, Southwestern Oklahoma State University, and the University of Central Oklahoma.  Dr. Jason F. Kirksey, Vice President for Institutional Diversity, Oklahoma State University, served as the Principal Investigator for the program.   In Phase IV, the Oklahoma Alliance institutions awarded a total of 3,523 Bachelor of Science degrees to minority STEM majors.  Additionally, the Alliance supported over 1,100 scholars with more than 50 percent advancing to graduate degree programs.  Many Scholars matriculated into graduate programs, Bridge to the Doctorate, and Graduate Fellowship programs at institutions across the United States.   Participants from the Oklahoma Alliance institutions took an active part in activities that enhanced and assessed their academic performance, aroused accountability consciousness, and provided other experiences that lead to graduate school and workforce preparation.  Phase IV Scholars:  Participated in international experiences in over 37 different locations outside of the continental United States.  Participated in Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) and International Research Experiences for Undergraduates (iREU) programs Participated in academic year  research experiences Participated in summer internships  Engaged in over 850 conference and symposium presentations Received national scholarships, i.e., Goldwater, Udall, Graduate Research Fellowship, Bridge to the Doctorate, etc.  Research project outcomes accepted for publication in peer-reviewed journals, with scholars being lead authors  Maintained an average GPA of over 3.0 Completed degree requirements on average in 4.9 years, which is well below the typical six-year completion rates.    Six Alliance institutions continue to rank in the top 15 for degrees awarded to Native Americans with Northeastern State University and Oklahoma State University consistently in the top two positions.  For the third consecutive year Oklahoma State University received the Higher Education Excellence in Diversity Award (HEED), acknowledging the dedication to diversity and commitment to excellence.  The HEED award is presented by Insight Into Diversity magazine.  Program goals of recruitment and graduating at least a 25% increase in underrepresented minority undergraduates over the span of the project, as compared to Phase III, was exceeded.  Minority enrollment in Alliance institutions increased 61% in Phase IV.        Last Modified: 02/04/2015       Submitted by: Jason F Kirksey]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
