<AbstractNarration>The objective of this collaborative research project is to study the mechanism of deformation of active molybdenum disulphide lubricant nanoparticles, integrated with organic molecules. The plastic deformation, and thus formation of a tribofilm, will be studied particularly when introduced in minimum quantity lubrication grinding and deep hole drilling. The technical approach to seek the objective necessitates first to study physical, chemical and tribological properties of active lubricant nanoparticles compatible with base fluids used in machining. In the next phase of this study the role of concentration and quantity of nanolubricant formulations, depth of cut, speed and number of machining passes will be investigated. The outcome will be assessed experimentally and partly theoretically using various in situ and ex situ parameters such as cutting forces, tool wear, surface finish and integrity of the workpiece, nano and micro structure, location, distribution and chemistry of the triobofilm, and size and chemistry of debris for studying the role of tribofilm in reducing cutting forces, increasing tool life and providing better surface quality of the machined workpiece. Additionally, one study will address understanding the transient evaporation of oil molecules integrated in nanoparticles and their subsequent role as an effective vehicle for heat transfer at the machining interface.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broad impact of this research is in facilitating the replacement of recirculating lubrication systems, which are sources of performance variation and significant waste streams. In addition, it is expected there will be energy savings and an increase in productivity at low cost in the most demanding machining applications. Further, this research is an example of how recent investment in nanomanufacturing in the United States can significantly benefit traditional machining and manufacturing industries to increase productivity in a range of infrastructure-related manufacturing industries. Training students in this nanotechnology will be an important component in the facilitation of a new generation of innovation.</AbstractNarration>
