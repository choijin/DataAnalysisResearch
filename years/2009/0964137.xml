<AbstractNarration>Membrane proteins are one of the most important classes of molecules, representing over half of drug targets, and also one of the most poorly understood classes. This award is to leverage new technologies in nanofabrication, nano-optics, microfluidics and protein engineering to develop a nanopore membrane biosensor, which has the potential to transform membrane protein research. This real-time imaging instrument will exploit periodic nanopores patterned in a thin gold film to measure the binding kinetics and affinities between membrane-bound receptors and ligands - a task that is highly desirable but is rarely achieved with existing affinity biosensors such as BIAcoreTM. A thin gold film perforated with periodic nanopores will concurrently act as a mechanical scaffold to support cell membranes as well as a label-free surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensor. Binding of ligands to immobilized membrane receptors will sharply modulate the light transmission through metallic nanopores, which is recorded as a real-time "movie" with high resolution. The system will be integrated with microfluidics to reduce sample consumption and enable multiplexing. While this instrument will be applicable to analyze potentially any membrane protein in a near-native lipid bilayer environment, initial studies will be performed with the key recognition events controlling cellular immunity. The ability to perform ligand screening for membrane receptors at high throughput and high resolution would present a breakthrough in studying these molecules and the fundamental life processes they enable.&lt;br/&gt;The integration of supported and free-standing lipid membranes with nanopore SPR sensors will provide an entirely novel approach for dynamic probing of membrane protein interactions, rather than adding incremental improvements to existing SPR instruments. To encourage adoption of the technology by biological groups, a two-day short course at the University of Minnesota (http://www.nano.umn.edu/biomems09/) will be expanded to include nanopore array fabrication, while the software and fabrication protocols will be freely available on the research website. To excite underrepresented groups about STEM research, SPR and protein-protein binding experiments will be incorporated into a training plan spanning middle-school through graduate students, placing special emphasis on undergraduates. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project is to develop a new biological instrument based on gold nanopores for rapid, high throughput optical sensing of protein-protein interactions, with a special emphasis on membrane proteins.     Intellectual merit: Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensors utilizing gold films have been the standard tool for studying protein-ligand interactions to measure their affinity and binding kinetics. Commercially available SPR sensors, however, suffer from several drawbacks, because it is difficult to combine conventional SPR sensors with lipid bilayer membranes and membrane proteins incorporated therein. Membrane proteins play key roles in a variety of biological processes, yet it remains challenging to screen ligands for therapeutic applications for quantitative binding and selectivity.     This project aimed to measure binding kinetics between membrane proteins such as the adenosine A2a G protein coupled receptors, T cell receptors and their ligands using these novel SPR sensors based on nanoporous gold films. To address this technological challenge, the PI's team worked with collaborators at the University of Minnesota who simultaneously developed a high-throughput nanofabrication technique to produce uniform and high-quality gold nanopore films with low cost. We used these instruments in proof-of-concept experiments that demonstrated the use of nanopores for real-time SPR biosensing between antibody-ligand pairs and a variety of ligand-membrane protein pairs. All of these goals have been accomplished, and the details documented in more than 6 journal articles published.     Broader Impact:     To facilitate the dissemination of the knowledge and techniques developed herein, the PI has presented at numerous relevant biological meetings, including the 4th Annual NIH Road Map meeting on "Membrane Protein Technologies" in San Francisco in November 2012.     This project has had a clear impact on human resources development in terms of the students directly involved: two PhD students graduated in 2014 and 2015 and two undergraduate students involved in the project are now both graduate students and NSF GRFP recipients at CalTech and Stanford University, respectively.     Additionally, the PI and PIÆs team members also annually conducted demonstration projects at the annual Manor Middle School Science Night and the Society for Women Engineers summer camp for 7th-8th grade students.
