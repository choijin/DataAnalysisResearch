<AbstractNarration>A Logical Framework for Self-Optimizing Networked Cyber-Physical Systems&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to develop foundations for the newly emerging&lt;br/&gt;generation of networked cyber-physical systems. The approach is based on a&lt;br/&gt;distributed logic of cyber-physical systems together with distributed&lt;br/&gt;cross-layer control and optimization strategies to enabled local actions to&lt;br/&gt;maintain or improve the satisfaction of system goals. The framework will be&lt;br/&gt;implemented first in simulation, then on one of SRI's robot platforms, and&lt;br/&gt;demonstrated in the context of networked mobile robotic teams, a particularly&lt;br/&gt;challenging application.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Networked cyber-physical systems present many intellectual challenges&lt;br/&gt;not suitably addressed by existing computing paradigms. They must&lt;br/&gt;achieve system-wide objectives through local, asynchronous actions,&lt;br/&gt;using distributed control loops through the environment. A key&lt;br/&gt;challenge is to develop a robust computational foundation that&lt;br/&gt;supports a wide spectrum of system operation between autonomy and&lt;br/&gt;cooperation to adapt to uncertainties, changes, failures, and resource &lt;br/&gt;constraints, in particular to limitations of computational, energy, &lt;br/&gt;and networking resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results will have a variety of applications including distributed&lt;br/&gt;surveillance, instrumented pervasive spaces, crisis response, medical&lt;br/&gt;systems, green buildings, self-assembling structures, networked&lt;br/&gt;space/satellite missions, and distributed critical infrastructure&lt;br/&gt;monitoring and control. There is also potential for integration&lt;br/&gt;into SRI's commercial robotic platform. Results will be publicly&lt;br/&gt;available from a project web site, and tutorial material will be&lt;br/&gt;developed for students and researchers. A multi-disciplinary research&lt;br/&gt;seminar will be sponsored by SRI. The coPI is female with a strong&lt;br/&gt;record of mentoring female students and young researchers, including&lt;br/&gt;the project's female postdoc.</AbstractNarration>
