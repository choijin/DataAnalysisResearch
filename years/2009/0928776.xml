<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this award is to establish a theoretical framework for stochastic, complex systems&lt;br/&gt;such that given a specification, we can analyze the system to determine the probability that the specification&lt;br/&gt;will be achieved and automatically find an input law to maximize this probability. The research approach&lt;br/&gt;progresses from the adaptation of existing probabilistic specification languages into a form suitable for a&lt;br/&gt;general class of hybrid systems, to the creation of tools for the automatic synthesis of control strategies to&lt;br/&gt;satisfy a given probabilistic specification, and finally to an implementation of those tools for the automatic&lt;br/&gt;deployment of mobile robots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In formal analysis, finite models of computer programs or digital circuits are checked against temporal&lt;br/&gt;logic properties such as safety (i.e., something bad never happens), liveness (i.e., something good eventually&lt;br/&gt;happens), or richer specifications. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the dual problem of&lt;br/&gt;formal synthesis, where the focus is to construct a control for a continuous system that is safe and correct&lt;br/&gt;by design. These efforts have centered on non-stochastic systems. Real-world systems, however, invariably&lt;br/&gt;evolve under stochastic inputs and all sensors are subject to noise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research will result in general-use computational tools for the analysis and&lt;br/&gt;control of stochastic systems with continuous dynamics. Applications of such techniques are wide-spread,&lt;br/&gt;ranging from engineered systems such as power grids, autonomous robots for personal and military use, and&lt;br/&gt;biomedical devices, to natural systems such as genetic networks up to entire eco-systems. The research is&lt;br/&gt;closely coupled to an educational and outreach plan, including curriculum development at the undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;level, involvement of both undergraduate and high school students in the research, and participation of the&lt;br/&gt;PIs in outreach events such as the Upward Bound program at Boston University.</AbstractNarration>
