<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Cooper, Susan M.&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: DMS - 0940459  &lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Nebraska-Lincoln &lt;br/&gt;Title: KUMUNU 2009&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT: The 2009 KUMUNU conference will be held at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, September 19-20. KUMUNU is an annual weekend conference anchored by the Universities of Kansas (KU), Missouri-Columbia (MU) and Nebraska-Lincoln (NU), promoting interaction among researchers, post docs and graduate students in commutative algebra and related disciplines (such as algebraic geometry, K-theory and coding theory) at regional schools (which in 2008 included 16 different institutions). Although the KUMUNU triad has significant strength in these areas, geographic separation raises a hurdle to taking the most advantage of this strength. Fortunately, the distances are small enough to allow scheduling in such a way that regional participants can inexpensively gather at a central location for a weekend conference. The KUMUNU conference series thus provides a cost-effective annual venue for regional researchers at various stages of their careers, including graduate students, recent Ph.D.s and faculty at nonPh.D. granting institutions, to interact with each other and with experienced researchers based at KU, MU, NU and a limited number of invited experts from outside the region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Travel and lodging support to facilitate participation, especially for graduate students, is a key element for KUMUNU to achieve its main goals. These include: playing a strong regional mentoring role at all levels by showcasing the research of post docs and young faculty and by helping recent Ph.D.s and graduate students in commutative algebra and related disciplines enrich their research programs by meeting senior researchers based at KU, MU, NU and elsewhere; and promoting research in commutative algebra by providing a venue for discussion of the latest developments in the field, for exchanging ideas and for setting the basis for future research collaborations. The conference design also furthers these goals:  KUMUNU comprises a limited number of talks, which are encouraged to be accessible to graduate students, by speakers representing a geographically diverse mix of senior researchers, young faculty and post docs, with plenty of time reserved outside of talks for additional interaction. The relatively small size of the meeting and its geographic and disciplinary focus also encourage participants to establish productive collaborative relationships. In addition to the stimulation and enrichment of the research careers of the students and early career participants, participants from nonPh.D. granting institutions will take ideas from the conference back to their colleagues and students, stimulating further research and mathematical enrichment at their home institutions.</AbstractNarration>
