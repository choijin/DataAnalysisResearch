<AbstractNarration>The objective of this proposal is the development and implementation of a systems-theory framework for modeling, analyzing, and designing microprobe-based systems that will enable high-speed and reliable imaging of surface topographies, matter properties, and probe-and-matter interaction forces with nanoscale precision.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this proposal leverages a systems-theoretic approach for analysis and design which uses real-time model-based techniques to address critical challenges associated with microprobe based nanoscale investigation.  One of the primary challenges encountered is the control of the main probe; a microcantilever. Currently, most approaches do not exploit models of the probe to achieve its control. Also, models of probe-sample interaction in the dynamic mode operation have not been employed. In this proposal, relevant models for real-time control of the main probe will be developed and subsequently employed for engendering high bandwidth and high resolution. The approach, , will provide significant advances in imaging capabilities, by up to two-orders faster imaging than existing modes.  An important need for probe based nanoscale investigation is that of increasing the range of the positioning devices, to the millimeter scale without sacrificing high resolution (nanometer scale). In the proposal, modern control paradigm is proposed for long-range high resolution positioning which will enable critical nanoscale-investigation studies, especially in biology. Model-based techniques are proposed that will resolve a  significant challenge of matter-property and lateral-forces characterization in real time as the matter is scanned for surface imaging. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts will include transformative technologies that will enable high precision, high bandwidth and large range nano investigation capabilities. Thus, proposed research will  translate into   technological and economic gains. This work is at the confluence of dynamic systems and control theory, control applications, and instrumentation technology.  The graduate students involved will be trained in a unique interdisciplinary manner that exposes them to the diverse research areas and interaction with industry. Besides its direct impact on graduate education, this program will provide workshops for advanced graduate students and research engineers, research experience for undergraduates, internet-based access to SPM-devices for high-school teachers and students. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
