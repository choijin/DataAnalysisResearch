<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Michael T. Ashby of the University of Oklahoma will study the reaction mechanisms of sulfur species of fundamental chemical interest that are implicated in biological antimicrobial processes.  The understanding of sulfur species reactivity under physiological conditions is very limited, even though they are implicated in cellular damage processes.   The information gained from these studies will find application in biological/medical fields, and such studies will also enhance fundamental knowledge of sulfur chemistry.   The PI will be involved in graduate student and postdoctoral training and has a track record of broadening the participation of underrepresented groups in chemistry.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The project has focused on understanding the chemical mechanisms that involve biological reactive intermediates, mostly oxidative human defense factors, with sulfur-containing compounds. &nbsp;These sulfur compounds have included the amino acids cysteine and methionine as well as inorganic sulfur-containing compounds such as thiocyanate.
