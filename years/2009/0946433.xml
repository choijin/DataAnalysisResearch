<AbstractNarration>The University of South Florida is hosting a conference on Research on the Enacted K-12 Mathematics Curriculum.  The purpose of the conference is to explicate the theory on mathematics curriculum enactment, defining key constructs and explaining how they are expected to interact, and why, in order to facilitate the systematic accumulation of knowledge about mathematics curriculum enactment that can guide policy and practice.  The conference agenda builds on work of the Center for the Study of Mathematics Curriculum (CSMC) and work by NCTM to develop a research agenda for mathematics education. The conference proceedings will include the conceptual model developed during the conference, the priority research questions that were identified, and the instrument development agenda for addressing those questions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Conference on Research on the Enacted Mathematics Curriculum was held in November, 2010 in Tampa, Florida, at the University of South Florida. Conference organizers brought together 78 researchers and/or curriculum developers interested in issues related to the enacted curriculum, including those with extensive experience researching curriculum and those early in their careers (such as assistant professors and doctoral students). Participants discussed the development of a conceptual model for studying the enacted mathematics curriculum, a set of research questions related to the enacted curriculum, and an investigation of instruments needed to conduct such research. The development of a conceptual model helps provide coherence to the field; involving a range of participants at different stages of their careers helps to build capacity for future work in this area.     A book, Enacted Mathematics Curriculum: A Conceptual Model and Research Needs, coedited by Denisse R. Thompson and Zalman Usiskin served as a venue for collating and disseminating the work of the conference. The chapters in the book extend beyond simply a set of conference proceedings and raise additional issues that expand the work of the conference.     With the current climate related to educational reform, the general public is interested in the effectiveness of curriculum, particularly in mathematics. Understanding the effectiveness of curriculum requires being able to assess the nature of how curricululm is enacted or implemented in classrooms. The work of the conference, and the collection of that work in the published book, provide insights into measuring such enactment.
