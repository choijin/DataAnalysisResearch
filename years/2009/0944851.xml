<AbstractNarration>This project will investigate the contributions of viruses to the mortality of phytoplankton and bacterioplankton in the Western Antarctic Peninsula. Viral lysis has fundamentally different consequences for how carbon is transferred through the marine food web, but the importance of viral mortality is unknown.  The principal investigators will measure viral mortality on samples at different stages of the spring/summer bloom in the vicinity of Palmer Station, Antarctica. Since all of the available methods have their limitations, a suite of approaches will be employed. The project also will examine whether sea ice acts as a seed bank for viruses that contribute to phytoplankton mortality during the bloom. Fieldwork will be conducted primarily in the vicinity of Palmer Station to allow time series measurements during the course of the bloom. Broader impacts include teacher training workshops, summer research projects, and collaboration with Palmer LTER outreach activities.  The project also will contribute to the training of a postdoctoral fellow,  graduate students, and one or more undergraduate students each year.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Phytoplankton are the base of the Antarctic food web. The rapid growth of these tiny photosynthetic marine organisms during the Antarctic summer provides food that supports organisms living on the sea floor (e.g., sea stars, worms, and sponges), in the water (e.g., krill, penguins, fish, seals, whales), and even those that fly through the frigid polar air (e.g., skuas, petrels, and albatross). The massive increase in the number of phytoplankton in early summer is often followed by a sudden decline. We believe most of the phytoplankton disappear, because they are eaten and passed up the food chain. It is also possible, but unproven, that many Antarctic phytoplankton die as a result of viral infections before they can be eaten, which would mean less food available to support the Antarctic animals. There have been very few studies of viruses in the waters of Antarctica, especially of viruses that infect phytoplankton. Our goal was to determine whether viral infections are important for phytoplankton in these polar waters. In this project, we improved some techniques to study marine viruses, then applied the techniques to the waters of Antarctica. we discovered that, not only are viruses abundant, but certain types of viruses (those with genomes made out of RNA, rather than DNA) are very common. It appears that many of these infect diatoms, one of the most important types of phytoplankton in Antarctic waters. We also found genetic traces of viruses unlike any that have been isolated before. Our research has shown that viruses do have an important role in the Antarctic food web and provides information about the most common types of viruses. This information will be useful for future studies to determine what proportion of phytoplankton die as a result of infection and how this affects the rest of the food web. Our data will also help guide the isolation and characterization of new types of viruses. This could have some practical benefits. Viruses and their enzymes are useful tools for bioengineering and our sequence data could be searched to discover new cold-adapted enzymes that could be useful in biotechnology, allowing, for example, reactions to be carried out efficiently at lower temperatures than is possible at present.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 01/17/2014<br>      Modified by: Grieg&nbsp;F&nbsp;Steward</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
