<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Agriculture is inherently risky, perpetually under threat from draughts, hurricanes, floods, pests and crop diseases. In response to farmers' need to manage risk, governments and policy makers throughout the world have for decades attempted to provide public crop insurance or promote its private provision. Almost all such attempts have failed to operate sustainably without government subsidies.&lt;br/&gt;Project: The researchers propose to study the reasons for this failure of crop insurance. They will, in partnership with the Philippine Crop Insurance Corporation, a government entity, implement an experimental crop insurance program offered to rice farmers in rural Philippines. The design will allow them to separately identify the extent of adverse selection (i.e. when demand for insurance is higher among farmers who are more at risk) and moral hazard (i.e. lowered incentives of covered farmers to prevent damages), the main barriers to efficient workings of insurance markets.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: Using recent developments in experimental methodology, the researchers will be able to provide an empirical foundation for seminal theoretical papers on the economics of contracts by empirically decomposing these theoretical mechanisms. In addition, they will go beyond recent experimental contributions by incorporating measures of preferences, such as an individuals' aversion to risk, to further decompose the contract selection decision. This empirical evidence will contribute to the iterative process, from theory to testing and back to theory, that is so essential to the advancement of scientific knowledge.&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: The research has the promise to have broad implications for the design and implementation of public insurance programs. The findings will improve understanding of the workings of insurance markets and may lead to better regulation and more efficient insurance markets. Finally, it will help in the design of crop insurance programs in particular and thereby improve both risk management options for poor rural farmers and the governments' use of public funds for rural development.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Introduction  Farming households in developing countries face enormous risks from natural hazards. The adverse consequences of households bearing this risk are well known and include direct costs to the households welfare as well as depressed investment and access to credit. Unfortunately, insurance markets to manage this risk have failed to develop for most types of natural hazards. Economic theory suggests that information asymmetries -- that is, information that the farmer has that is hidden from the insurance company (e.g., on the risk profile of her land or on the actions taken to prevent harvest losses) and that can lead to higher claims for the insurance company than would be expected on average -- are a likely cause of this market failure, but empirical evidence is scarce.    This market failure motivated a project on crop insurance in the Philippines based on a randomized field experiment coupled with comprehensive data collection. The study was principally designed to understand the relative importance of, and mechanisms behind, the various possible information asymmetries in crop insurance contracts. The goal of the project was to understand to what degree these information asymmetries contribute to the failure of the crop insurance market and how progress can be made in designing new risk management products to shift risks in agricultural production from households to financial markets.      Implementation  The project was implemented in the province of Camarines Sur in Bicol region of the Philippines. A pilot was conducted during the 2010 wet season, followed by three experimental rounds, over the 2010-11 dry season, the 2011 wet season and the 2011-12 dry season. Over 500 farmers with more than 1500 plots participated in the study.     Design  Farmers who were tilling two or more irrigated rice plots (0.25-2.5 hectares) were invited to participate. Once enrolled, each plot was independently verified as being tilled by the enrolled farmer. Each farmer was then asked, if she could choose one plot to be insured (for free), which one she would prefer. Next, farmers were randomly selected to receive free insurance on a random sample of their plots. Each farmers' first-choice plot was allowed a slightly higher chance of receiving free insurance, generating incentives for truth telling in the plot choice decision.  The data generated by the experiments was complemented with administrative data from the insurance provider, geospatial data on the location of plots and environmental characteristics and three survey rounds (1 baseline per farmer, 2 follow-up surveys per season).      Results   Using a model that jointly considers the farmersÆ choice of a plot for insurance and their resource allocation decisions across plots, I illustrate three conceptually different information asymmetries that are relevant in this context: classic adverse selection (in this case, farmers preferring insurance on higher risk plots), classic moral hazard (in this case, farmers using less preventative effort on insured plots), and the interaction of the two -- that is, selection on anticipated moral hazard (in this case, farmers selecting plots on which, if insured, they can save a relatively large amount of preventative effort).  I find that all three are present in this context: 1) The plot that is selected by the farmer as her first-choice for insurance coverage has 20% higher damages than other plots in her portfolio, suggesting the presence of adverse selection; 2) I find evidence of moral hazard in the prevention of pests and crop diseases -- damages from these causes are 24% higher on randomly insured than uninsured plots -- but unsurprisingly, I find no evidence of moral hazard in damages from typhoons and floods; and 3) I find that the majority of selection is based on the inherent riskiness of plots but that farmers also select on plot-specific anticipated moral hazard.  By considering these information asymmetries together I am ab...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
