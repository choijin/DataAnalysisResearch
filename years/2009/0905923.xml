<AbstractNarration>The derived category of coherent sheaves has become a powerful tool in recent years in algebraic geometry. Remarkably this category also appears naturally in the mathematical physics of superstring theory where objects are D-branes, i.e., boundary conditions on open strings, and morphisms are Hilbert spaces associated to open string states. The proposer will investigate several aspects of this connection. The mathematics of tilting collections, quiver representations and matrix factorizations will be applied to notions such as monodromy, stability and moduli spaces to further understand string theory. It is expected that this research will lead to insight into the mathematics of the derived category of Calabi-Yau threefolds which play a central role in this proposal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;String theory aims at providing an understanding of the fundamental physics of our universe, particularly the geometry of spacetime at short distances. The mathematics of string theory requires the use of sophisticated techniques from modern geometry. Indeed, ideas from string theory have inspired many recent important developements in the pure mathematics of geometry. This proposal will explore the connection between D-branes, which in a sense are subspaces of spacetime, and algebraic geometry, in which geometry is expressed purely in terms of algebraic equations. It is expected that new results both in pure mathematics and mathematical physics will be obtained.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Superstring theory proposes to solve deep problems in our understanding of the physics of very short distances by replacing point-like particles with small string-like objects. It turns out that this requires spacetime to have ten dimensions implying that 6 extra dimensions are "compactified" on a shape (a "Calabi-Yau manifold") so small we cannot see it.    String theory implies the further existence of membrane-like and higher dimensional objects called D-branes. The mathematical structure of these D-branes happens to coincide with a construction called the "derived category" which is a powerful tool in analyzing the geometry of a Calabi-Yau manifold, and has been the subject of a great deal of research in pure mathematics in the past several years.    Our research uses insight from the physics of string theory to provide mathematical results about the derived category and so furthers our understanding of higher-dimensional geometry. It also shows how the powerful mathematics of the derived category can be used to compute physical quantities within certain superstring models.    The geometry of string compactifications becomes particularly interesting, both from a physical and mathematical point of view, when the Calabi-Yau space is not smooth. This research developed a method of computing the derived category in a systematic way for a large class of such singularities. It also provided a means of determining, at least partially, which D-branes acquire zero mass in the presence of such singularities. This question of masslessness turns out to be of great interest from a physics point of view as it leads to new models of quantum field theory.    This research also used the mathematical tools developed in the study of the derived category in the arena of "(0,2)-models". These are string theory constructions that can lead to phenomenologically realistic models of fundamental physics. Unfortunately manipulation of such theories has been notoriously difficult because of nontrivial maps of strings into spacetime. These awkward maps, known as worldsheet instantons, also happen to be mathematically very interesting as they probe intricate aspects of the geometry of the Calabi-Yau manifold. Other types of instantons have been used to great effect in the past within topics such as mirror symmetry and Gromov-Witten invariants. Our research probed the effects of these (0,2) worldsheet instantons and is quite distinct from past methods.    A particularly interesting example of such (0,2) instanton effects comes from simply counting the expected number of massless particles in a (0,2)-model from geometric methods and then comparing this result to exact results computed by other methods. Any discrepancy is due to worldsheet instantons in the form of particular spheres living withinthe Calabi-Yau manifold. A convenient set of Calabi-Yau manifolds can be produced by smoothing out a singular space (known as an orbifold) in different ways. We show this result in the accompanying figure. This figure shows a combinatorial method of resolving a particular orbifold (C3/Z11) in 5 ways using toric geometry. The number in the square is the geometric count ignoring instantons. The other numbers and arrows represent the method of computation that was developed in this research. Exact methods, using conformal field theory, show the correct result to be 39 in all 5 cases. Therefore there are instanton corrections in the bottom 3 cases. Further research attempted to account for these discrepancies by direct computation of the instanton effects. Some, but not all of the discrepancies were accounted for. This shows that the subject of (0,2)-instantons is geometrically subtle and it promises to yield nontrivial and new geometric results in the future.
