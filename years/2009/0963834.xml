<AbstractNarration>Wireless ad-hoc networks consist solely of cheap, mobile nodes that operate in the absence of expensive fixed infrastructure such as base stations. In order to save energy, increase data rate, or improve robustness, some nodes may act as helper nodes, relaying some or all of the information.  In the simplest form of relaying, data packets are forwarded node-by-node in a manner akin to a fire bucket brigade. In more advanced methods, such as those considered in this research, several nodes can cooperate to forward information. The key design questions are two-fold.  First is the design of cooperative communication techniques, i.e., physical-layer approaches for relaying information from one set of nodes to the next.  Second is routing, i.e., identifying which of the available nodes should participate in the transmission and what system resources (time, energy, bandwidth) should be allocated to each. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research analyzes interconnections between these two key questions, treated separately in most prior work.  We consider the routing problem when rateless codes are employed at the physical layer.  Such codes allow receiving nodes to accumulate mutual information (instead of just energy) from multiple transmitting nodes.  This yields greater network robustness and efficiency. The research investigates the effect of interference, which automatically arises when multiple messages are being transmitted simultaneously.  By using stochastic network optimization, optimum resource allocation can be provided without the need for centralized knowledge of all states of nodes and propagation channels. Cooperative transmission techniques based on a hybrid of network-coding and compute-and-forward, their rateless variants, and application to cooperative routing are investigated as well. The concepts are validated through experiments.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     This project targeted fundamental questions of optimum or near-optimum routing in wireless ad-hoc networks with advanced physical layers. The question of routing with advanced physical layers is novel, scientifically challenging, and practically important. The challenge arises because solutions require a combination of information theory, optimization theory, and knowledge of systems and wireless propagation.  Over the course of the project we significantly advanced our knowledge in this area.  We developed new methods to deal with streaming data systems, multiple information routes, and applied new tools from stochastic network optimization to characterize the stability region of such networks from a queuing perspective.   One assumption of our early project results was knowledge of network channel state information (CSI).  Inspired by work in the systems community we investigated how to acquire such CSI passively by observing the empirical occurances of collisions and transmission failures.  Inference from passively-collected data greatly reduces the network effort required to estimate such information, in particular in comparison to standard active "probing" techniques.  We applied tools from sparse graph inference to develop the scaling laws that underlie such inference problems. While initially motivated by centrally operated enterprise networks, these technique appear applicable to next-generation cloud radio access networks (CRAN).  In the project we developed results on two further aspect of information flow through networks. The first was in the study of rank-metric codes.  These codes are used for error-correction in non-coherent network coding.  In the project we developed information-theoretic bounds and constructions for these codes and connected them to problems of matrix completion and rank minimization over finite fields.  We also investigated questions of physical layer security in the form of secret key generation.  We developed a prototype for, and information theoretic bound on, the generation of secret keys based on the randomness intrinsic to wireless orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems.  Developments over the course of the project were not constrained to wireless networks.  Part-way through we realized that the methods we were developing for routing could be applied to the placement of jobs and virtual machines in data centers.  This initiated a fruitful sequence of papers with colleagues in computer architecture that investigated the use of queuing-theoretic analysis and optimization perspectives and techniques to manage computing systems efficiently.  In one thrust we developed methods to manage the state of a processor system (the number of active cores, the sleep state processors are put into, and the speed-energy tradeoff effected by dynamic voltage frequency scaling) to minimize energy usage while meeting target quality-of-computing constraints.  In another we determined how jointly to set CPU and memory-bus speeds in future systems containing tens to hundreds of processors.  The collaboration with computer architects also led to a final thrust in the project, which exploits the use of technique of error-correction coding to generate partially-redundant copies of a computation.  The basic idea was that we could spread computation across a cluster of cloud-type compute notes with the dual objectives of robustifying computation and decreasing time-to-completion.  This thrust has involved us with industrial partners and generated a number of interesting and fruitful directions in approximate computing and large-scale optimization for machine learning type applications.  In parallel with the techical results described above, the project also helped fund a number of outcomes in professional development, outreach, and curriculum redesign.  Some impacts were more focused, e.g., the professional development of the two PhD students and two postdocs involved (one of the latter is now a faculty member), though a summer school the PI organized, and through high-school outreach.  Others, such as those in curriculum development, impacted many hundreds of students.  One example of the latter was the expansion of a first-year course on the "Grand Challenges" of engineering.  Through consideration of large scale global problems students were exposed to the different engineering disciplines, and understood how technical solutions must be situated smartly amongst important social, political, legal, and environmental constraints.  Students developed their communication, presentation, and teamwork skills through a pair of group projects. A second example is the redevelopment of the signals-and-systems curriculum.  The goal of the redevelopment was to elucidates underlying connections to linear algebra and optimization, to connect the ideas developed in the course to important technological applications in communication, control, and signal processing and, through labs, to build facility with the mathematical software packages central to follow-on courses. Over 1000 students have completed this redesigned curriculum.           Last Modified: 04/26/2017       Submitted by: Robert D Nowak]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
