<AbstractNarration>Discipline Code: 21&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks to improve the early college-level STEM quantitative curriculum. Connecting the modeling, statistics, computation, and calculus (MSCC) subjects among themselves is important for aligning the quantitative curriculum with other STEM disciplines. The first step is to connect calculus to modeling and statistics. Doing so often involves the use of computer technology.&lt;br/&gt;This project creates a community of educator-scholars who can inform each other about the connections among the MSCC subjects, increase awareness of the advantages of integrating the MSCC subjects among themselves and with other STEM disciplines, improve and expand resources that can be useful in teaching in a variety of institutions, create faculty development opportunities to disseminate successful approaches, and develop materials useful in assessing student mastery of concepts relating to MSCC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;National reports, from a wide range of STEM (and other) disciplines, call for interdisciplinary alignment and the enhancement of the traditional quantitative curriculum to emphasize modeling, statistics, and computation. This Phase II proposal draws on successful demonstrations at individual institutions which achieve this alignment by unifying the MSCC subjects.&lt;br/&gt;One example is the Applied Calculus/Statistical Modeling first-year courses at Macalester College in which students from a range of disciplines gain strong skills and conceptual understanding of multivariate quantitative topics and mastery of important statistical techniques such as analysis of covariance. Modeling is a major theme of both course, and modern computation is integrated into both.&lt;br/&gt;Another example is the bio-calculus program at Appalachian State University designed to integrate mathematics and statistics into the biology curriculum. In this program, calculus is successfully introduced to students by dealing with discrete models motivated by the analysis of scientific data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The topics emphasized in this project are at the heart of a solid quantitative education for STEM students. The project engages faculty in diverse institutional settings, helping to ensure that the materials developed are broadly adoptable. Assessment in the form of a concept inventory is an integral component of the project, which helps demonstrate the effectiveness of the innovations. The emphasis on faculty development opportunities, both webinars and summer workshops, provides a mechanism for uptake of the innovations by faculty from a broad range of institutions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The mathematical sciences play a crucial and growing role in both research and the economy as a whole.  Unfortunately, different aspects of the mathematical sciences --- statistics, calculus, and technical computing --- are presented to students in a disconnected way and often have little overlap with actual practices in the workplace, marketplace, and research lab. As well, there is little emphasis on techniques for modeling: constructing a mathematical representation of the real-world problem that can be manipulated and examined by mathematical tools to find a solution. Project MOSAIC was organized to help instructors teach the mathematical sciences in an integrated way and especially to put modeling and modern computing at the center of the curriculum. The project involved development of curricular materials, tools for teaching, and outreach to the community of instructors involved in teaching college-level mathematical sciences. One of the major themes of Project MOSAIC is to facilitate the use in teaching of professional-level software tools.  Two important aspects of this are the use of a computing language and the capability to use the same tools at increasing levels of sophistication and across multiple fields.  The language is particularly important.  Unlike the seemingly easy-to-use mouse-driven interfaces of many educational software packages, a language provides a means to communicate ideas and algorithms to other research workers and to participate in the community of professionals. Project MOSAIC resulted in modeling- and computation-based textbooks as well as shorter form tutorials and introduction.  These make use of a leading technical computing software environment, R, and particularly an extension to R called the "mosaic package."  The mosaic package was designed to reduce the overhead involved in getting started with R by simplifying the syntax while retaining power and the connection to the full repertoire of the capabilities of R.  Approximately 50,000 students per year are introduced to R through mosaic in statistics and calculus classes.  For many instructors, R has been transformed through mosaic from an intimidating and hard-to-use research tool into a system that they are comfortable using in their teaching.  More broadly, Project MOSAIC has demonstrated to an initially skeptical academy that itÆs feasible to teach the mathematical sciences in a modeling and computationally oriented way.  As a result, professional guidelines provided by national organizations such as the American Statistical Association and the Mathematical Association of America have shifted to an explicit emphasis on modeling and instruction with professional-level tools.
