<AbstractNarration>The research of the Pacific Lattice Group (PLG) involves investigations into the fundamental behavior of matter at subatomic scales via supercomputer simulations and calculations of theoretical physics. There are three complimentary strands to the program, all involving study of strongly-interacting particles. One theme is to understand from basic principles how only a few fundamental building blocks --- the quarks and gluons of Quantum ChromoDynamics (QCD) --- combine in complex ways to generate experimentally observed states such as the proton, neutron, and other more exotic particles found at accelerators. The second strand of the work explores the mechanism of quark confinement, namely the puzzle of why quarks cannot be observed individually in Nature, but are instead always restricted to multiple quark combinations by some not-fully understood aspects of QCD. Finally, the third strand studies the possibility that the new experimental program at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN might discover a whole new family of fundamental particles, whose strong interactions have prevented them from being observed to date, and which combine to form the ``Higgs'' particle, the only remaining particle predicted by the Standard Model which has not been found. All three strands involve intensive large-scale computer simulations, requiring high-end computational resources combined with cutting-edge simulation techniques, developed within the framework of lattice field theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance of this program is to advance the current understanding of the fundamental nature of matter. Specifically, the particle physics community is preparing for major new discoveries in the near future as new experiments such as the LHC start, coupled with very large-scale computing power making possible the exploration of theoretical ideas in new and more detailed ways. This research program sits precisely at this juncture.  These studies are coupled with the development of a modern data-sharing mechanism and a lively outreach program affecting K-12 schools and the community.  This research is also taking place at a predominantly undergraduate institution, and thus provides an active research site involving the training of undergraduates.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is  both the end of a long search--the particle was predicted in the 1960's, part of the "Standard Model" of the fundamental structure of matter, as well--and the beginning of a new era of discovery.  Our work, supercomputer exploration of theories and models of new physics, beyond the Standard  Model, marries present-day computer technology to the  latest theoretical methods, and can already test models of new physics and  make predictions relevant for current experiments.  Holland and  collaborators have focused on two models that involve strong  interactions, similar to the physics of neutrons and protons, as a  possible explanation for the underlying behavior of the Higgs boson.  These models, even if not realized in nature, provide benchmarks of how  accurately strongly interacting theories can make  predictions. One particular model, the sextet theory, has an array of  particles created by more fundamental pieces being glued together by  their strong mutual attraction. This predicts a particular sequence of  new particles, which may have already been observed  in the latest experiments at the LHC. The theoretical and experimental  results will be crucially tested in the next year and beyond. Particle  physics is a central piece of our understanding of nature and the  universe, and research in strongly interacting theories  is one of the next steps in pushing beyond our current knowledge.  Similarly, Hetrick's work has explored exotic models of the Higgs field which involve extra dimensions. Theories of this type have emerged in the string theory approch to a unified field theory (which would unify quantum mechanics and Einstein's theory of gravity).  In both cases, our work has illuminated aspects of these models, answering questions about the models' viability, and raising questions for further research.  In addition, the large scale lattice data archive that we maintain provides an important service to the particle physics community by allowing work of many researchers to be leveraged for significantly more results.
