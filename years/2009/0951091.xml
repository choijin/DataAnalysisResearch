<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;Chromosomes, the packaging units for genetic information, cannot be transmitted from generation to generation unless they interact with microtubule-based spindles.  Normally, the centromere (constricted region of a chromosome) binds to the spindles.  This allows the spindles to pull pairs of chromosomes apart, so that one copy of each chromosome ends up in the new, daughter cell during meiosis.  This project will investigate neocentromeres, which are specialized chromosomal regions that can be used to study how chromosomes interact with spindles.  In maize, neocentromeres can dramatically change genetic inheritance.  One aim of this work will focus on the maize abnormal chromosome 10 that regulates natural neocentromere activity.  Genes that regulate neocentromeres will be identified using a combination of modern sequencing methods.  The second aim will focus on long arrays of binding sites that have been added to different positions on chromosomes arms.  Known microtubule-based motor proteins (known as kinesins) will be tethered to the binding sites, causing the arrays to interact with microtubules. This novel system will make it possible to better understand how neocentromeres alter genetic inheritance.  Both approaches address fundamental questions in genetics and will facilitate the development of new methods for improving crops by transgenic methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;Maize is a classic American crop that naturally appeals to students of all ages.  To broaden the impact of the research, the project includes travel and student training at a small university [Kentucky Wesleyan College (KWC)] that serves a rural farming community.  Activities will include summer training for Professor Evelyn Hiatt and three undergraduates over a three-year period.  Visiting undergraduate students will receive in-lab training and field experience, as well as exposure to a research setting in a major research university.  The tools and methodologies used during the project will serve as a basis to improve coursework and training at KWC.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Meiotic drive is an exception to Mendels rules whereby chromosomes demonstrate the capacity to preferentially segregate to progeny without regard to their impact on organismal fitness.  Such examples are very rare, and the best-known example is associated with an unusual chromosome called Abnormal Chromosome 10 (Ab10) in maize.  Ab10 causes repetitive regions of the genome called knobs to become neocentromeres and move independently on the spindle.  This form of chromosome movement was not undertood prior to this award.  We made exciting new progress by creating the first molecular resources for Ab10, identifying new mutants that affect neocentromere activity, and ultimately identifying a novel family of kinesin genes (Kin618) that are very like to have a direct role in causing both neocentromere activity and meiotic drive. A mutant that lacks neocentromere activity (smd12) is an epimutation of Kin618 that appears to be caused by the DNA methylation of the entire gene family. The smd12 mutant shows no expression of Kin618 and lacks neocentromere activity at major knob repeats.  We also idenfified multiple new isolates of Ab10 and initiated the first diversity analysis of this unusual chromosome.
