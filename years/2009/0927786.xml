<AbstractNarration>The objective in this research is to demonstrate electrochemically fabricated magnetic bit-patterned media using precision fabricated templates to achieve data storage densities above ten terabit per square inch, far surpassing what is available in today?s even most advanced magnetic data storage systems.&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the proposed multifaceted research is to contribute to the understanding of the materials science and engineering of underpotential codeposition of magnetic alloys, the potential of self-limiting ion milling for ultrahigh density square matrix template nanofabrication, and the effects of spatial confinement on face-centered-cubic to face-centered-tetragonal phase transformation kinetics in ultrahigh anisotropy iron-platinum materials system. The availability of ultrahigh magnetic anisotropy nanostructured arrays that will be developed in the course of this project will further facilitate the fundamental studies of the scalability limits of magnetic recording.&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this research is to enable a range of transformative data-storage applications such as probe-based data storage, in which two-dimensional arrays of read/write nanotransducers are used to address the bits on patterned media. Extremely high data storage bit densities to be explored in the course of this project will be sufficient, for example, to serve all the data storage needs of the world?s largest corporation with a single desktop computer! The proposed program will be integrated with existing NSF-REU, RET, and NUE programs as well as State-supported programs, in which the investigators actively participate, to enhance the recruitment of women and underrepresented minorities into the fields of science and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The overarching goal of this project was to demonstrate electrochemical fabrication of high-density magnetic arrays using graphitic templates formed using so-called SLIM process, a self-limiting ion milling fabrication technology developed by our team. We have achieved several significant milestones in the course of the project:  1)    We have expanded the utility of SLIM process by transferring the process from high-vacuum ion milling that is rarely used in commercial microfabrication to a process that works in any typical reactive-ion etching (RIE) system, a significant boost for the prospects of the technology transfer. Similar to the original SLIM process, this new low-energy glow-discharge process enables close-packed non-circular device patterns to be formed from a precursor array of uniform circular openings in polymethyl methacrylate defined by electron beam lithography. This technique is of a particular interest for bit-patterned magnetic recording medium fabrication, where close packed square magnetic bits may improve its recording performance.   2)    We have demonstrated dense magnetic arrays formed by electrochemical deposition of nickel over self-limiting formed molds, which open the route for deposition of high-anisotropy FePt arrays into these molds.  3)    We have demonstrated thermal stability of these molds, which is essential for post-deposition annealing of FePt to achieve high magnetic anisotropy phase.  4)    We have demonstrated the extension of the technology to the fabrication of nanoimprint molds, which further expands the utility and industrial applications.  Graduate and undergraduate students as well as postdocs who participated in the projects received training in advanced nano/micro patterning techniques, thin film synthesis using electrochemical deposition, magnetic characterization, and image analysis. Furthermore, participants had an opportunity to experience an interdisciplinary nature of this work that combined device nanofabrication, electrochemical synthesis, magnetic characterization, image analysis. Since the outcomes of the project include potential industrial applications and the skills the project required from its participants to develop are directly transferrable into industrial setting, the project participants are well prepared to secure jobs with the industry, especially, magnetic data drive industry that has expressed particular interest in evaluating the technology for nanopatterning of magnetic disks.
