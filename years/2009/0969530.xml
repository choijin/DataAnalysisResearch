<AbstractNarration>The main long term goal of this project is to develop theoretical and computational tools that will allow researchers to predict behavior of atomic and molecular systems or explain the results of experiments on atoms and molecules. Because the difficulty in calculating the behavior of these objects grows exponentially with the number of particles, even a small increase in the number of objects can have a huge impact on the effort needed. The main focus of this project is on systems where two or more electrons can simultaneously escape the atom/molecule, or where highly excited atoms are exposed to strong fields. These systems can exhibit highly correlated motion which is difficult to understand without new theoretical or computational techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this project is that it advances the base of knowledge in atomic physics and provides an environment where undergraduates, graduate students and postdoctoral researchers learn the art of scientific research. Young researchers from underrepresented groups are actively encouraged to join this project and they have had good training during previous projects. The results of the research projects are published in peer reviewed journals and presented at divisional meetings, topical workshops, and colloquia, and they can have impact on other scientists.</AbstractNarration>
