<AbstractNarration>This project examines the process of collaborative knowledge production within the Oakland Museum of California as it undertakes the first major redesign of its permanent exhibitions in 40 years. The research will observe the formation of historical narratives and the delineation of "communities" through the lens of the object as museum staff, community members, curators, and the objects themselves interact to co-produce new representations and narratives. Objects are at the heart of the investigation since groups define, lay claim to, repudiate and are in turn defined by them. The project interrogates how definitions of "community" and "expertise" affect the resulting exhibitions, and how power relations infuse decisions that seem innocuous. The resulting ethnography will not only compare how approaches to race, class and gender have changed between the 1969 and 2009 exhibitions, but it will most crucially provide insight into how cultural institutions collaborate with alleged "non-experts" to provide new, dynamic forms of knowledge. This research brings together insights and theoretical tools from the disparate fields of visual anthropology, material culture studies and science and technology studies to explore the role of objects in performing identity and constructing historical narratives. The project is an investigation of science and its publics, contributing to understanding how members of underrepresented populations participate in the creation and consumption of knowledge presented in museums. It will impact how institutions collaborate with communities to produce more multivocal narratives of identity and difference. The project also has educational relevance in producing deeper understandings of exhibition reception by multiethnic stakeholders. It will examine the co-creation of narratives in conjunction with diverse communities; such narratives have huge educational potential because of their public prominence, use in the curriculum of elementary schools, and their presentation of public culture and generally accepted views of history.</AbstractNarration>
