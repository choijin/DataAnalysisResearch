<AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will develop and evaluate a Beta prototype 50 kW 300 kW-hr novel energy storage system. No current energy storage technology can provide low specific cost, high energy density, and long lifetime operation in the mid-capacity range (100kWh - 10 MWh). Particular opportunities exist with renewable energy providers (e.g., wind and solar), commercial &amp; industrial consumers, as well as utilities for services such as capacity firming, consumption smoothing, energy arbitrage, and power regulation. SustainX intends to develop, manufacture and market a disruptive, cost-effective and scalable energy storage device that will serve as an enabling technology for the proliferation of alternative energy generation sources, such as wind and solar power. Having demonstrated technical feasibility through the Phase 1 &amp; 1B effort, the company's Phase II effort will be dedicated to improving system round-trip efficiency, scaling the technology, and ultimately deploying a Beta system at a customer site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Low cost, long lifetime energy storage has the potential to broadly impact grid stability and reliability, commercial and industrial consumer energy costs, and renewable energy generator value and overall market penetration.  As the penetration of wind increases due to renewable portfolio standards, rising fossil fuel costs, public sentiment surrounding climate change and other market pressures, the industry faces a number of challenges. These include, but are not limited to, intermittency of supply, errors in forecasting power production, increased regulation requirements, and transmission congestion. As wind becomes a larger percentage of the energy portfolio, these challenges are compounded. Energy storage has the potential to mitigate these integration issues, thereby allowing wind power to be utilized on a larger scale in a more economically-viable fashion. Specifically, wind generators will be able to use SustainX's energy storage technology to firm capacity, increase peak sales, and enhance ancillary service capabilities. Storage capacity therefore not only represents a significant value to current wind production, but should also be seen as an enabling technology that will allow the world to reach its near- and long-term energy management goals.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The purpose of this project was to develop and demonstrate a more efficient, affordable technology for storing large amounts of energy in the form of compressed air.  Large-scale energy storage can smooth the generation and transmission of electricity throughout the grid, making electricity cheaper, more reliable, and less polluting to generate.  Air is a desirable energy-storage medium because it is free, nontoxic, and nonflammable.     In compressed-air energy storage, electricity runs machines that create compressed air which is later used to generate electricity again. The compressed-air energy storage technology developed by SustainX under this project achieves higher efficiency&mdash;that is, more of the energy used to compress the air is retrieved later as electricity&mdash;by keeping the air at a more or less constant temperature during both compression and expansion.  This has several advantages, including avoidance of extreme heating and cooling of the air.     During the course of this project, SustainX took its approach from small proof-of-concept models to a large-scale, functioning Pilot system that demonstrates its patented innovations in compressed-air energy storage. The Pilot can produce 40 kilowatts of electricity (enough to run 400 100-watt light bulbs) and the total amount of energy it stores is limited only by the capacity of the high-pressure air tanks attached to it.  Experience with this 40-kilowatt system has enabled SustainX to design a MW-scale energy storage system that is not only higher power, but more efficient, and disruptively low in cost.  SustainX is moving toward demonstrating this product in real-world use and bringing it to market.  Thanks to support from the NSF as well as the US Department of Energy and venture-capital investors, SustainX is poised to make the USA a world leader in compressed-air energy storage.
