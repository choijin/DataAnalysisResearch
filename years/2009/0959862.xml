<AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program Professor Brian F. Woodfield and colleagues Juliana Boerio-Goates, Branton J. Campbell and Roger G. Harrison from the Department of Chemistry at Brigham Young University will acquire a powder X-ray diffractometer capable of carrying out routine phase identification and advanced structural analysis including phase identification of synthetic products, nanoparticle-size determination, and Rietveld structural analysis. Specific applications are: 1) studies of products of nanoparticle and catalyst syntheses; 2) nanocrystal growth kinetics; 3) relationships between nanoparticle and bulk structure; 4) semiconductor nanoparticle chemistry; 5) bioinorganic nanoparticle chemistry; and 6) materials physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of the full three dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles, and provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of a molecule relative to neighboring molecules. A powder diffractometer allows diffraction studies in powdered crystalline materials. The data provide information on particle sizes, phase identification and sample purity. The studies described here will impact a number of areas, including chemistry and materials chemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research.</AbstractNarration>

Two local small businesses (Megadiamond, Inc. and Cosmas, Inc.) have already made contact with us and have setup training sessions so they can use the XRD instrument as part of their R&amp;D effort.  Both companies have or have had NSF SBIR awards and collaborate with BYU on various research projects. Several research groups from the University of Utah have also expressed interest in using the instrument. All outreach activities will provided free of charge by the university.  Extending Research  The XRD instrument has greatly increased the speed and efficiency of the overall research work, in addition to making it possible to obtain publishable results from nanoparticle samples, very small polycrystalline samples (BJC), thin-film samples, oriented metallic sheets (BJC), air-sensitive samples (RGH), and variable-temperature measurements (BFW).  All of the new research directions described above depend heavily on the new instrument.  BJC has recently secured funding to study nanocomposites of graphene and transition-metal compounds.  BFW is currently submitting a proposal to NSF to develop improved computational techniques to understand surfaces of nanomaterials, confirm these theoretical approaches using experiment, and then apply this knowledge to more directed synthetic techniques to improve battery electrodes. The XRD instrument has made a dramatic impact in the materials research effort at Brigham Young University and for the surrounding startup business.             ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
