<AbstractNarration>The principal investigator will  work on problems in the geometry, topology, and dynamics  of surfaces.  The objective of the first part of the proposal is to increase our understanding of the mapping class group, its action on the Teichmuller space of a surface and the boundary at infinity of Teichmuller space. Among the specific problems is one that attempts to show that from the point of view of counting orbits points for  the action of the mapping class group on Teichmuller space,  a random mappping class group element is pseudo-Anosov. Another problem is to study the distribution of orbits of the mapping class group on Thurston's space of  measured foliations.   The objective of the second part of the proposal is  to study the  dynamics of flows on translation surfaces.  The principal investigator is interested specifically in the phenomenon of minimal but not uniquely ergodic directions for the linear flow on the translation surface.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator works in several diverse areas of theoretical mathematics. These fields are topology, geometry, and dynamical systems. They come together in the broad area of studying properties of surfaces. This is a subject of mathematics that goes back hundreds of years, and yet remains a vibrant area of modern research. The work of the principal investigator  involves expanding our knowledge of these areas and also involves the training of graduate students to become research mathematicians.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The principal investigator worked on and completed a number of projects in mathematics.  The PI  works in the fields of dynamical systems, topology, geometry,  and complex analysis. All  are fundamental in mathematics and these subjects often overlap.   In dynamical systems one studies the motion of objects as time evolves. Examples in the real world are the motion of planets and the motion of cells. The PI works on the subject of billiards in polygons and has been studying this dynamical system for years.  As part of the current  project the PI studied the size of the set  of billiard paths that do not come too close to the vertices.   Often in mathematics one studies  an object and the various geometries one can put on it. A prime example is to take a surface and study all the ways one can put a hyperbolic or negatively curved metric on it. The set of all possible such metrics s called the moduli space of hyperbolic surfaces; a subject that goes back almost 200 years.  It is important to study properties of this moduli space.
