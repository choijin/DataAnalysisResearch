<AbstractNarration>Telescopes on the ground must observe objects in deep space through the interference of the earth's atmosphere.  As light passes through the atmosphere it gets spread into rapidly varying "speckle" patterns by turbulence due to wind shear and changes in the atmosphere's temperature and pressure.  This effectively diminishes the resolving power of earth-based telescopes.  There are two primary techniques to correct for these effects:  speckle imaging and adaptive optics.   Adaptive optics is very successful but is also very complex and expensive to install, maintain, and operate.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The speckle technique uses a fast camera to record the motion of the objects seen through the telescope.  After the data are gathered, post-processing software is used to shift and align the image frames so that they can be added together to generate a higher-resolution picture.  There are many kinds of astronomical science that benefit greatly from improved image resolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Eikenberry is pursuing a technique that would enable the speckle technique to be used in real-time.  This would allow not only immediate image reconstruction but also permit the higher resolution telescope light to be passed on to another instrument.  His goal is to feed the light into a spectrograph which spreads the light out like a rainbow.  With the higher resolution that his technique will enable, scientists will be able to learn how the characteristics (relative velocities and chemical composition) of objects vary with position.  Dr. Eikenberry is mentoring a graduate student whose PhD thesis work will involve developing the new prototype instrument.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The purpose of this work was to use a small exploratory grant to investigate and, if possible, demonstrate the new observational technique of "speckle stabilization" we have invented for astronomy.  The Speckle Stabilization approach aims to use simple commercially-available technologies to achieve extremely high-resolution images of astronomical targets in live time, from large ground-based telescopes.  For certain niche applications, Speckle Stabilization can match or even exceed the image resolution of the Hubble Space Telescope, using ground-based telescopes.  The overall outcome of this project was a resounding success.  We first explored and verified the potential of the Speckle Stabilization technique using detailed computer simulations of atmospheric turbulence in Earth's atmosphere, coupled with realistic models of the experimental system.  We then designed and built such a system, and tested its performance in the laboratory using custom-designed and built turbulence generators.  Both the simulations and the laboratory tests confirmed our design expectations.  We then deployed the prototype system "on-sky" at two major astronomical observatories -- the Kitt Peak National Observatory 2.1-meter telescope in Arizona, and the William Herschel 4-meter telescope in the Canary Islands.  We demonstrated that even with this preliminary, low-budget prototype system, we could achieve excellent performance, improving over the natural atmospheric image quality by factors of several, and even approaching the resolution provided by the Hubble Space Telescope.  Furthermore, these on-sky tests allowed us to identify the limiting factors for improved performance (i.e. obtaining a higher-performance, but still commercially-available, fast steering mirror).  We hope to develop a new, improved system based on these experiences which can in fact surpass Hubble resolutions in the visible light band from the ground (pending the outcome of a new proposal to the National Science Foundation).  In addition, two graduate students received outstanding training under this grant, including the opportunity to work with and develop cutting-edge imaging technologies.  One student began the early phases of his doctoral studies under this grant.  The other student successfully completed his doctorate with the support of this grant, and has now moved on to apply his training in these technologies via a fellowship with the National Geo-Spatial Intelligence Agency.
