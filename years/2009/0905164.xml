<AbstractNarration>The phenomenal advance in computer technology in terms of processing&lt;br/&gt;speed and capacity, closely described by Moore's law, in the last four&lt;br/&gt;decades has been outpaced by the explosive amount of data that are used&lt;br/&gt;to describe more realistic models in scientific computing. For instance,&lt;br/&gt;the number of unknowns in a linear system has grown from hundreds in &lt;br/&gt;the past to tens of millions nowadays. Fast algorithms such as the&lt;br/&gt;celebrated fast multipole method (FMM) have provided a computational&lt;br/&gt;tool for narrowing the gap. At the same time, there is a great need&lt;br/&gt;and challenge to develop better computation techniques and utilize the&lt;br/&gt;present and emerging computers, with the gain in speed up to a couple &lt;br/&gt;of orders of magnitude. The goal of the proposed research is to &lt;br/&gt;advance computational theories and techniques, in order to meet the &lt;br/&gt;demand and challenge for large scale simulations of complex &lt;br/&gt;systems in scientific, medical and engineering studies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research team proposed to investigate, innovate and integrate the&lt;br/&gt;key simulation steps, from analytic re-formulation of system models with&lt;br/&gt;complex geometries to combinatorial optimization in mapping numerical&lt;br/&gt;algorithms to computing architectures.  Many traditional models are&lt;br/&gt;formulated in terms of linear or nonlinear partial differential&lt;br/&gt;equations (PDEs) with boundary conditions on complex geometries. By&lt;br/&gt;the work of other researchers and principal investigators,&lt;br/&gt;integral equation (IE) formulations have lead to better numerical&lt;br/&gt;algorithms in both efficiency and stability, and more importantly&lt;br/&gt;enabled certain important large-scale simulations. It is proposed first&lt;br/&gt;to study the reformulation of traditional PDE models into IE models, as&lt;br/&gt;a direct and analytical approach to innovative algorithm design. Next,&lt;br/&gt;preconditioning techniques will be studied as an indirect and&lt;br/&gt;stabilization approach. Furthermore, Graph-theoretic methods will be&lt;br/&gt;applied to optimize the FMM-based algorithms on various modern&lt;br/&gt;computer architectures, especially, parallel architectures.  These key&lt;br/&gt;components will be studied in conjunction, not in isolation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merits of the proposed work are three-fold. &lt;br/&gt;It sheds lights on (1) the model reformulation into IEs of the second &lt;br/&gt;kind as a fundamental analytic-algorithmic approach to accelerating &lt;br/&gt;and stabilizing numerical computation, (2) the connection between &lt;br/&gt;reformulation and preconditioning, and (3) on the mutual dependence &lt;br/&gt;of numerical algorithms and computer architectures. The proposed &lt;br/&gt;work will have broader impacts on various applications through&lt;br/&gt;timely dissemination with demonstration of case studies.  Three&lt;br/&gt;application areas of specific concern are electrostatics calculation &lt;br/&gt;in molecular dynamics simulations, computational fluid dynamics, and &lt;br/&gt;the study of oxygen delivery in tissues and tumors via microvascular&lt;br/&gt;networks. The proposed work involves interdisciplinary research&lt;br/&gt;collaboration and cultivation of young and new researchers with&lt;br/&gt;multi-disciplinary backgrounds.  Finally, the findings and &lt;br/&gt;algorithms will be embodied in open source high performance &lt;br/&gt;software to facilitate research computing by and large and to &lt;br/&gt;be used in classrooms.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The outcome of the research project may be put into three major parts. The first is a mathematical reformulation transforming certain important partial differential equations(PDEs) into integral equations (IEs) which lead to more stable and efficient numerical solutions, based on the ideas and techniques of the fast multipole method (FMM) and its recent new versions.  % This is mostly accomplished by the collaborators at INJ and UNC-CH.  The second part is the translation or mapping of analytical and numerical methods to mathematical software on modern computers, which are typically parallel. A few innovative ideas and their realization are proven successful : (1) the abstraction that allows the separation of mathematical components and architectural components for their optimal combination in adaptation to both problem-specific parameters and computer architecture specifics; (2) a graphical representation and spatio-temporal analysis of the algorithm-to-architecture mapping; (3) the design and development of a binary encoding scheme for provably fastest construction of the data structure for source-target interactions in an irregular configuration space, and the traversal over the structure.  All these are encapsulated in the mathematical software already released or to be released in the near future.  With much broader impact, the third part involves applications of the fundamental ideas and computational techniques to data analysis that is not necessarily or readily in the conventional problem expressions in terms of PDEs or IEs. Particular applications include localization of spinal cord injury, classification of hyper-spectral imaging data, and estimation of tumor deformation from cone-beam computational tomography data.
