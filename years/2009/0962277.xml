<AbstractNarration>Results from carbon-14 studies of biochemical classes of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and particulate organic carbon (POC) have shown that carbohydrate and protein derive from carbon dioxide that has been recently fixed into organic matter (i.e., modern in age), whereas the lipid fraction is the most highly aged (~103-104 yrs BP) component of both DOC and POC.  The older age of the lipid fraction is believed to be due to differences in organic matter sources, residence times, and/or reactivity.  However, more studies are needed to understand the age of the lipid fraction and its contribution to the average age of oceanic DOC and POC.  For this reason, a scientist from the College of William and Mary Virginia Institute of Marine Science and her collaborator from Ohio State University plan to examine the sources (i.e., terrigenous, marine, natural, anthropogenic), transformations, and fate of lipophilic organic matter across the land-ocean boundary of Delaware Bay and its adjacent coastal waters.  To attain their goal, the researcher will carry out a geochemical evaluation of the conservative vs. non-conservative behavior of different organic constituents (i.e., bulk DOC and POC and their lipid components) and their isotopic (delta14C and del13C) signatures as a function of salinity. This will provide information on the overall mean inputs and sinks of each constituent on the scale of the entire estuary.  In addition, the photochemical and microbial reactivity of DOC, POC and lipid components will be evaluated in controlled incubation experiments on timescales relevant to estuarine mixing and residence times.&lt;br/&gt;It is anticipated that this study will provide new insights on how the lipophilic organic matter contributes to the age, reactivity, and cycling of DOC and POC in estuarine and coastal waters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In terms of the broader impacts, at no cost to the project, the scientist from the College of William and Mary Virginia Institute of Marine Science plans to involve graduate students from the Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro in the research project, thereby building a collaboration between U.S. and Brazilian scientists.  One graduate student from the College of William and Mary Virginia Institute of Marine Science and one graduate student from Ohio State University would be supported and trained as part of this project.</AbstractNarration>

The carbon cycle within these regions is complex due to strong gradients in biological and physical processes, and increasing anthropogenic impacts. This is further complicated by the many sources of particulate and dissolved organic matter (OM) in estuaries, including materials derived from terrestrial, anthropogenic, sources and aquatic and marine primary production. This study used a combination of lipid biomarker analyses with stable and radiocarbon signatures of lipids and source-specific biomarkers to better understand the sources and aging of organic matter in the Delaware River and Estuary, a representative temperate estuary.  This study captured spatial distributions of organic matter over different regimes (e.g. low and high Delaware River discharge, low and high phytoplankton production, and low and high suspended sediment concentrations). These data expand upon earlier studies and provide new insights about the sources and ages of OM as well as the processes influencing their distribution in the Delaware system.     Intellectual merit  Results from this study showed:  (1) The lipid fractions of POM and UDOM have "older" radiocarbon ages than bulk POC and UDOC. ?14C values for POC increased along the salinity gradient from -229.4 &plusmn; 1.6 &permil; ~2093 y Before Present (BP) to +8.90 &plusmn; 0.04 &permil; (modern). The lowest ?14C values (i.e., oldest) were found at the estuarine turbidity maximum (ETM).    (2) Neutral lipids have older ages than polar lipids in the ultrafiltered DOM fraction. Overall, &Delta; 14C values for neutral lipids had "older" radiocarbon ages than polar lipids. This suggests that neutral lipids contribute to the "aged" signatures of total lipid in this estuary.    (3). Fatty acids (FA) associated with estuarine POM exhibit a range of &Delta;14C values and the age distribution of different FA changes along the estuary. Long-chain FA (land sources such as soils and plants) increased in age along the estuary. In contrast, algal FA had "older" radiocarbon ages in Delaware River, likely reflecting incorporation of aged DIC, and became "younger" along the estuary due to contributions from autochthonous sources (see attached Figure).    (4) The age of lipids in Delaware Bay results from delivery of "aged" OM from external sources in the watershed rather than "aging" along the salinity continuum. Results from this study showed that ?14C values for neutral total lipid extracts (TLE)  were more depleted (i.e., had "older" radiocarbon ages) than polar TLE. Radiocarbon ages for neutral TLEPOM were younger than neutral TLEUDOM by approximately 10,000 YB while polar TLEPOM and polar TLEUDOM were similar in age. Along the estuary, radiocarbon ages of TLE indicate two regions where "aged" lipid enters the Delaware system: (1) the Delaware River and (2) a location downstream of the ETM and upstream of the chl max region. An isotopic mixing model for &delta;13C and ?14C values for POC suggests that "young" POC may be removed in the ETM through respiration or burial, or that "older" carbon is added in this region of the estuary. Compound specific radiocarbon analysis of fatty acids (FA) showed that the ages of terrestrial and aquatic FA change along the estuary with long-chain FA (soils, vascular plants) getting older and short-chain FA (microbial sources) becoming younger down the estuary.    Overall, this study demonstrated that a range of environmental factors influenced the source and age composition of lipid with the Delaware estuary. Our findings suggest that watershed processes (land use, residence time in the watershed, anthropogenic activities), rather than within-estuary processing, are the likely control on the ages of organic matter observed in the Delaware study system.
