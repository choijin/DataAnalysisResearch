<AbstractNarration>Humans feel doubt and uncertainty. We know when we don't know or don't remember. A good example of this is the feeling that someone's name is on the tip of your tongue. This sophisticated cognitive capacity to be aware of our own thinking is called metacognition. It is closely allied to our consciousness and self-awareness and represents a fundamental dimension of our mental experience and intellectual functioning. The goal of the proposed research is to discover the origins of the metacognitive capacity by tracing the evolutionary roots of metacognition, self-awareness, and consciousness in nonhuman animals. Accordingly, this project explores metacognition in humans and rhesus macaques. The research design includes tasks that assess whether humans and nonhuman primates monitor and control their thinking in similar ways. The animals are tested via computer tasks in which they respond by touching icons on their computer screen using a joystick-controlled cursor.  In previous work, animals performed these tasks eagerly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Metacognition is crucial to every aspect of learning and comprehension, and in every educational setting. Understanding the cognitive organization of this capacity in adult humans and tracing its evolutionary emergence will support the development of animal models for metacognition. These models will ground the study of neurological substrates and neurochemical blocks and enhancements to metacognition. The simple, nonverbal tasks developed to suit animals are also ideal for testing very young humans. These paradigms should extend the range of techniques available to child development researchers. These paradigms may also support the study of metacognition in language-delayed or autistic children and promote efforts to train metacognition in educationally challenged populations. The research may open a new window on reflective mind in animals and on human origins, perhaps explaining how or why conscious cognitive regulation came to be such a crucial aspect of human intelligence. Finally, the demonstrations of animal awareness emerging from the research will have important implications regarding respectful, compassionate husbandry in all areas of animal research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Adult humans consistently and actively reflect on their own thought processes.  They monitor what they know, what they do not know, and then modify their behavior to find information or to report their certainty or uncertainty.  These capacites are often referred to as metacognition.  They are sophisticared processes, and they are highly adaptive.  Our research is motivated to discover and understand the evolutionary emergence of these capacities by studying when and how other species demonstrate metacognition through uncertainty monitoring and information-seeking behaviors.   We presented monkeys and adult humans a series of tests using computer games in which participants had to monitor their perceptional experiences, theyir memories, and in some cases their confidence in their ability to make correct choices.  When they were uncertain, we gave them the chance to ask for more information or to avoid making a response so as to also avoid potentially making an error.  Monkeys, like humans, use these responses to deal with fallibility and uncertainty, as measured objectively in terms of how well they are performing on such tasks.   We focused specifically on any possible external, associatively-learned cues that might control monkey and human responses, to try to isolate learning-based and more cognitive interpretations of these behavior patterns.  Our results showed that monkeys often relied on cognitive contruals of tasks, and that their uncertainty responses or information-seeking responses were not controlled by external stimuli.  We showed that monkeys, like humans, suffer in their metacognitive monitoring when important working memory resources must be devoted to other ongoing tasks.  We showed that monkeys flexibly modifed their degree of escaping trials not just on the objective difficulty of the trial (e.g., how hard it was to tell if a pizelated box was sparse or dense) but also in terms of what was at risk in that context (did they have a lot of rewards at stake or only a small number).  This showed that monkeys, like humans, attend not only to objective difficulty, but also to a subjective sense of what is at risk when they decide if they know enough to make a response or should escape that situation or request more information.
