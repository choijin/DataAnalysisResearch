<AbstractNarration>Over the past decade the USAP ships, RV/AS Gould and RV/IB Palmer, have used hull-mounted acoustic Doppler current profilers (ADCP) to routinely record underway, along track velocity profiles beneath the ships. This has resulted in a growing database of ADCP transects, especially in the region of the West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP). Combined with other hydrographic data (e.g. XBT/ XCTD data, drifter tracks, some limited moorings) this current velocity data will be used for further analysis of the physical circulation in this ecologically and climatically sensitive region of the Southern Ocean. Processes including inter-annual and spatial variability of WAP shelf-edge and cross-shelf transport, the effects of tides, circulation controls upon sea-ice formation and associated Antarctic ecosystems (e.g. krill) are some of the key circulation features that may be more accurately inferred from these combined data sets. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will support the development of a graduate student in descriptive physical oceanography, and introduce undergraduate students to quantitative scientific analysis.</AbstractNarration>

The large SO GLOBEC effort in this area is testimony to the importance of understanding circulation here, in order to understand and quantify life-cycles and importance of krill in the Antarctic ecosystem.  Circulation controls not only the connections between sites of krill spawning, recruitment, and high chla content, which presumably correlates to krill food stocks, but also contributes to or controls nutrient and heat budgets for the shelf, thus affecting ecosystems from the building block level up, as well as influencing sea-ice development, and thus both physical habitat and stratification on the shelf. This project specifically addressed connectivity and cross-shelf transport directly relevant to these larger issues, and will guide continuing model development efforts.  Accurately modeling of broad circulation  features and local episodic processes is quite difficult, and depends on validation from observations.   Two undergraduate interns have contributed o this effort, and both have developed their interests in computer science and data analysis as a result.
