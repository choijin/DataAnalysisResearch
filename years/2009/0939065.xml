<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This CPATH award funds an extension of a CPATH community building project between Michigan State University (MSU), Lansing Community College (LCC), and the Corporation for Skilled Workforce (CSW) to prepare a globally competitive engineering workforce that is able to apply Computational Thinking (CT) to a broad range of societal challenges and opportunities. Broadly defined in the context of the engineering practice, computational thinking involves solving problems and designing systems by making use of fundamental computer science concepts. The goal is to redesign the role of computing within the engineering programs at MSU and LCC to develop CT competencies informed by industry needs by infusing CT learning opportunities into the undergraduate engineering curriculum. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has several major activities.  A primary focus is on developing and implementing instructional modules in Chemical Engineering and Civil Engineering at MSU and the pre-engineering courses at LCC.  The approach is to identify and implement authentic problems for curricular revision in two engineering disciplinary curricula at MSU and the engineering transfer curricula at LCC and to identify the computational principles for each disciplinary epitome and use these principles to help design the instructional modules. The team plans to develop appropriate materials to support the disciplinary faculty who will be teaching the modules. Comprehensive evaluation is to be conducted including the design and implementation of quasi-experimental evaluation and assessment components to document CT competencies in the engineering students. Finally, the group plans to improve information and knowledge exchange via the CPACE Engineering Talent Development Network and dissemination and communication efforts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit lies with the strong interdisciplinary team that plans to redefine the role of computing within engineering programs and the collaborative network including industry partners that are involved.  The project includes identification of computational thinking concepts and correlation with engineering competencies.  The research results should inform future innovation in multiple engineering disciplines. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts include the diverse group of students and stakeholders involved and engaged. Transfer from Lansing Community College into engineering programs is to be facilitated and students should be better prepared using the resources of this project. Dissemination of the resources and model is broad, thus allowing for replication and adaptation on a national scale.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A Collaborative Process to Align Computing Education with Engineering Workforce Needs (CPACE): Implementing Constituency-driven Curricular Change that Integrates Computational Thinking Across Engineering Disciplines  American engineering and technology industries require employees with strong computational problem-solving skills. One of the challenges of preparing engineers for the rapidly changing workplace is to provide the foundations they need to choose among, and use a wide range of computational tools. First funded in 2007, CPACE brings together Michigan State University (MSU), Lansing Community College (LCC) and the Corporation for a Skilled Workforce (CSW), to transform undergraduate engineering computing education in a process that is driven by industry needs and to redesign the role of computing within engineering programs.  Impacts of the CPACE project include:  (1) developing an innovative process to help engineering stakeholders communicate and work together to identify essential computational skills and competencies for engineering graduates and implementing curricular reforms that address computational problem-solving needs and concerns of engineering industries.  (2) understanding the skills and behaviors associated with computational problem solving uniquely characterized for the engineering practice.   (3) providing evidence to guide revisions of the teaching and learning of computational competencies that are well-integrated with engineering practice.  Intellectual Merit and Broader Impact  We identified computational competencies that are essential to maintain a competitive 21st Century engineering workforce and aligned them with computing concepts that can be used in engineering curricula (figure 1). Beginning with the computational skills taught in freshman engineering courses, and moving across all four years of the engineering curricula, we are interested in understanding (1) how studentsÆ computational problem-solving skills progress through the curricula and (2) what are the features that characterize the knowledge, skills and behaviors associated with computational problem solving in engineering?  Computational Competency in Undergraduate Engineering:  Our analyses indicate that students who are engaged in classroom activities that encourage the use of computational skills report gains in the use and application of important computational competencies (e.g. MATLAB and EXCEL-related). However, students entering disciplinary courses either at the sophomore or junior level report a marked drop in confidence in their ability to use and apply important computational skills. Students have difficulties making connections between different computational tools and skills; suggesting they have a limited understanding of underlying computational principles. Our studies highlight the need to revise the teaching of computational competencies, particularly at the introductory level, to help students develop computational knowledge that is well integrated with the engineering practice.  Assessment of Computational Competencies: Despite the central role that computation plays in the engineering practice there is a lack of assessments to measure computational competencies. A key achievement of the CPACE project is the development of assessment tools to allow us to understand studentsÆ computational competencies in the context of engineering.  CPACE Computational Competencies Framework (CPACE-CCF): Based on the CPACE computational competencies (Figure 1) we designed rubrics to assess studentsÆ computational problem solving in course projects and other assignments. Table 1 illustrates two exemplar competencies from Figure 1, and includes sample descriptors aligned to the characteristics and behaviors associated with the competencies. The development and testing of the CPACE-CCF represents an important step towards characterizing the knowledge, skills and behaviors associated with computational problem solving for unde...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
