<AbstractNarration>CCF - 0936391  &lt;br/&gt;Title: SRC/NSF Forum on 2020 Semiconductor Memory Strategies: Processes, Devices, and Architectures&lt;br/&gt;PI name: Victor Zhirnov     &lt;br/&gt;Inst: Semiconductor Research Corporation &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;This workshop proposal has been initiated by the Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC) and is part of an ongoing attempt to periodically examine and evaluate the needs of the NSF/SRC research community to identify the future directions of the field of microelectronic design automation. This particular proposal is for supporting a workshop on the topic of novel memory technologies. In particular, recent  discovery of a new memory device called the ?Memristors? inspired this workshop, but a broader set of issues having to do with design technologies pertaining to advances in memory technology  and their continuous scaling behaviors will also be discussed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC) is a nonprofit consortium of design automation industries. In recent years, it has taken a major role in chalking out the future technology paths and the requirements of industry by publishing the so called ITRS roadmap. While the ITRS roadmap has been a guiding principle for industry, a similar agenda for university researchers seem to be absent at the present time. The workshop is supposed to fill this void for university researchers, by identifying an agenda for longer term research in the domain of memory technologies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
