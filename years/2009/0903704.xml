<AbstractNarration>The primary focus of this project is to strengthen the Science Department and implement an associate level degree that would provide an educational foundation for students wishing to pursue careers in environmentally sustainable industries. This is not enough as many students entering the college struggle in STEM courses. Therefore we must target the local school systems through a variety of outreach programs to address weakness in these areas. Math literacy is perhaps the greatest problem and will receive special consideration at all levels.&lt;br/&gt;Student preparedness is not only depended on be taught high quality classes, but also requires students to take advance courses in math and science. As these courses are typically electives this project addresses this situation, in addition to increasing the overall interest in STEM.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Sisseton Wahpeton College (SWC) was awarded a grant by the National Science FoundationÃ†s Tribal Colleges &amp; Universities Program (NSF-TCUP) in the fall of 2009, support the project entitled "SWC &ndash; Increases Capacity in Science Instruction".  The goal of this project was to increase the opportunities in STEM education in order to develop the highly qualified workforce needed by the Sisseton Wahpeton Oyate and the Lake Traverse Reservation in the 21st century.   While the primary focus of the project was to restructure and strengthen the Science Department at SWC, there were additional objectives.  These included activities to improve math literacy and the continuing development of SWCÃ†s computer science programs.  As mathematics is an important underpinning of scientific study, additional effort was devoted towards the integration of these skills into the curriculum of new and revised science courses.  Computer science skills are increasingly important in the study and practice of science, in addition to being important workforce development need on the Lake Traverse Reservation.  The key activities of the proposal centered on curriculum development and revisions, with a focus towards interdisciplinary and interactive learning models.  The first step was to complete an ongoing evaluation of current offerings within the Science Department to determine how to most effectively meet studentsÃ† needs.  As expected, it was determined that there were too many courses and degree programs given the very small number of faculty teaching in the department.  Over the course of the project several of these programs were phased out, with their best elements being integrated into the new Sustainable Environmental Studies degree.  This new associates of science degree was purposefully designed to provide a broad foundation for students preparing to transfer into baccalaureate programs at other colleges and universities.  The central theme of program is environmental science and the sustainable harvesting of natural resources located on the Lake Traverse Reservation.  Issues related to environmental protection, for example water quality, are a common thread running throughout the curriculum.  However, it also focuses on the condition and diversity of native plants species, fisheries, and other natural resources as bellwether markers of the overall health of the environment.  Additionally, it allows courses to examine the commercial, political, and cultural aspects related to these resources.  As the recruitment and retention of qualified science faculty are issues at this tribal college, it was import to address these concerns in the design of the Sustainable Environmental Studies program.  The value of this design element proved important even during the course of the project.  While this award allowed the hiring of a second full-time science faculty at the beginning of the project, a series of unrelated and unforeseen events occurred resulting in the search for three separate replacements over the six years of the grant.  Although this rate of turnover caused a major disruption to the implementation of the project, it had far less impact on students as the built-in flexibility of the program allowed for shifts in the specializations of individual faculty members.  As a result the primary objective of the project was accomplished.  The project proposal outlined a very ambitious number of secondary and tertiary objectives.  Although the achievements under each of these objectives varied, in nearly every instance they met or exceeded the expectations stated in the proposal.  These objectives included improvements to the mathematics offerings at SWC, the integration of more instructional technology in STEM courses, expansion of the Student Help Desk program, and a summer bridge program for high school students.  The only objective that did not meet expectations was the creation of educational TV programing promoting STEM.  Although a...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
