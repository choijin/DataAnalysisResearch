<AbstractNarration>This award by the Biomaterials program in the Division of Materials Research to University of Delaware is to develop new collagen-domain-containing, elastomeric multiblock copolymers that will be capable of multiple orders of assembly triggered by environmental cues such as temperature, pH, and metal ion concentration. The development of materials functionalized with peptide and polypeptide domains offers important opportunities for detailed control of the assembly, responsiveness, and function of hybrid materials.  Accordingly, a variety of polypeptides comprising the putative repeat sequences of natural structural proteins have been produced with useful applications in nanotechnology and medicine.  This research project is to identify new sequences and strategies for the bacterial expression of functional collagen polypeptides, as well as their recombinant incorporation into elastin-collagen-elastin triblock copolypeptides.  The main objectives of this project are: a) Recombinant expression of new hydrophilic collagen-like polypeptides and characterization of their triple-helix formation; b) Production of stimuli-responsive triblock and multiblock copolymers comprising thermally responsive elastin-like domains and collagen-like domains; and c) Characterization and elaboration of the materials after their assembly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Basic understanding of the programmed sequential assembly, functionalized with peptide and polypeptide domains, will offer unprecedented opportunities to produce materials with desired assembled structures and subsequent control over the presentation of biologically, electrically, and optically active moieties.  Elaboration of these structures with organic and inorganic groups will offer materials that can function as adhesives, tough wound healing materials, cell-adherent tissue scaffolds, and optically active layers in devices.  The proposed academic programs include teaching and training of students from underrepresented groups including women in the proposed research activities.  ?The Science of Art?, an outreach program as part of this award, will present the science of materials and their properties at art classes to students at secondary level and engage them in scientific concepts in an environment outside of that in which science learning normally occurs.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project has introduced a new set of peptide-based conjugates that show interesting thermally responsive assembly.  The main building block employed in these new materials are domains based on collagen, the most abundant protein in mammals. Collagens play important roles in biological functions including tissue scaffolding and repari, as well as in mediating cell adhesion and migration.  Responsive materials that contain domains derived from collagen would thus have a wide range of potential applications in medicine.  Collagens also assemble into higher-order structures, so materials that contain collagen-derived domains may also show interesting nanostructures.  In this work, collagen-like peptides were coupled to thermally responsive domains to permit contol of the assembly of the materials on the basis of temperature.  This project has yielded some of the first collagen-containing conjugates reported to form hollow nanoparticles, as well as the first conjugates containing very short elastin-like domains to show unexpected thermally responsive assembly.  The nanoparticles formed have diameters on the order of 100-200 nanometers and should be capable of being loaded with a range of cargo, including proteins and drugs, which would make them potentially useful in treating diseases such as cancer and osteoarthiritis. Owing to the potential for these carriers in multi-temperature responsive delivery of  both water-soluble and water-insoluble compounds, the  technology may also have application in a range of other industries, including  food, water treatment, and agriculture.
