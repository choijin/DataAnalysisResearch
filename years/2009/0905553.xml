<AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Traditional database systems are designed to provide the user with a&lt;br/&gt;clear picture of past states of the world as is represented in the&lt;br/&gt;database. Recently, stream processing systems are introduced to&lt;br/&gt;produce near real-time answers for those applications applications&lt;br/&gt;that require up-to-date information. Thus, we see a trend toward&lt;br/&gt;shrinking the ?reality gap? to zero. But for some applications, even&lt;br/&gt;real-time is not good enough. There is often a desire to get out in&lt;br/&gt;front of the present by delivering predictions of future events to&lt;br/&gt;take advantage of opportunities or to avert calamity. Security&lt;br/&gt;applications are a good example since they are typically interested in&lt;br/&gt;preventing a breach rather than simply reporting that one has&lt;br/&gt;happened. There is currently no database system that can effectively&lt;br/&gt;serve as a generic platform to support such predictive applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to fill this gap by designing and building a&lt;br/&gt;prototype database system called "Longview" to enable data-centric&lt;br/&gt;predictive analytics. Longview facilitates the use of statistical&lt;br/&gt;models to analyze historical and current data and make predictions&lt;br/&gt;about future data values and events. Users can plug new predictive&lt;br/&gt;models into the system along with a modest amount of meta-data, and&lt;br/&gt;the system uses those models to efficiently evaluate predictive&lt;br/&gt;queries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Longview treats predictive models as first-class citizens by&lt;br/&gt;intelligently managing them in the process of data management and&lt;br/&gt;query optimization. This involves automatically building models and&lt;br/&gt;determining when and which model(s) to apply to answer predictive&lt;br/&gt;queries. This also involves creating and using the proper physical&lt;br/&gt;data structures to facilitate efficient model building, selection, and&lt;br/&gt;execution. Longview handles both streaming and historical queries. In&lt;br/&gt;fact, many streaming queries need efficient access to an archive of&lt;br/&gt;past values, making it necessary to seamlessly combine both stream and&lt;br/&gt;historical processing. Finally, Longview investigates "white-box"&lt;br/&gt;model support, in which the database leverages the operational&lt;br/&gt;semantics and representation of models to improve performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Longview's goal is to make it much easier to build predictive&lt;br/&gt;analytics applications in data intensive situations. Seamlessly&lt;br/&gt;combining data and model management is key to make the process of&lt;br/&gt;computing with predictions far easier to express and more efficient&lt;br/&gt;than the current ad-hoc application-level approaches. The resulting&lt;br/&gt;technology also allows for a better understanding and support for&lt;br/&gt;user-defined functions in database systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Longview is initially used for a real-world sensor-based tracking&lt;br/&gt;application and a predictive web portal for easy experimentation with&lt;br/&gt;different models and data sets.
