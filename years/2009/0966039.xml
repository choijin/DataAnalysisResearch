<AbstractNarration>The S-STEM project in the College of Natural Science and Mathematics at California State University Long Beach (CSULB) is to provide approximately sixteen need-based scholarships per year for five years to declared BS-track undergraduate students from four departments; Chemistry &amp; Biochemistry, Geological Sciences, Physics &amp; Astronomy, and Mathematics &amp; Statistics. The PI and Co-PIs represent each participating department.  The objectives of the Physical Science and Mathematics Scholarship (PSMS) program are to (1) provide a supportive environment that immerses participants in the academic community enabling them to reach their scholastic potential; (2) improve the retention/graduation rate and reduce the time to graduation of participants; and (3) prepare participants to enter the STEM workforce or graduate study.  Qualified students are to be recruited through strategic advertisement during freshmen and transfer student orientations, in pre-requisite classes, via advising, and through a web-link.   To maximize impact and reduce replication and cost, the PSMS program is to capitalize on existing student support structures and partner with other sponsored programs.  In addition to the student scholarships, the PSMS program is to offer a supplementary instruction course, program specific mentoring and advising, study groups and tutoring.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goals of the S-STEM program, locally named as the Physical Science and Mathematics Scholarship (PSMS) at California State University Long Beach, were to  1)  improve retention and graduation rates within Physics, Chemistry, Geology and Mathematics  2)  prepare our students for the STEM workforce and/or graduate schools  3)  provide a supportive environment that helped students develop a sense of belonging within STEM.      Our program provided 161 semester-scholarships to 44 students, of which 26 students were NSF-classified underrepresented minority (URM).  The retention rate within the majors (Chemistry, Geology, Mathematics, and Physics) is overall 95% and 92% for URM.  Specifically, 34 students (21 URMs) graduated, and 8 students (4 URMs) are still pursuing in their respective major.  Even among the six students who left the program due to the poor academic performance, 4 students graduated and one is still in the major.  Only 2 students are not retained in their original majors.   Among the graduates, 19 students (56%) are pursuing STEM graduate degrees or a professional school, and 3 students are selected to the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship (Chemistry, Geological Sciences, and Physics).  10 students (29%) found private or government-sector STEM professional jobs.  The program provided the financial support, faculty mentorship for individual students, cohort building and peer-mentoring among the scholarship recipients, and workshops to develop soft skills. Our students were encouraged to seek out all opportunities including student leadership positions, and very successful in achieving their goals with mentorship.  In addition to three students receiving the NSF Graduate Research Fellowships, twenty-two students participated in research activities (e.g., Honor?s theses, lab assistantships, directed research), nine students participated in an official NSF Research Experience for Undergraduates (REUs), five students participated in a semester-long or summer internship program, three students participated in a summer enrichment program, and many of them served as officers in student organizations.  All of the above statistics demonstrate the success of our students and the success of this program in improving retention and preparing students to enter the STEM workforce or graduate schools.  The program was very effective at developing a student community within our college and helped to improve our students? sense, and their families? sense, of belonging in STEM.  Many scholarship recipients were actively engaged in the peer-mentoring and tutoring, and they participated in the student orientations.  Their representation had a positive impact in the induction of those four majors (about &frac14; of the incoming class).  Furthermore, our program put a spotlight on the Chemistry, Geology, Mathematics, and Physics-majors, and was able to develop and articulate the needs of a non-Biomedical student community within the College.  We published a peer-reviewed article based on the student surveys, our own observations, and the evolution of the program, it outlines the best practices and documents the impact on the students? successes.
