<AbstractNarration>Our Galaxy contains astrophysical systems that accelerate particles to energies beyond the reach of any accelerator built by humans. What drives these accelerators is a major question in astrophysics, and understanding these accelerators has broad implications. TeV photons are a key diagnostic of highly energetic particles. Most simply put, emission of a TeV photon requires that the emitting electron, proton, or other particle began at an energy of a TeV or greater. Observations in the TeV band are a sensitive probe of the most energetic physical processes occurring in a variety of Galactic objects. Detection of TeV emission from binaries systems containing a neutron star or black hole is an exciting, new, and unexpected result. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, this group will conduct observations in the TeV band using the Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System (VERITAS) to image flashes of Cherenkov light produced when highly energetic photons strike Earth's atmosphere. They will use VERITAS to study Galactic particle accelerators including jets from stellar-mass black holes and rapidly rotating, young neutron stars, supernova remnants, and unidentified gamma-ray sources. In addition, they will conduct multi-wavelength (X-ray/GeV/TeV) observations that are the key to understanding the particle acceleration process in these systems. They will operate and maintain the pointing monitor system and contribute to the operation of the VERITAS array. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As Broader Impacts, an integral part of the proposed activity will be the broad dissemination of information on very high energy gamma-ray astronomy to college and high school students and the general public making use of materials developed in the VERITAS education and outreach program being led by the Adler Planetarium and Astronomy Museum. Presentations on gamma-ray astronomy and specific results from VERITAS will be made to high school classes and to the general public as part of the "Hawk-Eyes on Science" program of the Physics and Astronomy Department at the University of Iowa and at the Eastern Iowa Observatory and Learning Center (EIOLC) located near Cedar Rapids, IA.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The scientific goal of this program was to enhance our understanding of astrophysical objects within the Milky Way that accelerate particles to TeV energies.  The primary contribution of this project during the final year was publication of results of VERITAS observations of the unidentified very high energy gamma-ray source MGRO J1908+06. VERITAS produced the most detailed maps of the gamma-ray emission to date. The results show that J1908 appears to be an unusual pulsar wind nebula. J1908 has an unusually large extent, compared to pulsar wind nebulae of similar ages, that suggests either an unusual parent pulsar, i.e. one with a high space velocity, or an unusual interaction between the pulsar wind and the surroundings. The former interpretation would raise interesting questions regarding the diffusion and energy loss of the TeV-emitting electrons. The latter would present a laboratory for the study of re-acceleration of relativistic particles that could provide insights to the nature of the dark accelerators.  Some highlights of results from this project from previous years include studies of very high energy gamma-rays from transients sources associated with our Milky Way galaxy, the discovery of very high energy gamma-ray emission from the remnant of Tycho's supernova, and the discovery of pulsed gamma-rays at energies above 100 GeV from the Crab pulsar.  Overall, this project has significantly contributed to our understanding of the most energetic particle accelerators in our galaxy.  Individuals involved in this project gave public lectures that brought some of the results to the general public and made an impact beyond the bounds of the science, engineering, and the academic world.  One individual also met with high school science teachers to keep them up to date on recent developments in astronomy of interest to them and their students.  The project contributed to the training of one postdoctoral research scientist, three graduate students, and one undergraduate student.
