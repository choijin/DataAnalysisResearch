<AbstractNarration>The Learning Mathematics for Teaching (LMT) project developed assessments to measure teachers' knowledge of mathematics needed in teaching.  These items have been widely used by NSF and Department of Education Math and Science Partnerships. To help disseminate the items and to facilitate their implementation, the LMT project developed the first stage of a web-based system called the Teacher Knowledge Assessment system (TKAS) that allows MSP program leaders and others to administer the assessments on line. This project is enhancing the TKAS system to include an online training module, a feature allowing users to design their own assessment scales, and a module to assist users in interpreting results for their projects. An anticipated 300 MSP projects and others will use TKAS to assess over 12,000 teachers over three years.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using data generated by the system, the project team is conducting two studies. The first study is a meta-analysis examining the degree to which MSP projects contribute to teachers' learning as measured by various parts of the LMT assessments. The second study is investigating the features of different professional development activities on student learning.</AbstractNarration>
