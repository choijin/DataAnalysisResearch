<AbstractNarration>This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project will investigate and improve infrastructure sustainability with experimental and modeling approaches by studying the multi-physical properties of solar roofing materials and fabricate a novel solar roofing panel with optimized multifunction. The panel will contain a photovoltaic layer deposited on a thermoelectric layer and then bonded to a plastic lumber substrate through a functionally graded interlayer containing water tubes.  Heat transfer and thermo-mechanical behavior of the solar panel will be characterized by experiments and multi-scale/physical modeling.  Delamination and in-layer cracking will be investigated and simulated for the structural design of the panels. An internal variable based model will be introduced to describe the long-term performance.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The long-term educational goal of this CAREER project is to promote sustainable engineering among the next generation of researchers and engineers at the graduate, undergraduate and pre-collegiate levels. This CAREER project will develop several educational components related to architecturally integrated sustainable infrastructure for harvesting solar energy and increase awareness of novel cost effective approaches that serve as viable solutions for global energy and climate challenges. Three strategic approaches will be implemented: 1) develop interdisciplinary undergraduate and graduate curricula that integrate material manufacturing, instrumentation development, laboratory testing, and technology innovation; 2) establish collaboration with a public school in the Harlem community to promote STEM research course work related to sustainable infrastructure and renewable energy among underrepresented youth, and; 3) increase public understanding and awareness of the role of original research in the development and implementation of sustainable energy and building solutions.</AbstractNarration>

With the optimized manufacturing parameters, a 2 ft &times; 2 ft prototype FGMs with water tubes embedded was fabricated by the vibration and sedimentation combined approach in order to assess the thermal efficiency toward the green energy building envelope applications (Fig. 3). Since the volume fraction of aluminum (Al) powder continuously varies in the thickness direction, the thermo-mechanical property distribution changes smoothly, and avoids the thermal stress concentration across layers and increases the structural integrity and durability of the panels. Several prototype BIPVTs have been fabricated by mounting mono-crystalline silicon PV cells onto the FGM layer with a thermal conductive adhesive.  A schematic illustration of the developed BIPVT panel is shown in Fig. 4, where the FGM layer gradually transits material phases from well-conductive side (aluminum dominated) attached with a photovoltaic (PV) solar cell to another highly insulated side (polymer materials) bonded to a structural substrate.

The substrate provides mechanical loading support and heat insulation of the building envelope. The performances of the prototype BIPVT panel in terms of its thermal efficiency via warm water collection and electricity generation via the PV cells have been investigated at the Carleton Laboratory by using a solar simulator (Fig. 5). Test resutls show that the increased temperature of the collected water by the BIPVT can be as high as 40 &ordm;C at an irradiation of 1000 W/m2 with a relatively low flowing rate at 30 ml/min, and that the decreased surface temperature of the BIPVT can be as high as 32 &ordm;C when the flowing rate increases to 150 ml/min.
