<AbstractNarration>As mobile embedded systems become more prevalent, there is an increasing demand to make processor pipelines more power efficient.  Conventional pipeline inefficiencies include unnecessary accesses to the register file due to duplication or avoidable computation from constantly checking for forwarding and hazards at points where they cannot possibly occur, repeated calculation of invariant values, etc.  It is desirable to develop an alternative processor design that can avoid these wasteful energy consumption aspects of a traditionally pipelined processor while still achieving comparable performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A statically pipelined processor is expected to achieve these goals by having the control during each cycle for each portion of the processor explicitly represented in each instruction.  The pipelining is in effect statically determined by the compiler,  which has several potential benefits, such as reducing energy consumption without degrading performance, supporting a less complex design with a lower production cost, and being able to apply more effective compiler optimizations due to instructions having more explicit control of the processor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the broader impact of this research is manifold. The use of ultra-low power embedded devices, such as bio-implantable microelectronic devices, can significantly affect everyday activities.  A new generation of ultra-low power processors will enable these devices to be more feasible to develop and deploy.  Educational efforts to introduce the latest architecture and compiler enhancements in the classroom complement our research.  Steps will also be taken to increase female and minority enrollment at both institutions in their Computer Science and Computer Engineering programs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Energy efficiency of computer processors has become more important in recent years.  First, due to the proliferation of mobile computing devices, which include smart phones, there is a need to extend the battery life of these products.  Second, we need to reduce the generated heat for general-purpose processors due to the power wall, which means that we cannot increase the clock rate without exceeding thermal limits.  Third, the cost for energy, including electricity, is rising and this cost is an increasing fraction of the operating cost of data centers.  Thus, energy efficiency has become important at all computing levels.  In this project we have reexamined how traditional embedded computer processors can be designed to be more energy efficient without sacrificing performance.  We have found that by redesigning the instruction set so that instructions control what happens during each cycle of the processor, as shown in Figure 1, we were able to reduce energy while simultaneously improving performance and decreasing code size.  The benefits were measured both using a conventional simulator and a VHDL implementation of the static pipeline processor. These benefits were achieved due to the new instruction set enabling a new level of compiler optimizations that eliminated unnecessary or redundant operations in the processor.  We have also redesigned how data accesses are performed.  We have designed new techniques for accessing data in the first level of the memory hierarchy.  Our techniques for significantly improve energy efficiency of first-level data accesses and either do not affect or provide small improvements in performance.
