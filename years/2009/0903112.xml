<AbstractNarration>With rapid changes and new developments in nanotechnology, corrosion, composites, biomaterials and green technologies, as well as the traditional areas of metals, ceramics and plastics, industry needs qualified technicians educated in materials and advanced manufacturing.  The Resource Center for Materials Technology Education (MatEd) builds on its previous efforts to broaden access to resources for faculty educating materials and manufacturing technicians and other materials professionals through an innovative, easily accessible website with linkages to curriculum materials, workshops, conferences journals and professional organizations.  The collection of peer-reviewed, high quality instructional modules aligned with industry-based core competencies for technicians in both traditional and new advanced materials technologies is increased and disseminated broadly to help faculty enhance current courses and develop new ones.  Partnerships created with other ATE centers in welding, rapid prototyping, and aerospace and with professional societies ensure a comprehensive collection of use to technician education.  Strategies to ensure the sustainability of the web site are developed.  The evaluation measures the usefulness of the materials and the core competencies to faculty and other users.</AbstractNarration>

MatEd is helping to transform materials science education in the US. Producing a replicable competency development model that can be used to organize courses and programs. The Center has also created a library of materials-related modules to support materials technology teaching and learning. Refining its dissemination and outreach strategies. Continuous improvement by the MatEd team has focused on targeting specific audiences with appropriate content, tools, and educational resources. This effort has enabled greater impact of MatEdÆs work by reaching specific educational audiences that can benefit most.      INTELLECTUAL MERITS  Due to the ubiquity of materials, MatEd is in a unique leadership position. MatEd helps to develop, guide, and structure materials science education for secondary and post-secondary levels. Students and technicians need the knowledge and experience to optimize the use of materials, and to stay current in the critical field of materials technology.
