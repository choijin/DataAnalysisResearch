    <AbstractNarration>To address a shortage of civil engineering graduates, much of the work currently done by civil engineers in agencies and industry can be performed by engineering technicians. Work such as field and laboratory data collection, elementary analysis and construction quality control could all be performed by engineering technicians. This project develops a cadre of engineering technicians by offering a curriculum which reduces the higher order mathematics requirement for an engineering degree and substitutes for these courses more practical courses suitable for engineering technicians. Courses such as material properties, construction testing, data gathering and statistical quality control are included in the curriculum. Additionally, the program enlists the help of industry to provide jobs during summers and part-time work during the school year. This practical training enables students to experience real world applications of their coursework. Industry supervisors mentor students and train them to be employees of value as civil engineering technicians. Scholarships are also offered to selected candidates in order to allow them to take full course loads. This rigorous practical education coupled with concurrent on-the-job training prepares a technician workforce capable of meeting the demands of the field.</AbstractNarration>
