<AbstractNarration>Number is important for almost everything we do as adult humans.  Where does our quantitative mind originate?  Previous research by Dr. Brannon and others has shown that very young infants can discriminate sets of items based on number alone.  Despite the abundance of evidence that now demonstrates that infants have rudimentary abilities to perceive numerical differences, we do not yet understand whether or how these capacities relate to later mathematical cognition.  The focus of this project is to ask whether nonverbal numerical abilities that emerge early in human development serve as a foundation for learning mathematics.  To answer these questions Dr. Brannon and her research team have developed a new procedure that quantifies an individual infant's ability to see numerical differences.  The procedure involves presenting babies with two streams of numerical images.  One of the streams features a constant number of dots in each image; however, the images vary in the location and size of the dots.  The other image features two different numerical values that alternate.  Infants prefer to look at the changing numerical stream and the magnitude of their preference for the changing stream depends on the ratio between the two values in that stream.  The project will use a longitudinal design to look at the relationship between numerical discrimination abilities in 6-month-old babies and later numerical discrimination and math concepts in the same children at 3.5 and 4.5 years of age.  A large sample of 6-month-old infants will first be tested in the new numerical change detection task.  The same infants will be tested in a variety of nonverbal numerical discrimination tasks at 9 and 18 months and then in both verbal and nonverbal numerical tasks at 3.5 and 4.5 years of age.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide a foundation for understanding the relationship between numerical abilities in infancy and later childhood.  Establishing a link between rudimentary numerical abilities in infancy and later developing mathematical abilities could provide an important avenue for identifying early mathematics difficulties and developing interventions to address these difficulties.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Research over the last 30-40 years has demonstrated that in the first year of life, babies represent number.  Without counting, babies rely on an approximate number system to assess quantity. This system for representing number approximately is evolutionarily primitive and can be seen in many animal species.  The system continues to function throughout the human lifespan alongside our uniquely human symbolic representations of number and mathematical thinking.  Approximate number representations allow babies, animals and even adults prevented from counting, to differentiate sets based solely on number. Work from our group and others has shown that the acuity of the primitive approximate number system is correlated with symbolic math ability.  This correlation suggests that the primitive nonverbal number sense may be foundational for mathematics.   If preverbal number sense is foundational for symbolic mathematics, then facility at making preverbal judgments about numerosity should predict aspects of children?s developing symbolic mathematical ability.  This NSF project addressed this possibility by assessing the acuity of the approximate number system in infancy and then tracking the same children into early childhood to assess their mathematical ability. We showed 6-month old infants two streams of visual dot arrays and measured the time they spent looking at each stream.  Only one of the two streams showed arrays that changed in numerosity but both streams changed in dot size and dot spatial arrangements. We found that infants overwhelmingly preferred to look at the numerically changing stream as long as the change was at least a 1:2 numerical ratio (e.g., 8 vs 16 dots).  Three years later the children returned to the laboratory and we tested their developing symbolic number knowledge and mathematical ability in a variety of ways.  The tasks assessed children?s ability to verbally count, to recognize Arabic numerals, to construct small sets of objects and to answer simple mathematical word problems.  We found that performance in the infant test at 6-months of age predicted a small but statistically significant portion of the variance in children?s symbolic mathematical ability.  These findings provide support for the idea that children build upon a primitive sense of number when learning to count.  Future work will explore whether training that is designed to improve primitive number sense facilitates children?s mathematical learning.
