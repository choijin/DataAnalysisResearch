<AbstractNarration>Today we have organizational and software procedures that facilitate the exchange of interpersonal information in social networking sites, instant messaging, bulletin boards, online role?playing games, computer?supported collaborative work, and online education. All of these applications fit into the larger category of social media that support virtual communities. As we increasingly rely on this cyberspace, the issue of privacy protection in social media is critically important. The objective of this project is to develop an advanced framework called U-Control for Digital Persona and Privacy Management to manage and release personal information considering a notion of digital persona based user privacy preferences and associated risks in disclosing such private information over virtual communities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Successful completion of this project will result in the development of a protection framework and architecture to address the privacy challenges in social media-based virtual communities. This research effort is also expected to set an important direction to the future research in the area of virtual communities and online privacy solutions. This research has the potential for  broad societal impact by providing user-controlled sharing of personal attributes and the efficiency of existing business models and operations of such.</AbstractNarration>
