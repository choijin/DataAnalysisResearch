<AbstractNarration>This project is awarding 80 scholarships to 40 students over the five-year grant period to academically talented and financially needy students pursuing degrees in engineering technology. All the recipients participate in 75% or more of the program's activities such as mentoring, cohort-specfic programs, industry site visits, and evaluation loops. Eighty percent of the scholarship recipents are earning an associate degree in an engineering technology program. Four-year school transfer assistance or job placement is provided to all of the graduating students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major goal of the NSF BFIT All Stars Scholarship and Leadership project is to provide financial support and guidance to academically gifted and financially needy students wishing to study STEM disciplines.

In Year 1 of this project, a rubric was applied to identify incoming students that fit the requirements of the NSF S-STEM solicitation, namely students with high academic skills. The rubric scores did not predict to a satisfactory degree those students who would find the All Stars workshops and other activities to be helpful and motivating, and therefore promote their ability to maintain a GPA of 2.75 or above.  The rubric considered high school GPA, accuplacer placement test results, recommendation letters, written essays, career goals and personal interviews. Our adjusted approach was to delay selection of students until one semester had passed. This adjustment gave program leaders the opportunity to get acquainted with the incoming students, and gather more quantitative and qualitative data in order to make more targeted decisions on student recruitment for All Stars.  Because of this, we have a very high success rate and graduation rate of the NSF BFIT All Stars. This adjusted approach is a reflection of the overwhelmingly high-needs and at-risk nature of BFITÆs student population.  The most successful part of regular meetings with the All Stars was our ability to help the students with their academics through individual tutoring, and to encourage them to form study groups.  Many of our most successful students worked together with other All Stars on course work in their programs, forming small learning communities where they would support each other.  The industry site visits were also very successful.  They gave the students a better idea of the environment they would one day be working in and the visits motivated the students to continue working hard on their courses.  A major challenge that emerged in the first years of the grant was communication with the students.  Email has proved to be largely ineffective with this age group, and has been supplanted by text messaging. Still, students frequently change their phone number and forget to share their new number. Facebook has turned out to be an amazing communication tool for keeping in touch, especially following graduation.  The privacy tools available on Facebook that make selective sharing and group communication manageable have become increasingly important and effective.   This project removed financial barriers which could have caused many of these talented students to leave BFIT before completing their degrees. Most of these students are the first in their families to attend college. Their BFIT degrees will enable them to enter growing industries with the skills and motivation needed for continued advancement. Successful completion of a BFIT degree transforms the life trajectory of each student, and has the potential to lift entire families out of poverty.
