<AbstractNarration>0969015&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vafai&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Convective heat transfer in porous media is important in applications and devices including but not limited to biological matter, electronics cooling, thermal insulation engineering, geothermal and environmental engineering, heat pipes, underground spreading of chemical waste, nuclear waste reposition, fuel cells, direct contact heat exchangers and petroleum reservoirs. This grant provides partial support for individuals to attend the Third International Conference on Porous Media and its Applications in Science, Engineering and Industry to be held in Tuscany, Italy on June 20 - 24, 2010.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit.  This conference will serve as the venue for the exchange of information on new scientific results and set priorities for future research in the area of transport in porous media. World experts in various aspects of porous media research will exchange information through a series of formal presentations and informal discussions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts. NSF funding provides partial support for travel by some of the organizing committee, distinguished speakers, and graduate students. The conference will include the active participation of a diverse cadre of researchers including students and individuals from underrepresented groups. As in previous conferences, papers of high quality will be published in appropriate journals after a peer-review process.</AbstractNarration>
