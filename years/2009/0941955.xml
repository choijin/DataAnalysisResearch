<AbstractNarration>Chemistry (12)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Development of renewable energy resources is a primary concern for national economic growth, energy security and global environmental protection.  Biofuels produced from plant sources are one of the most promising renewable fuel options.  Development of necessary technologies for efficient production of biofuels requires a substantial expansion of infrastructure and vigorous research in related areas of science.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project develops teaching materials for a biochemistry laboratory course that incorporates current topics in biofuel research.  The new laboratory modules are designed to promote students' independent thinking, critical thinking and reasoning, and learning important concepts in biochemistry through guided inquiry and open inquiry experiments.  Such modules are able to encourage active student engagement in their learning by maintaining a focus throughout the entire course on important issues in science and society, specifically the energy crisis and environmental protection.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The main intellectual merit of this project is that it integrates a socio-economically relevant topic, biofuel synthesis, with research-based laboratory activities to enhance learning of important concepts in biochemistry.  This project has several broader impacts: its goals are to generate interest among minority undergraduate STEM students in energy-related careers that are in increasingly high demand, to train undergraduate STEM students to be competent in various modern laboratory techniques, and to prepare these students for careers in research.  A further goal is to promote the development of the next generation of scientists and educators who are going to face the challenge of solving environmental and energy problems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A central strategy of the project was to develop a series of inquiry-based laboratory experiments to enhance student learning of important concepts in biochemistry, to promote higher level thinking skills (e.g., critical reasoning) and to elevate the level of student engagement.  The inquiry-based laboratory experiments had a positive impact on student achievement and attitudes.  Students stated that the lab required that they utilize critical thinking and inquiry skills, what many thought was similar to their experiences in research internships, not an undergraduate laboratory.  Our results showed an increased interest in biofuel research areas as indicated by student discussions on the topic, inquiry about summer internships, and employment of a student at a biofuel facility.  Assessment data showed an increase in student learning of important concepts in biochemistry.  An important outcome is the enhanced academic preparation of minority students for careers in the science fields.  The project also funded several workshops on active learning instructional strategies for faculty and K-12 teachers to promote the implementation of active learning activities in science courses.  The K-12 teachers were provided resources (laboratory experiments, supplies, disposable, and a handheld visible spectrophotometer) to implement active learning activities in their classrooms.  The K-12 teachers stated that they had minimal knowledge and experience in enzyme assays and spectroscopy prior to the workshop.  The teachers were excited about implementing hands-on activities in their classroom to enhance their student learning and interest in the science fields.  The results from this project were dissemination by presentations at the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Annual Meeting and the Gordon Research Conference on Chemistry Education Research and Practice.
