<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award is to identify the relationship between spinal ligament microstructure and the mechanics of the lower back.  The motion and mechanical response of the spine depend strongly upon the mechanical properties of the spinal ligaments; however, there is not currently a method for obtaining these properties for an individual.  The research approach is to (1) image and quantify ligament microstructure, (2) measure the ligament material properties using a novel, anisotropic small-punch technique, and (3) evaluate the effects of ligament microstructure variation on the lower back using finite element analysis.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lower back pain is a leading cause of role disability with an estimated U.S. economic impact exceeding $100 billion per year.  Connecting microstructure variability in spinal ligaments with material behavior will improve understanding of the mechanical consequences of current low back pain treatments, as well as facilitate development of restorative devices for the spine that could significantly improve the quality of life for many people who are disabled by low back pain.  Graduate and undergraduate engineering students will be intimately involved in all aspects of the research, including sharing the results with both technical and nontechnical audiences.  The educational aspect of the work is to enhance current undergraduate coursework, develop a complementary graduate course, and invite well-qualified collaborators and industry partners to interact with interested students in both classroom and research evaluation settings.  Additionally, a mobile showcase of biomechanics related projects that educate and excite 7th through 12th grade students towards biomechanics and engineering fields will be developed.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major goals of this CAREER award project were to characterize the microstructure and material properties of spinal ligaments, and then to evaluate their influence on the behavior of the lumbar spine in the context of low back pain.    As part of this project, quantitative metrics for spinal ligament microstructure were measured.  A novel device for measuring the material properties of ligaments and tendons using very small samples was invented and used to measure the material properties of the spinal ligaments.  By pairing the quantitative evaluation of lumbar spinal microstructure with the measured material properties we were able to predict the mechanical behavior of lumbar spinal ligaments based solely on their imaging data.  The role of spinal ligaments on spinal motion and low back pain was also clarified using detailed numerical models of the spine.  These and other related results were published in 9 journal articles, 8 graduate student theses and dissertations, 4 conference papers, and 28 conference abstracts.  A US patent related to this work is currently pending.  Collaborative work with investigators around the world has been initiated and has helped to uncover the complex factors underlying low back pain.      Educational outcomes from this project were significant: 8 graduate students and 13 undergraduate students were supported and mentored under this project.   The PI also leveraged the award to make enhancements to both the undergraduate and graduate curriculum at BYU with regards to biomechanics instruction.  Two new graduate classes in biomechanics were added to the curriculum, and a biomaterials module was added to the undergraduate materials science class.  The PI also developed a mobile biomechanics showcase consisting of posters and interactive exhibits demonstrating interesting biomechanics principles.  This exhibit was presented by both the PI and by the involved graduate and undergraduate students at various venues, including local elementary, junior high school, and high school classrooms, as well as at annual institutional engineering educational outreach programs.  During the course of the project, over 2,300 K-12 students directly participated in these interactive exhibits designed to increase their interest in pursuing science and technology as a career.
