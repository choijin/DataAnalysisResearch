<AbstractNarration>Assuring deadlines of embedded tasks for contemporary multicore architectures is becoming increasingly difficult. Real-time scheduling relies on task migration to exploit multicores, yet migration actually reduces timing predictability due to cache warm-up overheads and increased interconnect traffic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work promotes a fundamentally new approach to increase the timing predictability of multicore architectures aimed at task migration in embedded environments making three major contributions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. The development of novel strategies to guide migration based on cost/benefit tradeoffs exploiting both static and dynamic analyses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. The devising of mechanisms to increase timing predictability under task migration providing explicit support for proactive and reactive real-time data movement across cores and their caches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. The promotion of rate- and bandwidth-adaptive mechanisms as well as monitoring capabilities to increase predictability under task migration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work aims at initiating a novel research direction investigating the benefits of interactions between hardware and software for embedded multicores with respect to timing predictability. This project fundamentally contributes to the research and educational infrastructure for the design and development of safety- and mission-critical embedded systems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The overall goal of this research is to develop mechanisms and policies in support of predictable execution in embedded multicore systems. The work goes beyond the state of existing multicore designs in developing and assessing architectural support and analysis methods to specifically increase the predictability of execution times under deadline constraints. In this context, task migration is studied as it provides the means to balance resource utilization while imposing a significant challenge to predictability. This work subsumes analysis techniques for predictability under stationary execution in embedded multicores, thereby transforming the embedded landscape in making utilization of advanced multicore microprocessors feasible, even for time-critical embedded domains. Our work aims at initiating a novel research direction investigating the benefits of interactions between hardware and software for embedded multicores with respect to timing predictability. Key outcomes: 1. A semi-partitoning approach was developed to effectively schedule high utilization hard real time systems. This is designed considering all the practical overheads for a cache based multi-core NoC architecture. A second novel migration- and architecture-aware semi-partitioned scheduling strategy was proposed. The two proposed approaches were evaluated alongside two state-of-the-art semi-partitioned scheduling strategies.  2. A weighted TDMA approach was developed to make the WCET of tasks location independent for cores on a NoC architecture. Later, a novel dynamic-priority policy for scheduling memory accesses on the Network-on-Chip (NoC) and a location-aware partitioning policy that takes explicit advantage of this NoC scheduling policy were proposed to improve the efficiency of task allocation on NoC based multi-core architectures. 3. Variants of the memory access arbitration policy discussed in outcome 2 were implemented on TileraÆs TilePro64 hardware platform. Experimental evaluation demonstrated the use of such a memory access arbitration policy can significantly reduce the variability in the execution times of tasks, thus improving predictability of off-chip memory accesses.  4. A novel scheme for partitioning and scheduling resource sharing tasks on locked-cache based multi-core architectures was proposed and found to be more effective than previous approaches to partition and schedule resource sharing tasks.
