<AbstractNarration>The ocean plays a critical role in sequestering CO2 by exporting fixed carbon to the deep ocean through the biological pump.  There is a pressing need to understand the systematics of carbon export in the Southern Ocean in the context of global warming because of the sensitivity of this region to climate change, already manifested as significant temperature increases.  Numerous studies have indicated that Fe supply is a primary control on phytoplankton biomass and productivity in the Southern Ocean. The results from previous cruises in Feb-Mar 2004 and Jul-Aug 2006 have revealed the major natural Fe fertilization from Fe-rich shelf waters to the Fe-limited high nutrient low chlorophyll (HNLC) Antarctic Circumpolar Current Surface Water (ASW) in the southern Drake Passage, producing a series of phytoplankton blooms. Remaining questions include:  How is natural Fe transported to the euphotic zone through small-meso-large scale horizontal-vertical transport and mixing in different HNLC ACC areas?  How does plankton community structure evolve in response to a natural Fe addition, how does Fe speciation respond to biogeochemical processes, and how is Fe recycled to determine the longevity of phytoplankton blooms?  How does the export of POC evolve as a function of upwelling-mixing, Fe addition-recycling and bacteria-plankton structure?  This synthesis proposal will address these fundamental questions using a unique dataset combining multiyear physical, Fe and biogeochemical data collected between 2004 and 2006 from 2 NSF-funded Fe fertilization experiment cruises and 3 Antarctic Marine Living Resource (AMLR) cruises in the southern Drake Passage and southwestern Scotia Sea through collaboration with scientists in the AMLR program and US Southern Ocean GLOBEC projects.  All investigators involved in this study are engaged in graduate and undergraduate instruction, and mentoring of postdoctoral researchers.  Each P.I. will incorporate key elements of the proposed syntheses in our lectures, problem sets and group projects.  The project includes support to convene a 4-5 day international workshop on natural Fe fertilization at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. The workshop will include scientists from United Kingdom, France and Germany who have conducted natural Fe fertilization experiments, and Korea and China who are planning to conduct natural Fe fertilization experiments. The participation of graduate students and postdoctoral scholars will be especially encouraged. The results will be published in a Deep-Sea Research II special issue.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In reference to the idea that iron might be limiting marine productivity in large swaths of the ocean, Oceanographer John Martin famously said "Give me half a tanker of iron and IÆll give you the next ice age". These words launched over two decades of research on ocean iron limitation, including several large scale iron fertilization experiments to test MartinÆs original hypothesis. More recently, ocean scientists have investigated the processes behind natural ocean iron fertilization, whereby sediments over ocean islands, plateaus, and peninsulas appear to be fueling massive phytoplankton blooms in the normally iron-limited Southern Ocean.  The focus of this NSF funded research project was to synthesize key findings from these natural iron fertilization studies in order to identify common themes among them as well as any unanswered questions that may require further investigation. Our efforts in this regard were two-fold. First, we organized an international workshop on the topic with over thirty participants from five countries. Secondly, we published a special volume of the journal Deep Sea Research II with twelve contributions synthesizing the physics, chemistry, and biology of natural iron fertilized blooms.  Owing to the potential for phytoplankton blooms to remove CO2 from the atmosphere, the major focus of iron fertilization studies to date has been on the carbon sequestration efficiency. Our meeting participations agreed that future studies should "strive to better understand ecosystem processes" since our knowledge of carbon sequestration is sufficiently mature at this stage. Such new endeavors should probe further on the bioavailability of particulate iron (the major form of iron in most cases) and what role microbes and zooplankton play in regulation iron availability in the water column. Lastly, no one prior study has been able to "close" the iron and carbon budget due to a lack of full seasonal coverage of the phytoplankton bloom. Future studies, which may require a multi-ship/multi-nation coordinated effort, should attempt to address this shortcoming.  In terms of broader impacts, we note that this project supported one postdoctoral investigator and contributed to international capacity building by funding the conference mentioned above. The career development of numerous Ph.D. students and early career researchers was enhanced through participation in the synthesis meeting and publication of their results in the Deep Sea Research II special volume.
