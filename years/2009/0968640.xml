<AbstractNarration>This grant will support a collaborative research effort at three universities and three government laboratories to develop a method to represent liquid water clouds in the atmospheric boundary layer (i.e. at levels within about 2km of the surface).  The method, which has the acronym CLUBB (clouds unified by binormals), will address the disparity between the size of a climate model grid box (typically 100km) and the much smaller sizes of the updrafts and downdrafts which occur in boundary layer clouds (perhaps 100m).  The research will use a variety of observations in concert with simulations from more detailed models (including large-eddy simulation models) to construct joint probability density functions (PDFs) for  vertical velocity, temperature, moisture, and hydrometeor species.  The PDFs will then be used to simulate the formation of clouds (particularly boundary layer cumulus and stratocumulus clouds) and the extent to which cloud reflectivity and other properties are determined by aerosols.  CLUBB will be implemented in two climate models, one at the National Center for Atmospheric Research and one at the NOAA Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory.  The research was proposed in responsee to a solicitation for Climate Process and Modeling Teams (CPTs), which are intended to perform work yielding improvements to climate models over a three-year time period.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this CPT project are expected to have broad scientific and practical benefits, since climate models are a basic research tool in climate-related research.  Furthermore, climate models are increasingly in demand as tools for decision support by policy makers considering strategies to address climate variability and climate change.  Thus, improvements in climate models offer the prospect of better guidance for policy decisions.  In addition, the grant will support the education of three graduate students, and for the employment and mentoring of three postdoctoral researchers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The principal outcomes for this project fall into two categories.  1.  Intellectual Merit  Because of the limitations of today's supercomputers, global models of the atmosphere cannot resolve small-scale clouds or turbulence.  Hence, such models require that the effects of small-scale clouds and turbulence be estimated, or "parameterized."  In this project, a cloud and turbulence parameterization was implemented in a global atmospheric model, the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM).  The new version of the model was tested against satellite observations and reanalysis data.  Improvements were found in the spatial distribution of stratocumulus and cumulus clouds and in tropical phenomena such as the Madden-Julian oscillation.  As a result, the parameterization was chosen for inclusion in the next public release of CAM.  2.  Broader Impacts  The project had several broad benefits.  The project will benefit the large user-base of CAM when the new version is released.  The new version will be used in the coming years to study a wide variety of atmospheric phenomena.  In addition, this project provided excellent student training in the areas of atmospheric science, numerical methods, and software development.  A number of undergraduates were trained and have gone on to graduate school or jobs in industry.  Graduate students and a postdoctoral research associate also received training.
