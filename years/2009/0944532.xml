<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to address relationships between foreland basins and their tectonic settings by combining detrital zircon isotope characteristics and sedimentological data. To accomplish this goal the PIs will develop a detailed geochronology and analyze Hf- and O-isotopes of detrital zircons in sandstones of the Devonian Taylor Group and the Permian-Triassic Victoria Group. These data will allow them to better determine provenance and basin fill, and to understand the nature of the now ice covered source regions in East and West Antarctica. The PIs will document possible unexposed/unknown crustal terrains in West Antarctica, investigate sub-glacial terrains of East Antarctica that were exposed to erosion during Devonian to Triassic time, and determine the evolving provenance and tectonic history of the Devonian to Triassic Gondwana basins in the central Transantarctic Mountains. Detrital zircon data will be interpreted in the context of fluvial dispersal/drainage patterns, sandstone petrology, and sequence stratigraphy. This interpretation will identify source terrains and evolving sediment provenances. Paleocurrent analysis and sequence stratigraphy will determine the timing and nature of changing tectonic conditions associated with development of the depositional basins and document the tectonic history of the Antarctic sector of Gondwana. Results from this study will answer questions about the Panthalassan margin of Gondwana, the Antarctic craton, and the Beacon depositional basin and their respective roles in global tectonics and the geologic and biotic history of Antarctica. The Beacon basin and adjacent uplands played an important role in the development and demise of Gondwanan glaciation through modification of polar climates, development of peat-forming mires, colonization of the landscape by plants, and were a migration route for Mesozoic vertebrates into Antarctica. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: &lt;br/&gt;This proposal includes support for two graduate students who will participate in the fieldwork, and also support for other students to participate in laboratory studies. Results of the research will be incorporated in classroom teaching at the undergraduate and graduate levels and will help train the next generation of field geologists. Interactions with K-12 science classes will be achieved by video/computer conferencing and satellite phone connections from Antarctica. Another outreach effort is the developing cooperation between the Byrd Polar Research Center and the Center of Science and Industry in Columbus.</AbstractNarration>

An abrupt rise in the ELA in the late Sakmarian (Early Permian) due to a rapid increase in atmospheric CO2 levels resulted in rapid deglaciation throughout polar Gondwana. Following this event, glaciers were absent in Antarctica until the late Cenozoic. However, glaciers continued to occur in eastern Australia at high elevations until the Capitanian (late Middle Permian). This discrepancy between mid-latitude glaciation and ice-free conditions in polar Gondwana indicates that major global cooling did not play a role in the development of the Australian glaciers. Although glacial and interglacial periods within an ice age are driven by orbitally driven changes in insolation, our results support the concept that icehouse to greenhouse climatic states are driven by changes in the level of greenhouse gasses within the atmosphere. Following the LPIA, CTAM basins shallowed upward from deep marine, to deltaic, to fluvial environments. Plants began colonizing the landscape immediately following glacial retreat. Continued tectonism resulted in the transformation of CTAM into a poorly drained elongate, trough-shaped, foreland basin in the Middle Permian. Although the basin margins were characteriz...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
