<AbstractNarration>This collaborative research project is being undertaken by Dr. H.Y. Sohn, University of Utah, and Dr. Suzan S. Ibrahim, Central Metallurgical Research and Development Institute of Egypt to investigate the use of various waste raw materials such as recycled slag in the production of synthetic wollastonite (a calcium silicate mineral) and to find the optimum conditions of flux, temperature, and particle size. The research entails (1) upgrading the raw material to remove unwanted components, (2) developing the wollastonite production process (sintering) and (3) evaluating the resulting product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wollastonite has unique properties, making it an important candidate to be used as an insulating material to replace asbestos in addition to its usage in different industries such as ceramics, glass, coatings, metallurgical, welding, and paper.  This timely proposal addresses dwindling supplies of natural wollastonite and the need for synthetic wollastonite of high purity for industrial application. Its synthesis is a relatively simple process, involving upgrading of raw materials to remove unwanted components and then sintering, or heating, to an appropriate temperature. Various waste materials can be used as the starting point for wollastonite synthesis. If successful, this research project should have immediate economic impact in allowing waste materials to be used beneficially and in providing a means to supply synthetic wollastonite at a practicable cost. The collaboration between US and Egyptian participants is an important aspect of this research, and graduate students will participate in the effort. Industry involvement will strengthen the applicability of the research, and notable environmental benefits may result.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is funded under the US-Egypt Joint Fund Program, which provides grants to scientists and engineers in both countries to undertake cooperative research.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
