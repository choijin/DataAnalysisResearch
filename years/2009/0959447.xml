<AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this day of modern large telescopes, small telescopes are still actively making significant contributions to our knowledge about the universe and its constituents, from Gamma Ray Bursts at the edge of the universe to nearby stars and solar system bodies.  A consortium of colleges in the southeastern United States has assembled an impressive network of small telescopes spread around the globe under the leadership of Dr. Daniel Reichart of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.  Originally designed for the specific purpose of rapidly following up on "transient events" - sudden changes on the sky due to the explosive death throes of stars for example - their  telescopes are also heavily used by both professional researchers and their students at a number of colleges and universities in the southeast as well as by elementary and secondary educators and their students.  Dr. Reichart and his team are now planning to add new capabilities to the network, providing increased coverage around the globe to monitor our changing skies.  Optical telescopes work best at night of course, so if astronomers want to monitor objects in the sky around the clock, they must have telescopes spread around the world.  To be sure of the coverage, it is also necessary to have multiple telescopes in case the weather is bad at some of the locations.    The National Science Foundation's Major Research Instrumentation program is providing the funding for the new telescopes through its Division of Astronomical Sciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill built the original array of six PROMPT telescopes at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO) in Chile in 2004 and 2005.  After early successes using PROMPT to study distant cosmic explosions called gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), we began an effort to significantly broaden its capabilities and use in 2009.  Leveraging non-federal funding from the Mt. Cuba Astronomical Foundation and European partners, we received an additional $1.8M in American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funding in 2010, which we used to add new telescopes and sites with wide-field optical, lucky optical, near-infrared, near-continuous simultaneous multi-wavelength, and radio capabilities.  PROMPT is evolving from a GRB experiment to a broad-based facility for small-telescope research and education:  PROMPT researchers now publish one peer-reviewed journal article per month and PROMPT educators now serve over 6,000 students per year.    Specifically, we have expanded PROMPT to include:  (1) a new, 32-inch diameter robotic telescope at CTIO, with wide-field optical, lucky optical, and near-infrared imaging capabilities; (2) four new, 17-inch diameter robotic telescopes at Siding Spring Observatory in Australia, enabling near-continuous, simultaneous multi-wavelength observing of southern hemisphere targets, as well as live observing for education and public engagement in the United States; and (3) a 20-meter diameter radio telescope at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) in Green Bank, West Virginia, including the development of a radio version of Skynet, our telescope control and web-based, dynamic queue scheduling software.
