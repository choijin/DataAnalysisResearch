<AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program Professor Daniel Burden and colleagues Brian Hunt, Lisa Keranen-Burden, Peter Walhout and Roger Kennet all from Wheaton College, in collaboration with Dr. John Kasianowicz of the National Institute of Standards and Technology will acquire a suite of instruments (an atomic force microscope, an inverted optical microscope, a Langmuir trough, a patch clamp, and a microfluidic shear flow analyzer) to study soft interfaces at the nanoscale and single-molecule level. The instrumentation will be used to support research activities and education programs in (1) topographical imaging of polyelectrolyte multilayer (PEM) thin films; (2) characterizing diffusion of lipid bilayer membranes on PEM films; (3) probing of ion channels in bilayer membranes; (4) studying the distribution, diffusion and aggregation of toxins in cell membranes; and (5) imaging the response of cell surfaces to shear stress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Soft interfaces are ubiquitous in nature, especially in biological systems.  The microscopy and spectroscopy tools that Wheaton College will acquire with support from this award will allow these young scientists and their students to investigate a number of interesting problems, lying at the interface of physics, chemistry and biology.  Results from this work may lead in years to come to a better understanding of how cells interact with their environment.  The young researchers working with the PIs will receive excellent training in the use of state-of-the-art research equipment.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   We purchased and installed instruments for interrogating soft interfaces at Wheaton College.  Five faculty members from the Chemistry, Biology, and Applied Health Science Departments and one collaborator at NIST led projects using the new equipment, along with a number of undergraduate research students and support staff.  Soft interfaces possess dynamic behaviors at ambient temperatures and often self-organize into mesoscopic physical structures that are complex.  Thus, measurements that correlate both structure and dynamic properties are particularly important. The research areas connected in this proposal center on the theme of biologically oriented interfaces and soft polymer materials. The instruments that were purchased allow preparation and characterization of samples with features that span a range of sizes from the mesoscale to individual molecules (i.e., nanometers to microns).  Intellectual Merit:  The specific research projects made possible by this award include: (1) topographical imaging of polyelectrolyte multilayer (PEM) thin films and correlation to single-molecule diffusion measurements; (2) characterizing the diffusion of lipid bilayer membranes supported on PEM films; (3) probing optical and electrical properties of proteins and ion channels in bilayer membranes that are formed on novel micromachined apertures; (4)  the study of toxin distribution, diffusion, and aggregation dynamics in cell membranes, including toxins from B. anthracis (Anthrax) and S. aureus (Staph); (5) imaging the response of cell surfaces to shear stress and athlerosclerotic chemical stimulants.  Findings from these studies impact a wide range of areas including biochemistry, analytical chemistry, polymer and materials science, cell biology, membrane biology, vascular physiology, biorheology, and the national defense.  To date, three peer-reviewed papers, three national conference presentations, and numerous web-based documents have been published.  See the following link for specific information:  http://www.wheaton.edu/Academics/Faculty/B/Daniel-Burden  Broader Impacts:  A prime driving force underlying the instrument acquisition has been the collaborative involvement of undergraduate research students.  During the award period, more than 12 research students (including chemistry, biology, and applied health science majors) had intensive research experiences on the new equipment. The instruments continue to be used by more than 10 students annually.  We project this rate of usage to continue for the foreseeable future.  Furthermore, the new instruments have helped promote an ongoing collaboration with NIST.  A special programmatic emphasis was given to sustaining our traditionally strong level of participation from female undergraduate researchers.  We began participation in a new outreach program to minority students, entitled the Wheaton BRIDGE (Building Roads to Intellectual Diversity and Great Education).  This program was aimed at providing scientific opportunities for first-generation college-bound, low-income or African-American or Latino students from the Chicagoland area.  Use of the instrumentation in advanced Analytical and Physical Chemistry teaching laboratories expanded the impact of research to many dozens of students each year.
