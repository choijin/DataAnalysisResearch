<AbstractNarration>This award supports US participants of Thematic Program: Dynamics and Transport in Disordered Systems at the Fields Institute in Toronto, Canada in the Spring 2011.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It has been known for a long time that heat flows from hot bodies to cold ones, that differences in voltages generate currents. &lt;br/&gt;Even if macroscopically this is well studied in many contexts, it is not easy to understand these phenomena at the microscopic level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several mathematical models have been proposed for the phenomena. Some of them based on probability theory and some of them are  classical and  deterministic.&lt;br/&gt;In recent times, there has been very good progress in both classes of models the mathematical phenomena discovered are eerily similar sometimes. &lt;br/&gt;The main goal of the special semester is to bring together specialists in both types of models to find common ground and to make sure that there are students who get trained in both points of view.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Many technological devices require to  transport heat or electricity accross materials. In spite of its ubiquity in technology, these are poorly understood phenomena and the only way to design deviced is often to perform expensive experiments. Ocassionally, there are surprises with the discovery of materials that do not fit any of the paradigms. A very notable example of surprising material, is the graphene whose discovery was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2010.  Remarkably, there have been progress in solving questions of transport in very different Mathematical contexts including probability (percolation, large deviations) and dynamical systems (Arnol'd diffusion, statistical laws of averaging). In particular, there was some understanding of the mechanisms that make the Fourier law  (the heat flux is proportional to the difference of temperature divided by the distance). In recent time,there have been models of materials that satisfy it and models of materials that do not satisfy it.     The goal of the program was to bring together mathematicians from different disciplines so that they could exchange information on these topics and coordinate the different points of view.  The program included 3 workshops, graduate courses as well as scientists having extended visits. Related to the program were some distinguished lectures given by Prof. Avila and Sinai sponsored by other sources. The support of NSF was used to allow USA scientists without other sources of funding (specially young scientists) to attend the program.  The program attracted support from a large variety of sources and the participants came from several countries.
