<AbstractNarration>Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) composed of smart sensors interconnected over wireless links are quickly becoming the technology of choice for monitoring and measuring geographically distributed physical, chemical, or biological phenomena in real time. Dynamic WSN environments encountered in environmental monitoring, surveillance, pollution control, and reconnaissance applications, require responsive management of WSN resources and their adaptive allocation to sensing, networking support, localization, and planning tasks, based on user requests and changes in the environment. A specified quality of service should however be ensured for criteria such as resolution of the raw-data, latency, network reconfiguration delay, and resource utilization in the steady-state. This project develops an integrated cross-layered approach to networking, databases, control, mobility management, and information processing in WSNs. In particular, context-aware and energy-efficient solutions are pursued that are based on opportunistic sensing and processing techniques, dynamic indexing structures, novel query language constructs, reactive mobility control algorithms, and distributed compression based routing algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technological advances from this research will significantly simplify the deployment of WSNs and lead to novel context-aware applications. The advances will directly benefit domains such as emergency-response management, environmental threat remediation, and biological habitat monitoring. Apart from developing the required algorithms, the project will implement simulation platforms and a monitoring environment using physical devices. The platforms will provide students with new educational opportunities to actively explore information acquisition and resource management in resource-constrained environments. All project resources will be shared with the public through a project webpage.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project addressed the challenges posed by the deployment and use of networks of fixed and mobile heterogeneous smart sensing devices to factor in competing demands on sensor network resources and their best allocation to sensing the environment and analyzing the sensed data. We developed effective and energy-efficient distributed algorithms for processing spatio-temporal queries with uncertainty in wireless sensor networks and designed novel spatio-temporal multidimensional index structures that adapt to topology changes and support efficient routing and query processing. Our work led to the creation of efficient context-aware application layer routing primitives and medium access control protocols that facilitate mobility and dynamic quality of service for time sensitive messages, while providing energy, delay, and throughput efficiency. Network coding and cross-layer optimization were explored, demonstrating effectiveness in a scenario of broadcasting a common content to a group of cooperating wireless nodes within proximity of each other. We also developed distributed resource allocation and mobility control algorithms that balance event localization, event response, exploration, and routing, and are robust to sensor noise and communication failures. We devised context-aware resource and power-efficient algorithms for important data processing tasks such as data aggregation, using Compressive Sensing to reduce the amount of data communicated and the efficient computation of discrete Fourier transform of data sensed on non-uniform sampling grids.
