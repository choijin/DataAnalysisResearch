<AbstractNarration>Proposal Title: Collaborative Research: Engineering the Morphology and&lt;br/&gt;Microstructure of Group III-V Compound Semiconducting&lt;br/&gt;Nanowires&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of California-Los Angeles&lt;br/&gt;Abstract Date: 08/03/09&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this interdisciplinary collaborative research effort between UCLA and Brown&lt;br/&gt;University is to quantitatively understand the mechanisms governing the growth of&lt;br/&gt;group III-V compound semiconducting nanowire heterostructures and hence develop&lt;br/&gt;strategies to tailor their morphology, crystallinity, and chemistry. Semiconducting&lt;br/&gt;nanowires have recently gained considerable attention owing to their potential for&lt;br/&gt;applications in optoelectronics, nanoelectronics, sensors, energy harvesting, and&lt;br/&gt;energy storage. However, growth of desired multi-component nanowire heterostructures&lt;br/&gt;is difficult due to kinetic instabilities occurring during growth. To address this issue, the&lt;br/&gt;proposed research will combine in situ (as well as ex situ) studies of nanowire growth as&lt;br/&gt;a function of temperature, time, flux, and catalyst composition with&lt;br/&gt;theoretical/computational modeling. Simulated morphologies and structures will then be&lt;br/&gt;compared with experimental observations to quantitatively describe the morphological,&lt;br/&gt;structural, and compositional evolution during the growth of nanowires.&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research will provide a holistic understanding of the&lt;br/&gt;nanowire heterostructure formation and help develop technologies for the fabrication of&lt;br/&gt;advanced functional materials with desired properties. The proposed experimental and&lt;br/&gt;computational methods are general and applicable to investigate (and predict)&lt;br/&gt;nanostructure growth in other material systems as well as other synthesis (eg., solution&lt;br/&gt;phase) methods. The results will be disseminated to enhance the understanding of the&lt;br/&gt;nanowire growth mechanisms. Videos of in situ observations and growth simulations will&lt;br/&gt;be posted on the Web to promote interest in nanoscience and nanotechnology among&lt;br/&gt;the public. Graduate and engineering undergraduate students will benefit through&lt;br/&gt;classroom instruction and involvement in the research. High-school students will be&lt;br/&gt;engaged to provide them firsthand research experience that will encourage them to&lt;br/&gt;pursue higher education in engineering&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
