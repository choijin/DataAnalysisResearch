<AbstractNarration>This project will investigate several research topics on the effects of plasma and neutral gas transport processes on the ionosphere and surrounding regions.  The methodology is based on time-dependent, high-resolution, physics-based theoretical and assimilative models in addition to auxiliary data from ground-based radars and magnetometers, particularly the Poker Flat (PFISR) and Resolute Bay (RISR) incoherent scatter radars.  The scientific problems under investigation pertain to the ionosphere, thermosphere, exosphere, plasmasphere, polar wind, and to coupling mechanisms relevant to these regions.  A focused goal of the project is to better understand the effect of mesoscale plasma structures on global-scale flows using ensemble Kalman filtering of high-latitude ionospheric electrodynamical variables.  Other specific topics include: the atmospheric response to the recent extreme solar cycle phase minimum and to sporadic space weather events; the generation and evolution of ionospheric disturbances; and the climatology of atmospheric waves.</AbstractNarration>
