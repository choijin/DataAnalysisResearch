<AbstractNarration>A backscatter communication enables development and implementation of battery-less sensors, miniaturized (MEMS) robots, or even nano devices. However, the current stat-of-the-art technology limits communication scenario to a direct transmission between active and passive devices, for example in radio frequency identification (RFID) system between a reader and a passive tag. In contrast, the goal of this project is to develop a novel multi-hop network that utilizes backscatter signal as communication for passive, battery-less devices. The objectives of this work include mathematical representation of such passive multi-hop networks and development of novel cross-layer communication protocols and control schemes with learning methodology for beam-forming. The expected contributions include an improved theoretical understanding of the multi-hop network of battery-less devices and a novel cross-layer optimization framework of network protocols that are feasible and practically viable. The end result of this effort would lead into a truly pervasive, backscatter-based networking paradigm.&lt;br/&gt;The proposal?s outcomes include extending the range and improved capabilities of RFID systems to support larger and more complex sensing applications while lowering cost and minimizing environmental impacts (batteries-less operation). Moreover, a set of outreach activities include engagement of women and students from under-represented minorities through Missouri S&amp;T Student Diversity Programs' office and Project Lead the Way (K-12 outreach).  In long term, the outcomes will support various applications of MEMS and nano devices through facilitating a communication and control of such devices, with a potential to transform the healthcare, manufacturing into something that now is considered a science fiction.</AbstractNarration>
