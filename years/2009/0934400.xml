<AbstractNarration>IIP 0934400&lt;br/&gt;University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign&lt;br/&gt;Ruzic&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) iis planning to join the existing multi-university Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) entitled "The Center for Laser and Plasma for Advanced Manufacturing" which was created in 2002.  The center was initially established as a single university center and currently has grown to a multi-university center with participation from the University of Virginia (lead), the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor and the Southern Methodist University.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary focus of the center's research has been in laser applications for advanced manufacturing. Some of the center's research activities have included laser removal of oxides, laser micro-machining of titanium, laser microtexturing, optical sensor for laser welding, micromachining of aluminum alloys and carbon nanocomposites. The addition of UIUC would strengthen the plasma component of the center and bring in a more diverse industrial base. The research at UIUC will cover a wide spectrum of plasmas and plasma manufacturing techniques, and the proposed site's research plan will center around three research thrusts: development of large scale plasma deposition system, directed etching assisted by lasers, and atmospheric plasma induced polymerization.  In addition, UIUC will work towards solving a multitude of research problems in plasma manufacturing that are both near-term and long-term.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The effort at UIUC will broaden the many years of plasma-related research into the rapidly expanding arena of lasers/plasma assisted manufacturing.  The proposed center will offer new opportunities for industry partners as both short term and long term engineering problems are solved. Industry partners can use the technology to develop new markets, improve product quality and performance, and reduce manufacturing costs. The proposed project also provides undergraduate and graduate students the opportunity to collaborate with industry, and expand their problem solving and research skills. Results of the research will be disseminated through publications and presentation in reputed journals.  UIUC also has a postdoctoral plan in place to enhance the post-doc experience.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Plasma-aided manufacturing (PAM) encompasses a vast range of industrial applications, from thin-film sputter deposition, and microcircuit fabrication to plasma spraying, and plasma polymerization. While different kinds of plasmas are being used for different applications, the commercial sector in the past largely depended merely on using the plasma without in-depth understanding of the variety of phenomenon taking place. This trend if continued will result in the advancement of technology only at a diminishing rate. In order to close this gap and make significant advances in plasma manufacturing, there is ever growing need of university/industry collaborative research. And it is for this reason; the Center for Plasma Material Interactions (CPLAM) at University of Illinois, Urbana Champaign (UIUC) was established in collaboration with industries. For the passed thirteeng years CPLAM at UIUC had accomplished several cross-disciplinary projects. More then 20 presentations were presented at top world scientific conferences, 10 articles were published and a patent was filed. More then 60 undergraduate students were involved in the Center related research, several grad students and postdocs have contributed to the successful completing of the Center projects.  Project: HPPMS Magnet Development and Cross-Industry Collaborations  When representatives from multiple companies are together at an IAB meeting, it is natural for the discussions to focus on areas of mutual interest.  There is no better example than this story.  The Huettinger Corporation makes power supplies.  In particular they make a type of power supply used for creating coatings with plasmas, called High Powered Pulsed Magnetron Sputtering (HPPMS).  HPPMS is different than regular magnetron sputtering because the plasma is so dense that it ionizes the metal atoms being liberated from the target.  These metal ions are drawn back to the target causing self-sputtering, and the current soars.  The current rises to 500 Amps, compared to perhaps 10 Amps using a conventional supply.  (See Fig. 1.) The devices is pulsed so the average power still remains in the kW range where cooling keeps the target intact.  The additional metal ions from HPPMS allows superior films to be created.  They have lower stress and smaller grain sizes. For many applications this is essential.  However, the deposition rate is dramatically lower than with a conventional source. Sales of the supplies lag primarily due to this reason. Prof. Ruzic came up with the idea of trying to alter the magnets using in the magnetrons in such a manner as to increase the deposition rate when using a HPPMS supply and presented it to the IAB.   Fig. 2. shows the results from the new "Epsilon-pack" (open symbols) compared to the conventional pack (closed symbols), for power supplies from three of the member companies:  Huettinger, Zond (zPulser) and Applied Energy (pulsed DC)  compared to standard DC sputtering.  Note that the two HPPMS supplyÆs, and particularly the Huettigner supply had a dramatic gain in deposition rate. This work lead to a patent.  Project: Starfire MSWP and the Cross-Site Collaborations.  Starfire Industries is a small company (15 employees, $1.5 M revenue in 2013) located on the University of Illinois Research Park.  Based on ideas generated by Prof. Ruzic through their membership in the Center, they were awarded an NSF SBIR Phase I and II to develop a microwave-driven surface-wave plasma source to manufacture solar cells. This new kind of source has a very lower electron temperature, but a high electron density.  This means the ion energy striking the growing film is significantly reduced, and therefore does not create defects and traps which reduce the efficiency of the solar cell. In addition, this technology allows both a-Si and &micro;c-Si to be created in the same machine at a high rate, thereby dramatically reducing cost.
