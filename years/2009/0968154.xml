<AbstractNarration>The science of thin liquid films has developed rapidly in recent years, with applications to coating flows, biofluids, microfluidic engineering, and medicine. In this project, we will focus on three groups of free-surface flow problems using a combination of mathematical modeling, analysis and numerical simulation, coupled to carefully chosen quantitative experiments. The three areas are: (i) flows driven by surface tension gradients, (ii) the role of inertia in regimes where lubrication is inadequate to model thin film flow, and (iii) vibrating thin films. Advances in our understanding of theoretical issues surrounding modeling these flows, and the exploration of new features of the flows through experiments will have direct applications to improving control and reliability of manufacturing processes in high-tech industries and to biomedical systems.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The flow of thin liquid layers or films occurs in contexts including industrial coating flows, microfluidic engineering, and medicine. In this project, we focus on properties of thin liquid films such as the role of surface tension in driving flow, and the behavior of thin layers under rapid vibration.  Surface tension is an important mechanism in the dynamics of mucus layers in the lung, and is central to the treatment of premature infants by surfactant replacement therapy. The control of thin layer flow, through the temperature dependence of surface tension or using rapid vibrations, has the potential to eliminate damaging nonuniformities in industrial coating processes. Each of these areas and applications pose substantial scientific challenges that will be met with a collaborative effort between mathematicians and physicists, exploring theoretical and experimental methods in tandem. The project includes graduate and undergraduate student training in an interdisciplinary research program that&lt;br/&gt;will develop coordinated advanced skills in physics, engineering, and applied mathematics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major goal of this project was to better understand how surfactants, which are chemicals that lower surface tension, spread on thin viscous films of liquid.  The motivation for this work are biological scenarios, such as the liquid lining in the alveoli of human lungs, or industrial flows in which surfactants are used as cleaners or stabilizers.  The project had several components.  We conducted physical experiments and developed new techniques so that we could simultaneously see how the surfactant and liquid film were moving.   This technique used special fluorescent surfactants.  We also created open source computing code to solve mathematical equations that have been used to model the motion of film and surfactant.  The code works for a variety of mathematical equations, not just the ones most relevant to this research.  Finally we modified the traditional mathematical equations based on evidence from our experiments, because the traditional model was failing to capture the dynamics we observed.  Thus the project was of interest not only to mathematicians, but also to biologists, chemists and physicists, and we presented our work to all of these audiences.  Products of the research included conference posters, talks and research papers, presented by the Principal Investigator and the undergraduate students.  We also developed an outreach activity to explain our work to K-12 audiences.  The activity was published in a journal for teachers and used at Science and Engineering Festivals.  The work performed at Harvey Mudd College was conducted by undergraduate mathematics, physics and engineering majors.
