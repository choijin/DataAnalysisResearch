<AbstractNarration>Computer Science (31) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This collaborative project from the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, Southern Polytechnic State University, and Tuskegee University develops a sequence of two cryptography courses. The first course adopts intensive labs and focuses on understanding the properties and vulnerabilities of various cryptography techniques. The second course challenges students with real-world cases in emerging areas in a collaborative environment. The project develops five teaching modules based on labs and case studies and conducts a detailed assessment of the proposed hands-on learning materials, case studies, and modules. The PIs organize three summer mini-workshops to train faculty members from the three campuses and other universities nationwide on how to use the new courses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project proposes novel pedagogies for undergraduate Cryptography and the hands-on exercises tied with cryptography topics teach students cryptographic algorithms and their vulnerabilities. The designed case studies bridge the gap between cryptographic theory and real-world cryptographic applications in emerging areas. The modules can be used in several courses such as network security or security management.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project facilitates faculty collaboration and development at three institutions in three states Tennessee, Georgia and Alabama. It broadens participations of minority students in Information Assurance due to the leadership of Tuskegee University, an experienced institution in minority education. Dissemination of the generated teaching materials is supported by summer mini-workshops, a dedicated website developed and maintained by the PIs, conference presentations, and journal publications.</AbstractNarration>

This project was able to connect with a broader group of educators with similar background and interests in IA education which enhanced the knowledge base on how to improve student learning in IA more effectively.

This project increased the number of hands-on labs through its funding and support and thus increased the number of labs made available to students.
