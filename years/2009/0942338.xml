<AbstractNarration>Engineering-Other (59)&lt;br/&gt;A growing number of engineering programs have developed innovative educational programs to prepare students to create and deploy low-cost, environmentally and socially beneficial solutions. Often, these programs use experiential approaches to provide students with opportunities to develop technologies that will meet the needs of geographically, culturally and economically diverse customers. This project will provide training and support to faculty who are committed to doing work in this area, but need access to additional resources and a network of people who share a similar vision. The project will develop and offer a workshop to provide faculty with key information and resources to develop, implement, and enhance programs that focus on designing and commercializing breakthrough technologies that address basic human needs and alleviate environmental problems in an economically and environmentally sustainable way. The project addresses several significant needs in this emerging area of engineering education: 1) a mechanism for faculty to share and learn about best practices in educational innovations; 2) a hands-on opportunity to develop curricula and strategies for implementation based on information and feedback from experienced colleagues; and 3) an evaluation of the impact these activities have on teaching and curriculum, including the successes and challenges of implementing educational innovations in the university and in the field.</AbstractNarration>

A faculty development workshop was held in June 2011 on the campus of Colorado State University in Fort Collins, Colorado. Thirty-two attendees affiliated with 18 institutions attended. The four day workshop provided: (a) demonstrations by experienced entrepreneurship and engineering faculty of their educational innovations; and (b) hands-on opportunities to develop curricula and implementation plans with feedback from colleagues. A website was created after the workshop to disseminate related curricular materials (http://nciia.org/node/1649), including case studies of sample student projects, a knowledge map for faculty to identify and share contacts around the globe, and final presentations created by the attendees to summarize their proposed innovations (http://nciia.org/node/1659).
