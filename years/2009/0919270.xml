<AbstractNarration>This proposal will fund the search for neutrino-less double beta decay. The neutrinos are fundamental particles that play key roles in the early universe, in cosmology and astrophysics, and in nuclear and particle physics. Results from neutrino oscillation experiments have provided compelling evidence that neutrinos have mass and give the first indication that the Standard Model of nuclear and particle physics is incomplete. A 1-tonne detector searching for neutrino-less double beta-decay will be about 100 times more sensitive than current measurements and will confirm or exclude the inverted mass hierarchy for Majorana neutrinos. To achieve the ultimately realizing 1-tonne scale detectors using Ge detectors, the Majorana and GERDA collaborations have established a formal cooperative agreement. The collaborations have agreed to share resources and knowledge in their development of detector designs to reach for a Majorana mass sensitivity below 50 meV. This proposal requests support for the design of a 1-tonne-scale Ge experiment. Work will be performed on the engineering, design, simulation, and risk analysis of an apparatus based on two different concepts, one developed by the Majorana collaboration, and the other by the GERDA collaboration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technology of larger, lower-background Ge arrays developed from a tonne-scale neutrino-less double beta decay experiment can be expected to enable a new generation of highly efficient, ultra-low-background gamma spectroscopy measurements. Among the fields that stand to benefit from this new generation of technology are: measurements of anthropogenic radiation in the environment; atmospheric, ocean, and groundwater environmental transport measured via natural isotopic tracers; methods of radioactive dating; reactor monitoring; bioassay for determining very low occupational exposures to radiation; and biological studies involving radiotracers at very low activities. Students and postdocs will be trained in deep underground physics and related disciplines, such as low-background techniques, detector technology, nuclear physics and neutrino physics. An education and outreach program with the Morehead Planetarium on the campus of University of North Carolina will bring this science to the public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

Many theories predict that neutrinos must be such "Majorana" particles, and if so may offer an explanation of why neutrinos have such small masses when compared to the charged leptons and quarks.  Searching for 0&nu;&beta;&beta; decay is an extremely daunting challenge because of the exceeding long decay half-lives of greater than 1025 years!  Any experiment that hopes to discover such a rare decay must both have sufficient mass (~ ton) and take unprecedented steps to eliminate or minimize potential backgrounds from naturally occurring uranium and thorium and their associated decay chain products.  The measurement must also be situated deep underground to shield against cosmic rays on the earthÆs surface that can create cosmogenic activity.  The Majorana and GERDA collaborations are exploring the feasibility of a large-scale, 76Ge-based 0&nu;&beta;&beta;-decay experiment. Germanium is an ideal isotope to search for this rare decay mode, since high-purity germanium (HPGe) detectors are commercially used as radiation detectors for a variety of applications and have properties well suited to searching for 0&nu;&beta;&beta;-decay.
