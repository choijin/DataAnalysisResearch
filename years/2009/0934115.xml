<AbstractNarration>The Partnership for Research and Education in Materials (PREM) between the University of Puerto Rico Mayaguez (UPRM) and the University of Wisconsin (UW) Materials Research Science and Engineering Center on Nanostructured Interfaces (MRSEC) and the Nanoscale Science and Engineering Center on Templated Synthesis and Assembly at the Nanoscale (NSEC) broadens the participation of underrepresented groups in STEM at all levels.  This partnership capitalizes on past and current synergistic research and education collaborations between UPRM and the UW.  An essential aspect of this project is the combination of experiment and theory to elucidate and design novel functional materials at the nanoscale.  Four interdisciplinary research teams focus on the development and characterization of novel materials and processes for innovative applications, such as beta-peptides and poly-beta-peptides, engineered nanoparticles, liquid crystals, and multifunctional nanoporous materials. The applications for this research include development of antimicrobial agents, minimizing the potential deleterious effects of engineered nanoparticles on the environment, development of solid-like liquid crystalline elastomers and gels for chemical and biological sensing and cell-culture applications, and development of nanostructured materials for chemical transformation of sustainable biological feedstocks into fuels and specialty chemicals.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Educational and outreach efforts expose K-12 audiences to state-of-the-art materials science through the use of the Science on Wheels Educational Center (SONWEC), and incorporates creative and proven college-level programs. A demonstrated mentoring program for newly hired faculty is utilized which enhances the retention and success rate of underrepresented minority groups and women engaged at the faculty level.  And with the large number of Hispanic and female undergraduate students in attendance at UPRM, this partnership further increases the incorporation of Hispanics and women in the workforce pipeline leading to advanced degrees in areas related to Materials Science and Engineering and Nanotechnology, consequently significantly broadening participation and building a diverse community of materials researchers. This strategic partnership expands and strengthens UPRM?s educational and outreach innovations to a much broader audience in the US reaching beyond Wisconsin and Puerto Rico. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Wisconsin - Puerto Rico Partnership for Research and Education in Materials [Wi(PR)2EM] strengthened and broadened collaborations between the University of Wisconsin &ndash; Madison (UW) and the University of Puerto Rico (UPR) by leveraging and augmenting the reach of such alliances to develop a formal long-lasting relationship in nanostructured materials research and education.  The Wi(PR)2EM promoted the formation of a strong strategic partnership by fostering and expanding research projects in collaboration with UWÆs Materials Research Science and Engineering Center on Nanostructured Interfaces (MRSEC) and Nanoscale Science and Engineering Center on Templated Synthesis and Assembly at the Nanoscale (NSEC) and by combining research and education expertise found in the participating institutions into truly synergistic groups.  The Wi(PR)2EM developed strong, strategic and sustainable research and education partnerships between the UPR and the UW that broadened the participation of underrepresented groups in STEM at all levels.  These partnerships capitalized on several productive and compelling collaborations between UPR and the UW MRSEC and the NSEC, in synergistic research and education initiatives.  The Wi(PR)2EM brought together a truly unique group of some of the finest, most passionate minds in the partner institutions in a coordinated effort to address problems with enormous potential benefits for society and the environment.  All research teams made significant accomplishments that should help to advance the state of knowledge in engineered materials, which in turn should facilitate the development of transformative technologies that will help cure diseases, knowledge and materials that will insure a cleaner and safer environment, and engineered nanomaterials and processes for the environmentally benign, sustainable production of energy and high value chemicals.  The achievements of our research and education goals are contributing in making a path to finding solutions to some of the nationÆs critical missions such as climate change and energy security.  The assembled research teams comprised ample expertise in the design, synthesis, characterization, modeling and application of engineered nanostructured materials.  We developed and characterized novel materials and processes for a variety of innovative applications that include:  development of antimicrobial agents, development of solid-like liquid crystalline materials for chemical and biological sensing and cell-culture applications, development of nanostructured materials with improved catalytic performance and stability for the chemical transformation of sustainable biomass feedstocks into renewable fuels and chemicals and development of nanostructured materials for the adsorption or catalytic conversion of the greenhouse gas CO2 into fuels.  The partnership strongly fostered the incorporation of Hispanics and women in the workforce pipeline leading to advanced degrees in areas related to Materials Science and Engineering and Nanotechnology, significantly broadening participation and building a diverse community of materials researchers.  A vibrant educational and outreach effort was established to expose K-12 audiences to state-of-the-art materials science, incorporate creative and proven college-level programs, that aimed to recruit, nurture, and retain students from underrepresented backgrounds in STEM disciplines.  The education, outreach, and dissemination activities built upon infrastructure and platforms established through the UWÆs MRSEC and NSEC and the internationally acclaimed Science on Wheels (SONW) Educational Center.  A variety of education and outreach activities were arranged by the Wi(PR)2EM.  This effort includes informal science and engineering education activities such as D&iacute;asNano at the Mall  (over 11,000 participants, almost all Hispanics) and Science Shows; and formal educational activities for teachers and K-12 students such a...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
