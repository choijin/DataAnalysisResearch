<AbstractNarration>Biological Sciences (61). This project is creating a series of low-cost, quantitative laboratory experiments that teach students how to perform investigations using state-of-the-art fluorescent microarray technology; a technology previously not available to large-scale biology courses. The microarrays allow students to conduct inquiry-based investigations exploring plant biodiversity, systematics and evolution. As part of the evaluation process, undergraduate research students are conducting the experiments to ascertain the robustness of all procedures, instructional materials and equipment to ensure wide-scale educational adaptation of this technology. The microarrays and instruction materials are being made available to the larger biology community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is being co-funded by funds from the Directorate for Biological Sciences, Emerging Frontiers Division.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The original goal of the project was to develop resources that would allow undergraduate students to conduct experiments involving fluorescence-based genomic technology.  The strategy used was to develop a relatively inexpensive instrument based on mass-production consumer goods that could quantify microscopic fluorescent objects produced on microarray technology.  A fully functional pototype was created.  However, genomic technology is a rapidly evolving field. The instrument being developed became obsolete.  In response to the changing situation, the fluorescence detection device was modified so students could detect fluorescence of genetically engineered organisms expressing green fluorescence protein.  Another response was to develop instructional materials that integrate the use of an emerging genomic technology.      Next generation sequencing involves using machines that can sequence vast amounts of DNA in a single experiment.  An experiment involving the floating aquatic plant greater duckweed (Spirodela polyrhiza) was conducted that created a data set that allows students to propose ecological questions regarding nutrient cycling and water pollution.  Students can now use supercomputing resources to determine the collection of genes that respond to changing concentrations of phosphorous.  Phosphorous is an essential plant nutrient but is considered a water pollutant when the concentration becomes too high.  From genomic information, student can propose hypotheses and test their hypotheses with DNA technologies.       Last Modified: 10/05/2015       Submitted by: Stokes S Baker]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
