<AbstractNarration>0967466&lt;br/&gt;Thompson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Systems where lean combustion processes are carried out in excess air offer significant fuel efficiency benefits that can contribute to reductions of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, an important byproduct of lean combustion is NOx (x = 1, 2). While cost-effective technologies have been demonstrated for the remediation of NOx produced at stationary sources, solutions for the aftertreatment of NOx produced by mobile sources including diesel powered vehicles remains a major challenge. One of the most significant aspects is that Platinum-containing catalysts are the most effective catalysts for this operation, and the amount of platinum required makes these catalysts prohibitively expensive. In this proposal which calls for collaboration between PIs Thompson from University of Michigan and Schneider from University of Notre Dame, an industrial partner, General Motors, is added to make it a GOALI proposal as well as a Collaborative one. The intent is to resolve why catalytic activity of about the same magnitude as platinum has been observed with a non-precious metal containing perovskite catalyst originally observed by General Motors scientists, and to determine if rugged, inexpensive catalysts can be demonstrated which could in fact replace platinum. This would be a significant change in our understanding of reactions that are catalyzed by platinum, and on a more practical level, would open up the area of diesel-powered vehicles with the improved efficiencies and reduced GHG emissions expected, as less-expensive catalytic after-treatments or mufflers could be available. The program involves the two universities and the industrial partner at many points of contact and in various phases of the work. Students will benefit from the collaboration and from the contact with industry. In addition the PIs will leverage existing education and outreach programs on the campuses to both interest and educate society about the issue and benefits from success in the project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Advances in fuel chemistries and engine designs over the past few decades have helped vehicles operate more cleanly and efficiently, and treating engine exhaust using a catalytic converter is required in the U.S., Europe, and all over the world to meet ever-tightening environmental regulations.  Additional advances are possible with diesel and lean burning engines, however, emissions from the associated vehicles contain significant amounts of nitrogen oxides. The treatment of these nitrogen oxides &ndash; which are toxic and responsible for photochemical smog &ndash; is a particular challenge due to the presence of excess oxygen in the exhaust.  A key reaction is the oxidation of nitric oxide (NO) with oxygen to form nitrogen dioxide (NO2), which usually requires a catalyst containing significant amounts of platinum.  Recently researchers at General Motors discovered that some perovskites are highly active for the oxidation of NO. Perovskite contain relatively inexpensive metals such as La, Mn, and Co, and have the potential to serve as much less expensive alternates to platinum-based catalysts.  While there are reports of the oxidation activities of perovskites, our fundamental understanding of these materials is relatively poor.  To help establish the feasibility of using these catalysts, our team synthesized a series of perovskites, evaluated their performance as NO oxidation catalysts, and characterized key physical and surface chemical properties.  The surface properties of these same structures were simulated using density functional theory methods and correlated with the experimental results.  It was observed that the La-based perovskites with Co or Ni were particularly active materials, and both experimental and simulated results indicated a periodic trend of increased activity as the transition metal increased in atomic number.  Additionally, the substitution of some of the La in the catalyst with Sr significantly improved activity for the cobalt-based perovskites but had little effect on the other types of perovskites. These results will assist in the design of perovskites for NO oxidation.  The project enabled a team consisting of several students, post-doctoral scholars and faculty at the University of Michigan and University of Notre Dame to collaborate with researchers at General Motors and advance our understanding of the surface and catalytic properties of perovskites.  The results have been disseminated to the catalysis and broader communities via several publications and presentations.
