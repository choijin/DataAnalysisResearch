<AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project objective is to commercialize a novel technology for indexing video. The company's approach automatically integrates information from speech, text, and video through algorithms that generate rich semantic indexes for video. The Phase I results show that this approach can be incorporated into a system that indexes video with high accuracy and at a fraction of the cost of currently used methods. Further, during the Phase I research, the company has identified a large and growing consumer market (sports video) in which the technology can be applied.  The technical objectives of the Phase II proposal focus on working with such partners to roll out initial Bluefin-powered applications, such as content-based search and video-enriched fantasy sports. Such applications are currently not feasible because of the low accuracy of automated indexing methods and the high cost of manual approaches to indexing video.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Millions of hours of new video content are coming online every month, feeding an exploding demand and reshaping the nature of the Internet. Just as text-oriented search engines were necessary to empower users to find what they needed during the first phase of the text-centric Internet, a new generation of technology will be necessary to organize and effectively find content in the fast-approaching video-dominated era of the Internet. Bluefin Lab is pioneering a new approach to video organization and search by commercializing cross-modal algorithms developed in Academe. While this differentiated technology can be leveraged in several target markets, the company's initial focus is on sports media where it will power a unique experience for video search, video-enhanced fantasy sports, and other video-centric applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Bluefin Labs is a Cambridge, MA-based social TV analytics company that uses publicly available social media commentary from Twitter, Facebook and blogs to measure viewer engagement with television shows and ads at scale &ndash; historically a costly and complex problem for TV and marketing industries to solve. BluefinÆs technology platform, grounded in 15 years of cognitive science and machine learning research at the MIT Media Lab,[2] semantically interprets peopleÆs social media comments and automatically links them with the TV shows and ads theyÆre watching.  Bluefin Labs was founded by Deb Roy and Michael Fleischman in 2008.  The seed for the company originated within the MIT Media Lab, where Roy is Professor and head of the Cognitive Machines group.  As a student in RoyÆs MIT group, FleischmanÆs PhD work on semantic video analysis garnered the attention of the National Science Foundation which awarded Roy and Fleischman a Small Business Innovation Research grant and effectively bootstrapped the launch of Bluefin. Bluefin Labs uses proprietary algorithms to match social media comments to televised content. The methodology of associating comments to TV is composed of three parts: temporal analysis (looking at when a comment is posted), semantic analysis (matching written comments to whatÆs on TV), and machine learning (the on-going process of training and re-training the matching algorithm). Bluefin also employs a proprietary algorithm for sentiment and gender analysis of the social media comments. The resulting data set is a large network of cause-effect links that measures peopleÆs engagement with TV, effectively creating a viewer/programmer feedback loop. This network is designed to provide marketers and media companies with insights that could be used for more efficient ad targeting and more informed content and creative development. Bluefin calls this mapping of social media commentary back to its televised stimulus the "TV Genome" &ndash; a highly complex endeavor that, like the Human Genome Project, requires immense computational resources along with deep-rooted techniques in cognitive science and machine learning. Bluefin has a view into more than 5 billion public-facing social media comments each month, tied to a continuously growing video fingerprint archive of more than one million distinct airings of TV shows and commercials. Bluefin currently ingests and performs video fingerprinting of 115 U.S. TV broadcast and cable networks. On February 6, 2013, it was announced that Twitter was buying Bluefin Labs for approximately $100 million.
