<AbstractNarration>Steroid hormones have pervasive effects throughout the lifespan for function of the many systems of the body and brain.  It is important to more fully understand how steroids work, given that there are several potential mechanisms for their varied effects.  The traditional and well-characterized view is that steroids have relatively slow actions after binding to intracellular steroid receptors.  However, steroid hormones can also have rapid effects at the cell membrane in ways that have yet to be fully understood.  The purpose of these studies is to investigate how the key hormone progesterone may have actions on the brain and behavior by acting at a potential membrane target, the recently discovered membrane progestin receptors (mPR).  In these experiments, the expression of mPRs in the brain and body and the functional relevance with respect to behavioral endpoints will be determined using rats and mice as models. Subjects will have mPR actions in the brain manipulated to directly investigate the role of mPRs by altering membrane progestin receptor expression or activity in brain regions important for the behavioral effects observed. Because progesterone mediates the important process of reproduction, similarities across species are expected, but differences may reveal specificity in the actions of different mPRs.  The research to be performed is important for understanding of the actions of progesterone, as well as other steroid hormones. This research will also provide for interdisciplinary training of faculty to further develop their skills in behavioral neuroscience and molecular biology. Post-doctoral, graduate, undergraduate, and high school student trainees will work with two excellent scientists in a project exploring an exciting new area of investigation that can lead to breakthroughs in understanding actions of steroid hormones.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Steroids are important growth-enhancing factors that can have a tremendous impact on the body and brain.  Inside of some "target" cells in the body are nuclear steroids receptors, specific to particular classes of steroids.  We are studying actions of progesterone, a hormone that has been implicated in reproduction, anxiety and cognition.  There are nuclear progestin receptors in peripheral areas of the body associated with the female-typic phenotype (breast, ovaries, uterus etc), but also in an area of the brain that is typically considered the master gland, the hypothalamus.  In our lab, we have found that progesterone has effects in another area of the brain, the midbrain, which is involved in reward and reinforcement.  Through actions in this region, there are changes in reproduction and through connections to other areas, the hippocampus and amygdala, changes in cognition and anxiety occur.  The midbrain lacks nuclear progestin receptors, actions of progesterone which typically underlie growth-enhancing effects.   With funding from the EAGER grant, we localized alpha and beta variants of a membrane progestin receptors, which was highly expressed in the midbrain, but not in all areas of the body.  The beta variant of the midbrain progestin receptors seems to be very important in mediating actions of progesterone in the midbrain.  Notably, the expression of the beta variant of the membrane progestin receptor are absent in the body.  This is very promising as we seem to be able to target membrane actions of progesterone in the brain without undue growth-enhancing effects in the body associated with actions of progesterone at nuclear progestin receptors.
