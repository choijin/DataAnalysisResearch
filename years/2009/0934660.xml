<AbstractNarration>This research is a time critical (RAPID) response cruise by a coalition of investigators to investigate a newly discovered explosively erupting undersea volcano in the Northern Lau Basin in the Western Pacific Ocean.  The discovery of actively erupting undersea volcanoes is a rarity and data that addresses many fundamental geological, hydrothermal, volcanic, and biological issues will be collected.  The volcano being investigated is one in which there is an unusual high-intensity hydrothermal plume and explosively erupted volcanic material.  Goals of this work are to document the fauna that colonize the initial stages of back arc volcanism, as well as to sample early stage hydrothermal fluids.  The intensity of fluid flow from the vents will also be examined.  It is likely that novel and previously unknown microbiological life forms associated with these fluids will be discovered.  Work is complementary to data being gathered to the south in an area of intense NSF-funded work (the Ridge 2000 Program).  Broader impacts of the work include graduate student and postdoctoral training, support of a PI whose gender is under-represented in the sciences, use of a novel ROV for undersea exploration, and public outreach through media outlets.  An additional impact is the cross agency nature of the project between NSF and NOAA.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In May 2009 a contingent of scientists, led by Principal Investigator Joseph Resing, witnessed the first ever eruption of molten lava from a submarine volcano in the deep-sea. The researchers, from private and public institutions across the nation, composed a large multi-institution effort to understand this fundamental process of the formation of the oceanÆs crust.  More than 70% of the earthÆs crust is formed in the oceans by volcanic activity in the deep sea, where it is virtually hidden from sight by the overlying ocean.  To conduct this research we used an underwater robot, or remotely operated vehicle, named Jason.  Using JasonÆs cameras we made observations of molten lava flowing across the seafloor,  large red lava bubbles, and massive explosions caused by both the escape of volcanic gasses and the interaction between the extremely hot lava and the surrounding cold ocean. In the deep ocean, however, increasing depth (pressure) mutes the explosive nature of submarine eruptions enough to allow them to be closely approached by research tools like the Jason. This in turn allows for close observations of volcanological processes, and the collection of lavas, fluids, microbes, and other biological fauna. We found that although the volcano was emitting large amounts of acidic and toxic gasses, it still nurtured life in the forms of microbes and shrimp. The scientists also found that the lava type coming from the volcano had never been seen erupting anywhere else on earth. These lavas, called boninite, are found in areas where new subduction zones are forming.  Remarkably, a hydrophone placed near the eruption recorded eruptive sounds for several months prior to arrival, indicating that the eruption was almost continuous.  Additional observations made a year later confirmed the on-going nature of the eruption.
