<AbstractNarration>SMART Utah is bringing 22 professionals with strong mathematical backgrounds and an interest in teaching into the profession in a manner that helps bridge the obstacles in making the transition: bringing the Fellows under supervised mentoring to the level of master teachers, while meeting the needs of districts to increase the number of quality math teachers. The collaborating entities are: the University of Utah Department of Mathematics and College of Education; the Utah State University departments of Mathematics and Teacher Education and Leadership; the Division of Teacher Quality and Licensure at the Utah State Office of Education; Math for America (MfA); the Park City Mathematics Institute (PCMI); and the Jordan, Granite, Salt Lake and San Juan school districts. The bases of the program are: in-depth understanding of mathematical content, connections between various mathematical areas, and connections between mathematics and other disciplines; pedagogical training that is content-driven, flexible and inclusive; permanent professional learning communities in the schools where teachers can continually extend their learning. On these bases, teachers can transmit important mathematical understandings to their students, transforming their classes into learning communities as well.  Through participation in the Park City Mathematics Institute, the Fellows are exposed to current mathematical research and to research in mathematics education as an integral part of their professional development. Through lesson study they undertake building of instruction informed by their teaching practices, and the feedback they receive from both their peers and students. Through the established distance-learning program at USU, with satellite sites throughout the state, the project is impacting  teachers and prospective teachers state-wide. The project interacts with a mathematics education center in San Juan county, serving the Navajo and Ute nations in Utah.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Over its seven year duration, our Noyce SMART alternate route to licensure produced 60 new secondary teachers of mathematics who subsequently achieve level-four licensure in the State of Utah.  45 of those teachers are still teaching mathematics full time in Utah's secondary schools. We view this accomplishment as the foundation on which we are continuing to build a mathematics teacher-leader professional community for public education throughout the step. Building on this foundation, the next step, that we began in 2014, was the creation of a Master Teacher Program on the Math for America model.  Currently we have an initial cadre of 8 Master Teachers invested in mathematics-based professional development with their colleagues in their schools and school districts.  The impact of the investment of the NSF Noyce Program in our proposal was magnified threefold by our partnership with Math for America and with the State of Utah through a three-way matching fund arrangement.  It is our belief that, when everything else has been tried, and the needle has not moved sufficiently, we as a society will direct our full investment to our last, best hope, namely our Nation's teachers. We believe that we are are participating in the preparation for that eventuality.                   Last Modified: 10/04/2016       Submitted by: Aaron J Bertram]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
