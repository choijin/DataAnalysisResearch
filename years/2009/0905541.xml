    <AbstractNarration>From Frames to Events: A Statistical Approach to Activity Analysis in Multi-Camera Systems&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Venkatesh Saligrama and Janusz Konrad, Boston University, MA 02215&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike other sensors, cameras provide excellent resolution, long viewing range,&lt;br/&gt;wide field of view and low latency thus permitting pervasive, wide-area visual&lt;br/&gt;surveillance. However, most network cameras deployed today are simple&lt;br/&gt;capture/compression/transmission devices, at most supporting rudimentary motion&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;detection; all higher-level processing is highly centralized. This centralized&lt;br/&gt;architecture stems from human-centric visual analytics as well as limited&lt;br/&gt;in-camera processing capacity, and is not scalable to large multi-camera&lt;br/&gt;systems. With over 30 million surveillance cameras in use in the United States&lt;br/&gt;today, that produce 4 billion hours of video footage per week, monitoring by&lt;br/&gt;human operators is obviously not sustainable. An autonomous, distributed,&lt;br/&gt;bandwidth-efficient, real-time video analytics system is needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project makes a step towards building such a system. At its core is a&lt;br/&gt;novel statistical framework for activity discovery and analysis that departs&lt;br/&gt;from the centralized model and leverages processing power of camera nodes.&lt;br/&gt;While traditional activity analysis operates at object level, e.g., objects are&lt;br/&gt;identified, tracked, and tested for abnormality, methods under development in&lt;br/&gt;this project employ activity analysis at pixel level. If the abnormal activity&lt;br/&gt;is reliably identified, then object extraction and tracking focus on region of&lt;br/&gt;interest and thus are relatively straightforward, on account of absence of&lt;br/&gt;clutter. In order to reliably identify pixel-level abnormalities, or more&lt;br/&gt;generally activities, a novel event-based video representation is used that&lt;br/&gt;decomposes video into iid samples lending itself to the application of&lt;br/&gt;statistical learning. In order to facilitate multi-camera collaboration,&lt;br/&gt;geometric invariance of dynamic events is exploited thus bypassing the&lt;br/&gt;difficult issues related to 3-D geometry dependent on viewing angles.</AbstractNarration>
