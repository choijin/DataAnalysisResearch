<AbstractNarration>The main goal of this project is to determine through a redesigned pre-service mathematics methods course how prospective elementary teachers become serious learners about teaching of mathematics and student learning of mathematics. &lt;br/&gt;Research Questions - Phase I (Teacher education program)&lt;br/&gt;  1) Are treatment and control interventions implemented as intended during both years of the experiment?&lt;br/&gt;  2) Do treatment-group pre-service teachers' beliefs about mathematics and mathematics learning change to a larger extent than control-group pre-service teachers' beliefs?&lt;br/&gt;  3) Are treatment-group pre-service teachers better able to analyze a lesson taught by others?&lt;br/&gt;  4) Are treatment-group pre-service teachers better able to plan, teach, and reflect on their mathematics teaching than pre-service teachers in the control group?&lt;br/&gt;  5) Do treatment-group pre-service teachers feel better prepared to teach mathematics than control group pre-service teachers?&lt;br/&gt;  6) To what extent do various characteristics of fieldwork and student-teaching experiences impact pre-service teachers' learning from treatment and control instruction?&lt;br/&gt;Research Questions - Phase II (Longitudinal study)&lt;br/&gt;  1) Is retention during the first three years of teaching higher for treatment than for control-group teachers? If participants decide to leave the profession, what are the reasons behind that decision?&lt;br/&gt;  2) Do treatment-group pre-service teachers feel better prepared to teach mathematics during their first three years of teaching than pre-service teachers in the control group?&lt;br/&gt;  3) Do treatment-group pre-service teachers exhibit better quality of mathematics instruction than pre-service teachers in the control group?&lt;br/&gt;  4) Do treatment-group pre-service teachers more frequently seek opportunities to engage in professional practices that focus on improving mathematics teaching, compared to control-group pre-service teachers? Do they more often assume (whether formally or informally) leadership roles that promote practice-based approaches to professional development?&lt;br/&gt;  5) What external factors (e.g., school leadership, available professional development opportunities) during the first three years of teaching support or hinder teachers' adoption of professional practices focusing on improving instruction?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work will be done at the teacher education program at University of California-Irvine and surrounding school districts. The participants in the study will be pre-service teachers in the 5th year program. These teachers will be followed through their third year of teaching. The main STEM field is mathematics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A randomized controlled experiment with a replication group will be conducted over four years that will compare what happens in their first three years of teaching by teachers who have used the Learning to Learn from Mathematics Teaching (LLMT) curriculum. Multiple measures will be used including fidelity of implementation (observations of mathematics methods course); beliefs survey; video-based analysis of a lesson; content and pedagogical content knowledge survey; survey on fieldwork and student teaching experience; retention-in-teaching rates over three years following 5th year program, teacher sense of efficacy scale; and classroom observations (for a sub-sample of participants). Two years of students who are in the 5th year teacher education program will participate in the study. In the first year 90 students will be randomly assigned to the regular methods course or the course with the LLMT incorporated. A second group of 90 students will be included in the study the next year. With the two cohorts of students there will be a pooled sample of 90 in the treatment group and 90 in the control group. In addition, each year, four participants, two from the treatment and two from the control group will be chosen to represent variation in contexts of fieldwork and student teaching experiences. These participants will be followed through the first three years of their teaching career. Case studies will include school and classroom observations and semi-structured interviews. The evaluation will be done by the advisory board. The assessment findings will provide evidence of the efficacy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main outcomes and impacts will be the evidence on a specific approach to have elementary teachers to become more effective in attending to student learning when teaching mathematics. The project has the potential to have the greatest impact on the 90 pre-service teachers who will receive instruction using the LLMT. Their students will be the beneficiaries. More impactful will be the dissemination of LLMT to be used in other teacher education programs and the knowledge gained from the study that can be used to shape other teacher education programs. Graduate students who work on the program will also benefit from engaging in the research study including data gathering and analysis.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ PROJECT OUTCOMES REPORT     CAREER:  Learning to Learn from Mathematics Teaching  P.I. Rossella Santagata     The main goal of this project was to study the impact of an approach to the preparation of elementary mathematics teachers that integrates into a traditional math methods course a research-based curriculum designed to develop specific dispositions, knowledge, and skills for learning from teaching. The Learning to Learn from Mathematics Teaching (LLMT) curriculum was designed to develop pre-service teachers? ability to reflect on their teaching and on the teaching of others in ways that generate knowledge about mathematics teaching and about student mathematics learning. Specifically, this project investigated through a multi-method study the effects of the LLMT curriculum both short term&mdash;on pre-service teachers? learning in the context of an elementary teacher preparation program,&mdash;and long term&mdash;by following them into their first three years of teaching. Two groups of participants were compared: a group who attended a mathematics methods course that integrated the LLMT curriculum into other activities dedicated to mathematics teaching pedagogy and a group who attended a more typical methods course that focused mainly on mathematics teaching pedagogy.     While the development of teachers who are reflective and are capable of analyzing and learning from their daily practice is a goal that most teacher education scholars support, teacher reflection is often conceptualized in rather vague terms, and is limited to unstructured and often unproductive fieldwork-based reflections. The pitfalls of teacher learning from fieldwork experiences have been underlined by many. When first exposed to examples of teaching, pre-service teachers tend to focus on irrelevant features, such as the way the person looks, the sound of their voice, and the gestures they use. Beyond attention to such superficial features, observing classrooms can become overwhelming.  Unless one has a clear goal in mind, classroom observations can easily turn into confused, unstructured notes that are of little use a few days later. It is also unlikely that pre-service teachers will encounter reform-minded practices in the lessons they observe in the field. To the contrary, field experiences may expose student teachers to a limited repertoire of strategies and to a limited and unrepresentative sample of students. Pre-service teachers may easily come to assume that only the strategies they observe are appropriate, regardless of the students they may one day teach. Development of professional judgment, adaptable to differing objectives and student groups, may not be developed through limited field experiences. Finally, because innovative practices are often described in teacher education courses only through abstract terms &ndash; without linking these to concrete images of practices &ndash; pre-service teachers may misinterpret what they observe during field experiences.  They may believe that the examples they observe constitute recommended practice when in fact they do not.  Researchers have found that instructors have difficulty challenging pre-service teachers? analyses of their field placement classrooms because they are unable to be present during those lessons.  Thus discussions are limited to assertions by individual students about what they had observed. Opportunities are lacking for pre-service teachers and experts to develop a shared language to describe innovative and effective teaching practices.     This project took an innovative approach to pre-service teacher learning from practice by:  1.     Utilizing a research-based observation and analysis framework and a focus on specific sub-skills that pre-service teachers need in order to learn from teaching in a disciplined and systematic manner;  2.     Taking advantage of new technologies, particularly of digital video, to ground discussions and reflections on concrete and shared images of teaching; and  3.     Adopting a multi-method approach to the study of teacher learning that combined an experiment with qualitative analyses and case studies of participants? learning experiences.     The study findings provided support for the integration of opportunities to learn to analyze practice and learn from teaching in teacher preparation. On a variety of measures, teachers who attended the methods course that integrated the LLMT curriculum outperformed their counterparts at the end of teacher preparation. Particularly promising were these teachers? beliefs about the central role of student mathematical thinking in a new vision of teaching and their ability to attend to the details of such thinking. Teachers were observed to maintain such focus once they entered the profession. Student thinking served as a lens through which they approached various teaching tasks including reflections on how to improve their teaching practices over time.     In addition to research findings, this project generated two outcomes:     1.     The "Learning to Learn from Mathematics Teaching" curriculum, which includes lesson plans, activities tied to specific pre-service teacher learning objectives, samples of pre-service teachers? work and scoring rubrics, and lists of videos of classroom lessons that can be used to facilitate analyses. This curriculum will be made available to interested researchers and practitioners upon request.  2.
