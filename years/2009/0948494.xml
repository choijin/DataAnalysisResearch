<AbstractNarration>The period between 1.78 and 1.63 billion years ago (Ga) was a time of important southward growth of the North American continent.  The rate of growth within this 150-million-year period far exceeds Phanerozoic (542 million years ago to the present) crustal growth rates. As a result of recent work in southern Wyoming and northern Colorado, in a region known as SW Laurentia, the PIs have identified a deformational, magmatic, and thermal event at 1.62-1.58 Ga, which is surprising because the region was thought to be tectonically quiescent.  The researchers will combine detailed kinematic histories of shear zones in northern and central Colorado, with precise, texturally-linked dates on deformation, and well-dated metamorphic pressure-temperature paths to evaluate two end-member hypotheses where the enigmatic tectonic 1.6 Ga event may represent either (1) intracratonic deformation of the newly accreted continental crust with stresses transmitted far inboard of the active plate margin or (2) deformation associated with delayed subduction of a long-lived remnant ocean basin. The 1.6 Ga tectonism may reflect the closing of this basin and the final accretion at the southern edge of the North American continent.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The recognition of 1.62 to 1.58 Ga deformation, magmatism, and metamorphism as much as 1200 km away from the continent-ocean plate boundary has important implications on several levels. First, the event may have Phanerozoic analogues in the Laramide (80 million years ago) orogeny or the modern Tibetan Plateau. If correct, this hypothesis would suggest rapid stabilization of, and efficient stress transfer within, newly accreted crust of this age. The present midcrustal level of exposure of rocks affected by the 1.6 Ga event affords an opportunity to investigate the crustal stress transfer in the strongest part of the crust. There are also implications for modern earthquake hazards well away from active plate boundaries. Alternatively, if the event reflects closure of a small ocean basin, then the crustal growth process was not a simple north to south progression and indeed was not completed in some of the northernmost regions until after 1.6 Ga. This might also explain some of the anomalous features on recent deep seismic surveys of the region. In either case, results from this study are likely to result in substantial revision of tectonic models for Paleoproterozoic crustal growth, assembly, and stabilization in SW Laurentia.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The time interval between 1.78-1.63 billions of years ago (Ga) was one of major crustal growth and assembly in the southwestern United States.  Prior to our research, the prevailing view was that the culminating event for crustal growth was the 1.654-1.633 Ga Mazatzal orogeny (period of mountain-building and addition of new crust).  Our study shows that geologic processes associated with crustal growth continued until at least 1.58 Ga or 50 million years longer than previously thought.  In addition, earlier studies claimed that the effects of the Mazatzal orogeny extended only as far north as central Colorado (the "Mazatzal Front").  An additional result of our study is that the Mazatzal orogeny was much more widespread than previously thought with deformation extending into southern Wyoming, more than 300 kilometers north of the "Mazatzal Front" as defined by previous workers.  This spatially and temporally "expanded" Mazatzal orogeny occurred at distances of up to 1200 kilometers north of any active plate margin present at that time, and may have been analogous to present-day deformation of the Tibetan Plateau, which is a a consequence of the collision between the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates.  This study supported three Masters students, all of whom are currently working in the petroleum industry.       Last Modified: 09/14/2014       Submitted by: Ernest M Duebendorfer]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
