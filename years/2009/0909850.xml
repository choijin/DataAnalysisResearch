<AbstractNarration>The goal of this research project is to advance knowledge about student and faculty perceptions of connection to community as factors in academic engagement. The three phases of this research will mold basic research results into applied strategies for improvements in engagement in higher education STEM environments. The first phase is a tool development phase which will provide a valid tool box for evaluating target constructs (engagement, participation, affect, cognition, etc.). Three data collection tools will be developed: student surveys, student focus group protocols, and faculty interview protocols. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second phase focuses on addressing the following research question: What connections to community are contributing to significant differences in academic engagement? and How do institutional characteristics mold the classroom experience toward increased community? Surveys will be administered to students and focus group and interviews conducted with students at five different post-secondary institutions. Data will be analyzed within and across institutions to gauge the effects of higher education institutional characteristics on student affect, perception, cognition, sense of belonging, engagement, and participation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, the third phase emphasizes applying results to develop strategies by which successful community-building characteristics of the various participating institutions can be transferred elsewhere. In all phases, the research team brings a broad range of diversity of expertise and institutional fabric to the proposed study. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Five different types of institutions are represented in this effort: Research 1 (University of Washington), Comprehensive (Minnesota State), Master's L (Simmons College), Private, Faith-Based (Seattle Pacific), and HBCU (Tuskegee). Each of these institutions has unique historical strengths for undergraduate education; this research will improve understanding of how these strengths impact connections to community via mediating engagement and subsequently predicting student learning. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Studies suggest that Americans are becoming increasingly isolated from family, friends, and other social networks.  Yet, the importance of community, belonging, and relationship has not lessened.   On the contrary, psychological research has continued to underline the importance of community and relationship in building stronger, more stable lives and social structures.  In nurturing and producing the next generation of workers and leaders in the United States, colleges and universities have a special responsibility to not only value the role that community plays in students' academic success, but also to understand how to strengthen community among more diverse students.  This project, entitled "Connection, Community, and Engagement in STEM education", has investigated the value of and the means to influence community and belonging among students in STEM fields at five higher education institutions across the United States using surveys, classroom observations and interviews.  Our results have shown that belonging connects to and predicts academic engagement among students.   Other research, in turn, has connected academic engagement to a wide variety of positive academic outcomes, including persistence, GPA, and fulfillment.   STEM is of particular interest because students in engineering and science fields tend to spend more time in their studies than other majors (which may limit the amount of time they have to benefit from community) and are entering fields which are likely to experience workforce shortages in the near future.   Not surprisingly, it is local connections to peers and faculty in the student's world that are most consistently associated with the student's academic engagement and also predict future engagement.   Despite the intense work demands and time constraints of engineering, science, and related fields, students find the time to participate in both academic and non-academic extracurricular activities and do so very strategically.  For example, a student may participate in a community outside of the major in order to facilitate a sense of belonging to the university, meet self-esteem needs, or relieve stress and stem anxiety associated with major studies.   Similarly, students strategically choose academic communities such as study groups and design project competitions to benefit from the social learning opportunities available only as students work and study together.   Overall, however, non-academic communities enhance engagement for less confident students the most while academic communities serve that purpose for the most confident students.      In addition to studying belonging, this study also looked closely at the role of faculty support in student engagement.   The role and influence of faculty cannot be understated.  It is not only linked directly to student engagement but is also indirectly linked to engagement through its connection to belonging.  Strong faculty support is associated with both better engagement and stronger sense of belonging.   What faculty do this year also predicts how well students will engage next year but this relationship differs by institution.  What faculty do outside of a course seems to be more influential at a larger, more research focused institution, while what they do inside of class seems to be more influential at smaller and more teaching-focused colleges and universities.  Regardless, what faculty do and how students perceive what they do has a significant and rich impact on students' academic experience.    Finally, this project has shown how complex relationships among support, belonging, and engagement are.   Many of the project outcomes vary by institution and the large amount of qualitative interview data from the project provide evidence that institutional culture is the underlying reason.  While the complexity of relationships among support, belonging, and engagement may make generalizations impractical, the importance of belonging is consistent ac...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
