<AbstractNarration>Natural history collections contain millions of bee specimens documenting the geographic ranges, temporal occurrence patterns, and floral associations of the 20,000 described bee species.  This project will digitize and consolidate specimen records from 10 bee collections across the United States.  The investigators will make or verify species identifications, capture full label data, georeference and error-check localities, and upload this information to publicly accessible databases.  Web-based tools will be used to capture data across collections efficiently, validate bee and plant names through automated comparison with taxonomic authority files, and synthesize data on species pages with images, digitized literature records, and other information about bees and their host plants.  Data will be uploaded to the Global Biodiversity Information Facility and to Discover Life (www.discoverlife.org), a website that features customizable global maps for all global bee species and dynamic identification keys for North American species.  To obtain information needed to conserve and manage pollinators, the investigators will work with ecologists to model geographic and temporal trends in bee populations in relation to environmental variables.  Bees are the most important pollinators of the approximately 1/3 of crops that require animal pollination.  Recent declines in honey bee populations highlight the need to understand better the roles of native bees in agricultural and natural systems.  This project will help predict risks to bees and their pollination services from climate change, habitat loss, and other factors.  The outreach program Bee Hunt (www.discoverlife.org/bee) will educate the public, including students in underserved communities, about bee diversity and the importance of pollination services.  Using digital photography and rigorous research protocols, Bee Hunt will empower people at biological field stations, nature centers, parks, schools, and other sites to collect high-quality data to augment information from specimen records.</AbstractNarration>

A robust status assessment for pollinators has been identified as a top scientific priority and requires compilation of comprehensive and accurate baseline data on bee occurence and floral associations. The Collaborative Databasing of North American Bee Collections Within a Global Informatics Network project uses open-source web-based tools (fig. 1) to capture specimen label data from historical and recent bee specimens residing in ten North American bee collections, disseminates these data to the public through maps and species pages on biodiversity portals, and to researchers to serve as the basis for diverse peer-reviewed research publications.</p> <p>The project used web-based tools to initiate or expand databasing at ten bee collections in multiple states from California to New England, leading to compilation of more than 1,000,000 bee specimen records with worldwide representation (fig. 2) and intensive coverage of all regions of North America (fig. 3). All project records were integrated and displayed on online global maps together with more the 2,000,000 additional bee occurrence records from other global datasets (fig. 4). Our primary biodiversity portal Discover Life works with project leaderrs to develop innovative tools to dynamically error-check all records to ensure reliability, e.g., that all taxonomic names match authoritative checklists and that geographic coordinates are consistent with reported localities. Once validated, specimen records are used by project participants and diverse partners as the basis for conservation assessments, taxonomic revisions, faunal surveys, maps in identification guides, and analyses of the response of bee populations to global change. Occurrened data assembled by the project has been a major source of data for IUCN Bumble Bee Working group status assessment and was also the main principal source for statistical analyses comparing the response of bees and their host plants to climatic warming and providing the first assessment of historical changes in the bee fauna of the northeastern United States. Project data corroborated severe declines of certain bumble bees, including socially parasitic species, while demonstrating persistence of many other bees, including many native pollinators of crops. To track the establishment and dramatic increase in exotic bee species data capture for these from both their native and introduced ranges was prioritized. To date, species pages with maps and synonyms have been assembled by project leaders for nearly all of the world's 20,000 bee species, and georeferenced specimen records have been captured for more than 7100 bee species worldwide and for more than 1200 bee-flower associations.
