<AbstractNarration>Founded on ethnomathematics research findings, this project--a collaborative research and development effort between Pacific Resources for Education and Learning and the University of Hawaii-Manoa--aims to increase the mathematics learning of first-, fourth-, and seventh-grade elementary school Micronesian students. Plans are to develop and field-test culturally and linguistically sensitive grade-level curriculum units in specific mathematics topics, such as number and counting, division of whole numbers and fractions, and elements of geometry, focused on the indigenous mathematics learning experiences of eight distinct islands in the Pacific region. A team of mathematicians, mathematics educators, mathematics teachers, graduate students, curriculum and assessment experts, and quantitative and qualitative methodologists will develop and implement approximately 24 curriculum units (8 for each grade level).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The hypothesis that inclusion of indigenous ways of knowing into the mathematics curriculum may enhance students' NCTM standards-based mathematics learning and meaning making drives the proposed scope of work. Thus, the main research question is: Does knowledge of recovered culturally based mathematics significantly improve indigenous student scores on standardized mathematics tests at grades 1, 4, and 7? The specific setting of the study comprises eight islands included in the Federated States of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Palau, and American Samoa. Participants include 2,304 first- , fourth- , and seventh-grade students: 24 experimental and 24 control groups, two of each grade level on each of the eight U.S.-affiliated islands of the Pacific region. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Qualitative data gathering strategies, such as interviews with local informants, teachers, and students; and classroom observations are used to document indigenous ways of knowing, mathematical content, assessment practices, and cultural practices. Quantitative data gathering and interpretation strategies using pre-and post-test scores, as well as scores from standardized assessments, will include statistical analyses to determine the effect of the curricular units on participating students' grade-level mathematics achievement. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The evaluation plan comprises both formative and summative components, including implementation evaluation and progress evaluation. Grade-level curriculum units, three publications on findings, a professional development model for teachers through graduate courses, and a cadre of masters' and doctoral degrees in mathematics education are among the main products of this effort.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Can the mathematics embedded in day-to-day culturally-based activities of Pacific Islands communities (such as building local-style houses, weaving mats and cloth, or preparing food for festivals) contribute to young studentsÆ success in learning classroom mathematics? This was the central question addressed by Project MACIMISE ("Math and Culture in Micronesia: Integrating Societal Experiences"). Building upon two previous NSF-funded projects designed to promote math education in the underserved US-affiliated Pacific Islands (USAPI), and informed by recent insights from the field of ethnomathematics (the study of the relationship between math and culture), MACIMISE had three principal objectives:  1)          Conduct research to elucidate the mathematics embedded in culturally-based activities in Pacific Islands communities.  2)          Develop culturally-based week-long math learning modules for local grade school students.  3)          Assess the impact of the math learning modules on studentsÆ math interest and performance.  MACIMISE was administered by Pacific Resources for Education and Learning (PREL) in collaboration with the College of Education at the University of Hawaiæi (UH). Twenty-two math educators from the 10 USAPI jurisdictions (Palau; Guam; Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands; Federated States of Micronesia: Yap, Chuuk, Pohnpei, Kosrae; Republic of the Marshall Islands; American Samoa; and Hawaiæi) were enrolled in MasterÆs or Doctoral degree programs in math education at UH. Using the virtual classroom platform "Blackboard Collaborate," instructors based in Guam and Hawaiæi met weekly with the students, who were widely distributed across five time zones in the Pacific Ocean. Additionally, all the students and instructors met face-to-face for three intensive week-long summer institutes during 2010-2012 in different Micronesian island locations.

In consultation with local experts and knowledge holders, the 22 math educators researched and wrote descriptions of culturally-based practices in their communities that contain embedded math concepts, within four general domains of local knowledge:  1)          Two-dimensional designs: examining objects such as hand loom-woven cloth, painted or design-stamped tapa cloth, traditional tattoos, and beaded necklaces for aspects of symmetry, pattern repetition, counting, and order.  2)          Three-dimensional constructions: analyzing objects such as local houses or canoes for aspects of geometry, ratios, and design principles.  3)          Language: understanding the classificatory distinctions embedded in vernacular counting systems, or math concepts expressed in local stories and songs.  4)          Social ceremonies: understanding aspects of counting, quantity, comparison, and equivalence embedded in social activities involving collection and redistribution of food or other quantifiable resources.  Building on their coursework and field research, the math educators developed 23 culturally-based math learning modules designed for grades 1, 4, or 7. Fourteen of these were successfully piloted by teachers in island classrooms, and six were selected for further testing, using either a quasi-experimental treatment/control design, or...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
