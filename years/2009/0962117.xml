<AbstractNarration>University of California-Riverside doctoral student Kohanya Ranch, with the guidance of Dr. Anne Sutherland, will undertake research on how revitalization movements affect American Indian political and social influence. The overarching research questions are: How do indigenous, legal, political, and scientific perspectives differ, how are those differences negotiated, what are the outcomes for stakeholders, and what role do revitalization movements play?  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will be conducted in southern California where there is a large concentration of Chumash American Indian tribes. Research methodologies will include participant observation in arenas of indigenous cultural reclamation and policy negotiation; interviews with stakeholders; and analysis of archival materials including newspaper articles and legal documents. Social network analysis will complement these methods by empirically mapping informational and relational ties in indigenous policy and revitalization networks.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This research is important because it will pioneer an application of social network analysis to theorizing the outcomes of stakeholder negotiation. The results of the research will also have practical policy implications. Funding this research also supports the education of a graduate student.</AbstractNarration>
