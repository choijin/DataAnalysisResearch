<AbstractNarration>Funds are provided to reconstruct the &amp;#948;26Mg of seawater by measuring it the &amp;#948;26Mg of pelagic carbonates across the Cenozoic. PI's preliminary results show similar patterns in &amp;#948;26Mg at sites in both the Pacific and Atlantic Ocean sites. However, some of the observed changes in &amp;#948;26Mg are too fast and too large to be compatible with the current understanding of the geochemical magnesium cycle. To refine understanding of magnesium isotope variability in pelagic carbonates the PI will also make magnesium isotope measurements on individual species of planktonic foraminifera and other size fractions of the bulk carbonate sediment as well as in pore fluids. These measurements will provide important new constraints on the potential effects of diagenesis. The PI will also pursue alternative approaches to reconstructing the &amp;#948;26Mg of seawater using fluid inclusions in evaporite minerals. The work will help elucidate the processes that control the major element chemistry of seawater, and therefore the global carbon cycle and climate, on geologic timescales. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research has the potential to make a broad impact on our understanding of the chemistry of the ocean, particularly with respect to the geochemical cycles of magnesium, calcium, and carbon. In addition, the proposed activities may help elucidate a better understanding of the causes of climate change over the Cenozoic by better constraining factors that affect the carbon cycle over this timescale. The research will support the training of a graduate student who will be exposed to a range of approaches including mass spectrometry and numerical modeling.</AbstractNarration>

This climatic change is attributed to a decline in atmospheric CO2, whose causes are hotly debated, and is associated with an increase in the ratio of Mg to Ca in seawater. A two- to three-fold increase in Mg/Ca over the Cenozoic observed in a variety of records of ancient seawater chemistry, including fluid inclusions in halite, deep-sea pore fluid profiles, the mineralogy of inorganic marine cements, low temperature calcium carbonate veins in oceanic crust, and biogenic carbonates. Similar co-variation between seawater Mg/Ca and climate, observed on hundred million year timescales throughout the Phanerozoic (the so-called æaragoniteÆ and æcalciteÆ seas), suggest fundamental connections between the global carbon cycle and the major element chemistry of seawater.     Exactly how climate and seawater chemistry are linked is not well understood. One set of hypotheses for this link invokes changes in seafloor spreading, which can alter both rates of silicate weathering (through changes in CO2 outgassing) and rates of hydrothermal circulation and basalt alteration. Another set of hypotheses invokes eustatic sealevel driven changes in the carbonate system, through changing the rate of shallow water carbonate deposition and dolomite formation or the rate of carbonate weathering.     This proposal funded new measurements of the Mg isotopic composition of carbonate sediments and their associated pore fluids.  We used these observations to argue for a novel hypothesis for a direct link between the rise in seawater Mg/Ca and the cooling of EarthÆs climate over the Cenozoic: the effect of cooler ocean temperatures on the Mg sink in low temperature marine clays.
