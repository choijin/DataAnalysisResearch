<AbstractNarration>The importance of gelatinous zooplankton in marine systems worldwide is increasing.  In Southern Ocean, increasing salp densities could have a detrimental effect on higher predators, including penguins, fur seals, and baleen whales. The proposed research is a methods-develoment project that will improve the capability to indirectly assess abundances and distributions of salps in the Southern Ocean through acoustic surveys. Hydrographic, net tow, and acoustic backscatter data will be collected in the waters surrounding the South Shetland Islands and the Antarctic peninsula, where both krill and salps are found and compete for food. Shipboard experimental manipulations and measurements will lead to improved techniques for assessment of salp biomass acoustically. Experiments will focus on material properties (density and sound speed), size and shape of salps, as well as how these physical properties will vary with the salp's environment, feeding rate, and reproductive status. In the field, volume backscattering data from an acoustic echosounder will be collected at the same locations as the net tows to enable comparison of net and acoustic estimates of salp abundance. A physics-based  scattering model for salps will be developed and validated, to determine if multiple acoustic frequencies can be used to discriminate between scattering associated with krill swarms and that from salp blooms.  During the same period as the Antarctic field work, a parallel outreach and education study will be undertaken in Long Island, New York examining local gelatinous zooplankton. This study will enable project participants to learn and practice research procedures and methods before traveling to Antarctica; provide a comparison time-series that will be used for educational purposes; and include many more students and teachers in the research project than would be able to participate in the Antarctic field component.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Project Outcomes:</strong> The goal of this project was to use hydrographic data, net tow collections of animals, and acoustic backscatter surveys to assess the abundance and distribution of salps (a gelatinous zooplankton) in the Southern Ocean and investigate their role in the ecosystem. Two six-week field seasons in Antarctica were conducted in November-December in 2010 and 2011 aboard research vessels in the South Shetland Islands and Western Antarctic Peninsula. Poor weather and rough sea conditions limited the number of workable days at sea during both years, however complete surveys of the SSI and WAP regions were able to be conducted. The most challenging aspect of the project was a dearth of salp organisms during both field seasons.  As a result of the limited number of salps caught in net tows in both years, additional zooplankton organisms were studied. The major findings of this project are: the abundance and distribution of Antarctic zooplankton including salps is highly variable with differences occurring across small areas and short time periods; the collection of morphometric and material property information about these animals can improve acoustic estimates of their abundance and distribution; acoustic instrumentation that is currently on NSF's Antarctic research vessels can be used in a qualitative and semi-quantitative way to sample the abundance and distribution of some zooplankton taxa in some situations. Additionally, hundreds of students (ranging from primary to secondary to undergraduate) have been exposed to this research project's goals.  Data from this project are used in undergraduate classes to help students learn how differences in environmental conditions in Antarctica may be related to the success of different types of organisms. This information may be applicable to predicting how zooplankton in the Southern Ocean may respond to the increasing warming of the Western Antarctic Peninsula region. Teachers who participated in a workshop as part of this project were better able to locate and understand polar science and climate change educational resources and were more confident in their ability to teach this material in their classrooms.</span></span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/29/2013<br>      Modified by: Joseph&nbsp;D&nbsp;Warren</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
