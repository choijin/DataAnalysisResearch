<AbstractNarration>This project addresses core elements of an information base, key system components of a Knowledge Plane for the future Internet.  Today the Internet network management functions are decreasingly available or capable of solving our networking problems.  We find a confluence of:  current network management being a human based ?cottage industry? limited to individual administrative boundaries; and networks becoming increasingly more pervasive and central in users? lives.  In the context of tussles among policies, there is a need for extensibility and distribution, and the necessity for controlled sharing and exchange of information, the Knowledge Plane is a proposal for a new component of the network architecture to provide self-knowledge, self-analysis, self-prediction, and self-repair as much as possible.&lt;br/&gt;An important component is the substrate in which information is collected, placed, made available under policy control and accessed under that same policy control. This work is taking the first step focusing on features the enable  the ability to make information available, a scoping approach to allow for scalability to the size of the Internet, the ability to declare an interest in information (rendezvous), delivery of that information under policy control.  There are further central aspects that are left to future work including: efficient rendezvous mechanisms, truly efficient information distribution and delivery, trust expression, and information location management.  The contribution of this work is that the information base is critically important to measurement and monitoring required to insure that the future network infrastructure highly available. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The work achieved under this grant was the next stage in the development of the concept and demonstration of a Knowledge Plane for the network, taken large. The challenge posed by the original Knowledge Plane paper was whether and how one might make "the network" self-knowledgeable, self-managing, self-improving, and self-repairing. The problem is that the Internet as we know it is organized into completely autonomous regions, typically called "autonomous systems", partitioned both by organizational separation of responsibilities and technical separated. In addition, the Internet was not designed for management. In current networking, functionality is broadly separated into two "planes", data and control, with the idea that one designs separately for controlling how the network resources are used from the actual use of the resources. The Knowledge Plane authors proposed a third plane for knowledge and management.  This project is the second of two focused on the issues of what it would take to actually create a knowledge plane. In the first, we focused on a set of questions about how one might reason about the issues of managing the network, when the information was often (1) widely distributed, (2) often incomplete or partially hidden for a variety of reasons, (3) sometimes perhaps intentionally misleading for either malicious or simply business reasons, and (4) scaled up beyond anything that anyone does today, both monitoring of behaviors can now happen everywhere and all the time. In this effort, our second, we have focused on how to build the underlying information plane that will support the reasoning and computation addressed in the first project.  In our proposal to do this work, the challenge facing us was how to have information collected everywhere, often not available for centralizing even if one wanted to, but more importantly not centralizing because that would be impossible under the conditions we expect. Thus, the information must stay "close to home", and only be accessed or transported if and when it is needed. During our work on the first project, a group of novel network architecture projects were created, under a premise we now call "information centric networking".

This is achieved in part based on the ideas and technologies developed in other NSF funded network architecture projects.  This second project has included 10 students over its lifetime including 6 graduate students and 4 undergraduates. The PI is a woman as were 6 of the students. One student is originally from Puerto Rico.             Last Modified: 11/27/2013       Submitted by: Karen R Sollins]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
