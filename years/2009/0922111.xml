<AbstractNarration>The emergence of novel infectious diseases is a serious societal problem. This project will improve understanding of the emergence of novel virus pathogens by testing predictions of the ecological and evolutionary theory for the origin of species.  A central premise is that the emergence of novel infectious diseases can be attributed to ecological change, particularly changes in the ecological interactions within and between species. The project's aims are to (1) determine whether competition for hosts promotes the origin of novel host-use strategies, (2) determine whether such competition also causes divergence in host-use strategies between viral populations, and (3) investigate the effect of such divergence on the movement of genes between viral populations.  The research is unique in studying experimentally the entire process by which new species arise, from the initial divergence of newly emergent viruses to the eventual formation of reproductive isolation between emergent and source virus populations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop an experimental model system, an RNA virus that infects bacteria, for studying the role of ecological interactions in the emergence of new infectious diseases. Graduate and undergraduate students will receive interdisciplinary training through participation in the research. The project includes outreach and education for K-12 students, their teachers, and the public. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).</AbstractNarration>
