<AbstractNarration>The Dynamic Geometry in Classrooms project, led by faculty at Texas State University San Marcos, is conducting repeated randomized control trials of an approach to high school geometry that utilizes dynamic geometry software and supporting instructional materials to supplement ordinary instructional practices.  It compares effects of that intervention with standard instruction that does not make use of computer drawing tools. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basic hypothesis of the study is that use of dynamic geometry software to engage students in constructing mathematical ideas through experimentation, observation, data recording, conjecturing, conjecture testing, and proof results in better geometry learning for most students. The study tests that hypothesis by assessing student learning in 76 classrooms randomly assigned to treatment and control groups. Student learning is assessed by a geometry standardized test, a conjecturing-proving test, and a measure of student beliefs about the nature of geometry and mathematics in general.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;Teachers in both treatment and control groups receive relevant professional development, and they are provided with supplementary resource materials for teaching geometry. Fidelity of implementation for the experimental treatment is monitored carefully. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Data for answering the several research questions of the study are analyzed by appropriate HLM methods.  Results will provide strong evidence about the effectiveness of dynamic geometry methods in high school teaching, evidence that can inform school decisions about innovation in that core high school mathematics course.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Dynamic Geometry in Classrooms project was funded to investigate the efficacy of a technology-rich, inquiry-based instructional approach to teaching high school geometry.  Its intellectual merit is grounded in this being the first study to use an experimental design with large numbers of participants to measure geometry learning over multiple years. Prior to this research, the promise so many scholars wrote about and investigated on dynamic geometry software had never been rigorously examined using a combination of an experimental design and qualitative in-depth interviews and observations.   After project team planning and an initial professional development for participating teachers, an experimental study was launched over two years with two groups of classes: a control group taught by teachers using what was called a "business-as-usual" approach and a treatment group implementing the dynamic geometry approach.  Participating teachers were randomly assigned to the two groups. The dynamic geometry approach made extensive use of interactive computer software for geometry to allow teachers to facilitate learning through explorations, experimentations, and inquiry.  The Geometers? Sketchpad was used in this project.  Several measurement instruments were developed to assess the critical variable of student geometry achievement as well as other important variables such as students? abilities to make conjectures and understand proofs, students? and teachers? beliefs about geometry, and teachers? ability to use technology and implement the dynamic geometry approach.  The first experimental year (2010-2011) included 64 classes (31 control, 33 treatment) with 1,221 high or middle school geometry students. The second year (2011-2012) involved 76 classes (36 control, 40 treatment) with teachers from the first year of the experiment and 1225 new students. All participating classes were in schools from five urban school districts in the Central Texas area.  The successive years of experimentation allowed the project team and participating teachers to improve all aspects of the study with particular attention to refining the measurement instruments and ensuring the integrity of implementation of the dynamic geometry approach.  The broader impacts of this investigation include data gathered from the study that were analyzed over the final four years leading to numerous published articles and book chapters, professional conference presentations, and technical reports addressing the key findings of the investigation as well as the many important lessons learned about research methodology and teacher professional development.  The key finding was evidence that students learning geometry using a dynamic approach at the high or middle school level experienced significantly higher achievement test scores on a geometry post-test than did comparable students learning using a traditional approach.  Also, students in classes using the dynamic approach demonstrated higher scores on a test of conjecturing and proving than did counterparts from traditional classes.  Findings also established the effectiveness of a professional development model for preparing teachers to apply the dynamic geometry approach successfully in geometry classes. Qualitative analyses of the process by which teachers develop into those who can effectively implement the dynamic geometry approach and of the thinking used by students when using dynamic geometry also provided valuable insights to guide both teaching and learning of geometry.   Students and teachers from participating districts, most of which serve urban economically disadvantaged populations, benefitted from innovative instruction, quality professional development, and technology resources.  Permanent software licenses were provided to all participating schools, and control-group teachers were provided with post-study instruction to help them implement the dynamic geometry approach. Student gains in problem solving, mathematical reasoning, and proof were measured and documented and teachers? ability to address these critically important mathematical processes were effectively fostered and developed.   Research findings in peer-reviewed venues appeared in the Handbook of Research on Transforming Mathematics Teacher Education in the Digital Age as well as in numerous peer-reviewed journals and national and international conference proceedings. Four articles for practitioners appeared in journals including those of the National Council of Teacher of Mathematics.
