<AbstractNarration>This program establishes a scholarship program for computer science graduate students specializing in information assurance. Upon graduation, the students participate in two years of federal service. The program of study is a dual-track masters program, leading to either a master's degree in computer sciences or an interdisciplinary master's degree with specialization in information security. Students in both tracks receive special attention in seminar and advising sessions to help them understand the context and role of information security in today's society. This includes regular presentations by leaders in commerce, academia, and government. Students have the opportunity to participate in leading-edge research projects conducted by faculty. Through this program students receive a valuable educational background in information security and assurance, obtain hands-on research experience, gain perspective on industry and research trends, and provide valuable service to the government while experiencing real-world problems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ There is an urgent need for highly-trained individuals capable of working in the field of cybersecurity and cybercrime prevention.  The training for these individuals is complex and specialized.  Graduate studies in this field may be expensive to undertake.  As a further concern, students who complete studies in this field are often unwilling to work for the Federal government, either because of issues of low pay, or lack of awareness of possibilities.  The Scholarship for Service program addresses these concerns.  It provides a multiyear fellowship and tuition to students pursuing a degree at a university with a recognized program in cyber security.  Upon graduation, the student is required to work in a Federally-supervised position for a fixed minimum number of years to "pay back" the fellowship.  Purdue University, in association with its well-known CERIAS center, was one of the first universities accredited and awarded a Scholarship for Service grant.  There was a record of successful education and placement of students through the program.  When the original grant expired, one student was still in classes and needed additional time to complete his degree.  This grant was to provde additional funding and time for the remaining Masters student to complete his studies and receive his degree from Purdue.  This done through our recognized degree program for cyber security specialists.  The student did, indeed, finish his degree with distinction, and immedately began employment with a Federal agency in the Washington, DC vicinity.  That concluded the scope of this award.
