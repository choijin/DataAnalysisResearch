<AbstractNarration>The proposed research and educational project focuses on time dependent creep deformation of mixed ionic electronic conducting (MIEC) perovskites at room and elevated temperatures. Because a basic understanding of the origin of the time dependent creep is not currently available for lanthanum cobaltites, manganites, chromites, ferrites, and other MIEC conductors, we propose to study creep as a function of external load, loading rate, time, temperature, domain wall mobility, as well as materials composition, crystal structure and grain size. Both experimental and modeling research is proposed to study the mechanisms of time dependent creep deformations, to define driving forces responsible for the phenomena, and to develop new strategies that will allow minimizing the effect of time dependent deformation in MIEC perovskites. A fundamental understanding of time dependent creep in MIEC perovskites is of major importance for further successful development of highly reliable and precise devices such as sensors and actuators, or different electrochemical devices where linear, time independent mechanical output is desirable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The present research program provides an ideal basis for Mechanical and Materials Engineering students to actively participate in project-based learning. Integrated research and educational activities include outreach to a diverse group of high school students and research opportunities for undergraduate students. Graduate students will be involved in research, presentations at technical meetings, and will mentor undergraduate and high school student researchers. Special efforts will be made to attract underrepresented students to pursue their careers in materials science and engineering through high school outreach and undergraduate research.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The structural deformation mechanisms of mixed ionic electronic conducting LaCoO3 based perovskites has been studied by in-situ neutron diffraction and micro-Raman spectroscopy both at room and high temperatures. The domain wall movement under applied compressive stress has been studied and an expansion of pure LaCoO3 under uniaxial compression during constant load creep experiments was detected. The elastic anisotropy of LaCoO3 and La0.8Ca0.2CoO3 ceramics developed under applied uniaxial compressive stress was analyzed. The mechanisms for development of elastic anisotropy as a function of applied stress as well as a function of the strain rate were proposed. A significant stiffening of pure LaCoO3 perovskite was discovered in 700-1000oC temperature range, where Young&rsquo;s modulus of the material increased almost 70% being measured as 66-70 GPa at room temperature and 112-116 GPa at 800-1000oC, while Young&rsquo;s modulus of La0.8Ca0.2CoO3 perovskite exhibited expected softening behavior being measured as 130-135 GPa at room temperature but decreased to 60-65 GPa in 800-1000oC temperature range.
