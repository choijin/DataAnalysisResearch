<AbstractNarration>Using a clustered randomized control trial of 44 secondary schools in the greater Philadelphia area, the project is researching the efficacy of a learning and assessment system that emphasizes students' attaining proficiency or better on a limited set of high value learning objectives in Algebra.  The study allows for and expects students to resubmit assignments and be reassessed until they achieve proficiency or greater. In this new classroom dynamic, students assume more responsibility for and be active agents in their own learning. For their part, teachers will adopt instructional strategies and techniques that support their students' ongoing and continuous learning, including defining learning outcomes, providing frequent and individualized feedback, and participating in professional development.  Based on six years of beta-testing, the model has demonstrated great promise for raising academic achievement and reducing dropout rates by increasing students' engagement with important mathematical content.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study's research questions are: 1) Does the use of proficiency-based assessment and reassessment of learning outcomes (PARLO) in Algebra lead to increases in secondary students' achievement and engagement in mathematics? 2) Does PARLO lead to increased student interest in pursuing more complex mathematics or science courses?  Two cohorts of ninth grade students are being followed.  While the system is being implemented only in ninth grade Algebra classes, student achievement data is being collected in grades 10 and 11 for all students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will result in a refined assessment system as well as published papers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Proficiency-based Assessment and Reassessment of Learning Outcomes System (PARLO) project helped teachers design high-valued learning outcomes, evaluated students on a proficiency-based scale, and allowed for resubmissions for full credit in a variety of modalities to foster student agency and success. The study was a cluster randomized controlled trial design of 29 schools in the Greater Philadephia area, with randomization done at the school level to simulate a naturalistic environment of implementation.  The randomization was stratified by cohort (whether the school began in the first year vs. second year of the study) and public/charter/parochial.  Students were 9th grade algebra and geometry students.   The main research question of the PARLO study was "Does the use of a  proficiency-based assessment and reassessment of learning outcomes  (PARLO) system lead to increases in high school studentsÆ achievement  in, engagement in, and attitude towards mathematics?"    Achievement:  There are three methods that were used to assess student performance -  content tests (in Algebra and Geometry), high stakes state tests, and  teacher interviews.  Analysis of the content tests was done using  hierarchical linear models (HLMs) with student nested within teacher nested within schools (as verified with an unconditional  means model).  Students in PARLO increased their rate of answering  questions correctly on the content test 5% more compared to the control  group (PARLO students increased by 13%, from 32% to 45%, whereas Control students increased by 8%, from 29% to 38%),  which was a statistically significant difference (p=0.03).  When  controlling for potential confounders, the results were  similar (6% increase, p=0.02).  On the high stakes test (PSSA), the PARLO schools improved more than the Control schools -  Control schools went up 2.1% and down 3% in terms of percent students  proficient or better for the two cohorts, respectively, whereas PARLO  schools went up 10.9% and 8.3%, respectively.  However, these school-level summaries are influenced by numerous factors outside  the specific control of the PARLO research study and also include all  students at the school, not just those in the PARLO study, therefore,  direct attribution to the PARLO study cannot be made.  Additional explorations and sensitivity analyses for these  data are ongoing (KK &amp; NL insert teacher interview findings about  students learning here).     Engagement:  (Qualitative)    Attitudes:  Student attitudes were examined used the Attitudes Towards Mathematics  Inventory.  In our study PARLO students went DOWN by 0.11 more on  enjoyment (p=0.04), 0.07 more on motivation (p=0.19), 0.04 more on value  (p=0.42), and 0.08 more on self-confidence (p=0.053).  These are based on the HLMs as  described above.  (Add qualitative results here).     The project produced the PARLO Tracker, an online monitoring system that teachers used to track their studentsÆ progress in achieving proficiency or better on a set of learning outcomes aligned to the stateÆs math standards.  This software was accessible to students and parents.  It is housed on a secure server and teachers, students and parents must log in to view a studentÆs progress.
