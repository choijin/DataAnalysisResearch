<AbstractNarration>The foreign-born share of the U.S. population has risen to almost a record proportion, 12.6 percent in 2007.  Immigrants to the U.S. increasingly are settling outside California and other traditional gateway states. In the last 20 years, immigrant populations have grown rapidly in the South and Midwest, regions that previously had been relatively untouched by the upswing in immigration that began half a century ago.  Population growth in these areas stemmed from natural increase but more importantly from the in-migration of the native born.  The credit-fueled boom that drew many immigrants to these new locations now has fizzled.  Migration behavior also has changed.  Fewer people (both immigrants and native-born) are migrating across state lines.  Immigration also has slowed.  Some states that had experienced rapid population growth now are facing population declines.  This research project will document the settlement patterns of foreign-born immigrants within the country and compare them to the native-born population.  The investigators will look specifically at US-born and foreign-born migration systems within the U.S. and are especially interested in analyzing how these two systems change over time, with a particular emphasis on the economic crisis of 2008-2010.  They will compare the movement of immigrants within the US with movements of U.S.-born people in the context of the recent recession, with special emphasis given to determining whether foreign-born and U.S.-born workers respond to labor market signals in the same way.  The investigators will test the hypothesis that immigrants will migrate within the U.S. in response to local economic crises in ways much like U.S.-born workers, leaving areas of high unemployment for areas with better job prospects.  They also will seek to determine whether immigrants will be more reluctant to leave immigrant enclaves and that they will be drawn to these enclaves when they do move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By examining how migrants respond to the pull of enclaves of people from the same ethnic group and the geography of employment opportunities, by considering how these responses vary by skill and education level as well as by ethnic group, and by considering how migration behavior may differ in more recent economic hard times from what occurred in the generally prosperous era of the 1990s, the investigators will address a core theoretical tension between the geography of labor markets and ethnic enclaves as drivers of migration systems.  The project's intellectual merit of this research will result from the measurement of their effects on immigrant internal migration across the economic cycle.  Positive broader impacts will include the frequent and timely release of information on the evolving settlement geography and employment of immigrants during this recession and its aftermath through both scholarly and more applied media.  The project also will provide education and training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students and a postdoctoral researcher.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our projectÃ†s broad goal was to understand the relationships between immigration, immigrant settlement patterns, internal migration and the labor market during a severe economic contraction and recovery period  in the context of a longer running trend in which internal migration is in decline.      These relationships are important because they help us understand how workers and labor markets adjust to economic pressures, such as rising employment or unemployment and changing economic structures.    The US has traditionally had high migration rates relative to other advanced economies and workers have migrated from regions with poor economic prospects to places where those prospects are better.  During the economic restructuring recessions of the 1970s and early 1980s, for example, many US workers moved from rustbelt to sunbelt states as the former contracted and the latter boomed.  Immigrants also moved into the country, generally complementing these flows and creating an additional source of labor for the long boom that occurred from the early 1980s through to 2007 (punctuated by mild slowdowns in the early 1990s and 2000s).      Our project explored how these relationships may have been changed by the economic contraction that began in late 2007.   Unlike the 1970s and 1980s, migration rates are now lower and there is no clear booming region for people to move to.    Our results show that those who move still choose locations where employment prospects are greatest but that certain trends established in the 1990s and early 2000s may have been disrupted.  Specifically, the dispersion of immigrants out of traditional gateways, such as New York and California, to new destinations, such as Georgia and North Carolina, has slowed down.  The situation has been made more complicated by the growth of state and local immigration policies.  Immigrants who are most vulnerable to these restrictionist policies are adjusting their location within the country in response to them.  This means that the geography of immigrant settlement in the US is adapting to the new economic geography of opportunity post-recession and to the geography of political and cultural attitudes and policy responses to immigration.      We are continuing to explore these labor market and settlement geography trends for immigrant workers in particular sectors, such as construction and STEM, and comparing their employment and migration outcomes relative to US born groups.  The evidence suggests that immigrants in sectors that have experienced significant job loss, such as construction, have fared better than US born workers.  Specifically, the rate of job loss for immigrants was smaller than for US born workers.  How this translates into immigrant employment growth post-recession is not clear yet but it does appear that the recession further cemented the enclave advantages of some immigrant groups in some sectors.
