    <AbstractNarration>The first FASEB Conference on NAD Metabolism and Signaling will be held on June 21-26th, 2009, in Carefree, Arizona. Beyond its well known functions, recent discoveries have demonstrated that nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is consumed in a wide variety of regulatory pathways, synthesized from unanticipated vitamins and intermediates, and processed to novel regulatory metabolites with unanticipated activities. This meeting is the first of its kind to bring together the numerous scientists from diverse areas of NAD controlled enzymatic processes. Over 100 scientists will participate in this conference. Recent discoveries have made clear the need to understand the complete metabolome of NAD. This conference will assemble diverse investigators from all areas of biology and biological chemistry that address this important field, providing a comprehensive platform for exchange of ideas and establishment of collaborations. Topic areas include biochemical/cellular pathways of enzymes including sirtuins, glycohydrolases, ADP-ribosyl cyclases, and NAD kinases. The meeting will provide fundamental and interdisciplinary background and training in areas including metabolism, enzymology, signaling, cell biology, and physiology. The invited speakers are recognized for their scientific excellence and contributions to cutting-edge discovery. Sessions include some content overlap to encourage attendance throughout the meeting. Discussions will emphasize integration of current knowledge to develop an overarching systems biology view of the NAD metabolome. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed conference brings together experts from a wide variety of disciplines and backgrounds. Genuine efforts have been made to be inclusive of women and underrepresented groups. Five of the nine sessions are chaired by women scientists who are also well represented among the speakers. A dedicated effort has been made to provide opportunities for young investigators to network and present their work, including the selection of several to highlight in 15 minute talks. NSF Funding will be used to support young investigators.</AbstractNarration>
