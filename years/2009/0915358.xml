<AbstractNarration>Quality Education for Minorities (QEM) Network, a non-profit organization, has been instrumental in improving the education of under-represented groups that have been undeserved historically by the nation's educational system. As an agent for change, QEM continues to develop effective strategies for broadening STEM participation, and focuses on issues and barriers that prevent minorities from receiving a high quality education. This project supports internship opportunities for students at the National Science Foundation as a mechanism to: increase students understanding of science policy; develop the potential of future leaders and proponents for STEM participation, including students from low-income communities; and promote the continuation of STEM interests and studies through the doctoral level. Complimentary to the internship experience at NSF, students are required to engage in a science-oriented community K-12 outreach activity during the following academic year at their respective institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

Each year, the award enabled undergraduate and graduate students majoring in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) fields to be placed at NSF where program officers mentored them. At the Foundation, interns gained in-depth exposure to NSFÆs policies, programs, and funded projects as well as conducted research that contributed to the FoundationÆs mission. SSIP serves as a mechanism to: increase internsÆ understanding of science education policy and how it is formulated and carried out; enable them to learn how national STEM programs are implemented; develop their potential as future leaders and proponents for broadening participation in STEM; and promote the continuation of their STEM interests and studies through the doctoral level.  Since 2009, 26 students have participated in QEM NetworkÆs ten-week science-policy internships. Each year, the ten-week summer program began in June and ended in August.  Interns attended meetings and seminars focused on science policy, conducted research, and worked with program officers to analyze and prepare reports on various STEM programs.

The interns also participated in professional development activities in the NSF Summer Scholars Internship Program.

QEM used both qualitative and quantitative data to assess how well the Internship Project was meeting its objectives. NSF program staff and mentors provided ongoing feedback.
