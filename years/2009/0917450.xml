<AbstractNarration>The University of Minnesota is partnering with several nature centers in the Midwest to transform citizen "technicians" into citizen "scientists." The Driven to Discover project will use existing citizen science programs with strong educational components to engage 12-14 year old youth and their adult mentors in authentic research.  The goal of the project is to develop a training model for adults who work with youth in a variety of informal education settings to involve them in authentic scientific inquiry via citizen science rather than just data collection activities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the proof-of-concept phase, teams consisting of 4-H youth, adult leaders, and several scientists are conducting participatory action research to understand what factors lead youth to full engagement in ecological research. In phase two, project personnel are training 4-H educators, naturalists, and teachers how to engage youth and their adult leaders in other 4-H programs and other informal education programs to conduct ecological research with scientists in advisory roles. Phase one involves approximately 10 adults and 70 youth, whereas phase two involves approximately 40 adults and 300 youth. A front-end study defined the project's target audiences and partners. Formative evaluation study will monitor interactions among members of the research teams and summative evaluation will measure impacts on participants' knowledge, skills development, attitudes, and behavior. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project deliverables include youth-generated ecological research findings, web-based program implementation materials, an annual conference, and a model for engaging youth groups in informal settings in authentic scientific inquiry.  The model is expected to impact more than six million youth nationwide.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Driven To Discover Project Outcomes Report  The University of MinnesotaÆs Driven to Discover project (D2D) was inspired by the growing number of individuals engaged in citizen science. The development team&mdash;research scientists, Extension educators, and youth development experts&mdash;built this project on the premise that citizen science programs provide opportunities to expand participant knowledge of and engagement in the content and the process of science.

Driven to Discover (D2D) achieved its goals to help adult leaders gain the knowledge and skills needed to mentor youth to become citizen scientists and contribute data to citizen science databases. Importantly, they also gained the necessary knowledge and experience to mentor their young team members through the process of asking and answering their own scientific questions about birds and monarch butterflies. However, the level at which the teams achieved the goals differed and various team characteristics, summarized below, affected project success.   The strongest predictor of meeting program goals was the adult leaderÆs ability to mentor youth through the process of science investigation. Leaders with lower understanding of the subject matter of their program, but who were strong youth mentors, were able to provide this mentoring. However, adult leaders who were less able to engage their youth teams with science in a positive way, even if they had moderate or strong science backgrounds, struggled to meet the program goals with their youth. Skilled adult leaders engaged their youth in self-directed learning and their own inquiry projects. Adult leaders with a background in formal education or non-formal natural science education were able to mentor their youth through the science investigation process more easily than those with background only in leading youth clubs or activities.   The program setting and group context affected project sustainability. Programs with the most potential for long-term sustainability were school/teacher associated programs, community centers (e.g., 4-H), and natural resource education centers. Other key elements included youth recruitment abilities, youth retention abilities, and adult leader retention. Successful recruiting programs established connections to youth interested in science through linkages such as home-schooling networks, environmental centers, informal education programs linke...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
