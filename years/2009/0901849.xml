<AbstractNarration>ECCS-0901849: High Resolution Magnetophoresis Using Multilayered Magnetic Nanodisks&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to demonstrate that a high resolution magnetic multiplexed bioseparation can be achieved by using multilayered magnetic nanodisks as labels. This new magnetophoretic approach allows a continuous separation of sub-100 nm sized magnetic nanodisks according to their distinct magnetic properties.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The proposed multilayered nanodisks, consisting of two magnetic layers separated by a non-magnetic layer with two capping layers, can provide a wide-range tunability of magnetic properties, which results in two important advantages over commonly used superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles: opening up the new possibility of magnetic multiplexing and filling the superparamagnetic nanoparticle size gap, from 30 nm to 200 nm, to provide high-moment magnetic labels for bioseparation. In a microfluidic arrangement, these nanodisks will be subjected to a magnetic field varying with time in a triangle wave format. Nanodisks with different saturation fields can be continuously separated. Since magnetic properties of labels and magnetic fields are exactly known, the whole separation process can be easily modeled, which will provide us a convenient tool to optimize conditions for different kind of separations. &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Separation is an important part of any biochemical analysis. The proposed separation method mimics widely-used electrophoresis, but replacing electric field with magnetic field. Magnetic field does not interfere with biological process and materials, and can be applied externally without physical contact between magnet and any liquid. Magnetic forces are independent on ionic strength, pH or surface charges. It can be seen that this proposed approach, if successful, will provide an important alternative for bioseparation. Moreover, it can introduce valuable multiplexing into many highly sensitive detection methods for biosensing. Both of these will have a broad impact in many biological and biomedical research fields. Also, this project offers an outstanding venue to integrate research activities with the education and training for college and graduate students in nanobiotechnology, which is considered as one of the most potentially valuable technologies for U.S. in the global economic competition and for national security. Three experiment modules will be created for a new practicum approach on undergraduate nanobiotechnology teaching; ?experiment-oriented just-in-time teaching?. In addition, through three existing summer camps at UT Arlington, several hundreds of K-12 students will be exposed to this research. Among them, about thirty percent are Hispanic students. The students will certainly be affected positively and may spark their interest in science and engineering.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
