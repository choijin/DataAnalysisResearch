<AbstractNarration>The World Health Organization estimates that 2.4 billion people worldwide are without access to sanitation.  The social cost of poor or inadequate sanitation is significant.  Disease related to poor water, sanitation, and hygiene is the leading cause of death in children in the developing world and reduces the quality of life and economic opportunities for millions of adults.  Health concerns do not strongly motivate people in poor countries to build latrines at home, however.  Even when latrines are subsidized and built, people do not use them.  There is a critical need to identify and understand the reasons people decide not to build or use latrines, and by contrast, the factors that lead to latrine use and maintenance.  This CAREER award will support research that aims to identify the international policies, socioeconomic factors, and environmental conditions that influence the building and use of latrines in rural India, where an estimated 360 million people live without access to toilets.  Sanitation projects directly depend on land and water resources.  The investigator will collect data on environmental conditions (e.g., access to open land or running water) that support existing practices and their locations.  The research project will explore latrine use and non-use as complicated by social and spatial norms.  The investigator will use an iterative, mixed-method approach, including the use of quantitative methods to link socioeconomic and geographic factors with latrine building at the national scale.  These analyses will inform the selection of four separate sites in rural Indian villages where interviews will be conducted with residents and community leaders.  Systematic analysis of extensive ethnographic data will seek to explain the complex factors influencing the uneven distribution and use of latrines at village and household scales. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will generate fundamental insights regarding the factors that influence the use of different forms of sanitation by residents in developing regions.  Through a multi-scalar exploration of the everyday practices of people, this project will advance knowledge about household-scale adoption or rejection of sanitation interventions.  As such, the project may help provide practical solutions to the global sanitation crisis by determining the socio-economic, environmental, and geographic factors that influence the willingness and ability of communities to use latrines.  The project also will provide valuable education and training opportunities for students in the U.S. and India, and it will provide information for public health educational activities in the study areas and elsewhere.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>An estimated 2.2 billion people worldwide lack access to adequate sanitation; 647 million of these people live in India. Billions of dollars flow into funding latrine building and sanitation education campaigns globally. Not least of these is the Clean India Mission, which will spend US$31 billion to make India open defecation free by 2019. However, policymakers, practitioners and scholars still do not comprehensively understand why people do not build latrines, and why they continue to defecate in the open, even when they have latrines at home.</p> <p>The Indian states of Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, and Uttarakhand were included in this study. In each state, at least three villages were chosen from regions where the number of households with latrines was low. Over four 8-week periods, no fewer than 60 interviews of one hour were taken across the study sites. American and Indian graduate students, NGO workers, and postdoctoral researchers were trained in qualitative field methods and ethics. Together in teams lead by the PI, they collected data on the environmental conditions in the villages, and interviewed adult men and women about their habits, feelings, and beliefs regarding open defecation and latrine use. After interviews were completed, graduate students and postdoctoral researchers engaged in data analysis, report preparation, and results dissemination at conferences, workshops, and meetings with government officials.</p> <p>The research fills a knowledge gap in both the discipline of Geography and the professional Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene sector on sanitation as a human-environment relationship. For rural people living in the Indian countryside, livelihoods are primarily agricultural, sewerage is absent, and water access may be seasonal or sporadic. Building latrines, and using them sustainably, means working within these environmental constraints and maximizing opportunities so that latrine units are affordable, convenient to use and to clean, and hygienic.</p> <p>The study used both quantitative and qualitative methods, and analysis of early data informed later periods of data collection. To date, it has enabled key contributions addressing 1) the particular problems of sanitation for remote communities; 2) the importance of access to land and water for latrine usage sustainability; and 3) the role that caste, class and gender play in the adoption of sanitation and successful drinking water governance.</p> <p>First, the study found that in remote places, distance from urban centers was a key obstruction to the construction and maintenance of latrines. Remote communities prioritized acquiring basic services like electricity, roads, health care, and schools ahead of latrine building. The study concluded that it is necessary for governments to provide the same services to citizens that live in remote places as they do for citizens living closer to centers of political power. When these amenities are available, latrine adoption may follow.</p> <p>Second, sustainable latrine usage, in locations around the world, depends on access to water and the ability to empty latrine pits when they fill. Through the cases of failed latrine-building interventions in rural India, the research demonstrated that each of these interventions failed due to local political struggles over: access to natural resources (water); technologically appropriate infrastructure (latrine design); and access to subsidies (for building). Attempts to curtail open defecation failed because elite families thwarted latrine-building interventions in an effort to maintain their power.&nbsp;However, new housing developments were being built on nearby open defecation grounds, leading many villagers to predict that they would soon be building latrines.</p> <p>Third, unequal social relationships like caste, class and gender can undermine adoption of sanitation and successful drinking water management. Latrine building interventions often focus on women as those who want to use latrines the most, and this is often true. However, household-level relationships between women and men may work in favor, or against, the family&rsquo;s ultimate decision to build a latrine. In villages where caste tensions were high, resources necessary to build and use latrines were insufficient for poor, lower caste families, while rich, upper caste families spent their own funds to build elaborate latrines.</p> <p>A graduate course on the findings of this research was developed for the Department of Geography at Texas A&amp;M University. The research also informed an undergraduate course on Regional Geography of South Asia, created by the PI. Additionally important, a global campaign of results dissemination has involved stakeholders from the World Bank, the Water Supply and Sanitation Collaborative Council (UNOPS), and the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, among others. Findings have been presented at national and international meetings, conferences, and workshops to engineers, economists, anthropologists, public health scientists, as well as practitioners, government officials, and donors. Dissemination has focused on how a geographic, human-environment approach adds new insights and practical solutions to understandings of open defecation and sanitation adoption.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/30/2017<br>      Modified by: Kathleen&nbsp;O'reilly</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/0956022/0956022_10017178_1504133137451_TalkinginRajasthan--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/0956022/0956022_10017178_1504133137451_TalkinginRajasthan--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Interviewing in Rajasthan"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/0956022/0956022_10017178_1504133137451_TalkinginRajasthan--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Interviewing in Rajasthan"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Village women ask O'Reilly about herself and the research.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Kathleen O'Reilly</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Kathleen&nbsp;O'reilly</div> <div class="imageTitle">Interviewing in Rajasthan</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/0956022/0956022_10017178_1504131990313_schooltoilet--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/0956022/0956022_10017178_1504131990313_schooltoilet--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Village School Toilet"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/0956022/0956022_10017178_1504131990313_schooltoilet--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Village School Toilet"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">A public school toilet in Uttarakhand (India).</div> <div class="imageCredit">Kathleen O'Reilly</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Kathleen&nbsp;O'reilly</div> <div class="imageTitle">Village School Toilet</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/0956022/0956022_10017178_1504132232030_plantedfieldamongfallow--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/0956022/0956022_10017178_1504132232030_plantedfieldamongfallow--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Agricultural Terracing in Uttarakhand"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/0956022/0956022_10017178_1504132232030_plantedfieldamongfallow--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Agricultural Terracing in Uttarakhand"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Terraced fields, showing some that are planted and others that are fallow, as Soumyajit Das, research assistant, looks on.
