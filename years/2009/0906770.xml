<AbstractNarration>ID: MPS/DMR/BMAT(7623) 0906770       PI: Kisailus, David     ORG: UC Riverside&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Structure-Function Analysis of an Ultra-hard Biological Composite&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTELLECTUAL MERIT:  There is a need for new light-weight structural materials with high strength and durability that are low-cost and recyclable. Nature has evolved efficient strategies, exemplified in the mineralized tissues of numerous species, to synthesize materials that often exhibit exceptional mechanical properties. These biological systems demonstrate the ability to control nano- and microstructural features that significantly improve the mechanical performance of otherwise brittle materials. One such example is found in the hyper-mineralized combative dactyl club of the stomatopods, a group of highly aggressive marine crustaceans. This ultrahard organic-inorganic composite structure is capable of inflicting significant damage following impact with a wide variety of biomineralized structures (e.g., mollusk shells, crab exoskeletons, the skulls of small fish). This project combines expertise in a number of areas including biologically inspired materials synthesis, structural characterization, mechanical testing, solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, protein-mineral interaction modeling, and a thorough knowledge of the biological system to be studied. Using these approaches, the project will investigate the structure-property relationships of the hyper-mineralized stomatopod dactyl clubs and elucidate the primary toughening mechanisms of these unique composite materials through the following potentially transformational investigations: (1) A detailed, three-dimensional map of the nano- and microstructural features, with specific mineral composition and phase information. (2) A complementary mechanical investigation of the regional structures. (3) In-vitro mineralization experiments to understand organic-inorganic interactions that control mineral composition and phase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACTS:  This strongly interdisciplinary research has the potential to enable significant progress in the emerging fields of nanotechnology and nanomanufacturing by exploiting control mechanisms established by nature to make novel materials and devices exhibiting paradigm-shifting properties. By investigating the structure-property relationships of these unique impact-tolerant mineralized structures using modern chemical, morphological, and mechanical characterization techniques, the long-term aim will be to develop the necessary tools for the design and fabrication of cost-effective and environmentally friendly engineering materials that mimic the various design elements and performance properties present in biological systems.  The PI, a new faculty member at UC Riverside, has demonstrated an ability to attract a diverse group of students to his lab.  Of the six graduate students, three are female.  He has 12 undergraduates working in his lab, including four females, four Hispanics, and two African Americans.  The co-PI has an equally strong record in attracting a diverse group of students. The UC Riverside campus is noted for its success in attracting underrepresented minorities to a Research I environment and seeing them complete their studies successfully.  Encouragement of undergraduate research is an important component of this success, and both PIs are making strong contributions. Although not required of proposals submitted prior to January 5, 2009, the proposal describes a clear and effective plan for training of the postdoctoral who will be trained on the project.  The PI has also described plans for involving high school students and teachers from the diverse community surrounding the university in his research.  A web camera set up in the Kisailus lab will enable students in local and more distant high schools to observe the stomatopod rearing facilities and the experimental research as it progresses.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

Modern representatives can reach lengths of nearly 40 cm, although most species are significantly smaller (e.g., 15 cm). To the casual observer, they superficially resemble heavily armored caterpillars and the group is best known for their complex visual systems, their solitary nature, and aggressive hunting strategies. In stomatopods, the second pair of thoracic appendages is highly modified and specifically adapted for powerful close-range combat. The dactyl modifications (the terminal segment) of these appendages divide the group into those that either hunt by impaling their prey with spear-like structures or those that smash them with a powerful blow from a heavily mineralized club. This robust hammer-like composite structure is capable of inflicting significant damage following impact with a wide variety of heavily mineralized biological structures (e.g., mollusk shells, crab exoskeletons, the skulls of small fish, and the occasional weary fisherman). Significantly, many of these prey items represent model systems for the study of tough and damage tolerant biological materials and investigation into their micro- and nano-architectural features have provided critical insight into the design of robust synthetic analogs. This observation highlights the unique structure and impressive performance of the stomatopod dactyl club, and the important lessons that can be learned from its investigation.&nbsp;We report a comprehensive study of the structural complexity and mechanical properties of the dactyl clubs of Odontodactylus scyllarus, a common reef-associated stomatopod from the tropical Indo-Pacific. As described by Patek et al., these formidable structures are capable of accelerations to 10,400 g and speeds of 23 m/s from a stationary position. Their rapid strike can generate cavitation bubbles between the appendage and their prey, with the collapse of these bubbles producing significant stresses at the contact point, in addition to the instantaneous forces upwards of 700 N resulting from the direct impact. Despite these significant loads, the dactyl clubs are extremely damage tolerant and are able to withstand thousands of highly energetic blows.&nbsp;Our studies show that the stomatopod dactyl club represents a significant departure from previously studied damage tolerant biological composites, in that it is specifically employed for high velocity offensive strikes. Our structural investigations coupled with nano-mechanical characterization and finite element simulations have shown that the club consists of several microstructural features (Figure 1) that permit the infliction of crippling impacts while simultaneously minimizing internal damage within the club.&nbsp;</p> <p>Caption for Figure 1.
