<AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase I project will develop a unique material constructed from processed dairy manure for the replacement of peat moss in horticultural media.  The new material will also incorporate beneficial microbes for improving plant growth.  This product will solve two problems at once, eliminate environmental damage caused by the harvesting of peat moss and provide a new use for millions of pounds of animal waste produced in the U.S. each year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impact of the proposed project will be a new use for dairy waste in the U.S.  The product would be a major improvement in support material presently used to grow turf for lawns and golf courses and lead to reduced use of peat moss.  Formulations containing beneficial microbes would improve the performance and stress tolerance of plants and reduce the use of fertilizer containing chemicals.  The technology is also carbon neutral and environmentally green.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

The objectives of the project were (1) to produce products with and without beneficial microbes for applications such as turf establishment and greenhouse potting mix amendments, and to assess their abilities to increase plant performance; (2) to produce mixes containing <em>Trichoderma</em> strains (the beneficial microbes) that are resistant to biotic (plant pathogen) and abiotic (drought) stress; and (3) to prepare prototype pads including <em>Trichoderma</em> for architectural, instant turf and similar markets. In objective 1, we have developed systems for using two agricultural wastes, dairy manure and mushroom compost (composted residue after mushroom production), and have developed a potting mix with a high proportion of manure to produce products for the retail garden market. The dairy manure we use is from farms with slurry manure operations that separate solids using a screw press. This solid material has excellent texture and is low is soluble salts (a major problem with manures). Moreover, while manure and mushroom composts are currently sold to home gardeners, all or most available products are heavy and muddy due to high moisture content. We have developed drying techniques to produce &ldquo;clean hands&rdquo; dry manure and mushroom compost products for use as a soil conditioner that are receiving good early acceptance. However, manure has a high pH and low N contents that are damaging to plants when used as stand-alone products, such as potting mixes. In response, we have developed a mix of 35% manure, 35% peat, 20% vermiculite, 10% horticultural clay to produce a potting mixture that supports excellent plant performance.&nbsp; In Objective 2, we have made major progress in understanding the mechanisms and uses of <em>Trichoderma</em> spp. These beneficial fungi have been shown to be endophytic plant symbionts that (a) induce plants to be resistant to disease, (b) that increase resistance to abiotic stresses such as drought, and (c) improve plant fertilizer use efficiency. &ndash;Omics studies have demonstrated that these effects are a result of the ability of the plant endophytes to alter plant gene expression.
