<AbstractNarration>For the past two decades, string theory has been one of the most intensely investigated areas of theoretical high-energy physics.  This is true chiefly because string theory offers what is currently the most successful method of unifying gravity with the other fundamental forces (strong, weak, and electromagnetic).  Results from string theory have also spilled over into many other branches of physics, leading to improved understanding of gauge theories, condensed-matter physics, and heavy-ion physics.  String theory has also led to powerful new insights in mathematics.  In this project, Professor Blanco-Pillado aims to apply string theory to cosmology.  Specifically, he proposes to study the cosmological implications of a certain class of string models (so-called ``flux compactifications''), paying particular attention to the effects of the complex structure moduli part of the four-dimensional potential.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will also have significant broader impacts.  Beyond the interdisciplinary reach of the proposed research --- connecting high-energy physics and cosmology through the paradigm of string theory --- this project will also involve the training of a graduate student to conduct research in this cutting-edge field of study.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The current program belongs to a new area of research on the interplay of fundamental physics and cosmology. This is an emergent field in research that has attracted a lot of attention in the last few years. One of the main reasons for this is that observations in cosmology have achieved an impressive precision and they may well be the only way we can learn something about the underlying fundamental theory. It is therefore important to extract as much information as possible about its observational signatures.   As part of this grant, I have been working on several projects in this general field of research investigating the implications for cosmology of the most distinctive aspects of one of the most important candidates for a fundamental theory, string theory. Here is a brief description of the lines of research pursued in these last three years.   String theory is a higher dimensional theory. It is normally thought of as a 10 or 11 dimensional theory. This is in clear contrast with our everyday observation that tells us that we live in 4 dimensional spacetime. It is therefore clear that we should understand how to "compactify" the extra 6 dimensional manifold in such a way that it becomes invisible to the 4 dimensional observers. There are, however, potentially many different ways in which one can obtain a 4 dimensional universe starting from a higher dimensional theory.  Each of these compactifications would lead to a new vacua for the theory. This vast number of vacua has been described as the Landscape of String Theory. In the cosmological context, some of these vacua will have a positive value of the cosmological constant and will drive the universe to an accelerated expansion. Most of these states are, however, metastable and transitions between them will occur through a quantum tunneling process with bubbles of different vacua nucleating and expanding in the parent vacuum. Each of these bubbles can host inside a full universe compatible with our cosmological observations and are therefore referred to as bubble universes.   The goal of this research is to identify the possible observational signatures that would help to confirm this radical new picture of the universe at the largest possible scales. In particular, we have studied in detail the transitions between many of these vacua by generalizing the idea of bubble nucleation to a higher dimensional universe and focusing on the new observational signatures this could bring.   Most of the studies of the string landscape to date have focused on effectively (3+1)-dimensional vacua. However our work has naturally led us to a far more complicated picture of a multidimensional landscape where many of the compactified vacua would be endowed with fewer or more, large spatial dimensions. We do not live within such a vacuum so their interest may only seem academic at first. This conclusion is however premature since our observable universe may reside in a bubble that nucleated within or collided with such vacua, and such processes might leave distinct observational signatures.   Our recent work spearheaded this general program of research. We studied some consequences of the case where the eternally-inflating vacuum in which our bubble universe nucleates has one fewer large spatial dimension -- it being compactified in that vacuum.  We found potentially-observable signatures in the spectrum of inflationary perturbations that lead to the observed Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) fluctuations.   On the other hand, recent cosmological observations seem to indicate that the universe underwent a period of accelerated expansion in the early stages of cosmological evolution, the so-called inflationary period. There is, however, no consensus at the moment on the particular underlying fundamental theory that gives rise to the microphysics of inflation. It is therefore interesting to ask whether there is a way to embed inflation in String Theory. I am particularly interested in models...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
