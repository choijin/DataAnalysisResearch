<AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009&lt;br/&gt;(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of Puerto Rico in Rio Piedras (UPRRP), in collaboration with the University of Puerto Rico in Cayey, the Puerto Rico Department of Education (PRDE) and the Puerto Rico Community Foundation, a non-profit organization, is certifying ten 7-12th grade mathematics teachers, teaching in high-need school districts, as Master Math Teachers (MMT).  The Master Math Teachers are being trained to offer professional development to math teachers at the Professional Math and Science Resource Centers (PMSRC) that have been established throughout the Island by the Puerto Rico Math and Science Partnership (PRMSP). The MMTs serve as role models of exemplary mathematics teaching practices, experts in content knowledge, and leaders among their peers to promote improvements in student academic achievement. The PRMMTP consists of two phases: an intensive certification program followed by a period during which  the MMTs serve as professional developers completing a total of five years of service. The MMT Certification focuses on the enhancement of mastery of math content and pedagogical skills through an approach that integrates depth of conceptual understanding with content-specific teaching strategies, and mentoring and leadership skills. Disciplinary content focuses on inductive and deductive reasoning, and mathematical models (linear, quadratic and exponential) within a problem solving framework. Learning experiences are modeled in which participants explore, formulate conjectures, deduce, justify and put arguments to the test. A math action research course prepares the teachers to carry out a math action research at the grade level they teach. MMTs must present a portfolio as  evidence of their performance based on a set of criteria of teaching effectiveness through student learning outcomes. In the second phase of the PRMMTP the certified MMTs assume leadership roles within high need school districts. Activities include serving as mentors, participating in curriculum development projects, participating in pre-service teacher education, and assisting in the development and implementation of professional development for other teachers, particularly in the PMSRCs. MMTs also participate as Cooperating Teachers during the practicum of 7-12th grade pre-service math teachers and as mentors for beginning teachers. Each participating teacher receives a $10,000 annual salary supplement during the five years of participation in the program teaching in a high-need school district.</AbstractNarration>
