<AbstractNarration>Musical experience during childhood profoundly influences how the brain processes sound, even with just one year of training. Enhancements in musicians' brains often relate to the very neural impairments seen in children with language, learning and literacy disorders. Musical experience might therefore boost impaired systems in children with such disorders. Little is known about how musical experience brings about changes in the brain and about how these changes relate with behaviors such as language, learning and literacy. With support from the National Science Foundation, Nina Kraus and her laboratory will provide initial evidence for musical training's impact on both cortical and subcortical auditory processing in children and adults, defining the roles different parts of the brain play in shaping cognitive and perceptual capabilities related to language, learning and literacy. To accomplish this work, the researchers will recruit musician and non-musician participants from 3 to 35 years of age and assess them at three age groups, with child musicians recruited in collaboration with Chicago's Suzuki-Orff School of Music. Using scalp electrodes, the researchers record brain responses to speech and music sounds from both the auditory brainstem and the cortex. Electrodes are also used to measure auditory attention in the brain while participants are asked to listen to a spoken story and ignore competing sounds. Participants additionally complete listening and learning tests by which researchers assess cognitive and perceptual abilities and relate them with brain activity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work has the capacity to explain how brain changes occur with musical experience in the auditory system and to define relationships these changes have with language, literacy and attention. Understanding of the cognitive benefits of music could influence public policy regarding music education and music therapy. Outcomes of this project will also expand clinicians' toolkits for addressing language, literacy and attention disorders in addition to influencing policy-makers to incorporate music into classrooms, particularly for schools with at-risk children demonstrating high concentrations of language, learning and literacy disorders. The principal investigator has established a track record of broadly disseminating findings to the research community and the public, and expects new findings to be further translated into practice on an international scale.</AbstractNarration>
