<AbstractNarration>The Engaging Youth in Engineering (EYE) Module Study is developing, pilot testing, and field testing two engineering modules for middle school science and mathematics classes: Bioengineering the Future with a focus on seventh grade life science; and Engineering Clean Energy targeting eighth grade physical science. Each module addresses an engineering design challenge of relevance to industries in the region and fosters the development of engineering habits of mind. The approach integrates technology and other resources to engage and meet the diverse needs of children in a large, urban school district, and deepens student understanding of selected middle grades mathematics and science content. The theoretical foundations for the module development are grounded in contemporary learning research. Instructional design of the materials emphasizes contextual learning, collaboration, content integration, and embedded assessments within the framework of the backward design process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Teacher professional development materials are being developed and participating mathematics and science teachers from the collaborating middle schools engage in at least one week of professional development each summer. An EYE Coach assists with professional development and supports the teachers on site during the implementation of the modules. The field testing sites offer opportunities to assess the impact of the instructional materials in across diverse groups of students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project explores the workability of incorporating engineering design experiences into standards-based courses to move toward an integrated STEM middle school curriculum in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. This approach has potential to strengthen middle school STEM programs through the integration of engineering experiences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Engaging Youth through Engineering (EYE) is a partnership driven, workforce development initiative of the Mobile Area Education Foundation (MAEF) in Mobile, Alabama. EYE, provides engineering-based curriculum at the elementary, middle, and high school levels in Mobile County Public School System (MCPSS). At the middle grades, EYE targets ALL students through a unique set of STEM curriculum: the EYE Modules, developed and researched under the National Science Foundation (NSF) funded EYE Module Study (DRK-12 # 0918769).     The goal of the Study was to develop and research a set of supplemental curriculum resources. The EYE Modules, which broadened the access to STEM content and increased the number and diversity of students who are able to enter high school prepared to take the course work needed for STEM academics or careers. Research focused on determining in what ways the modules, and the related professional development for teachers, impacted the following objectives:     EYE students will demonstrate a significant shift in interest, attitudes, self-efficacy and capacity toward pursing STEM-dependent careers and coursework.      EYE teachers will show significant shifts in attitudes, self-efficacy, and capacity toward using inquiry based instruction on STEM applications in their classes, and belief in their studentsÆ potential to enter STEM-dependent fields.      The MCPSS, a large, urban school district, will transform its middle grades mathematics and science curriculum into a STEM curriculum that incorporates 21st century skills.      The EYE Modules  The EYE Modules are designed to provide teachers with a practical way to incorporate "T" and "E" while enhancing their existing "M" and "S" curriculum. The EYE Modules are a set of eight comprehensive and extensive teacher instructional guides, with materials and equipment kits, for middle grades teachers to implement collaboratively in mathematics and science classes, which provides students with opportunities to construct solutions to engineering design challenges.     Throughout the set of EYE Modules, students progress toward the EYE Learning Outcomes which focus on developing an "engineering habit of mind." Students learn how to apply knowledge of mathematics, science and technology through the engineering design process; analyze and interpret data; identify, formulate and solve problems; communicate effectively; function as part of a team; use the techniques and tools necessary in the modern workforce; and recognize the need for and engage in ongoing learning.     The EYE Modules are a unique set of STEM curriculum with several identifying features. For example, the Modules:  are NOT an add-on; they are designed to be implemented in the core math and science classes. equally emphasize mathematics and science content and pedagogy.  require collaboration between math and science teachers. provide strategies for building teamwork and problem solving skills.      Since 2009, the EYE Modules have been implemented in 17 middle schools in two states, serving over 5,000 students. Additionally, MAEF has received over 100 requests for the curriculum from 35 states and two countries.     The EYE Module Study Results  A longitudinal comparison study of the impact of the finalized set of the EYE Modules, involving middle school students in two EYE Research and Development schools and two matched comparison schools, was conducted following two cohorts of students: students who completed 8th grade in 2012-2013 and students who completed 8th grade in 2013-2014.  Students in the participating EYE schools experienced two EYE Modules in 6th grade, three EYE Modules in 7th grade, and two EYE modules in 8th grade. Students in the comparison schools experienced the traditional mathematics and science curriculum. A total of 822 students were included in the study.     Student Impacts:  Research results indicate positive impacts on students. For example, student beliefs about the personal i...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
