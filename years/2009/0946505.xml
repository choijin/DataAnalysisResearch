<AbstractNarration>0946505&lt;br/&gt;Towns&lt;br/&gt;This award is to provide the technology insertion service for the TergaGrid and follow on eXtremeDigital (XD) program.  The purpose of the award is to; &lt;br/&gt;(i) continually test the user environment and capabilities provided by XD to ensure delivery of the highest possible quality of service (QOS) and (ii)review and test advanced software tools for manipulating,  processing and analyzing very large amounts of information, as these tools become available.&lt;br/&gt;The Technology Insertion Service will have user-level access to all XD computational, storage and visualization services and will use these for testing advanced software tools and developing deployment strategies, in partnership with the relevant service providers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Evaluating and Enhancing the eXtreme Digital (XD) Cyberinfrastructure for Maximum Usability and Science Impact Project Outcomes Report Prepared by  John Towns, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (PI)  JRay Scott, Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center (co-PI)  Maytal Dahan, University of Texas (co-PI)  Victor Hazlewood, University of Tennessee (co-PI)   The Evaluating and Enhancing the eXtreme Digital Cyberinfrastructure for Maximum Usability and Science Impact project, known internally as the Technology Investigation Service (TIS), was a collaboration between University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center, University of Texas-Austin, University of Tennessee-Knoxville, and University of Virginia which identified and evaluated potential technologies to close the gap between the Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE, https://www.xsede.org/) service offerings and the needs of the national community of researchers dependent on XSEDE?s services.  Funded by the NSF Division of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure (award ACI 09-46505), the two major goals of TIS were (1) evaluating and making recommendations of new technologies to XSEDE for consideration of adoption into the cyberinfrastructure and (2) raising awareness of TIS to the XSEDE community and stakeholders to solicit their input on candidate technologies for evaluation.   Four significant outcomes from TIS include: the development and deployment of the XSEDE Technology Evaluation Database (XTED); the significantly improved XSEDE software search capability; the technology evaluation process; and the evaluations performed along with their corresponding technology adoption recommendations to XSEDE.    XTED was developed by TIS staff to identify, track, and provide evaluation reports of hardware and software technologies that could be integrated in XSEDE or any other cyberinfrastructure to further support research efforts. The results of the XTED were intended to be used to inform both the XSEDE community and the wider computational science community of technologies that can improve the capabilities, usability, and reliability of the research environment.  The XTED was used extensively by TIS but was ultimately did not gain adoption by the community.  However, leveraging the experience of the XTED, the XSEDE software search capability was extensively overhauled and eventually rolled out into production in December 2014 (see https://portal.xsede.org/software#/) providing great benefit to the research community.  The new software search provides XSEDE users an easy and intuitive way to search for specific research software packages, view the different versions available, and filter the search results by site, resource, and field of science. While significantly improving the existing interface for users, the TIS team also closely collaborated with XSEDE?s staff to redesign the information services software that gathers software information from Service Provider sites and also developed an administrative interface to improve the back-end software search components.   The evaluation team developed a technology evaluation process in year one and continuously improved the process over the life of the TIS project. This included a step-by-step technology evaluation process along with documentation and reporting templates. The technology evaluation process included: an evaluation selection process; an evaluation plan; requirements and documentation collection; installation; a test plan and test results; issue disclosure; and reporting. In addition, in the final TIS project year an evaluation process using evaluation pilot projects was used for technology evaluation. Pilots were different from regular evaluations because they included TIS staff, technology experts outside of TIS, and researchers in order to improve the evaluation process for specific technologies and receive feedback from others beyond TIS staff. The entire technology evaluation process was transferred to XSEDE for its future use. The TIS project performed 21 evaluations over the life of the project.  These included evaluations of:  four file transfer tools four remote graphical desktop tools three security related tools two software defined networking capabilities two scientific workflow tools two system administrator tools one data management tool one user environment tool one GPU (graphical processing unit) virtualization tool and one compute server virtualization tool    Of the 21 evaluations, 13 positive recommendations, four qualified positive recommendations (due to some limitations or expectations), and four negative recommendations were made. Six of the positive recommendations led to adoption of technologies in XSEDE or at an XSEDE Service Provider. ability to        Last Modified: 11/01/2016       Submitted by: John W Towns]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
