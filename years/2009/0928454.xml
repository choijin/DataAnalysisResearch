<AbstractNarration>During the last five years, Savannah State University embarked on its most comprehensive program to date to strengthen science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education at the University through the implementation of the Minority Access for Graduate Education and Careers (MAGEC-STEM) program. The program focused on increased enrollment and enhanced teaching and student support services. The new MAGEC-STEM Plus Program will further strengthen the culture of STEM excellence at the University by expanding and deepening our outreach, teaching, and mentoring activities through the following three objectives: 1) Curricular Development, Revision and Enhancement Reform, 2) Expanding Pathways for Undergraduate Recruitment, Enrichment, Retention and Research Experience, and 3) Strengthening the Faculty Development Activities.  &lt;br/&gt;The program results will be disseminated widely to the community through SSU and program websites and presentations at regional and national/scientific meetings and publications in scientific journals. This program will advance the mission of the University through its provision of high quality degree programs in STEM disciplines that increase the participation of African Americans in higher education.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Savannah State University (SSU)&rsquo;s NSF-HBCU-UP Implementation Program through its two funded cycles (2003-2017) had a significant institutional impact on the University&rsquo;s capacity to increase the number of underrepresented minorities (URMs) who attain STEM BS degrees and enter STEM graduate programs and the STEM workforce. The program produced results beyond the expectations of its participants and the University community at large and confirmed that the innate abilities of students drawn from the population we serve mesh with the high demands and rigor of advanced STEM education. To strengthen undergraduate STEM awareness and the subsequent increase in the number<strong> </strong>of students attending graduate programs across the country, the program established an Undergraduate Research and Mentoring Center. This Center has focused on mentoring to improve the performance and retention of students in STEM disciplines. In addition, this structured Center has developed and organized innovative methods of advising, mentoring, and career development. We coordinated with external entities including higher education, industry, researchers (including international), K-12 educators, and prospective parents and students to promote and expand the public&rsquo;s awareness of undergraduate and graduate research at SSU, including scholarship opportunities, has resulted in the following notable achievements. Over the period 2004-2016, SSU&rsquo;s STEM enrollment grew from 655 to 1833 (180%), which reflects 35% of total undergraduate enrollment at SSU.&nbsp; The program established a comprehensive STEM education, academic support and research training program for more than 150 recruited URM STEM scholars, including pre-freshman summer bridge programs, advisement, structured mentoring, seminars, research, conference participation, student publications and GRE preparation, as well as professional development support for faculty to enhance their skills in research training, mentoring and acquiring new funding. The program worked synergistically with other NSF and externally funded STEM programs and state funded initiatives to: 1) significantly increase the number of URMs (includes HBCU-UP and other synergistic programs) engaged in both on- and off-campus research (794), and attend (1432), present (726) at the national and international conferences, 2) conduct enrichment seminars and workshops (336); 3) support more than 50% of STEM faculty to conduct research, publish papers (83), patents (2) and participate in undergraduate research training and to develop new courses/programs; 4) support the development of new interdisciplinary STEM degree programs and curriculum including a Forensic Science BS degree program, STEM teaching degree program and a new Masters in Mathematics program. A STEM Center was established which provided dedicated study, meeting, and research space for STEM students and faculty mentors and a structured recruitment and outreach program was developed with Savannah area high schools. Other initiatives include: 1) an Annual SSU Research Day, a premier student research event initiated in 2011 to encourage and support the research endeavors of STEM students, featuring research of over 150 students/year from all disciplines; 2) an annual Journal of Research (ARISING) initiated in 2014 to highlight research and scholarly accomplishments of both STEM faculty and students which is widely circulated to the campus community, other universities, SSU alumni and the Savannah community; 3) International research experience in China, India, and Malaysia and Study Abroad program in Brazil; 4) Undergraduate Research, Mentoring and Career Advisement for STEM majors including GRE preparation and graduate school application assistance; 5) Summer workshops for K-12 STEM teachers to enhance knowledge of STEM content serving &nbsp;teachers; and 6) Career paths and student internships with K-12 teachers and local industry. The program&rsquo;s support for undergraduate research experience at national and international institutions, along with interdisciplinary approaches and study abroad experiences, strengthened bridges to graduate programs. The program contributed to the economic growth of the region, state, and nation by building SSU&rsquo;s capacity to increase the number of URM students who successfully enter the STEM workforce as academicians/scientists, math teachers and professionals in Industry. &nbsp;Several programs and initiatives developed through HBCU-UP (including the Annual Research Day, the ARISING journal, and the new degree program in Forensic Science) have been institutionalized by SSU, thus strengthening SSU&rsquo; STEM education and research capacity for the long-term.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>
