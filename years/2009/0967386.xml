<AbstractNarration>This project has two primary goals.  The first is to solve the problem of the unitary dual: to describe the irreducible unitary representations of real reductive Lie groups. The primary tool is an algorithm to compute the unitary dual of any given group, which we are implementing inside the "atlas" software. We plan to use this information to prove results about the unitary dual, beginning with the unitarity of Arthur's unipotent representations. The second primary goal is to make information about representation theory of real groups accessible to non-specialists, via the software, a web site, public workshops, and other means. The atlas software is freely available on the atlas web site, and will continue to be maintained there indefinitely.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The idea of using symmetry to study problems in mathematics and science dates back to Fourier's work on heat nearly two hundred years ago. In the hands of Hermann Weyl, Eugene Wigner, and Andre Weil, symmetry has come to play a central role in quantum mechanics and in number theory. Lie groups, named after the Norwegian mathematician Sophus Lie, are the mathematical objects underlying symmetry.  Representation theory studies all of the ways a given symmetry, or Lie group, can manifest itself. The problem of understanding all "unitary" representations (in which the symmetry operations preserve lengths) is one of the most important unsolved problems in the subject, and has potential applications in many areas; for example, it is an abstract version of the question, "what quantum mechanical systems can admit a certain kind of symmetry?"</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The problems in this proposal are all related to the determination of the unitary dual of a real or  p-adic reductive group.  The problem of  classifying  the  unitary  dual is a central one  in representation theory.  It  is significant for other areas of mathematics such as automorphic forms/number theory, mathematical physics, and analysis.  More specifically,  during the  tenure of this grant I have studied:  1) Dirac cohomology. This is an invariant of a representation which is typically  easier to compute than other invariants such as the distribution character.  The ultimate goal is to use Dirac cohomology to classify  and understand major parts of the unitary dual, e.g. unitary representations with regular nonintegral infinitesimal character.   2) unitarity, and character theory  of certain representations called unipotent. There are precise conjectures (and results) on how unipotent representations fit as building blocks  of  the unitary dual.  3) hermitian forms of representations of p-adic groups. The ultimate more specific  goal is to describe an algorithm for computing the signature of an irreducible representation in a Bernstein component.     For part 1), joint with Pandzic we have studied the Dirac cohomology of unipotent representations in the case of the real groups Sp(p,q) and U(p,q). A paper has been submitted. The results give a complete description of  the Dirac cohomology of unipotent representations. The results provide significant classes of examples of how complicated  the Dirac cohomology can be.   One of the applications is to obtain explicit formulas for the character of a unipotent representation on the compact Cartan subgroup.  With Trapa and Ciubotaru we have introduced and studied a version of the Dirac operator for affine graded Hecke algebras. As an application, in a separate paper joint with Ciubotaru,  we determined the Dirac cohomology of unitary  representations of the  graded Iwahori-Hecke algebras of type A. These representations are significant for automorphic forms. A particular class of representations  are the p-adic analogues of the representations introduced and studied by B. Speh in the real case.  For part 2), joint with P.  Trapa we have published a  paper describing explicit  new stable combinations of characters of unipotent representations. Stable combinations of characters are certain linear combinations of characters which are "easier" to work with, and have interesting properties from the point of view of automorphic forms.  A second paper in preparation proves the unitarity of unipotent representations in  the case of the groups Sp(p,q) and O*(n).     For part 3), joint with Ciubotaru we have published  a paper analyzing the reducibility of standard modules for affine graded algebras. Reducibility of standard representations  is a basic problem in representation theory.   In a preprint  we have studied  the structure of star operations in the affine graded Hecke algebras. A star operation on an algebra is necessary in order to make sense of hermitian and unitary representations.   We are continuing work on establishing an algorithm for computing hermitian forms of standard modules analogous to the real case (which is part of the main FRG program). There are significant differences and  difficulties from  the real case. Techniques such as the use of   translation functors, are not available. In addition, tempered modules for  the p-adic case are parametrized by  characters of component groups of nilpotent orbits  in the Lie algebra.  Their geometry plays a role in the structure of tempered representations, and this is a difficult subject.  During the tenure of the  grant I have given numerous invited talks and travelled to collaborate with the aforementioned  coworkers. I gave invited talks at Rutgers, Utah, San Diego, Hong Kong, Sanya, Marseilles, Boston, Baton Rouge. Somre of the cost of the travel was covered by the grant.
