<AbstractNarration>Project experiments will utilize the interaction of laser light with atoms to explore the most fundamental issues in elementary particle and nuclear physics. One experiment will search with unprecedented sensitivity for a tiny separation between the centers of plus and minus charge of the mercury atom.  The existence of such an 'electric dipole' would violate time-reversal and matter/anti-matter symmetries and would help explain the preponderance of matter over anti-matter in the Universe.  Another experiment will measure the recoil of Ytterbium atoms when they absorb light, and thereby test the validity of basic quantum electrodynamics to better than a part per billion.   Also, an experiment with a single barium atomic ion will probe the nature of the nuclear force by measuring the shape of an atomic nucleus more precisely than ever before.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These experiments open up avenues to the wider community and also to practical applications.  The notions of time reversal and anti-matter appeal to the general public.  The mercury experiment that addresses these issues requires developing ultra-sensitive magnetometry that could be used in medicine.  People are excited when they see a single trapped barium ion with the naked eye, or in a photograph, and then find out that this ion can be an accurate clock for navigation.  Within physics these experiments touch a broad community: atomic, nuclear, high energy, and astrophysics.  They attract many graduate and undergraduate students for the chance to work locally on small-scale experiments and explore fundamental issues normally studied only by large groups at high energy accelerators.   These students gain experience in exquisite technology with atoms, lasers and electronics, and in turn help make advances in this technology that they take with them to their future careers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our central goal has been to maintain exciting research in contemporary atomic physics that at the same time is of wide interest within physics as a whole and also addresses issues at the forefront of elementary particle physics.  This goal helps provide a strong educational mission.  Graduate and undergraduate students are attracted to this program by the general excitement of atomic physics, the experimental techniques we use (lasers, single-ions, cold trapped atoms), and for some students the lure of working locally on small-scale experiments in which they can explore fundamental issues normally studied only by large groups at high energy accelerators.  Our three experiments involve atoms in quite different conditions, mercury atoms in a vapor at about room temperature, ultra-cold ytterbium atoms held in an optical trap, and an ultra-cold single barium ion held in an electric trap.  Here we will use the mercury experiment to illustrate the kind of questions we can probe, in this case the possible existence of a tiny separation between the centers of + and &ndash; charge of a fundamental particle or atom.   Called a permanent electric dipole moment (EDM) such a charge separation along the axis of spin would violate time reversal symmetry and combined matter/anti-matter and left/right symmetries.  For over half a century physicists have been searching for an EDM.  Nowadays an EDM is expected to exist at a measurable size based on theories such as Supersymmetry that go beyond the Standard Model of particle physics and also on theories that account for the preponderance of matter over anti-matter in the universe.  In our experiment, mercury vapor cells are illuminated by laser beams that line up the nuclear spins of the mercury atoms and detect the change in spin direction when an EDM along the spin axis would be acted on by an applied electric field.  This experiment has yielded the most precise energy shift measurement ever performed, equivalent to a change in temperature of a nano-nano degree C.  With this precision, we are able to show that if an EDM exists, it is so small that if the mercury atom were blown up to the size of the earth, the EDM would amount to a displacement of an atomic electron by less than one billionth of a millimeter.    The current version of this experiment is expected to yield data four times more sensitive.  Combined with upcoming results of other EDM experiments, the new data should offer an exacting probe of physics that might account for the excess of  matter over anti-matter in our universe.
