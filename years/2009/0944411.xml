<AbstractNarration>While changes in populations typically are tracked to gauge the impact of climate or habitat change, the process involves the response of individuals as each copes with an altered environment. In a study of Adelie penguins that spans 13 breeding seasons, results indicate that only 20% of individuals within a colony successfully raise offspring, and that they do so because of their exemplary foraging proficiency. Moreover, foraging appears to require more effort at the largest colony, where intraspecific competition is higher than at small colonies, and also requires more proficiency during periods of environmental stress. When conditions are particularly daunting, emigration dramatically increases, countering the long-standing assumption that Ad√©lie penguins are highly philopatric.  The research project will 1) determine the effect of age, experience and physiology on individual foraging efficiency; 2) determine the effect of age, experience, and individual quality on breeding success and survival in varying environmental and competitive conditions at the colony level; and 3) develop a comprehensive model for the Ross-Beaufort Island metapopulation dynamics. Broader impacts include training of interns, continuation of public outreach through the highly successful project website penguinscience.com, development of classroom materials and other standards-based instructional resources.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>We completed 20 NSF-funded field seasons to understand: 1) how demographic factors explain population trends in the southernmost colonies of Ad&eacute;lie Penguins (Ross Sea); 2) why rate of population change is affected by colony size; and 3) how foraging ecology is related to these patterns (Fig. 1). We chose a metapopulation of 4 colonies on Ross and Beaufort islands that together comprise 8% of this species&rsquo; world population and range in size by three orders of magnitude: Cape Crozier (~250,000 pairs) to Cape Bird and Beaufort Island (~60,000) and Cape Royds (~2,000). The Crozier colony doubled in size during our study and is now likely the largest for this species. We compared the reproductive and foraging effort and success of penguins of known age and history at these colonies and continue to estimate and model vital rates (Fig. 2). A sub-goal has been to determine the longevity of this species, and the possible influence of senescence on life history, and we propose herein to continue toward this goal. While the current longevity record is 20 y, a number of individuals banded 19 y ago are still breeding, about to equal that previous limit. We also found that a small minority of breeders are always successful, and have been attempting to figure out why, but realize we still have much more to learn. Finally, we hypothesize that we are seeing effects of the growing sea ice season and extent documented for the Ross Sea region of the Southern Ocean on Ad&eacute;lie penguin demography, and wish to explore this question further.</p> <p>Based on a retrospective analysis of colony-size data, it appeared that changes in sea-ice extent and especially prevalence of the Ross Sea Polynya, as a function of climate factors, was responsible, in part (30% variation explained), for the population trends during the 1980s. However, we subsequently concluded that the extraction of 15,000 minke whales (direct competitors of penguins) from the Ross Sea sector during the 1970-80&rsquo;s was likely contributing to the penguin increase. As the whale population recovered upon cessation of whaling, penguin increase ceased. Now the colonies are increasing again (Fig 1), and we hypothesize that this is due to competitive release as large Antarctic toothfish (<em>Dissostichus mawsoni</em>),which eat the same fish prey, are removed from the system by commercial fishing.</p> <p>Seeking to understand intraspecific competition as one factor in colony size change, we compared penguin &lsquo;quality of life&rsquo; at colonies of different size. We developed banded, known-age, known-history populations at each colony, as noted, a process taking several years owing to delayed recruitment (5-6 y). We helped pioneer use of implanted RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) tags and computerized weighbridges (WB) to assess adult mass, meal size fed to chicks, and feeding frequency. Reliable WB&rsquo;s have been deployed at 3 colonies for 9-19 seasons. We found that penguins are <em>optimal foragers </em>when trips are &le;2 days long (food loads increase with trip length) but as trips increase &gt;2 days in order to find quality prey patches farther away (the subject of another analysis), meal size, adult body mass, and chick growth decrease (Fig 3). Further, foraging behavior varies by sex, body size, and individual quality (&ldquo;BQI&rdquo;: an index related to the propensity of an individual to breed successfully relative to the rest of the population) as well as sea ice conditions. Longer trip times, lighter adult mass, and higher energy expenditure occur at the largest colony, as well as an expanding foraging area that excludes individuals from other colonies as the chick-provisioning period progresses, indicating intra-specific competition within and between colonies. Trip times were alsoaffected by minke and killer whales in the penguins&rsquo; foraging area, through inter-specific competition for food (more whales, longer trips and prey switch). Finally, coupling the above results with IPCC climate model-projected changes to the Ross Sea environment, we made qualitative predictions for how Ad&eacute;lie Penguins would respond over the next 50 years: increase then decrease.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/22/2016<br>      Modified by: David&nbsp;G&nbsp;Ainley</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/0944411/0944411_10037970_1474577724908_Fig1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/0944411/0944411_10037970_1474577724908_Fig1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Fig 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/0944411/0944411_10037970_1474577724908_Fig1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Fig 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Changes in breeding numbers of Ad√©lie penguins in the Beaufort/Ross Island metapopulation, 1981-2012.
